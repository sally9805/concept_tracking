txt THE HUNDRED DAYS . PERSONAL REMINISCENcES . Concluded . I THE most remarkable event of the " Hundred Days " was the celebrated " Champ de Mai , " where Napoleon met deputies from the Departments , and distributed eagles to representatives of his forces . He intended it as an assembly of the French people , which should sanetion and legalize his second accession to the throne , and pledge itself , by solemn adjuration , to preserve the sovereignty of his family . It was a day of wholesale swearing , and the deputies uttered any quantity of oaths of eternal fidelity , which they barely kept three weeks . The dis // tribution of the eagles was the only real and interesting part of the performance , and the deep sympathy between both parties was very evident . The Emperor stood in the open field , on a raised platform , from which a broad flight of steps descended ; and pages of his household were continually running up and down , communicating with the detachments from various branches of the army , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the eagles and give the oath to defend them . I was present during the whole of this latter ceremony . Through the forbearance of a portion of the Imperial Guard , into whose ranks I obtruded myself I had a very favorable position , and felt that in this part of the day 's work there was no sham . I would here bear testimony to the chaxacter of those veterans known as the " Old Guard . " I frequently came in contact with individuals of them , and liked so well to talk with them , that I never lost a chance of making their acquaintance . One , who was partial to me because I was an American , bad served in this country with Rochambean , had fought under the eye of Washington , and was at the surrender of Coruwallis . He had borne his share in the vicissitudes of the Republic , the Consulate , and the Empire . He was scarred with wounds , and his breast was decorated with the cross of the Legion of Honor , which he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these old soldiers confirmed what has been said of them , that they were singularly mild and courteous . There was a gentleness of manner about them that was remarkable . They had seen too much service to boast of it , and they left the bragging to younger men . Terrible as they were on the field of battle , they seemed to have adopted as a rule of conduct , that In peace , there 's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility . " On this memorable day , I saw Napoleon more distinctly than at any other time . I was frequently present when be was reviewing troops , but either he or they were in motion , and I bad to catch a glimpse of him as opportunities offered . At this time , as be passed through the *haxnps Elys6es , I *tood among my friemids , the soldiers , who lined the way , and who suffered me to remain where a man would not have been tolerated , lie was escorted by the Horse Grenadiers of the Guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat alone in a state coach , all glass and gold , to which pages clung wherever they could find footing . He was splendidly attired , and wore a Spanish bat with drooping feathers . As he moved slowly through the crowd , he bowed to the right and left , not in the hasty , abrupt way which is generally attributed to him , but in a calm , dignified , though absent manner . His face was one not to be forgotten . I saw it repeatedly ; but whenever I bring it up , it comes before me , not as it appeared from the window of the Tuilerics , or when riding among his troops , or when standing , with folded arms or his hands behind him , as they defiled before him but it rises on my vision as it looked that morning , under the nodding plumes ,  - -  smooth , massive , and so tranquil , that it seemed impossible a storm of passion ebuld ever ruffle it . The complexion was clear olive , without a particle of color , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man within . The repose of that marble countenance told nothing of the past , nor of anxiety for the deadly struggle that awaited him . The cheering sounds around him did not change it ; they fell on an ear that beard them not . His eye glanced on the multitudes ; but it saw them not . There was more machinery than soul in the recognition , as his head instinctively swayed towards them . The idol of stone was there , joyless and impassive amidst its worshippers , taking its lifeless part in this last pageant . But the thinking , active man was elsewhere , and returned only when be found himself in the presence of delegated France , and in the // more congenial occupation which succeeded . Immediately after this event , all the available troops remaining in Paris were sent toward the Belgian frontier , and in a few days were followed by the , Emperor . Then came an interval of anxious suspense , which Rumor , with her thousand tongues , occupied to the best of her ability . I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a printed sheet was sent to the chateau where I was visiting , with an account of the defeat of the Prussians at Ligny and the retreat of the British at Quatre Bras . Madame Key was staying in the vicinity and , as the Marshal had taken an active part in the engagement , I was sent to communicate to her the victory . She was ill , and I gave the message to a lady , her connection , much pleased to be the bearer of such welcome intelligence . I returned that day to Paris , and found my schoolmates in the highest exhilaration . Every hour brought confirmation of a decisive victory . It was thought that the great battle of the campaign had been fought* , and that the French had only to follow up their advantage . Letters from officers were published , representing that the Allies were thoroughly routed , and describing the conflict so minutely , that there could be no doubt of the result . All was now joy and congratulation ; and conjectures were freely made as to the terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits which should be assigned to the territory of France . A day or two after this , we made a customary visit to a swimming-school on the Seine , and some of us entered into conversation with the gendarme , or police soldier , placed there to preserve order . He was very reserved and unwilling to say much ; but , at last , when we dwelt on the recent successes , he shook his head mournfully , and said he feared there had been some great ( lisaster ; adding , " The Emperor is in Paris . I saw him alight from his carriage this morning , when on duty ; he had very few attendants , and it was whispered that our army had been defeated . " That my companions did not seek relief at the bottom of the river can be ascribed only to their entire disbelief of the gendarme 's story . But , as they returned home , discussing his words at every step , fears began to steal over them when they reflected how seriously he talked and how sorrowful he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris . His army no longer existed , and his star had been blotted from the heavens . His plans , wonderfully conceived , had been indifferently executed ; a series of blunders , beyond his control , interrupted his combinations , and delay in important movements , added to the necessity of meeting two enemies at the same moment , destroyed the centralization on which he had depended for overthrowing both in succession . The orders be sent to his Marshals were intercepted , and they were left to an uncertainty which prevented any unity of action . The accusation of treason , sometimes brought against them , is false and ungenerous ; and the insinuations of Napoleon himself were unworthy of him . They may have erred in judgment , but they acted as they thought expedient , and they never showed more devotion to their country and to their chief than on the fatal day of Waterloo . I have been twice over that field , and have beard remarks of military men , which have only convinced me that it is easier to criticize a battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty thousand men , joined the Emperor , the British would have been destroyed . But he stopped at Wavre , to fight , as he supposed , the whole Prussian army , thinking to do good service by keeping it from the main battle . Blileher outwitted him , and , leaving ten thousand men to deceive and keep him in check , hurried on to turn the scale . The fate of both contending hosts rested on the cloud of dust that arose on the eastern horizon , and the eyes of Napoleon and Wellington watched its approach , knowing that it // brought victory or defeat . The one was still precipitating his impetuous columns on the sometimes penetrated , but never broken , squares of infantry , which seemed rooted to the earth , and which , though torn by shot and shell , and harassed by incessant charges of cavalry , closed their thinned ranks with an obstinacy and determination such as he had never before encountered . The other stood amidst the growing grain , seeing his army wastlug away before those terrible assaults and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order for retreat was given , he tore up the unripened corn , and , grinding it between his hands , groaned out , in his agony , - " Oh , that Bliicher , or night , would come ! " The last time I was at Waterloo , many years ago , the guide who accompanied me told me , that , a short time before , a man , whose appearance was that of a substantial farmer , and who was followed by an attendant , called on him for his services . The guide went his usual round , making his often-repeated remarks and commenting severely on Grouchy . The stranger examined the ground attentively , and only occasionally replied , saying , " Grouchy received no orders . " At last , the servant fell back , detaining the guide , and , in a low tone , said to him , " Speak no more about Marshal Grouchy , for that is he . " The man told me , that , after that , he abstained from saying anything offensive ; but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various positions of the battle became apparent to him . He , doubtless , saw how little would have turned the current of the fight , and knew that the means of doing it had been in his own hands . The guide seemed much impressed with the deep feeling of the Marshal , and said to me , " I will never speak ill of him again . " The battle of Waterloo is often mentioned as the sole cause of Napoleon 's downfall ; and it is said , that , had he gained that day , he would have secured his throne . It seems to be forgotten that a complete victory would have left him with weakened forces , and that he had already exhausted the resources of France in his preparations for this one campaign that the masses of Austria and Russia were advancing in hot haste , which , with the rallied remains of Prussia , and the indomitable perseverance and uncompromising hostility of England , quickened by a reverse of her arms , would have presented an array against which he could have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only have been procrastinated , involving still greater waste of life , and augmenting the desolation which for so many years had been the fate of Europe . Yes , Napoleon was in Paris ,  --  a general without soldiers , and a sovereign without subjects . The prestige of his name was gone ; and had the Chamber of ; Deputies invested him with the Dictatorship , as was suggested , it would have been " a barren sceptre in his gripe , " and the utmost stretch of power could not have collected materials to meet the impending invasion . At no period did he show such irresolution as at this time . He tendered his abdication , and it was accepted . He offered his services as a soldier , and they were declined . He had ceased , for the moment , to be anything to France . Yet he lingered for days about the capital , the inhabitants of which were too intent in gazing at the storm , ready to burst upon them , to be mindful of his existence . There was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , and were more interested in his position than in that of the enemy at their gates . There was a show of resistance . The fragments of the army of Belgium gathered round Paris ; the National Guard , or militia of the city , was marched out ; and the youth of the colleges were furnished with field-pieces and artillery officers , who drilled them into very effective cannoneers , and they took naturally to the business , pronouncing it decidedly better fun than hard study . They were of an age which is full of animal courage , and their only fear was a peremptory order from parents or guardians to leave // college and return home . Some of my school-fellows , anticipating such an injunction , joined the camp outside the city , and saw service enough to talk about for the remainder of their lives . One morning , I was at the Lyceum , where all were prepared for an immediate order to march , and each one was making his last arrangements . No person could have supposed that these young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in mortal combat . They were in the highest spirits , and looked forward to the hoped-for battle as though it were to be the most amusing thing imaginable . While I was there , a false report came in that Napoleon had resumed the command of the army . The excitement instantly rose to fever-heat , and the demonstration told what hold he still had on these his steadfast friends . From our position the rear of the army was but a short distance , while the advanced portions of it were engaged . Versailles had been entered by the Allies , who were attacked and driven out by the French under Vandamme . The cannonade was at one time as continuous as the roll of a drum . Prisoners were guarded through the streets , and wagons , conveying wounded men , were continually passing . Stragglers from the routed army of Waterloo were to be met in all directions , many of them disabled by their pursuers , or the fatigues of a hurried retreat . Pride was forgotten in extreme misery , and they were grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken into our institution as a servant . He had been in the army eighteen years , fifteen of which he had served as drummer . Tie had been in some of the severest battles , had gone through the Russian campaign , and was among the few of his regiment who survived the carnage of Waterloo . And yet this man , who had been familiar with death more than half his life , and who at times talked as thod*gh he were a perfect tornado in the field , was as arrant a poltroon as ever skulked . After the Allied Troops entered Paris , and were divided among the inhabitants , some Prussian cavalry soldiers were quartered on us . Collisions occasionally took place between them and the scholars ; and in one instance , one of them entered a study-room in an insulting manner , and in consequence thereof made a progress from the top of the stairs to the bottom with a celerity that would have done credit to his regiment in a charge . His comrades armed themselves to avenge the indignity , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet them with pistols and fencing-foils , the latter with buttons snapped off and points sharpened . There was hopeful promise of a very respectable skirmish ; but it was nipped in the bud by the interposition of our peace-making instructors , aided by the authority of a Prussian officer . When the affair was over , some wonder was expressed why our fire-eating military attendant had not given us his professional services ; and , on search being made , we found him snugly stowed away in a hole under the stairs , where he had crept on the first announcement of hostilities . He afterwards confessed to me that he was a coward , and that no one could imagine what he had suffered in his agonies of fear during his various campaigns . Yet he came very near being rewarded for extraordinary valor and coolness . His regiment was advancing on the enemy , and as he was mechanically beating the monotonous pas de charge , not knowing whether he was on his head or his heels , a shot cut the band by which his drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and without stopping , held it in one hand while he continued to beat the charge with the other . An officer of rank saw the action , and ri ( ling up , said , " Your name , brave fellow ? You shall have the cross of honor for that gallant deed . " He told me he really did not know what he was doing ; he was too frightened to think about anything . But he added , that it was a pity the general was killed in that very battle , as it robbed him of the promised decoration . // I mention this incident as an evidence of what diversified materials an army is composed , and that the instruments of military despotism are not necessarily endowed with personal courage , the discipline of the mass compensating for individual imperfection . It also gives evidence that luck has much to do in the fortunes of this world , and that many a man who " bears his blushing honors thick upon him " would as poorly stand a scrutiny as to the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drummer , had he been enabled to strut about , in piping times of peace , with a strip of red ribbon at his hutton-hole . While preparations were making for the defence of Paris , and the alarmed citizens feared , what was at one time threatened , that the defenders would he driven in , and the streets become a scene of warfare , involving all conditions in the chances of indiscriminate massacre , the powers that were saw the futility of resistance , and opening negotiations with the enemy , closed the war by capitulation . Whatever relief this may have been to the people generally , it was a sad blow to the martial ardor of my schoolmates . Their opinion of the transaction was expressed in language by no means complimentary to their temporary rulers . To lose such an opportunity for a fight was a height of absurdity for which treason and cowardice were inadequate terms . Their military visions melted away , the field-pieces were wheeled oW the army officers bade them farewell , they were required to deliver up their arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduced to the inglorious necessity of attending prayers and learning lessons . The hundred Days were over . The Allies once more poured into France , and in their train came back the poor , despised , antiquated Bourbons , identifying themselves with the common enemy , and becoming a byword and a reproach , which were to cling to them until they should he driven into hopeless banishment . The King rei*ntered Paris , ac companied by foreign soldiers . I saw him pass the Boulevard , and I then hastened across the Garden to await his arrival at the Tuileries , standing near the spot where , three months before , I had seen Napoleon . The tricolor was no longer there , hut the white flag again floated over the place so full of historical recollections . Louis XVIII . soon reached this ancestral abode of his family , and having mounted , with some difficulty and expenditure of . breath , to the second story , he wbddled into the balcony which overlooked the crowd silently waiting for the expected speech , and , leaning ponderously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , in a loud voice , " Good day , my children . " This was the exordium , body , and peroration of his address , and it struck his audience so ludicrously , that a laugh spread among them , until it became general , and all seemed in the best possible humor . The King laughed , too , evidently regarding his reception as highly flattering* The affair turned out well , for the multitude parted in a merry mood , considering his Majesty rather a jolly old gentleman , and making sundry comuparisons between him and the late tenant , illustrative of the difference between King Stork and King Log . Paris was crowded with foreign soldiers . The streets swarmed with them their encampments filled the public gardens they drilled in the open squares and on the Boulevards ; their sentinels stood everywhere . Their presence was a perpetual commentary on the vanity of that glory which is dependent on the sword . They gazed at triumphal monuments erected to commemorate battles which had subjected their own countries to the iron rule of conquest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat was cast from their captured cannon , and by arches whose friezes told a boastful tale of their subjugation . They passed over bridges whose names reminded them of fields which had witnessed their headlong rout . They strolled through galleries where the masterpieces of art hung as memorials that // their political existence had been dependent on the will of a victorious foe . Attempts were made to destroy these trophies of naticinal degradation ; but , in some instances , the skill of the architect and the fidelity of the builder were an overmatch for the hasty ire of an incensed soldiery , and withstood the attacks until admiration for the work brought shame on their efforts to demolish it . But for the Parisians there was a calamity in reserve , which sank deeper into their souls than the fluttering of hostile banners in their streets , or the clanging tread of an armed enemy on their door-stones . It was decided that the Gallery of the Louvre should he despoiled , and that the works of art , which had been collected from all nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be restored to their legitimate owners . A wail went up from the universal heart of France at this sad judgment . It was felt that this great loss would be irreparable . Time , the soother of all sorrow , might restore her woyn energies , recruit her wasted population , cover her fields with abundance , and , turning the activity of an intelligent people into industrial channels , clothe her with renewed wealth and power . But the magnificence of that collection , once departed , could never come to her again and the lover of beauty , instead of finding under one roof whatever genius had created for the worship of the ages , would have to wander over all Europe , seeking in isolated and widely-separated positions the riches which at the Louvre were strewed before him in congregated prodigality . But lamentations were in vain . The miracles of human inspiration were borne to the congenial climes which originated them , to have , in all after time , the tale of their journeyings an inseparable appendage to their history , and even their intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had been considered worthy a place in the Gallery of Napoleon . In the general amnesty which formed an article in the capitulation of Paris , there was no apprehension that revenge would demand an atonement . But hardly had the Bourbons recommenced their reign , when , in utter disregard of the faith of treaties , they sought satisfaction for their late precipitate flight in assailing those who had been instrumental in causing it . Many of their intended victims found safety in foreign lands . Labedoy*re , who joined the Emperor with his regiment , was tried and executed . Lavalette was condemned , but escaped through the heroism of his wife and the generous devotion of three Englishmen . Ney was shot in Paris . I would dwell a moment on his fate , not only because circumstances gave me a peculiar interest in it , but from the fact that it had more effect in drawing a dividing line between the royal family and the French people than any event that occurred during their reign . It was treasured up with a hate that found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when the insurgents stormed the Tuileries , their cries bore evidence that fifteen years had not diminished the bitter feeling engendered by that vindictive , unnecessary , and most impolitic act . During the Hundred Days , and shortly before the battle of Waterloo , I was , one Sunday afternoon , in the Luxembourg Garden , where the fine weather had brought out many of the inhabitants of that quarter . The lady I was accompanying remarked , as we walked among the crowd , " There is Marshal Ney . " He had joined the promenaders , and his object seemed to be , like that of the others , to enjoy an hour of recreation . Probably the next time he crossed those walks was on the way to the place of his execution , which was between the Garden and the Boulevard . At the time of his confinement and trial at the Luxembourg Palace , the gardens were closed . I usually passed through them twice a week , but was now obliged to go round them . Early one morning , I stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity , and , while there , heard a discharge of mus // ketry . We wondered at it , but could not conjecture its cause ; and although we spoke of the trial of Marshal Ney , we had so little reason to suppose that his life *was in jeopardy , that neither of us imagined that volley was his death-knell . As I continued on my way , I passed round the Boulevard , and reaching the spot I have named , I saw a few men and women , of the lowest class , standing together , while a sentinel paced to and fro before a wall , which was covered with mortar , and which formed one side of the place . I turned in to the spot and inquired what was the matter . A man replied ,  --  " Marshal Key has been shot here , and his body has just been removed . " I looked at the soldier , but he was gravely going through his monotonous duty , and I knew that military rule forbade my addressing him . I looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wall , and seeing it marked by balls , I attempted , with my knife , to dig out a memorial of that day 's sad work , but the soldier motioned me away . I afterwards revisited the place , but the wall had been plastered over , and no indications remained where ' the death-shot had penetrated . The sensation produced by this event was profound and permanent . Many a heart , inclined towards the Bourbons , was alienated by it forever . Families which had rejoiced at the Restoration now cursed it in their bitterness , and from that day dated a hostility which knew no reconciliation . The army and the youth of France demanded , why a soldier , whose whole life had been passed in her service , should be sacrificed to appease a race that was a stranger to the country , and for which it had no sympathy . A gloom spread like a funeral pall over society , and even those who had blamed the Marshal for joining the Emperor were now among his warmest defenders . The print-shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang it in their homes , with a reverence like that attaching to the image of a martyred saint . Had he died at Waterloo , as he led on the Imperial Guard to their last charge , when five horses were shot under him , and his uniform , riddled by balls , hung about him in tatters , he would not have had such an apotheosis as was now given him , with one simultaneous movement , by all classes of his countrymen . The inveterate intention of the reigning family was to obliterate every mark that bore the impress of Napoleon . Wherever the initial of his name had been inserted on the public edifices , it was carefully erased ; his statues were broken or removed ; prints of him could not be exposed for sale ; and it appeared to be their fixed detesmin*tion to drive him from men 's memories .. But he had left mementos which jealousy could not conceal nor petty malice destroy . His Code was still the law of the land ; the monuments of his genius were thickly scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every tongue ; and as time mellowed the remembrance of him , the good he had done survived and the evil was forgotten or extenuated . Whoever would judge this man should consider the times which produced him and the fearful authority he wielded . He came to take his place among the rulers of the earth , while she was rocking with convulsions ,  - -  seeking regeneration through the baptism of blood . He came as a connecting link between anarchy and order , an agent of destiny to act his part in the great tragedy of revolution , the end of which is not yet . His mission was to give a lesson to sovereigns and people , to humble hereditary power , and to prove by his own career the unsubstantial character of a government which dcludes the popular will that creates it . During his captivity , he understood the true causes of his overthrow , and talked of them with an intelligence which misfortune had saddened down into philosophy . He saw that the secret of his reverses was not to be found in the banded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great masses of men , who felt // with him , and moved with him , and bade him God-speed , until ' he abandoned the distinctive princijile which advanced him , and relinquished their affection for royal affiances and the doubtful friendship of monarchs . His better nature was laid aside , his common sense became merged in court etiquette , he sacrificed his conscience to his ambition , and the Man was forgotten in the Emperor . It is creditable to the world , that his divorce did more , perhaps , than anything else to alienate the respect and attachment of mankind ; and many who could find excuses for his gravest public misdeeds can never forgive this impiety to the household gods . I was most forcibly impressed with the relation between him and Josephine , in a visit I made to Malmaison a short time subsequent to her death , which occurred soon after his first abdication . It was the place where they had lived together , before the imperial diadem had seared his brain ; and it was the chosen spot of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sank to the degradation of courting their alliance . " The house was as she left it . Not a thing had been moved , the servants were still there , and the order and comfort of the establishment were as though her return were momently expected . The plants she loved were carefully tended , and her particular favorites were affectionately pointed out . The old domestic who acted as my guide spoke low , as if afraid of disturbing her repose , or as if the sanctity of death still pervaded the apartments . lie could not mention her without emotion ; and he told enough of her quiet , unobtrusive life , of her kindness to the poor , of her gentleness to all about her , to account for the devotion of her dependants . The evidences of her refined taste were everywhere , and there were tokens that her love for her husband had survived his injustice and desertion . After his second marriage , he occasionally visited her , and she never allowed anything to be disturbed which reminded her that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had left them ; the chair on which he sat was still where he had arisen from it ; the flower he had plucked withered where he had dropped it . Every article he had touched was sacred , and remained unprofaned by other hands . Doubtless , long after he had returned to his brilliant capital , and all remembram5e of her was lost in the glittering court assembled about the fair-haired daughter of Auspria , that lone woman wandered , in solitary sadness , through the places which had been hallowed by his presence , and gazed on the senseless objects consecrated by his passing attention . After his last abdication , he retired once more to Malmaison , where he passed the few days that remained , until he bade a final farewell to the scenes which he had known at the dawn of his prosperity . No man can tell his thoughts during those lonely hours . His wife was in the palace of her ancestors , and his child was to know him no more . He could hear the din of marching soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to him now . His wand was broken , the spell was over , the spirits that ministered to him had vanished , and the enchanter was left powerless and alone . But , in the still watches of the night , a familiar form may have stood beside him , and a well-known voice again whispered to him in the kindly tones of by-gone years . The crown , the sceptre , the imperial purple , the long line of kings , for which he had renounced a woman worth them all , must have faded from his memory in the swarming recollections of his once happy home . lie could not look around him without seeing in every object an accusing angel ; and if a human heart throbbed in his bosom , retribution came before death . Yet call him not up for judgment , without reflecting that his awful elevation and the gigantic task he had assumed had perverted a heart naturally kind and affectionate , and left him little leisure to devote to the virtues which decorate domestic life . The numberless anecdotes related of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself all whom he attempted to conciliate , the warm attachment of those immediately about him , tend to the belief that there was much of ' good in him . But his eye was continually fixed on the star he saw blazing before him , and in his efforts to follow its guidance , he heeded not the victims he crushed in his onward progress . He considered men as mere instruments to extend his dominion , and he used them with wasteful expenditure , to advance his projects or to secure his conquests . But he was not cruel , nor was he steeled to human misery . Had he been what he is sometimes represented , he never could have retained the ascendency over the minds of his followers , which , regardless of defeat and suffering and death , lived on when even hope had gone . Accusatory words are easily spoken , and there is often a dispdsition to condemn , without calculating the compelling motives which govern human actions , or the height of place which has given to surrounding objects a coloring and figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many a man who can not bear a little brief authority without abusing it , who lords it over a few dependants with insolent and arbitrary rule , whose temper makes everybody uncomfortable within the limited sphere of his government . and whose petty tyranny turns his own home into a despotic empire , can pronounce a sweeping doom against one who was clothed with irresponsible power , who seemed elevated above the accidents of humanity , whose audience-chamber was thronged by princes , whose words were as the breath of life , and who dealt out kingdoms to his kindred like the portions of a family inheritance . Let censure , then , be tempered with charity , nor be lightly bestowed on him who will continue to fill a space in the annals of the world when the present shall be merged in that shadowy realm where fact becomes mingled with fable , and the reality , dimmed by distance , shall be so transfigured by poetry and romance , that it may even be doubted whether he ever lived . Seventeen years after the period which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by his grave at St. Ielena . I was returning from a long residence in the East , and , having doubled the stormy Cape of Good Hope , looked forward with no little interest to a short repose at the halting-place between India and Europe . But when I saw its blue mass heaving from the ocean , the usual excitement attendant on the cry of " Land ! " was lost in the absorbing feeling , that there Napoleon Bonaparte died and was buried . The lonely rock rose in solitary barrenness , a bleak and mournful monument of some rude caprice of Nature , which has thrown it out to stand in cheerless desolation amidst the broad waters of the Atlantic . The day I passed there was devoted to the place where the captive wore away the weary and troubled years of his imprisonment , and to the little spot which he himself selected when anticipating the denial of his last wish ,  --  now fully answered " that his ashes might repose on the banks of the Seine , in the midst of that French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing in or about the house to remind one of its late o*cupant . It was used as a granary . The apartments were filled with straw ; a machine for threshing or winnowing was in the parlor ; and the room where he died was now converted into a stable , a horse standing where his bed had been . The position was naked and comfortless , being on the summit of a hill , perpetually swept by the trade-winds , which suffered no living thing to stand , except a few straggling , bare , shadeless trees , which contributed to the disconsolate character of the landscape . The grave was in a quiet little valley . It was covered by three plain slabs of stone , closely surrounded by an iron railing ; a low wooden paling extended a small distance around ; and the whole was overhung by three decaying willows . The appearance of the place was plain and appropriate . Nothing was wanting to its // unadorned and affecting simplicity . Ornament could not have increased its beauty , nor inscription have added to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his most inveterate foes ; but the path to his tomb was reverently trodden , and those who had stood opposed to him in life forgot that there had been enmity between them . Death had extinguished hostility ; and the pilgrims who visited his resting-place spoke kindly of his memory , and , hoarding some little token , bore it to their distant homes to be prized by their posterity as having been gathered at his grave . The dome of the Invalides now rises over his remains ; his statue again caps the column that commemorates his exploits ; and one of his name , advanced by the sole magic of his glory , controls , with arbitrary will and singular ability , the destinies , not of France only , but of Europe . The nations which united for his overthrow now humbly bow before the family they solemnly pledged themselves should May , never again taste power , and , with illconcealed distrust and anxiety , deprecate a resentment that has not been weakened by years nor forgotten in alliances .
