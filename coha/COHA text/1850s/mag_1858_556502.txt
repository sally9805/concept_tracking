ART . II . - Life of George Washington . By WASHINGTON IRVING . Vols . I. to IV . New York : George P. Put-b nam &amp; Co. 18*5 - 1857 . Svo. * WE have been told that , when Mr. Irving was a child five or six years old , he was walking one day , with a favorite Scotch servant-woman , in Broadway ; not the Broadway of our times , in which Presidents and Generals are lost in the crowd , but that quiet little thoroughfare , which , starting from the Battery as its court-end , ran on , through rows of modest dwelling-houses and still more modest shops , to the fields and gardens around the Park . In one of these shops there was a little more stir than usual , with a little bustle , too , of curiosity about the door , which attracted the good woman 's attention ; and on looking in for the cause , she saw that General Washington was there . Seizing her young companion by the hand , she drew him forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaiming , " Look here , sir , here is a bairn that is named for ye . " Washington laid his hand upon the child 's head , and from that day to this , the blessing of the " Father of his Country " has rested upon it . It is impossible to recall this little incident without reflecting , " How mysteriously is the web of life woven ! To Washington it was a trifle , dwelt upon , perhaps , with pleasure , for a moment , told , it may be , to his wife on his return home , and then forgotten amid the thousand anxieties of his position . He had just entered upon his duties as President under the new Constitution . Grave cares , intricate questions of state , were weighing upon him , and what time had he to bestow anything more than a smile and a caress on this child of a stranger , even though bearing his own name ? What would have been his sensations could he have foreseen the future career of that child ! How would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of the first volume , in an article , which , as a critical examination of it in so unfinished a state would have been premature and necessarily incomplete , was chiefly devoted to an analysis of Washington 's character . Our readers would hardly have excused us if we had failed to embrace the earliest opportunity of returning to it . // been lightened , what a thrill would have shot to his heart , What a fervor would have glowed in his benediction , could some friendly voice have whispered in his ear , ' This boy xviii one day bear his part in the great work of raising his country to the first place among the nations ; he will compel her reluctant kindred beyond the sea to recognize her genius , as you have compelled them to recognize her power ; he will fill public stations with dignity , and adorn private life with all the gentler virtues ; and when , at last , after many wanderings and many labors , he shall come and make his home upon the banks of that stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noblest achievements , he will devote the mature wisdom and temperate eloquence of a green old age to the story of your life , and indissolubly unite his name with yours in a work which shall be the guide and the delight of the remotest posterity ! ' " Many concurring causes seem to have pointed out Mr. Irving as the historian of Washington . He had been the first to tell the story of Columbus fully , and to paint the struggles of that sublime genius in colors which , like those of the frescos on the ruins of old Roman palaces , will preserve their freshness unchanged , in spite of time and decay . He was knoxvu to have a rare talent for the study of character , seizing readily upon all those delicate shades and nice distinctions which , though essential to the truth of a portrait , and often the only clew to apparent contradictions , escape the commou eye . He was acknowledged to be one of the best of narrators , full of life and movement , carrying you from scene to scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth of a poet , and yet free from that melodramatic exaggeration which is the worst falsifier of history . He was the master of a pure English style , with its graphic epithets and rich cadences , which , while it addresses itself to the understanding and the heart , fills the ear with a delicious melody that thrills you like music . And with all this he had lived in the world , and that in an age full of great events ; had mingled freely in the society of different nations ; had met face to face the great men of his time ; had seen kings upon their thrones , savage chiefs in their native wilds , gen // erals fresh from the battle-field , statesmen surrounded with the pageantry of office , or mourning in involuntary retirement the loss of a power that had become essential to their happiness . He had lived , too , in delightful intercourse with the monarchs of the mind , the great poets who , from the seclusion of their closets , sent forth words that were repeated with rapture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the watch-fire ; and he had seen them pass away one by one , repeating the lesson of ages , that he who would live in the hearts of men must live for mankind . Therefore , when it was known that the first volume was in the hands of the printer9 there was a general expression of satisfaction among the friends of American literature . They felt that this wondrous story would be told aright ; that Washington would be drawn in all the majesty of his greatness ; that the charms of exquisite composition , gracing the record of virtue , would form a work which fathers would transmit to their children as a precious legacy . This expectation has been abundantly fulfilled . Each new volume has been received with a welcome that must have carried a cheering glow to the author 's heart . You will meet them in steamboats , you will meet them in the cars ; they have taken their place at the side of the classics in the library , and lie , in rich bindings , among the ornaments of the centre-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek of youth , and heard their harmonious periods flowing with impressive solemnity from the lips of age . Seldom has literature witnessed a more perfect triumph ; never , one on which the recorder of her checkered annals can dwell with so serene and unsullied joy . The life of Washington had already been written by eminent men , and rightly filled an important place in American literature . The first of his biographers who had access to his papers was Chief Justice Marshall , - a man of rare intellectual vigor , large experience , untiring industry , a statesman , a diplomatist , a jurist , and a soldier . He had served through the war with credit ; had , on two important occasions , been invited by Washington to connect himself with his administration ; had lived with him on terms of confidential intercourse ; // and after his death had been intrusted with his papers , as they had been arranged under his own direction and left by him in the archives of Mount Vernon . From these authentic sources , illustrated by personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and official documents , Judge Marshall drew the materials for his life of Washington ; a work which , whether we consider the dignity of the subject or the character and position of the author , must always hold a conspicuous place in our historical literature . The first edition , in five octavo volumes , began to appear within little over three years after Washington 's death , and while most of the principal actors in the events which it records were still living ; - a circumstance which may be considered as having exercised both a favorable and an unfavorable influence upon it . All the principal events of Washington 's life were still fresh in many memories . The old men had witnessed them ; men of middle age , and some who were still young , had been actors in them ; and children had grown up in the midst of those fireside recollections which make the first generation after a great event feel as if they had been its contemporaries . This familiarity with the details of his subject , both in himself and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the feelings of those of a later generation . Everything was so clear to his own mind , that he never paused to ask how it would strike others . The names of men and places , of encampments and battle-fields , awakened such vivid recollections , came before him with such a variety of characteristic circumstances , that he never thought of painting them . It was difficult for him to conceive , in his intimate familiarity with them , what kind of questions one less familiar would ask . Why should he tell how Washington looked in his tent , or sat his horse , when thousands of his readers knew it as well as he ? But with all this he would be true to the spirit of the times . He would speak of things as they appeared to the actors themselves . He co ild not falsify the general character of an age which was still living to tell him if his portrait were unfaithful . He would retain enough of his early fecings // to reproduce his original impressions ; while many interesting circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a poet , what a picture he might have drawn ! How naturally the hero would have blended with the man ! How like actual things all the great points of Washington 's character , and all the important periods of his career , with their variety of incident and position , would have come before us , warming our hearts and kindling our imaginations as with a real presence ! It would have been like a triumphal procession in an old bas-relief , in which , while the long ranks of victors and captives pass before you with their arms and trophies , and in all the magnificence of ancient warfare , your eye still follows the general in his car of triumph , as the moving and master spirit of all . But Marshall was pre-eminently a man of pure intellect , expounding with lucid order the conclusions of an exact logic and profound analysis , but unskilled in the language of the imagination and the art of awakening vivid conceptions . His work is a clear exposition of causes , an accurate narrative of events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motives and characters , but formal , cold , and inelegant ; commanding our confidence by its candor and our respect by its good sense , but failing to reanimate the past , and to bring us into the presence of its hero as a living being . Ramsay attempted less than Marshall . He had already written the History of South Carolina and the History of the Revolution , and the Life of Washington seemed the natural complement of his labors . Like Marshall , he had been an actor in the scenes which he undertook to describe , had lived familiarly with the eminent men of the day , had had free access to official documents , and had studied Washington in his own letters . He had , moreover , a more cultivated historical sense than Marshall , and used language more effectively . He possessed in an eminent degree the power of compression . " His book is complete , " we once heard good old General Lafayette say of his History of the Revolution ; " he has put everything into it : he abbreviates like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants color : it has movement without vivacity ; distinctness without graphic power . He tells the // story , but fails to paint the scenes or the men . And thus , with a kind of knowledge which none but a contemporary can possess , with ample materials to draw from , and abundant means of verifying every statement by direct conference with actor3 still in the full possession of their faculties , he has left us a meagre volume , which must always be consulted , though it will seldom be read . An interval of thirty years , which added but little to our knowledge of Washington 's history , brings us to Mr. Sparks . And now , for the first time , we find ourselves in presence of a man placed at sufficient distance from the scene to view it in all its complex relations , and eminently qualified by the bent of his genius , by habits of patient research , and by that sober earnestness which never relaxes its exerti ns , to do full justice to the subject . The careful study which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important part of this period , while editing the " iDiplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution , " had prepared him for entering with a more perfect intelligence upon the examination of Washington 's own papers . For ten years those precious documents , the originals themselves , which Washington , with a full consciousness of their historical value , * had carefully arranged and preserved during his lifetime , and bequeathed at his death to his favorite nephew , as a special testimonial of his confidence , were intrusted to him , to select and annotate for the press , his daily companions , the absorbing object of his study and meditation . He read them all , more than two hundred folio volumes , carefully and critically , with pen in hand ; and when he had gone through them once , and marked those which seemed best adapted to the plan of his publication , to guard himself , as far as conscientious industry could do it , against the danger of mistake , he began his task anew , and went over them all again . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researches to Washington 's own correspondence . He travelled extensively , both at home and abroad ; examined numerous public and private collections ; conversed // with the surviving friends and companions of his hero ; visited every battle-field and every encampment ; traced out the lines of march of the contending armies ; and more than once had the good fortune to find some old soldier near the spot , to guide him in his observations . And that none of those influences which bring happy thoughts , and attune the faculties to harmonious action , might be wanting , he went , when these preliminary studies were completed , and took up his abode , with all the precious fruits of his labors around him , in the house in which Washington had passed the first trying and eventful months of the war . There , in the same room in which the " Father of his Country , " as yet but imperfectly known to himself and to the world , had met in council the early companions of his cares , some of whom were to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him in the proving hour , with the very paper before him on which that haud , which never traced a selfish nor an ignoble thought , had recorded the wants and wishes of those gloomy days , he took up his pen to tell the wonderful story . How often must he have started at the opening door , the door through which Washington had passed ! What solemn thoughts must have come over him as he raised his eyes to the window and looked forth , under the shadowing elms and across the green meadows where the Charles still winds its pleasant path to the bay ! " Those elms , " he may have said , " were saplings when Washington was here , bending to every blast , casting no grateful shadows upon the greensward , drawing no music from the passing wind . Did Washington , as his thoughtful eye rested upon them and his spirit held anxious communion with the future , ever liken them to the tree that he was planting ? Did he ever say to them , You will go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine and shower , putting forth your leaves and casting them again , with each return of the seasons , till your tops reach high into the heavens , and your broad branches spread out with a grateful shade ; but who can foretell the fate of that delicate and fragile tree which I am planting in darkness and gloom ? Who can say what manner of men they will be who will one day come and seat themselves at your feet , - the hardy sons of // 337 freemen , or the abject offspring of slaves , - reviling me as a rebel , or blessing my memory as the deliverer of my country ? " ' How often must these and kindred thoughts have crowded upon the historian 's mind and checked his pen ! What more could he have asked to aid him in combining the results of his long and laborious researches into a glowing and lifelike picture of Washington ? But , unfortunately , the history of Washington 's life was less Mr. Sparks 's object than editing and illustrating his writings . Modestly overestimating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own . With materials for five volumes , he has confined himself to one . With unrivalled stores of illustration , he has given us only enough to make us cager for more . As an introduction to Washington 's Writings , his work is a model , luminous , comprehensive , accurate , and just ; conceived in the true spirit of historical appreciation , and written in a simple , manly , and dignified style . It will always retain the high position which it took from the beginning , and will be regarded as an indispensable auxiliary to the study of Washington 's character . Of foreign lives of Washington , we know of none that deserves especial mention . The subject is still a difficult , if not an ungrateful one , for an Englishman . Napier or Arnold might have treated it fairly ; but by far the greater part of their countrymen , however lavish in their general eulogies , or however anxious , with Lord Mahon , " to render full justice to the opposite party , " f can hardly divest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Washington , at the best , but a successful traitor . In German literature , there is nothing worthy of the subject . How can there be while Germany remains what she is ? In Italian there is Botta 's eloquent narrative of the war , " After the able , accurate , and comprehensive work of Chief Justice Marshall , it would be presumptuous to attempt a historical biography of Washington . - Sparks 's Washington , Vol . I. , Preface , p. xii . But the American War is a fine subject , and treated , as you would treat it , with the same perfect fairness as the Succession War , its history would vindicate the honor of this country at the same time that it rendered full justice to the opposite cause . " - Southey to Lord Mahon , Appendix to Vol . VI . of Lord Mahon 's History of England , &amp;c. , p. 1 . // worthy , both in sentiment and in style , of the best days of Italian literature , but necessarily imperfect as a personal history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those profound and just appreciations , by which the philosophic historian has thrown such a flood of light upon some of the most important parts of human annals . With the last edition of this Essay , there is a Life of Washington by De Witte , a work of some literary pretensions , but iiiaccurate in many of its statements and judgments , and adding nothing to our knowledge of Washington 's character or actions . These , with the exception of the last , which had not yet appeared , were the principal Lives of Washington , when Mr. Irving took up his pen . It was no light task for one who had already reached that term of life which it was not given to Washington to pass . Would he be able to transcend the statesmanlike appreciation of Marshall ? Could he hope to add to the facts that crowd the industrious pages of Sparks ? or to rival the profound analysis and luminous generalizations of Guizot ? And , harder than all , would it be possible for him to preserve that calm and sober coloring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times ? Of all the difficulties which he has had to encounter , none , perhaps , was so great , or so much to be feared , as his own reputation . For beauty of language , grace of style , delicacy of fancy , and genial sentiment , he had long held the first place in modern English literature . The subjects of his previous histories had been singularly in harmony with the peculiar characteristics of his genius , in which good sense and delicate appreciation of character are blended with elements eminently poetical . Columbus was a personage who might well excite the enthusiasm of a poet , while the narrative of his adventurous career demanded sagacious criticism , sound judgment , and the most skilful touches of art . A mind not used to kindle with its own conceptions , to see strange forms in the evening clouds , and to dream in the forest twilight by the side of fountains and meadow brooks , would never have understood that mingling of enthusiasm and practical sense , of daring enterprise and visionary speculation , which entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // to cling with as firm a faith to the creations of his own intellect , as to the revelations of his perceptive faculties . The unknown seas into which he sailed so boldly ; the New World , with its luxuriant scenery , its novel productions and strange inhabitants ; and , more than all , the deep tragedy of his protracted sufferings and unworthy death , - are subjects so nearly akin to poetry , that , if the narrative of them had come down to us as the production of some legendary age , we should have hesitated to accept it as history . Nor was the miraculous rise of the Mohammedan Empire , and the sudden conversion of the idolatrous tribes of the desert into irresistible armies of religious enthusiasts , a subject less suited to Mr. Irving 's pen . But in painting the sound discretion and sober enthusiasm of Washington , in describing scenes with which every reader had been more or less familiar from his childhood , in speaking of armies of mechanics and farmers , how would he be able to repress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flowing periods to the severe truth of history ? The doubt was natural . A critical examination of the literary character of the work will give the best solution of it . It is generally understood that Mr. Jrving began to collect his materials before his mission to Spain , and that his work has consequently been growing in his mind some fourteen or fifteen years . It was not , however , till several years after his return that he entered upon it seriously . Meanwhile the Life of Goldsmith , and the History of Mahomet and his Followers , were written , and the revised edition of his Works carried through the press . It was an interval of active exertion , during which he did enough to have made the reputation of any other man , and in fields remote from that which he was preparing to tread . But this was done without losing sight of his great subject , to which he returned from time to time , gradually extending his researches and enlarging his range of inquiry . He visited many , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public career . From his own garden he could look down upon some of the most interesting localities of the war . And the few who could // still speak of it as eyewitnesses were glad to repeat their stories to such a listener . Like Sparks , he studied Washington 's letters in the originals , to which he could now add the writings of Hamilton , Adams , and Jefferson , and the vast array of facts so laboriously collected and so judiciously arranged by Mr. Force , in his American Archives , one of the most remarkable monuments of historical industry of any age or country . And when the results of this deliberate and comprehensive preparation had arranged themselves in his mind , in distinct and definite forms , the great drama of the Revolution would seem to have unrolled itself before his eyes , in the full grandeur of its proportions , with Washington for its central and directing spirit . Then it was that he took up his pen , like a spectator fresh from some exciting scene , to pour out his recollections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume was published early in 1855 ; the second , before the close of the same year ; the third , in 1856 ; and the fourth , in 1857 . At first he had expected to bring his story within the compass of three volumes ; but as he proceeded , the figures came crowding upon the canvas till he found himself compelled to choose between expansion and mutilation . Fortunately for literature and for his own fame , he chose the former . Each part now fills its appropriate place , without jostling or jarring with the others . The first volume contains a full history of Washington 's youth , presents an elaborate picture of the severe ordeal through which he passed in the old French war , gives graphic sketches of his domestic life at Mount Vernon , and , tracing carefully the progress of public sentiment during the opening scenes of the Revolution , closes with his arrival at the camp before Boston . The second opens with the siege of Boston , and brings the story down to the battle of Princeton and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns of 1777 - 79 . The fourth contains the closing scenes of the war , and the melancholy history of the Confederation , and ends with the first inauguration ; and a fifth will soon terminate the eventful drama . The first thing that strikes the reader , on closing these volumes , is the skill with which the work is divided , and // the judgment with which the proportions of the different parts of its complex narrative are marked out . This alone would entitle its author to a high rank among historians ; for it implies the power of vigorous conception , a quality which holds the same place in historical that invention does in poetical composition . To conceive a complicated subject as one , to detect the principle of unity which binds its scattered and often discordant parts into an harmonious whole , and to feel your pen guided by this instinctive appreciation to put everything into its true place , as the particles of matter are arranged by the force of gravitation at their proper distances from the common centre , is a rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as repulsive to the mind as discord is to a musical ear , and this not merely from an inherent love of order , but because we can never fully understand the spirit and relations of that which we can not grasp as a whole . It is for this , in a great measure , that history is less read than it ought to be . The events*of history are full of variety and novelty , often carrying us so far beyond our conjectures as to have made it a common saying , that truth is stranger than fiction . Yet men of fine talents , of profound thought , of eminent literary powers , are frequently unable to excite our interest in the most eventful periods . They fail to discover the latent principle of unity . They treat history as they study it , not as a living whole , with one great heart sending out the vivifying blood to every part of the system and receiving it back again to purify it and transmit it anew to the remotest extremities , hut as an aggregate of parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . Hume wrote the history of England backwards , and thus has given us a series of groups , instead of an harmonious picture . The ancients , whose artistic intuitions hardly ever deserted them , seldom err in this ; the greatest of them never . Sallust , Xenophon , and even Thucydides , were greatly assisted by the nature of their subjects ; but in Tacitus the principle is ever present , even in his Annals , in which the division by years necessarily gives a somewhat fragmentary cast to the narrative ; and Livy is not more remarkable for his power of painting to the mind 's eye , than for the skill 29* // IRVING 'S LIFE OF WASHINGTON . with which he infuses into every part of his work the pervading spirit of Roman genius. * Mr. Irving , too , was aided by the nature of his subject ; for as regards unity of narrative , the biographer has a great advantage over the general historian . But the manner in which he has availed himself of this advantage deserves the highest praise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards the larger part of his life was closely interwoven with the history of his country . He never stands alone . He is constantly surrounded by public men . Great events group themselves about him , as if by a natural law . Every movement of his seems to communicate life and energy to thousands . As with the prophet of old , his arms are still raised to insure the triumph of his countrymen . And though the two or three intervals of his retirement from public life appear , at first , like the reigns of good kings , to afford but meagre materials to the historian , on looking closer , you perceive that a great work was still going on , and that he is its best exponent . Therefore , in tracing his career , the historian must frequently leave the immediate subject of his narrative , in order to follow the progress of events in which he does not appear personally . He must describe the movements of distant armies and battles won by other leaders . And yet , while he metes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must preserve for his own hero his appropriate place as guide and director of all . This Mr. Irving has done with singular skill . Washington is emphatically the hero of his narrative , standing out in bold relief from the group of eminent men that cluster around him , everywhere recognized as an all-pervading spirit , breathing life and energy into every part , and felt in the remotest extremities of the land by his controlling will and sublime example . You turn to him instinctively from every " Ad illa mihi pro se quisque acriter intendat animum , qua* vita , qui mores fuenut ; per quos viros , quibusque artibus domi militia*qne , et parturn et aucturn irnp eriurn sit . Labente deinde paullatim disciplina , velut desidentes primo mores sequatur animo : deinde Ut magis ina , , isque lapsi sint ; turn ire c*epenint precipites ; donec ad hnc tempora , quihus nec vitia nostra , nec remedia pati possumus , perventurn est . " This noble passage of his preface , one of the most perfect pieces of any age , has always seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // battle-field , to see how he will receive the tidings . You feel a double joy at every victory , in the thought that it will lighten his burden . You judge men by their fidelity to him , and measure their services by the estimate in which he held them . And this effect is obtained without any exaggeration of Washington 's actions , without forcing him from his natural position , or bringing him officiously forward out of time and place , by so guiding the flexible thread of the narrative as to make him the point at which you instinctively place yourself to watch the gradual development of the eventful plot . It is , indeed , a striking and instructive lesson , to see how much a great man gains by a generous estimate of those around him . Washington is far greater , with Greene , Hamilton , and Knox for counsellors , than if , forgetting the complex responsibilities of his position , he had relied upon his own unaided judgment . The personal devotion of such men was the highest tribute that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them at all times and in all emergencies without reserve , and with equal unreserve they lay open their thoughts and their hearts before him . The decision rests with him ; the responsibility is his , and his too the chief glory . But in no history of this period do his friends and associates appear to so much advantage , or come in for so large a share of praise . Schuyler 's claims to our respect were never so clearly set forth before . The comprehensive views and rare sagacity of Greene are fully recognized . The sound sense and unwavering zeal of Knox are painted with truthful simplicity . The shining talents of Hamilton receive a new lustre from the brilliant touches of Mr. Irving 's pencil . Even Lee , wayward and ungenial , and Gates , vain , arrogant , and selfishly ambitious , are not condemned unheard . Their real services are faithfully recorded ; and if they do not stand in a brighter light , it was their own act that drew the cloud over them . Mr. Irving evidently set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we know of no writer within the circle of our reading , who has so successfully established his claim to the rare and difficult virtue of historical impartiality . // Of purely literary qualifications , the first in historical composition is narrative power . Something more is implied in this than the art of telling a story well ; for historical narrative is a succession of stories requiring a capacity of continuous exertion through a long series of events . In power there is the same difference between this and mere story-telling , that there is between carrying a burden a few paces and carrying it through the whole of a long journey . The very men that would trip off the most briskly in one case , might be the first to sink from exhaustion in the other . In this respect , also , the ancients are far in advance of us . Their histories are eminently narrative . The story begins with the first line , and is carried on to the end of the book with a life and movement that seldom flag . With what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how quickly you find yourself in the midst of groups of living men , and in all the tumult of action ! Some of the chroniclers of the Middle Age caught the same spirit , and , living in the midst of the scenes which they describe , gave to their stories the vivacity and freshness of their own emotions . The Italian historians followed in the track of the ancients . They narrate throughout , interweaving their reflections in the narrative sentences without clogging their movement . In our own days a systematic effort has been made to revive this method as the only true mode of writing history . Barante * was the first to set the example , in his History of the Dukes of Burgundy , a work conceived and executed in the true spirit of antiquity , and which presents the singular spectacle of a man of rare philosophical endowments sternly repressing his philosophical impulses in order to become a picturesque narrator . Thierry belongs , with some modifications , to the same school . The History of the Norman Conquest is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , and glowing with the wild and vigorous colors of the age which it delineates . And most of the recent French historians , accepting in a great measure the views of Barante and // Thierry , have endeavored to distinguish themselves by skill and eloquence of narration . Of Englishmen Macaulay is almost the only one that can be honorably compared with the great narrative historians of France ; for Arnold 's brilliant career was cut short too early to allow him to take firm possession of the high place in historical literature which was his due , and Napier is more particularly a military historian . Macaulay is a narrator of rare power , endowed with a singular skill in seizing upon characteristic circumstances , and a wonderful exuberance of picturesque expression . He is not afraid of calling attention to apparent trifles , always preferring the dignity of nature to the dignity of history . He feels that accurate knowledge depends upon detail , and that we can never form a lively conception of a scene , unless we come near enough to it to detect its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The past seems to rise up under his pen , with its passions , its virtues , and its vices , as if to renew before us the spectacle of its good and evil . It would have been difficult for Mr. Irving to choose a moment in which his narrative skill would have been brought to a loftier standard of comparison , or subjected to a more rigorous task . But he too is richly endowed with the higher qualities of the narrative historian . He possesses a lively imagination , enabling him to enter readily into the feelings and character of another age ; an affluent fancy , suggesting picturesque epithets , and happy trains of thought and expression ; an extensive range of observation , giving distinctness and life to his conceptions ; genial sympathies , which quicken and glow with the images that rise under his pen ; and a power of continuous exertion that sustains him unwearied to the end . Simplicity and grace are among the most obvious characteristics of his narrative , - the simplicity of an earnest nature , and the grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , lively , animated , and richly varied . It is as clear as a meadow-brQok , but rolls on like his own Hudson , now expanding into silvery lakes , now gently sweeping round some green and wooded promontory , and now gathering its waters into a deep and impetuous current , and pouring the resistless vol // IRVING 'S LIFE OF WASHINGTON . nine through a precipitous and rock-bound gorge . And yet , perhaps , if we were called upon to say in what its peculiar merit consists , we should name its full and equable flow . There is nothing abrupt in it . The sentences follow one another with such a natural sequence , so smooth , so harmonious , and withal so full of life , that you are carried forward without ever pausing to measure your progress . We have given the first place to narrative power , because we c nnot conceive of a good history without it . It is the art of telling a story in such a way as to make the incidents their own interpreters . Description holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the eye and investing them with their natural attributes , gives greater definiteness and vivacity to the conception . It demands a different kind of talent , consisting chiefly in the power of conceiving form distinctly , and combining it readily into *groups and pictures . In narrative the historian is brought into relation with the poet ; in description , with both the poet and the painter . Description , indeed , is painting to the mind 's eye , and requires that perfect command of the elements of form and color , that ready perception of appropriate shadows and distances , that rare combination , in short , of intuitions and acquired knowledge , which enables the great artist to bring a group or a landscape before the eye with an effect hardly inferior to that of the real scene . It has been said that Mr. Irving , in his younger days , gave Aliston such an impression of his skill with the pencil , as to lead that great artist , whose noble nature was never disturbed by the fear of raising up a rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to induce him to take up the profession of an artist . However this may have been , it is very evident from Mr. Irving 's descriptions that he might have become a great painter . His figures are full of individuality , and drawn to the life . There is no hardness in the outline , no faltering in the touch ; everything is rendered with a free and firm hand . His groups are disposed with an instinctive appreciation of the mutual relations and dependencies of the characters . " The School of Athens " does not present a more admirable example than these volumes , of the art of // placing a variety of prominent figures upon the same canvas . There are some exquisite pieces , too , of landscape painting , bits of scenery that fill up the backgrounds with the happiest effect , and give a fine relief to the stern groups of warriors and statesmen . Sometimes he paints in detail , and with a wondrous truth and vivacity of coloring . Sometimes he paints in outline , creating as it were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of his pictures reveal a careful study of nature , an accurate knowledge of details , fine power of combination , and a happy tact in adapting his style and coloring to the particular subject . No part of this work has apparently received more attention than the characters or portraits , - a department which the great historians of ancient and modern times have regarded as peculiarly fitted for the display of their best powers . It is in this that Clarendon takes so high a place among English historians , and Sallust among the ancients ; in Robertson and Hume the portraits are among the most elaborate portions of their works ; and in no other department of our own historical literature would it be so easy to make a large collection of brilliant passages . The profouu*l knowledge of hum annature , and the power of detecting the secret springs of action and laying bare the hidden recesses of the heart , which this talent presupposes , have naturally caused it to be held in high estimation . If to know man so as to bend him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to know him so as to be able to paint his passions and motives , may well be the boast of the historian . The history of the Revolution affords a fine field for the display of this talent , and Mr. Irving has availed himself of it with distinguished success . As the leading men come upon the stage , their previous history is sketched with a few rapid touches , and their characters are unfolded with a nice appreciation of circumstances and motives . Some are drawn with great attention , - full-lengths , in which all the characteristic features are carefully wrought up into a finished picture . Others are happily hit off by a few bold strokes . That fine For he seems to have felt , with the great Roman critic , " Historia . . . . tanto rohustior quanto verior. " - Quint . Lb . II . cap . 4. // discrimination which distinguishes the poet 's knowledge of the heart , is everywhere apparent . There is a felicitous conciseness , a happy reserve , which adds greatly to the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , when the conception has been given , and instantly drops his pencil . He never indulges in disquisitions , though he often closes a chapter with some apposite reflection that rises naturally from the subject . There are many just , many beautiful , and many noble thoughts interwoven with the narrative . But he would seem to have no ambition of being a maker of aphorisms . He for the most part lets the moral and wisdom of the story flow from the story itself ; and appears to feel that the reader may be safely intrusted with the care of drawing his own deductions . In this , he has shown , we think , excellent judgment ; for if history be philosophy teaching by example , it is to the vividness with which the example is brought before us , rather than to any ethical elaboration of it , that we should look for the efficacy of the lesson . The general tone of the work is sober and calm . There is no exaggeration of style or sentiment in it . Mr. Irving has formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the simplest and most natural forms of expression . If his own good taste had not been sufficient to guard him against fanciful epithets and melodramatic effects his excellent sense would have shown him how much they are out of place in speaking of Washington . There is a sobriety in Washington 's character which repels all the common artifices of rhetoric . His history is full of great results and simple means . If you would speak of him worthily , you must rely wholly upon the grandeur of the thought . When Homer makes Olympus tremble at the nod of Jupiter , he uses the simplest words that the language could supply - II , Kat Icvavqjcrn ' * , r ' kJpi% , i VEVcTE Kpovtcov A*4*p&amp;ita* * *pa xa*ra&amp; ETS-EppcecTavTo avaKTos ' Kpar* cbr ' aOavwroto !

" Pope* s version - or perversion rather - is a striking illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Irving has caught the true spirit of antiquity . He is natural , simple , and earnest , and some of his finest effects are produced with the least apparent effort . Now and then there is a kindling of the imagination , like the occasional flashings up of the more passionate elements of Washington 's own nature ; but the pervading tone is that of earnest sobriety . He is evidently full of his subject ; believes all that he says ; is impressed even to solemnity with the moral grandeur of his hero ; and , feeling how closely the events of tha1* period are interwoven with the future destinies of our race , tells his story like one too well convinced of the importance of it to think of adding to its impressiveness by pomp of language or brilliancy of metaphor . This , which in some would be but a negative merit , in Mr. Irving is a positive one . For a man of his imagination , with all the wealth of one of the richest of languages at his command , the temptations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes difficult to resist . Many a brilliant thought must have started to his page , which his calmer judgment deliberately repressed . Many a period must have been cut down , which , in its original conception , glowed with gorgeous colors and flowed with majestic harmony . We should do Mr. Irving great injustice if we were to pass lightly over this remarkable characteristic of his work . It is a tribute to historic truth , as difficult as it is rare , and which deserves especial commemoration . It has been truly said , that a great poet never receives half the praise he is entitled to , because the world never knows how much he erases . It is only the rich man that can afford to cast his wealth away so freely . Gray struck out two of the finest stanzas of his " Elegy , ** * * " Hark ! how the sacred calm , that breathes around , Bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease ; In still small accents whisp'ring from the ground , A grateful earnest of eternal peace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanza but one . After the epitaph was added , the first draft contained the following exquisite lines - " There scatter 'd oft , the earliest of the year , By hands unseen are showers of violets found ; The redbreast loves to build and warble there , And little footsteps lightly print the ground . " // because they marred the general harmony of its structure . If this sacrifice to the laws of art be entitled to our approbation , what ought we to say of that self-denying spirit which , through four large volumes , can keep a rigorous watch over its own impulses , lest it should be betrayed into something inconsistent with the severity of its subject ? It is in a great measure in consequence of this general reserve , that you feel such confidence in the accuracy and fidelity of this history . A tone of sincerity that can not be mistaken runs through it . An atmosphere of truth surrounds it on every side . There is an air of reality about it which you trust implicitly and without hesitation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther towards securing your conviction than the most imposing array of citations and references . The general truth of history has seldom been called in question by any but those who have reason to fear its decisions ; but discredit has often been thrown upon details by the historian 's assuming a greater familiarity with them than any but the actors could have had . St. R6al has left us a history of the Spanish conspiracy against Venice hardly inferior to the thrilling scenes which it suggested to the tender heart and picturesque imagination of Otway . But unfortunately the ambition of equalling Sallust led him to introduce circumstances which he had no means of knowing , and the false coloring which he thus gave to the narrative was probably one of the reasons which led a modern historian to call the whole story in question. * Mr. Irving has taken advantage of every opportunity to introduce appropriate details ; seasoning his narrative with characteristic anecdotes , which give a pleasant relief to the general gravity of the subject , and serve to bring out those familiar traits , without which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he has dis * La Harpe apologizes for him with considerable ingenuity : " Les d&amp;ails d'nne conspiration aussi singuli*re que celle qu'iI Scrivait out naturellement une teinte un pea romanesque .

It may seem superfluous to speak of Mr. Irving 's style ; but it is so refreshing to meet with a work written in such good taste , and with so graceful an adherence to the pure traditions of our language , that we can not resist the temptation of dwelling for a moment upon the grateful theme . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from circumstances peculiar to itself , and reflecting , with more or less fidelity , its own characteristics . So long as the influences under which it grew up retain their power , it continues to hold its place as the popular standard . But no sooner do they cease to act , than it begins to lose its distinctive features and gradually to assume those of another period . Still there is an element in it which resists this constant tendency to change , and preserves itself with more or less purity through the entire series of transformations . This element is the genius of the language , a lithe and delicate spirit , assuming with miraculous flexibility a strange variety of forms , bending to the strong will , humoring the playful caprice , diffusing itself with subtile expansion throughout the whole body of literature , and giving to the infinite creations of mind the form and lineaments of national unity . Thus , while there is much in which the writers of different ages differ , there is something in which they agree ; and this point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be judged . Some hold the great writers of their language in such veneration , that they hardly venture to use a phrase which has not received their sanction , and never seem to feel sure of themselves unless when treading in their footsteps . Others , tempering their reverence for the past by a cheerful recognition of the changes which the progress of society and the rise of new arts aud inventions introduce into the forms of speech , readily admit whatever may be necessary for the adequate expression of thought . A third class seem to throw themselves // recklessly into the current , with an utter disregard of all the old landmarks and cherished associations of their fathers , confounding innovation with progress , and novelty with reform , too proud of the age they live in to remember how much it owes to the ages that went before , and filling their pages so lavishly with newinfusions of form and diction , as to make it difficult to recognize in the unnatural mixture the genuine characteristics of their mother tongue . No period of English literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than our own , in which the seeds of novelty have not only been scattered broadcast over the whole surface of society , but have , by the magnitude of our discoveries and the rapidity of our progress , become intermingled with our common trains of thought and all the habits of life . To resist this besetting sin , to acknowledge the claims of the age without blindly giving one 's self up to it , to detect those analogies which , running through the entire texture of a language , enable the judicious scholar to preserve its true spirit , even when he calls upon it to discourse of things which seem to . lie beyond the limits assigned to it by its greatest masters , is a proof of a just and philosophic mind , and must be regarded as a merit of no common order . Of the three great American historians Mr. Prescott , perhaps , has the fewest of those characteristic traits which may be regarded as distinctive of our own times . The general structure of his style resembles that of the best parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine flavor of general culture which can be acquired only by a long and careful study of the most polished writers of every age . His sentences have an easy and natural flow , adapting themselves with graceful flexibility to the different forms of expression which the subject requires , from a full picture to a simple outline . The rhythm of his periods is not always apparent , or , at least , not always prominent , for they are addressed to the eye rather than to the ear ; but there is a sweet undertone of natural melody running through them , which mingles pleasantly with their general flow , and fills the mind with an agreeable sense of harmony . There is no apparent effort about them . Everything is natural and easy , like the free giving of // what has been freely received . You may sometimes feel the want of energy ; of lucidness , never . The words are for the most part happily chosen , indicating a judicious use of the different elements of our vocabulary without any exclusive preference . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employs are beautiful and appropriate . lie has none of those fiery sentences which blaze up with spontaneous combustion , as if they were about to consume the paper on which they are written ; nor yet any of that other cast , so common among our modish writers , which seem to have been shot out like arrows from the bow , paining the sensitive ear by the incessant twang of the cord . But he expresses his thoughts with a genuine simplicity , a natural warmth , an unaffected dignity , that bring them before the mind of the reader as distinctly as they arose in his own , and leave them there like the recollection of , a sunny landscape or a sweet song , which dwells in the soul as an unfailing resource for secret refreshment . In striking contrast with these natural graces is the brilliant and elaborate tessellation of Mr. Bancroft 's style , into which rich and varied learning and wide experience of life have been wrought with lavish profusion . It is evident that Mr. Bancroft has studied the art of writing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwearied pains . The words are inserted in their places with a curious felicity . The epithets are drawn freely from a wide range ot reading , and set off the thought with dazzling brilliancy . Like Muller , the eloquent historian of Switzerland , he loves to interweave with his own the language of the texts he draws from , forming a rich mosaic of skilfully assorted colors . He affects , too , a sententious energy , and the forms of abstract thought . But the energy of manner is not always sustained by energy of matter , and a portrait or an exposition sometimes runs out into several pages of concise sentences . His periods are addressed to the ear as much , if not more , than to the eye ; and you would say that he could never entirely divest himself of the feeling that he was speaking to the multitude . He draws largely from the science and vocabulary of the times , and seems to feel a peculiar pleasure in preserving 30 // the coloring of his own age in his most elaborate pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retouching till every detail has been carefully finished . But his vivid imagination has somewhat fragmentary in it , giving to parts a prominence which mars at times the harmony of the whole . And thus the general effect is like that of a harpist , who , while he commands your admiration by brilliant execution , dwells too long upon single chords to produce a gratifying sense of harmony . His individual sentences are never obscure , but the chapters do not always leave distinct impressions . He has many beauties , some of them of a very high order , which yet lose much of their charm by the lack of simplicity and repose . We are too constantly reminded of the effort by which they were produced , and are seldom allowed to forget the artist in his work . In Mr. Irving 's style there is less of the nineteenth century than in Mr. Bancroft 's , and more than in Mr. Prescott 's . The character of his early works brought him into that kind of contact with his contemporaries which necessarily affects the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In painting objects that lay under his eye , he naturally employed the language of daily life , and when he came to speak of the manners and arts of other ages , or to indulge in the genial exercise of creation , he had already caught as large a share of the characteristics of his own age as was suited to the nature and bent of his mind . His favorite studies , at the same time , served to moderate the effect of these contemporary influences , and to aid him in forming a style in which the genius of the language is preserved without sacrificing the genius of the age . He had conceived an early passion for the old poets and moralists , and had taken a special delight in those exquisite ballads into which men fresh from the people poured all the poetry of common life . He had made himself familiar with popular traditions , had studied the antique drama , and , living in daily intercourse with men of polite conversation , had gathered around himself an atmosphere of pure literature , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were naturally and harmoniously blended . Mr. Irving 's language is genuine English , with few words // that Addison or Goldsmith would not have used , and few that would not have been readily understood a hundred years ago in the same sense in which he employs them . The arts and inventions of the age have left just traces enough in his style to show that he belongs to a period in which great changes have been wrought in society by the progress of natural and social science . He is fond of idioms , with which he is copiously supplied by extensive reading , directed and enlivened by the habits of good society . He is usually very happy in the choice both of his words and of his idioms , and it is very seldom that one could change either without jeoparding the thought . He evidently feels the power of a word in its place , and some of his pictures owe half their beauty to a felicitous selection of terms . There is a richness and splendor of diction in his essays and tales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a calm affluence , always adequate to the occasion , but never overflowing in those brilliant periods which are the legitimate ornament of imaginative corn position . In the structure of his sentences there is a pleasing variety , although , like most moderns , he prefers short sentences . Their rhythm is singularly rich and sweet , free from every taint of monotony , and always gratifying the ear by spontaneous adaptation to the thought . Indeed , they leave upon the mind the same kind of impression which poetry does when it has once become associated with sweet music ; one never recalls the verses without fancying that he hears the accompaniment . All is clear and distinct in his periods , which seem like mirrors to his thoughts , reflecting every idea so truthfully , that you feel , while reading him , as if you were looking directly into his mind . And this arises in a great measure from his never attempting a style of writing that is not in harmony with his habits of thought ; so that his words become the natural expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he always leaves strong impres * That faculty which Boilean justly makes a merit in Maiherbe - " D'un mot mis en sa place enseigna le pouvoir . " Art Po*tique , Ch . I. 133. // sions. * The image that has found its way to the mind through the medium of his words is sure to remain there in all its freshness . We can not call his style simple ; for it is too rich for absolute sirriplicity . And yet it is so natural , the ornaments are so chaste , the words seem to drop so readily into their places , the epithets seem to rise so spontaneously from the subject , the periods seem to flow so easily into one another , that you never think of pausing to reflect on the labor which it must have cost to learn how to use language so skilfully . There is a fine flavor of culture about it which can not be mistaken , but which , while it shows how conversant he must have been with the best writers , is free from all tincture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often eloquent . One may read his sentences effectively , but can not declaim them . He has more movement than Mr. Prescott , more fluidity than Mr. Bancroft . If we were called upon to name the leading characteristics of his style , we should say that they were rhythm , artistic conception , and a constant play of fancy . It is to his delicate perception of rhythmical beauty that his sentences owe their just and harmonious proportions . It is by his rare power of artistic conception that he enriches them with pictures full of life and movement . And the vivid play of his fancy gathers for him , from the wide realms of animate and inanimate nature , that store of felicitous epithets which illuminates them as with a perpetual glow of soft and rosy light . You never willingly lay down a volume of his till you have finished it ; and when you take it up anew , you still feel the pleasure grow upon you as you read . " Fascinating** is the word that we should most readily apply to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains over us , and so serene a sense of secret satisfaction does he diffuse through the mind by the graceful flow of his periods . We think , therefore , that Mr. Irving has succeeded perfectly in the task which he had set himself ,  --  a history of Washington which should bring him home to every heart by bringing // him distinctly before every mind . A psychological analysis of character , like Coleridge 's Pitt , or a philosophical generalization , like Guizot 's Essay , however valuable for a certain class of readers , - and surely their value can not be rated too highly , - would have failed to meet the wants of the thousands who wish to know what Washington did in order to win for himself the holy title of " Father of his Country . " The historian of Washington is the great teacher of the nation , who tells us what sacrifices it cost our fathers to prepare for us the blessings that we enjoy ; what heroism was required to overcome the obstacles that beset their path ; what self-denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; how strong their wills , how firm their hearts , how sound their judgment , how serene their wisdom . We should rise from the volume with the whole of the wondrous history imprinted upon our memories , and with our hearts glowing with fervent gratitude and generous patriotism . We should feel that a great soul has been laid open before us , and that we have been permitted to look into its innermost recesses ; that we have been brought nearer to one in the touch of whose garments are healing and strength , and that , henceforth , when trials come upon us , and doubts assail us , and our hearts sicken and grow faint at the contemplation of evils for which we can discover no cure , the image of the great and good man will rise before us like a messenger from heaven , to teach us the power of faith and the beauty of virtue . We regard the brilliant success of these volumes as an occasion of joyful congratulation to the citizens of our republic . It is eminently a national work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has not merely enriched our literature with a production of rare beauty , but has given new force to those local associations which bind us as with hallowed ties to the spots where great men lived and great things were done . Few will now cross the Delaware without remembering that Christmas night of tempest and victory . Who can look upon the heights of Brooklyn without fancying that , as he gazes , the spires and streets fade from his view , while in their stead stern and anxious faces rise through // the misty air , and amid them the majestic form of Washington , with a smile of trinmph just lighting for a moment his care-worn features , at the thought of the prize he has snatched from the grasp of a proud and exulting enemy ? And Princeton , and Valley Forge , and Monmouth , and the crowning glory of Yorktown , - how do they live anew for us ! With what perennial freshness will their names descend to posterity ! And those two noble streams that flow to the sea through alternations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potomac , the majestic Hudson , - how have they become blended by these magic pages in indissoluble association , - the one the cherished home of Washington , the seat of his domestic joys , his rural delights , looked to with eager yearning from the din of camps and battle-fields , sighed for with weary longing amid the pomp and pageantry of ofilcial greatness , to which he returned so gladly when his task had been accomplished , and which , dying with the serenity of Christian resignation , he consecrated by the holiest of all associations , the patriot 's grave , - the other the scene of cares and triumphs , On whose banks he had passed slow days of hope deferred , whose waters had borne him to and fro through checkered years of dubious fortune , and had witnessed the touching sublimity of his farewell to his companions in arms , and the simple grandeur of his reception as first President of the country he had saved ! How meet was it that , while his ashes repose beside the waters of the Potomac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hudson !
