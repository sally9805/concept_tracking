ART . 111. - MOSES STUART . A Commentary on Ecciesiastes . By MOSES STUART , lately Professor of Sacred Literature , in the Theological Seminary at Andover , Mass . New York : George P. Putnam , 1851 . SINCE the beginning of the present year , one of the most distinguished men in the history of American theology has rested from his labors . Th* celebrity and public usefulness of MosEs STUART , the multitude of his pupils scattered over the world , to whom the announcement of his decease comes with a touching sense of personal bereavement , and the effects which his labors in life have already wrought , and which his surviving influence is yet to work upon the progress of theology and of religion in our country , prompt us to lay before our readers , without waiting for a more authorized biographer , some notice of his life and labors , drawn partly from our personal reminiscences , and partly from opportunities of communication with some of his early and intimate friends . He was born at Wilton , in Fairfield County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 17 , in the spring vacation , he entered the Sophomore class in Yale College . He had made his preparation for college , partly at least , under the instruction of that admirable scholar , afterwards so distinguished as a jurist , Roger Minot Sherman , who had then just retir*d from is short connection with the Faculty of the College , and was attempting to establish himself in the practice of law at Norwalk . A classmate who entered at the same time , and shared in his examination , testifies that from his first appearance within college walls , all those peculiarities of manner which every one who knew him in later years must have observed , and which even the reader of his writings felt distinctly , all the singularities by which the man was so identified to the last , were fully developed . His earliest college composition , read in the recitation room , was on the advantages of a prospective over an immediate abolition of slavery , a subject which had just then a local interest in Connecticut ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diction and of argument , with his late pamphlet on cognate subjects , entitled " Conscience and the Constitution . " In a class which shows upon the catalogue some names of most distinguished scholarship , he was honored by the highest appointment  --  a distinction which he probably owed in // part to the thoroughness of his preparation under Mr. Sherman , particularly in mathematical studies . After leaving college , he found some temporary employment as a teacher , and soon commenced the study of law , which he had chosen for his profession . In 1802 he returned to college as a tutor , and while performing the duties of that office , he continued his legal studies , and was admitted to the bar in Fairfield County . But at the time of his admission to the bar , inquiries and studies of another sort were already beginning to engross his attention . President Dwight was accustomed in those days to read occasionally at evening prayers , a chapter from the translation in Macknight on the Epistles . Something in that exercise had interested Mr. Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath , borrowing for that purpose from the President , a volume of Macknight . As he read , an interest deeper than any merely intellectual inquiry was excited ; his religious consciousness was beginning to be awakened . Presently his Sabbath-day study of the Scriptures was continued into the week ; his ardent and impetuous mind felt itself grappling with infinite realities ; religion had become to him a matter of immediate inquiry ; his personal reconciliation to God was to him the greatest of all concerns , and the foremost of all duties . He saw in Christ , as in a glass , the glory of Cod ; and thus his views of life and of the world , and all his plans of activity in life , were changed . After a little study of theology under the guidance of President Dwight , and the writing of a single metaphysico-theological dissertation , which , with a text prefixed , was made to answer as a sermon at his examination for licensure , he was duly " approbated " by the Association , and commended to the churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having written another sermon , ( from 2 Kings ii , 12 , ) he began to preach . This was about the close of the year 1804 . Forty-seven years ago , the aged pastor of the First Church in New Haven , ( Dr. James Dana , ) being temporarily disabled in consequence of the fracture of a limb , Mr. Stuart was employed to supply the vacancy for a few Sabbaths . His preaching immediately began to command attention . So strong was the impression produced by his earliest efforts , that after a few weeks , a large portion of the congregation , and especially of the younger people , had fixed their hearts upon him with the determination that he should be their pastor . He was accordingly invited by a vote to preach as a candidate for settlement . The invitation was declined on the ground that the aged pastor with whom it was proposed to associate him as // a colleague , did not favor the movement . Between Dr. Dana and Mr. Stuart there was as great diversity of mind , manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any two men who could be thought of in such a connection . Dr. Dana was dignified , formal and precise in speech and manners . Mr. Stuart , though neither slovenly nor clownish , despised the idea of an old fashioned clerical dress , and old fashioned clerical dignity of countenance and demeanor . Dr. Dana was one whose taste in writing and in eloquence was formed on classical models . In Mr. Stuart 's written discourses , and in all his public performances , there was the utmost seriousness and earnestness , without any scholastic affectation of correctness . Dr. Dana 's notions were thoroughly c*nservative-as if it were enough to keep things as they were , and not let the church or the world grow worse . Mr. Stuart had by nature all the restless impulsiveness of a reformer ; he was one of those who feel that their business is to make the church and the world a great deal better . Dr. Dana 's way of preaching was cautious , as if he were unwilling to depart from the letter of the Scriptures , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points of Christian doctrine which are so magnified and illustrated by the emotions of Christian experience , and around which so many of the controversies of theology revolve from age to age . Mr. Stuart 's preaching was just the reverse of this : whatever he knew , he knew without the shadow of a doubt , and he proclaimed it without reserve or caution ; every sermon had with him the freshness of a new discovery ; and the outright earnestness with which he spoke just what he himself had found , and felt , and handled of the truth , carried the attention and the sympathy of his hearers . Dr. Dana 's opinions on the theological questions of the time , were utterly opposed to what was then called " new Divinity ; " he repudiated with all his heart , the dogmatic peculiarities which the successors of President Edwards had introduced into New England theology . Mr. Stuart , as a young man , as a man made for progress , and by virtue of all his associations , Was wholly with the new Divinity . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to have such a colleague as the society was proposing to thrust upon him ; or that the young candidate was unwilling to be put into such a relation . The result was that Dr. I ) ana , then seventy years of age , though in only the seventeenth year of his ministry in that church , was dismissed from his charge , and Mr. Stuart having been regularly invited to the pastoral office , was ordained on the 5th of March , 1806 , just as he was completing the twenty-sixth year of his age . // His short ministry in New Haven , marks an era in the history of the church which he served as pastor . We might almost define his settlement as the date of a revolution . The old petrified order of things which had come down through the ministry of at least three successive pastors , and which was sanctified by the traditions of more than a century , was rapidly and effectually disturbed . Meetings for prayer and free religious conference , which before had been hardly known-meetings in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than a scandal , became frequent . A new religious vitality began to be developed in the church ; a new seriousness spread itself over the congregation at large . Many who had cherished the notion that a decent morality , with a perfunctory attendance on public worship , was all that could reasonably be expected of them , began to ask , What lack I yet ? Many a soul , touched by God 's gracious spirit , began to be conscious of a need and guilt unfelt before , and began to inquire , What must I do ? Many to whom the idea of religious experience had been quite distasteful , began to feel the powers of the world to come , and awoke as from the dead to newness of life . During the three years and ten months of Mr. Stuart 's service in the pastoral office , two hundred persons were received to full communion in the church , of whom only twenty-eight were received by letter from other churches . Of those two hundredsuch is the rapidity with which a living generation passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them still in connection with the same church . He , in a ripe and venerable age . has gone to give an account of his ministry . How great a multitude of those to whom the word which he dispensed was " a savor of life unto life , " or " of death unto death , " have gone before to meet him at the dread tribunal ! As lately as the first ten years of the present century , the arrangements for theological education in this country , were exceedingly defective , in comparison with what they now are . The student , after completing what was then esteemed a course of liberal studies in some college , spent a few months , or a few weeks , as the case might be , either at college or with some pastor , reading some system or body of divinity , writing a t*w dissertations on the leading questions of theology , and preparing a few sermon* and then he was ready to pass his examination before the associated pastors of the neighborhood , and having received their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry . The Greek Testament was studied of course in college , for in those days it was considered indispensable to a liberal education ; but beyond this there was ordina // rily no study of the Scriptures in the languages in which they were written . If here and there some adventurous student entered on the study of the Hebrew , he found but little help and little encouragement . The zeal of President Stiles in behalf of Hebrew studies , and in behalf of theological erudition generalJy , had wrought no permanent effects . Doubtless the New England theology of that day , following the bias which it had received from the mighty hand of the elder Edwards , had its own high merits ; but in proportion as it became more speculative and metaphysical , it was growing less learned ; in proportion as it valued itself more and more upon its distinctive improvements in the statement and illustration of Christian doctrine , it was growing provincial ; in proportion as it concerned itself with philosophical analysis , it was tempted to withdraw itself from the historic interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few large-minded men in the eastern part of Massachusetts , alarmed at the development of Unitarianism in that quarter , began to consult about the foundation of a college f&amp;r educating ministers of the Gospel in the various branches of learning and science belonging distinctively to their own profession . From their consultations arose the theological seminary at Andover , in form a mere off-shoot from Phillips ' Academy , but entirely separate in fact , and endowed at its outset with a princely liberality . One part of the plan was , thorough instruction in the original languages of the Bible and in the theory and practice of Biblical interpretation . To the professorship in that department Mr. Stuart was invited near the close of the year 1809 , not long after the first organization of the seminary . No opening could have offered to him a more attractive prospect of activity and usefulness . The church and society reluctantly yielded to his judgment , and gave their consent to his dismission from the pastoral office . On the 9th of January , 1810 , just forty-two years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church in New Haven was formally dissolved . Inducted at the age of thirty into his new office , he devoted himself to it with characteristic zeal and force ; and as we have said that his settlement in the pastoral office marks an era in the history of the particular church to which he ministered , so we may say without exaggeration , that his removal to the chair of sacred literature at Andover , marks an era in the history of American theology . He went to that office with little preparation beside an earnest , enthusiastic mind , a habit of diligent application to whatever he , might undertake , and a gift for teaching which had been tried in college , and which consisted chiefly in the power // of inspiring his pupils for the time being with something of his own zeal . His acquaintance with Greek , at that time , was limited to the New Testament and a part of Homer 's Iliad ; and as for Hebrew he had never read more than half a dozen chapters in Genesis , and that without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to study and teaching , made up for all deficiencies in his own preparation . He created , as it were , the entire department of Biblical literature in that seminary , which has served as a model for every theological seminary since established in this country . Beginning to teach the venerable language of the Old Testament as he had learned it , ( or rather was learning it , ) without the points-the mode of reading and teaching to which Parkhurst and other English Hebraists of reputed learning had given considerable currency-he digested his knowledge , as fast as he acquired it , into a Grammar of the Hebrew language without the points . A copy of this now almost forgotten work we remember to have seen a little more than thirty years ago . After having been used for a year or two in manuscript , it was printed ; and it was the first book in the department of Biblical literature that was issued from the now celebrated Andover press . But hardly had that Grammar made its appearance when the author of it renounced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to lay anew , on a deeper and broader plan , the foundations of his Hebrew learning . He found that the English language contained no adequate helps for himself or for his pupils ; and that in the department of learning to which he was devoted , another living language had been enriched with a body of literature quite unknown to the theologians and scholars of Great Britain as well as of this country . At a time when the German language was almost as little studied among English and Anglo-American scholars as the Chinese now is , he became acquainted with the profound and all-investigating scholarship of German universities , and through their language he made the results of their learning available to himself in his pursuits . He soon began to bring forward a new class of divines ; not new in the sense of having new theological opinions , but new as having to some extent new habits of investigation and inquiry , and new methods of discussing theological questions . As students from Andover presented themselves to associations of pastors , here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good old ways was startled not only by new and uncouth technical words , such as " Exegesis , " " llermeneutics , " and " Linguistic , " but still more by the rejection ( perhaps not altogether // unostentatious ) of everything like a spiritual or secondary sense underlying the literal meaning of the Scriptures , and by the ready acknowledgment that this or that proof-text habitually quoted in preaching and in controversy , time out of mind , was not to be relied on as apposite or conclusive . There were not then so many facilities as now exist for propagating suspicion against an unfortunate innovator , but in many a monthly meeting of ministers , at many an ecclesiastical council , in many an associational meeting , there was inquiry and no little solicitude about the tendencies of Prof. Stuart 's mode of teaching ; and it seemed to be doubted whether any good would come in the end from the Andover institution . What might be the use of such an institution , and of such studies , to the church and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Moses Stuart descended , a champion in armor of proof , into the arena of the Unitarian controversy . For several years there had been , throughout New England , a growing uneasiness in the religious public at the rapid , but for the most part silent development of Unitarianism among the churches of Boston and vicinity . As yet , though there had been occasional skirmishes of controversy in pamphlets and magazines , there had been no formal separation of the parties , no drawing of definite lines between those who stood upon the old foundation , and those who had been carried away by the speculative and skeptical tendencies of the then dominant English philosophy . At last , in May , 1819 , Dr. Channing , in a sermon at the ordination of Mr. Sparks , ( now President Sparks of Cambridge , ) in a new Unitarian church at Baltimore , threw down the gauntlet , as it were , and challenged Orthodoxy to defend itself . The sermon was immediately published and was greatly admired . It was very soon followed by a memorable publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the tone of contempt in which Boston Unitarians had been wont to speak of Andover and Orthodoxy , began to be modified . As to the effect in other quarters , we remember to have heard a story which may be no better than a myth , but the existence even of such a myth answers our purpose as well as if we were able to warrant its historic verity . The story is that Dr. Beecher , then a pastor in Connecticut , had prepared a sermon against the dangerous tendency of familiarity with German commentators and philologists , and was on a journey to Andover , with the purpose of preaching it in the seminary chapel , when the Letters to Channing , having just been published , fell in his way ; and the consequence of reading them was that the well-intentioned sermon was consigned to the fire . In certain quarters the pre // judice against German studies is still extant ; but the utterance of it begins to sound like an echo of the cry which has sometimes been heard from ignorant zeal against " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not our purpose to criticise the published works of Prof. Stuart , or even to give a catalogue of their titles . In one way or another he has been , for more than thirty years , almost continually before the public as an author . The correction of proof-sheets and the preparation of manuscript foi the compositor has been with him a constantly returning labor . In sermons and in essays , in translations and in original treatises , in contributions to theological journals , ( almost invariably under his own name , ) and in separate volumes like those on the Canon of Scripture and the Interpretation of Prophecy , he has been contributing to the advancement of theological learning . His Hebrew Grammar-not the half-forgotten one to which we have already made allusion , but the one lately in use at Andover and elsewhere-was published in 1821 , and has passed through several editions , always improved , and always expecting to be improved again . But he is perhaps most honorably known in theological literature by his elaborate Commentaries . These were the great labor of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorship . The earliest of them , the Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews , was published in 1828 . We believe that , in respect to minuteness and thoroughness of philological investigation , nothing equal to it , nothing of the same sort , had then appeared in the English language . It was followed by Commentaries of the same character on the Epistle to the Romans and on the Apocalypse . More recently his Commentary on Daniel was added to the series . His latest publication was the Commentary on Ecclesiastes , the title of which is placed at the head of this article . His explanations of that most remarkable book , unique among the writings of either Testament , are interesting to the alumni of Andover for old acquaintance ' sake , though we believe* that to the majority even of professional readers the Commentary has the still greater interest of novelty . At our last interview with the venerable author , ( in October , ) we found him in his study , at work with all the activity and enthusiasm of earlier years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Book of Proverbs . Happy are we to learn that this work was completed and is now ready for publication , the last proof-sheet having been corrected before he lay down to die . It is not as an author , however , but as a teacher , that he has most effectually served his generation by the will of God . The // writer of this article became acquainted with him in the relation of a pupil , a little more than thirty-one years ago . The Professor was then in the meridian of his powers . He had been ten years in his professorship , and had become familiar with its duties . It is a reminiscence of youthful delight to recall the excitement of that lecture-room . The daily recitation was not to him , and therefore it was not to us , a daily drudgery ; in him it seemed to be a joyous exercise-/abor ipse voluptas  --  and his delighted earnestness transfused itself into the minds of his pupils . On our part , the profoundest reverence for the teacher was found to be not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any of his views and in drawing out from him the solution of our doubts . It was a new pleasure to find ourselves on such a footing of friendship and unembarrassed intercourse with one whom we so delighted to honor . It was a new pleasure to see the sacred page grow luminous , as he fixed upon it our awakened attention , and guided our minds to the perception of its beauties and its treasures . Nor was it without a new delight that we found ourselves led forth out of narrow and hard-beaten paths into the open field of free investigation . Thus , through a series of nearly forty years , class after class of men who had devoted themselves to the work of the ministry , was trained by him in the study of those Divine records which are the text-book and the only authoritative rule of Christian faith . His pupils , dispersed perhaps through all our states and territories , have found their posts of usefulness not only in the pastoral office , but in the most various academic stations , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the action of his ardent mind wakening and kindling their souls as with a touch of inspiration . These all owe to him , in no small measure , whatever they possess of skill and of freedom , in the exposition of the oracles of God . Nor is this the whole . His usefulness as a teacher connects itself not only with the progress of Christianity in the va*t empire of our Union , but with those foreign missionary movements which , proceeding from this country , are carrying Christianity into the most distant realms of Pagan and Mohammedan darkness . At Beir*it , each morning sun spreading its rosy splendor over the snow of Lebanon wakens to his daily task one of the most accomplished scholars of our age , who is preparing with toilsome accuracy , a new translation of the Bible into the sacred language of the Koran  --  a translation which , if he is permitted to finish it , will be pronounced , we doubt not , by competent judges , the most exquisite which the world has ever seen in any languagea translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncounted // millions with whom that language is vernacular , more than all that Luther 's Bible has been to Germany . At Constantinople , the language of the Turks has been enriched and hallowed by receiving a translation of the Scriptures ; and the Jews there are reading the law and the prophets , and the records of the New Testament , not in the dead Hebrew only , but in their own tongue in which they were born . At Smyrna , another hand is completing the translation into modern Armenian . Beyond the Mountains of Assyria , the Nestorians are rejoicing in the translation of the Scriptures into their spoken Syriac . It would be tedious to rehearse what has been done , or is now in progress , of the same sort , for India , for China , for Hawaii , for the Zulus of South Eastern Africa , for the Ch&amp;rokees and the Choctaws . In all these regions , in all these languages , the pupils of Prof. Stuart are employed , or have been , not only in preaching the Gospel , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidings of his death will travel round the globe to find those who have been disciples at his feet ; and tears , as of filial affection , will fall on pages half Inscribed with the strange words and uncouth characters of languages which the men whom he trained for their work are consecrating to the worship of God and the Gospel of Christ . It is , perhaps , the highest illustration of his usefulness , that , in so many languages , the Bible will be given by his pupils to so many tribes and nations , not in the form of hasty translations from a translation , but in the form of translations made directly from the inspired original , with all the aids afforded by the most advanced investigation . No intelligent admirer of Prof. Stuart will claim for him the highest rank , either in general learning , or in the particular learning of his own profession . He was too impetuous by nature , too zealous in his work , too intent on achievement , to be unfailingly accurate . Some of his pupils are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But who of them all can teach in that department as he taught , rousing the whole class and kindling each learner into a glow ? It is well to remember that the most minutely accurate scholar is not always the most effective teacher . Prof. Stuart 's merit is , that he did for his own department of learning what another professor , still flourishing in a green old age , has done for physical science . Distant be the day when the parallel may be drawn out , in all its points of resemblance and contrast , without indelicacy . Had Moses Stuart been one of those scholars who never err , and whom no criticism can censure , he might have adorned some learned chair with the wealth of his attainments and the academic renown of his acuteness ; but he would never have // been the inspiring teacher that he was , nor would he have been honored as the father of Biblical learning in America . It would be difficult to discuss at large his influence , present and prospective , on American theology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet we shall be unjust to his memory if we omit entirely so important a topic . The providence of God has made him the pioneer , or rather one of the chief instruments , of a great reformation in the method of theological education and of theological study  --  a reformation the effects of which on the pulpit , on the church , on the progress of the Gospel . and on the conversion of the world , have been as yet by no means exhausted or fully unfolded . A change is taking place in the character of our theology , a change which , however it may be deprecated by the fearful and the unbelieving , goes on , year after year , by the force of tendencies which can not be resisted . It is not that the vital truths of the evangelical system are rejected or undervalued ; rather let us say that they are contemplated in a clearer light and with a wider view of their relations , and that thus they are more adequately appreciated . It is not , as accusers proclaim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmarks of doctrine , as defended by Owen and Calvin , and in earlier ages by Augustine and Athanasius ; on the contrary , the New England orthodoxy , without losing any just reverence for its own great divines , and without forfeiting its right to what they have won for it , is growing , as we judge , more orthodox according to ancient , historic , and truly catholic standards of orthodoxy . It is not , as so many complain , that our teaching and preaching are less Scriptural and more speculative ; the very reverse is the fact . Doubtless the progress of this gradual revolution , ( for slow as the movement is , it may be called a revolution , ) is attended with dangers ; but what good thing is there in this world , what change for the better , which may not become extravagant and mischievous through human infirmity . Let those , therefore , who are foreordained and predisposed to be conservatives of the old , see to their duty and magnify their office . No doubt , as our theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact analysis of language and of thought will require new definitions and defenses of doctrine , and thus there will be new controversies among those who receive the truth in the love of it ; but the truth will be safe . The causes of the change in question are many . One of them , no doubt , is to be found in the progress of physical science and in the extent to which the inductive philosophy and its achievements have entered into our systems of education , // and have affected all our habits of thought . Much is due , also , to the fact , that with us Christianity is thrown upon its own resources , and stands in a new relation to all civil institutions . Much is due to the changing developments of infidelity , and to the presence of Romanism and other kindred systems which our predecessors knew only by tradition . Much is due to the enlarged and enterprising evangelism of the age , planning and laboring for the propagation of the truth , and continually reacting on the pulpit and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the contemplation of such causes , we should not forget how much is due to the influence of individual men , leaders by the endowments of nature or by the position assigned to them in God 's providence . No man among our recent theologians is more conspicuous in this respect than Moses Stuart . He was made to be a leader , wherever he might be placed ; and he was destined to an extraordinary position . The peculiarity of his influence upon the progress and tendency of our theology is not , as some suppose , the simple consequence of his studying German authors and introducing German expositors to the knowledge of those who read the English language . It is the consequence of his zeal for the study of the Scriptures , and of the success with which he insisted on making that the primary and fundamental study in the whole cyclopedia of theology . The difference is obvious enough between the method of studying theology which was in common use before the year 1810 , and that which may be regarded as beginning when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven to the professorship at Andover . On the one hand there is a method of teaching which begins with putting a ready-made system of theology into the hands of the learner , and ends with showing him how to argue it out , and how to use the Bible as a storehouse of proof-texts . This is the way to have a theology which , as determined by the genius of the age or of the people , will be either unthinking and traditional , or speculative , logical and rationalistic , but always narrow and sectarian . On the other hand there is a method of teaching , which begins with putting the Bible itself into the hands of the learner and setting him to study it as a collection of historical documents , and which afterwards leads him to investigate , in the light of this authentic and inspired Christianity , the dogmatic system which theologians , toiling from age to age upon the materials which the Bible afforded them , have hewn out , and jointed , and built up into a massive and symmetrical structure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with any violent change , a theology very different in its spirit and // Feb. tendency from the other . The theology resulting from such a method of instruction will be fundamentally scriptural , and therefore free and of a catholic spirit . Beginning with the study of the Scriptures as historic documents , it learns to distinguish between the revelation given in the record and the analyses and deductions of human logic ; and the more devoutly it clings to the one , the more humbly it distrusts the other . Without shutting up the expounder of Christian truth to the one work of interpretation , or forbidding him to attempt a science of theology , it cultivates among theologians a scholar-like and historical spirit , and puts them upon tracing along the line of ages the successive struggles by which the now existing science of dogmatic theology , identified in all its progress with the instincts and yearnings of evangelical piety , has been slowly developed out of the simple and primitive Gospel . That such is now the character of American evangelical theology , or even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not affirm ; but we confess it has often seemed to us that something like this may be the theology of the future . We believe that those who were familiar with Mr. Stuart 's preaching in his youth , generally agree in representing him as having lost in later years much of his power . The tradition of his preaching in New Haven corresponds with the record of what was achieved under his ministry , and makes him one of the most pungent , convincing and efficient preachers that New England has ever known . Two of his sermons , addressed to his own congregation , were published ,  --  one , preached at the last communion before his resignation of the pastoral office , the other a more formal farewell sermon preached after his dismission . A critic measuring these sermons , mechanically , by the rules laid down in books on homiletics , might not discover in them any remarkable superiority . A fastidious reader , comparing them with some of the grand discourses of such masters as Chalmers and Robert Hall , and looking only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , might find in them little to admire . Any intelligent man happening to light upon them in a volume of old pamphlets , and happening not to recognize the name of their author , might not discover any difference between them and the ordinary printed sermons of preachers whose celebrity never traveled far beyond their own parochial boundaries . But to one familiar with the author and able to represent to his own mind the actual preaching of the sermons at the time and place , those dingy leaves will seem to flash with an electric fire . He recalls the preacher 's tall , thin figure with the angular sharpness // of its outline . He hears the peculiar modulation of that voice , sometimes dropping to the deepest tones , sometimes mounting up the scale in bursts of emotion , always distinct in its articulation , often most emphatic in its pauses . He sees the occasionally vehement gesticulation , the expression gleaming in every feature , the soul unconsciously betraying at every moment its own inward glow , and thus giving even to the most familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who reads ihose two sermons in the light of such associations , the report which survivors give of the effects produced in the preaching of them , will not seem at all mysterious . Mr. Stuart 's power as a preacher was in his unaffected earnestness , snatching a grace beyond the reach of art . ' He had a quick sympathy with his hearers , which they felt because he felt it , and thus grappling their souls to his , he drew them along with him ; when the train began to move upon the track , the dead weight of every listener became as it were a living force , all their momentum was added to his own , and soon every axle and every wheel glowed with the rushing movement . In that constitutional quickness of sympathy , that genial heartiness which afterwards so charmed his pupils , and which gave him so much power with his parishioners in private intercourse , was one element of the earnestness with which , in the pulpit , he grasped the truth and felt its electric thrill through every fibre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor or a teacher , none that knew him as a man and a friend , will censure us for having described him only in terms of eulogy . Who that knew him can forget the genial glow of his affections , the fascinating frankness of his manners , the impressiveness of his voice , the eloquent expressiveness of his countenance , the flashes of wit and humor that illuminated his talk , the profound seriousness toward God and eternity which communicated itself to all who listened ? Who that remembers these things will expect us to criticise the eccentricities which gave such distinctness to his personal identity , or to draw his frailties from the dread abode ' to which they have just descended ? It is enough that he feared God , and trusted , as a weak and sinful man , in Jesus Christ , and that God has made him in his generation a burning and a shining light . His decease took place late in the evening of the Lord 's day , the 4th of January last . A short and apparently slight illness had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so suddenly that his family , who had retired for the night , had not time to assemble at his*bed-side ere he had breathed his last .
