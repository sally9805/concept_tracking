txt ADVERTISEMENT . Through the past year , M. de Lamartine has published a monthly journal , called The People 's Counsellor , " Le Conseiller du Peuple . " Each number of this journal contains an Essay , by him , on some specific subject , of pressing interest to the French people ,  --  generally , some political subject . As a companion to one of these numbers , he published the Essay which we here translate . We have thought that its interest and merit are by no means local ; but , that it will be read with as much interest in America , as in France . EDWARD E. HALE , FRANCIS LE BARON . Worcester , Mass . March 7 , 1850 . ATHEISM AMONG THE PEOPLE . I. I have often asked myself , " Why am I a Republican ?  --  Why am I the partizan of equitable Democracy , organized and established as a good and strong Government ?  --  Why have I a real love of the People  --  a love always serious , and sometimes even tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not born in the ranks of the People . I was born between the high Aristocracy and what was then called the inferior classes , in the days when there were classes , where are now equal citizens in various callings . I never starved in the People 's famine ; I never groaned , personally , in the People 's miseries ; I never sweat with its sweat ; I was never benumbed with its cold . Why then , I repeat it , do I hunger in its hunger , thirst with its thirst , warm under its sun , freeze under its cold , grieve under its sorrows ? Why should I not care for it as little as for that which passes at the antipodes ?  --  turn away my eyes , close my ears , think of other things , and wrap myself up in that soft , thick garment of indifference and egotism , in which I can shelter myself , and indulge my separate personal tastes , without asking whether , below me ,  --  in street , garret , or cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People ; a religious People , or an atheistic People ; a People of idlers , or of workers ; a People of Helots , or of citizens ? " And whenever I have thus questioned myself , I have thus answered myself :  --  " I love the people because I believe in God . For , if I did not believe in God , what would the people be to me ? I should enjoy at ease that lucky throw of the dice , which chance had turned up for me , the day of my birth ; and , with a secret , savage joy , I should say , ' So much the worse for the losers !  --  the world is a lottery . Woe to the conquered ! ' " I can not , indeed , say this without shame and cruelty ,  --  for , I repeat it , I believe in God . II . " And what is there in common , " you will say to me , " between your belief in God and your love for the People ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that vague , confused , indefinite , shadowy sentiment which compels one to suppose a principle because he sees consequences ,  --  a cause where he contemplates effects , a source where he sees the rush of the inexhaustible river of life , of forms , of substances , absorbed for ever in the ocean , and renewed unceasingly from creation . The belief in God , which is thus perceived and conceived , is , so to speak , only a mechanical sensation of the interior eye ,  --  an instinct of intelligence , in some sort forced and brutal ,  --  an evidence , not reasonable , not religious , not perfect , not meritorious ; but like the material evidence of light , which enters our eyes when we open them to the day ; like the evidence of sound which we hear when we listen to any noise ; like the evidence of touch when we plunge our limbs in the waves of the sea , and shiver at the contact . This elementary , gross , instinctive , involuntary belief in God , is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity . It is almost animal . I am persuaded that if the brutes even ,  --  if the dog , the horse , the ox , the elephant , the bird , could speak , they would confess , that , at the bottom of their nature , their instincts , their sensations , their obtuse intelligence , assisted by organs less perfect than ours , there is a clouded , secret sentiment of this existence of a superior and primordial Being , from whom all emanates , and to whom all returns ,  --  a shadow of the divinity upon their being , a distant approach to the conception of that idea , which fills the worlds , and for which alone the worlds have been made ,  --  the idea of God ! * * * * * This may be a bold , but it is not an impious supposition . For God , having made all things for himself alone , must have placed , upon all that he made , an impress of himself ; more or less clear , more or less luminous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Creator . But this faith , when it stops here , is not worthy of the name . It is a species of Pantheism , that is to say , a confused " visibility , " a physical working together into indissoluble union of something impersonal , something blind , something fatal , and something divine , which , in the elements composing the universe , we may call GOD . But this " visibility " can give to man no moral decision ,  --  can give to God no worship . The Pantheism of which I am accused as a philosopher and poet , that Pantheism which I have always scorned as a contradiction and as a blasphemy , resembles entirely the reasoning of the man who should say , " I see an innumerable multitude of rays , therefore there is no sun . " III . Faith , or reasonable and effective belief in God , proceeds , undoubtedly , from this first instinct ; but in proportion as intelligence develops itself , and human thought expands , it goes from knowledge to knowledge , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment to sentiment , infinitely farther and higher , in the idea of God . It does not see him with the eyes of the body , because the Infinite is not visible by a narrow window of flesh , pierced in the frontal bone of an insect called Man ; but it sees Him , with a thousand times more certainty , by the spirit , that immaterial eye of the soul , which nothing blinds ; and after having seen him with evidence , it reasons upon the consequences of his existence , upon the divine aims of His creation , upon the terrestrial as well as eternal destinies of His creatures , upon the nature of the homage and adoration that God expects , upon his moral laws , upon the public and private duties which he imposes on his creatures by their consciences , upon the liberty He leaves them ; so that with the sufferings of conflict He may give to them the merits and the prize of virtue . Thus in man does the instinct of God become Faith . Thus man can speak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the stars , the word which fills the worlds by itself alone , the word which commenced with them , and which can only end with them ;  --  " I believe in God ! " IV . It is in this sense , my friends , that I say to you , " I believe in God . " But , once having said this word with the universe of beings and of worlds , and blessed this invisible God for having rendered himself visible , sensible , evident , palpable , adorable in the mirror of weak human intelligence , made gradually more and more pure , I reason with myself on the best worship to be rendered Him in thought and action . Let me show how , by this reasoning , I am forcibly drawn to the love of the People . I say to myself , then , " Who is this God ? Is he a vain notion , which has no effect on the thoughts and acts of man , his creature ; who inspires nothing in him ; who gives him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not reward , and who does not punish ?  --  No ! God is not a mere notion , an idea , an evidence ;  --  God is a law ,  --  the living law , the supreme law , the universal law , the eternal law . Because God is a law on high , he is a duty on the earth ; and when man says , ' I believe in God , ' he says , at the same time , ' I believe in my duty towards God ,  --  I believe in my duty towards man . ' God is a government ! " And what are these duties ? They are of three sorts :  --  Duty towards God ,  --  that is to say , the duty of developing , as much as possible , my intelligence and my reason , to arrive at the purest idea and the highest worship of the Supreme Being , by whom and for whom all is , all exists :  --  Religion . Private Duties ,  --  that is to say , the exact and tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in written or unwritten laws , which bind me to those , to whom , in the order of nature , I hold most closely ,  --  the nearest to myself in the human group  --  father , mother , brothers , sisters , wife , children , friends , neighbors :  --  the Family . Collective Duties ,  --  that is to say , devotions , even to the sacrifice of myself , even to death , to the progress , the well-being , the preservation , the amelioration of this great human family , of which my family , and my country , are only parts ; and of which I myself am only a miserable and vanishing fraction , a leaf of a summer , which vegetates and withers on a branch of the immense trunk of the human race :  --  Society . Let us speak to-day only of these last duties ,  --  because , now we are occupied with politics alone . V. God , when one believes in Him as you and I do , imposes then on man a duty towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit it , do you not ? Then follow , and analyze with me this society . Of whom , and how , is it composed ? It is composed , at the same time , of strong and weak , conquerors and conquered , victors and vanquished , oppressors and oppressed , masters and slaves , nobles and serfs , of citizens and bondmen or subjects disinherited and enslaved , considered as living furniture , as tools and laughing-stocks to their fellow-men , as were the Blacks in our colonies before the Republic . Thanks to the increase of general reason , to the light of philosophy , to the inspiration of Christianity , to the progress of the idea of justice , of charity , and of fraternity , in laws , manners , and religion , society in America , in Europe , and in France , especially since the Revolution , has broken down all these barriers , all these denominations of caste , all these injurious distinctions among men . Society is composed only of various conditions , professions , functions , and ways of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; of proprietors of the soil , and proprietors of houses ; of investments , of handicrafts , of merchants , of manufacturers , of farmers ; of day-laborers becoming farmers , manufacturers , merchants , or possessors of houses or capital , in their turn ; of the rich , of those in easy circumstances , of the poor , of workmen with their hands , workmen with their minds ; of day-laborers , of those in need , of a small number of men enjoying considerable acquired or inherited wealth , of others of a smaller fortune painfully increased and improved , of others with property only sufficient for their needs ; there are some , finally , without any personal possession but their hands , and gleaning for themselves and for their families , in the workshop , or the field , and at the threshold of the homes of others on the earth , the asylum , the wages , the bread , the instruction , the tools , the daily pay , all those means of existence which they have neither inherited , saved , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People . This name is extended now ; it embraces really all the People ; but still it is used as the name of the indigent and suffering part of the People . It is more especially of this class that I intend to speak , in saying to you , " To love the People , it is necessary to believe in God . " VI . The love of the People , the conscience of the citizen , the sentiment which induces the individual to lose himself in the mass , to submit himself to the community , to sacrifice himself to its needs ,  --  his interest , his individuality , his egotism , his ambition , his pride , his fortune , his blood , his life , his reputation even , sometimes , to the safety of his country , to the happiness of the People , to the good of humanity , of which he is a member in the sight of God ,  --  in one word , all these virtues , necessary under every form of government ,  --  useful under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been derived , and never can be derived , from any thing but that single sentence , pronounced with religious faith , at the commencement , in the middle , at the end of all our patriotic acts :  --  " I believe in God ! " The People who do not believe strongly , efficaciously in this first principle , in this supreme original , in this last end of all existence , can not have a faith superior to their individual selfishness . The People who can not have a principle superior to their individual selfishness , in their acts as citizens , can not have national virtue . The People who can not have national virtue can not be free ; for they can have neither the courage which enables them to defend their own liberty , nor the conscience which forces them to respect the liberty of others , and to obey the laws , not as an outward force , but as a second conscience . The People who can neither defend their liberty , nor restrain it , may be , by turns , slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , Atheism in the People is the most invincible obstacle to the establishment and consolidation of that sublime form of government , the idol of all ages , the tendency of all perfect civilization , the dream of every sage , the model of all great souls ,  --  the government of the entire People by the reason and conscience of each citizen ,  --  otherwise called the REPUBLIC . VII . Must I demonstrate to you so simple a truth ? Can you not comprehend , without explanation of mine , that a nation , where each citizen thinks only of his own private well-being here below , and sacrifices constantly the general good to his personal and narrow interest ;  --  where the powerful man wishes to preserve all the power for himself alone , without making an equitable and proportional division to the weak ;  --  where the weak wishes to conquer at any price , that he may tyrannize in his turn ;  --  where the rich wishes to acquire and concentrate the greatest possible amount of wealth , to enjoy it alone , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance , in benevolence , in good deeds to his brothers ;  --  where the poor wishes to dispossess violently and unjustly those who possess more than himself , instead of recognizing that diversity of chances , of conditions , of professions , of fortunes , of which human life is composed ,  --  instead of acquiring prosperity for his family , in his turn and degree , by effort , by order , by labor , by economy , by the assistance of borrowed capital , by the law of inheritance , by the free transfer of real estate , by free entrance into different callings and trades , by free competition in the money market ;  --  where each class of citizens declares itself an enemy to every other , and heaps upon each other all manner of evil , instead of doing all the good in its power , and uniting in the holy harmony of social unity ;  --  where each individual draws around him , for himself alone , the common mantle , willing to tear it in pieces for himself , and thus leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , that such a People , having no God but its selfishness , no judge but interest , no conscience but cupidity , will fall , in a short time , into complete destruction , and , being incapable of a Republican government , because it casts aside the government of God himself , will rush headlong into the government of the brute : the government of the strongest , the despotism of the sword , the divinity of the cannon ,  --  that last resort of anarchy , which is at once the remedy and the death of nations without God ! Now has not this weakening of the sentiment of God in the soul of the People been , from year to year , from century to century , indeed , I might say , the most discouraging and threatening symptom , in the eyes of those who desire the progress of their race , who aspire to the moral perfection of the human spirit , who hope in Republican institutions , who love the People , who wish to cultivate their reason , who desire that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , by their enlightenment , their conscientiousness , their moderation and virtue , give the lie to those who declare them in a state of perpetual infancy , perpetual madness , or perpetual weakness ? Yes , this is but too true : men have been blotting out God , for a century past , from the souls of the People , and more especially in latter years . The masses have been driven to Atheism , they have been driven on every side and by every hand . Sometimes , by blasphemies , such as were never heard upon the earth , until an insult to the Creator became a means of popularity among His creatures ; blasphemies which would have darkened the sun and extinguished the stars , if God had not commanded His creation to pass unnoticed the revolt of a blind and foolish insect against Infinity , and refused Himself to sink to the foolishness of avenging impiety ! Read those lines which I dare not write , those lines where an apostle of Atheism effaces the name of God from the beautiful creation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the masses have been driven to Atheism by science . There are some geometers great in paradox , men who , of all the senses that the Creator has given to his creatures , have cultivated only one , the sense of touch ,  --  leaving out entirely that chief sense , which connects and confirms all others ,  --  the sense of the invisible , the moral sense . These savans , geometers , physicians , arithmeticians , mathematicians , chemists , astronomers , measurers of distances , calculators of numbers , have early acquired the habit of believing only in the tangible . These are the beings who , so to speak , live and think in the dark ; all , which is not palpable , does not exist for them . They measure the earth , and say , " We have not met God in any league of its surface ! " They heat the alembic , and say , " We have not perceived God in the smoke of any of our experiments ! " They dissect dead bodies , and say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any bundle of muscles or nerves in our dissection ! " They calculate columns of figures , long as the firmament , and say , " We have not seen God in the sum of any of our additions ! " They pierce , with eye and glass , into the dazzling mysteries of night , to discover , across thousands and thousands of leagues , the groups and the evolutions of the celestial worlds , and say , " We have not discovered God at the end of our telescopes ! The existence of God does not concern us ; it is no affair of ours ! "  --  Madmen ! They do not suspect that the knowledge and adoration of God are , at bottom , the only business of the creature ; and that all these distances , these globes , these numbers , these mysteries of the living being , this dissected mechanism of the dead , these compositions and decompositions of combined elements , these hosts of stars , and these eternal evolutions of suns around the divine hand which guides them , have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration , than to compel the acknowledgment , fear , admiration , and adoration of God , by that supreme sense , that sense superior to all other senses , that sense imponderable and impalpable , invisible yet beholding all things ,  --  that sense which we call intelligence ! Alas ! it is not that God has denied this sense to these men of figures , of science , and calculation ; but they have blinded themselves , they have cultivated the other senses so much , that they have weakened this . They have believed too much in matter , and so they have lost the eye of the spirit . These men , we are told , have made great progress in experimental science , but they have made good , evil , to the People , by saying to them , " We , who are so high , we can not see God !  --  blind men ! what do you see , then ? " IX . Besides these men , there is still another class ,  --  inventors of another science , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Economists . I do not , indeed , speak of all of them : there are among them some who are as spiritual as Fenelon , and these are , perhaps , at this day , the greater number . I speak only of those who , considering this world alone , have been driven , voluntarily or involuntarily , to Atheism in another way . Leaving the eternal and fastidious metaphysical and religions disputes in which the theologians of past centuries wasted the time , the good sense , and the blood of men , to honor their pretended God by immolating to Him the enemies of their faith , these false economists have said to governments and people , " Leave all this ; there is only one science which is good for any thing : it is the science of Wealth . All else is vanity and vexation of spirit . " This is the famous cry , the cry of a materialistic society :  --  " Grow rich ! " The economists of this school , now highly enlightened , legitimate children of the materialists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the things that belong to matter ; in men , only consumers and producers ; in the social functions , only labor of the hands :  --  to labor , to sow , to reap , to hew , to build , to forge , to weave , to barter , to exchange , to sell , to buy , to acquire , to beget ,  --  this is , according to these disciples of Malthus , the whole of man ! These are the Lycurguses and the Moseses , the legislators of a trading People : the moral , intellectual , spiritual , religious man does not exist for them . They love liberty , not because it ennobles human nature ; exercises free will , the most sublime of man 's vital functions ; cultivates his highest faculty ,  --  conscience ; purifies religion , the fundamental idea of mankind , from the superstitions that debase and dishonor it ; sanctifies human society , by leading it to the knowledge and worship of God ;  --  they love it because it abolishes Custom House duties ! All legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to a well-balanced account ! To have and to owe , these are the only two words in their language ! What matter to them the spirit , the soul , virtue , sentiment ?  --  What the moral and consoling beliefs , the divine hopes , the supernatural certainties , revealed or proved , or the immortal destiny , of man ?  --  What the present intellectual life , and the future immaterial life of these harvests of human generations , which God sows that they may bear fruit in his name , may adore his grandeur ,  --  which Death cuts down to bear them , ripe in faith and virtue , up to Heaven ? All this can neither be bought nor sold ; all this has neither stated price nor net revenue ; all this is not current on the Exchange ,  --  therefore it is nothing ! Thus these men count for nothing the forms of worship and the forms of government . They are neither followers of Brama , of Confucius , of Mahomet , of Plato , or of Rousseau ; neither absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the politics , and of the religion , in which they can manufacture most , buy and sell easiest , trade the best , multiply fastest ! Their civilization is traffic ; their God is the dollar ! This sect , useful in administering intelligently the affairs of commerce , has been a shadow over intellectual civilization ; for it has forgotten heavenly things , and , in forgetting them , has contributed to make the People also forget them . X. But that People which forgets God , forgets itself . What right has it to be a People , if it have not its origin and hope in Him ? How can the men of any nation expect tyrants to remember and respect its destiny , if they themselves debase this destiny to that of a machine with ten fingers , destined to weave the greatest possible number of yards of cloth in seventy years , to people as many hundred acres as possible with creatures as much to be pitied and as miserable as themselves , and to serve , from generation to generation , as human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their birth , their life , and their graves ? How can the moral spiritualism of a People long resist such theories ? Where can they find God in this workshop of matter ? XI . But even this is nothing . The French Revolution came in 1789 . It came to put an end to a double philosophy ,  --  the spiritual philosophy of Rousseau 's school , founded in reason and religion , the material philosophy of the school of Helvetius , Diderot , and their disciples , atheistic and cynical . The thought of the first of these philosophies was religious at bottom . It consisted merely in freeing the luminous idea of God from the shadows by which ignorance , intolerance , the inquisition of temporal dynasties and times of barbarism had falsified it ,  --  in freeing this idea , debased as it was ,  --  obscured , and enchained to thrones ,  --  so as to restore reason to its liberty , to inquiry , to the free conscience of every worship and of every soul ; to revive it in the eyes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the evidence of nature , the dignity and efficacy of free worship . But , for this , it was necessary to dispossess the Middle Ages of their temporal power , of their mort-main possessions , of their civil jurisdictions , of their exclusive privileges , of their legal intolerance against all other divine thoughts , and all other individual or national faith , all other forms of adoration and worship than what were imposed by the exclusive and established religion . To rally the people to this work , a work legitimate in itself , a work which the abuses of a crafty priesthood had made necessary , seven times , and whose accomplishment they had seven times partially and gradually undertaken , since the time of Charlemagne ,  --  the philosophers of the second school , the irreligious school , the atheistic school , of Diderot and Helvetius , drove the masses from stupidity even to impiety , and the demagogues of ' 93 forced them from impiety to Atheism , and from Atheism to blood . Demagogues , those poisoners of liberty , corrupt every revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they touch ; they dishonor every truth which they profess , by polluting or perverting it . The age and philosophy , Heaven and earth , desire what we too desire ,  --  freedom of conscience , voluntary worship ,  --  liberty of the human mind in matters of faith ,  --  the fraternity of altars , invoking , each in its own language , that God whom the whole earth is spelling out , and who reveals , from age to age , still another letter of His divine name . Instead of this , Atheists and demagogues united to persecute religion , to revenge themselves for the old persecutions of the priesthood . They profaned the temples , violated conscience , blasphemed the God of the faithful , parodied the ceremonies , cast to the winds the pious symbols of worship , and persecuted the ministers of religion . In the name of the Revolution , and under the menace of terror , they dragged the People to these Saturnalia . They corrupted the eyes , the hands , the minds , the souls of the populace . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea itself . The People , seeing the temple fall , believed that Heaven itself crumbled ; and that , following the profaned image of a vanishing worship , God himself would vanish from the world , with conscience , the supernatural law , the unwritten moral law , the soul and the immortality of the human race ! When the ignorant People no longer saw God between them and annihilation , they plunged into the boundless and bottomless abyss of Atheism , they lost their divine sense , they became brutal as the animal , who sees in the earth only a pasture ground , instead of the footstool of Jehovah . But these irreligious abominations , and these Saturnalia of Atheism , however much injury they inflicted on the religious spirit of the People , did not effect so much , perhaps , as the reign which followed this anarchy , the reign of Bonaparte , the so-called restorer of worship . And how ? XII . The Republic had passed its paroxysm of fever , of demagoguical madness , of persecution . The Directory had finally concentrated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , naturally moderate and tolerant , or made so by the experience and the lassitude of anarchy ; the moderate principles of the Revolution of 1789 , and of the constituted Assembly , regained their level , thanks to a natural reaction , limited by good sense , as happens after every revolution that overshoots its mark . The priests officiated , without obstacle , in the temples restored by the municipalities to the faithful , religion was entirely free , even favored by public respect , and by that care for good morals which all serious governments feel . Faith , taking refuge in men 's consciences , was , moreover , more sincere and more active , because it was neither constrained , nor favored , nor altered , nor profaned by the hand of government . This was , perhaps , the moment when there was the most religion in France ,  --  for this was the moment when , after having had its martyrs , the religious sentiment had a life in itself , and owed nothing to the partial and interested protection of the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposes upon you a God of its own fashion , or its own choice , the more does your conscience rise , and the more does it attach itself to the God of your own reason , or your own faith ! Bonaparte , whose genius was entirely military , but who , in affairs of moral , civil , and religious government , made it a matter of policy to contradict and extinguish all the truths of the Revolution , hastened to change all this . He wished to parody Charlemagne . Charlemagne had been the philosopher and revolutionary organizer of his time ; Charlemagne had bound together the spiritual and temporal , crowning the Pontiff that he might be crowned by him in turn . Bonaparte desired a State religion , an agreement in which religion and the empire should mutually engage and mutually check each other ; a Pope to subdue , to caress , to drive away , to recall , to persecute , by turns ; a coronation by the hand of an enslaved Church ; then a Church to chastise , when it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scandalous simony of ancient times , when the temporal power played , in the sight of the nations , with the idea and name of God , in a manner as contemptuous as it was odious . The People , who saw clearly through this intrigue of an indifferent sovereign ,  --  an Atheist at Toulon , a crafty politician at Marengo , a Mussulman in Egypt , a persecutor at Rome , an oppressor at Savona , a schismatic at Fontainbleau , a saint at Notre Dame de Paris ,  --  protector of religion and profaner of consciences by turns ,  --  felt their belief shaken anew . They asked themselves , " What then is God for us , poor souls , since God is such an instrument of power for great men , and such a police machine for governments ? " Scorn threw them back into Atheism . This was natural . XIII . This system was continued , with more sincerity on the part of government , under the dynasty of the Restoration . But the interested favors of the Court , for the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the populace against the priesthood . The more it lavished power and human dignities upon priestly superiors , the more the mind of the People turned from the religious sentiment . Each favor of royal authority to the privileged Church cast thousands of souls into Atheism . The Revolution of July suppressed the religion of the State : it was a progress towards the religion of conscience . But it favored the religion of the majority ; it still leaned towards the supremacy of numbers in matters of faith . However , from the moment the State religion was suppressed , the religion of conscience gained ground in men 's hearts . From 1830 to this day , every intelligent observer gladly acknowledges an immense progress in the religious sentiment in France .  --  Why ? Because the suppression of the official religion of the State was a progress in the liberty of conscience , and all progress in liberty of conscience is a progress of human thought toward the idea of God . Go farther still , and complete liberty will destroy Atheism in the People ! But the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scepticism , revolutionary impiety , the false and hypocritical piety of the empire , the concordat , the restoration of an imperial religion , and of an official and dynastic God by Napoleon , the tendency of the two Bourbon reigns to reconstruct a political church , everlastingly endowed with a monopoly of goods and of souls ,  --  and , finally , the industrialism of the reign of Louis Philippe , turning every thought to trade , to manual labor , to worldly wealth , and making gold the true and only God of the century ;  --  all this has borne its fruits . Look at these fruits at the present day , and say , if practical Atheism does not devour the souls of this People . But let us proceed . XIV . For eighteen years , new sects , or , rather , posthumous sects , have disputed for the soul of the People , under the names of Fourierism , of Pantheism , of Communism , of Industrialism , of Economism , and , finally , of Terrorism . Look at them , listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , handle them ; and say , if , with the exception of a vague deifying of every thing ,  --  that is to say , of nothing , by the Fourierites ,  --  there is a single one of these philosophical , social , or political sects , which is not founded on the most evident practical Atheism ; which has not matter for a God ; material enjoyments for morality ; exclusive satisfaction of the senses for an end ; purely sensual gratifications for a paradise ; this world for the sole scene of existence ; the body for the only condition of being ; the prolonging of life a few more years for its only hope ; a sharpening of the senses to material appetites for a perspective ; death for the end of all things ; after death , an assimilation with the dust of the earth for a future ; annihilation for justice , for reward , and for immortality ! No , there has not been since 1830 , there has not been since the Revolution , there is not at this moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , and saviors of the present , which is not Materialism in action . It is the deadly seed of the century of Helvetius , producing its poisons in the dregs of another century . It is man , deprived of his spiritual and immortal sense , reduced to a solid measure of organized matter , and seeking , not virtue , that key to his future destiny , in his soul ; but , in his senses , mere enjoyment , that end of the brute , who only believes in what he can eat and drink . XV . Analyze with me , if you are not overwhelmed with humiliation , the five or six Revelations of the latter days ; and ask yourselves , as I have often asked myself , while listening to them , if these revealers of pretended human felicity do indeed address themselves to men , or to herds of fatted cattle ! And are they astonished that the intellectual world resists them ? Do they complain that the ignorant are their only disciples ? Are they indignant that the ideas they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the abysses of society , and excite , instead of enthusiasm , only the fanaticism of hunger and thirst ? I can well believe it ! What People is there who would become fanatics , only for their own destruction ; renounce their moral nature , their divine souls , their immortal destinies , only for a morsel of more savory bread upon their table , for a larger portion of earth under their feet ? No ! no ! enthusiasm soars aloft , it does not fall to earth . Bear me up to Heaven , if you wish to dazzle my eyes ; promise me immortality , if you would offer to my soul a motive worthy of its nature , an aim worthy of its efforts , a price worthy of its virtue ! But what do your systems of atheistic society show us in perspective ? What do they promise us in compensation for our griefs ? What do they give us in exchange for our souls ? You know ,  --  we will not speak of it . But , indeed , if these sects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , if these questions which they debate , and these systems which they bring before the astonished People , are destined to serve as enigmas to posterity ; what will the future say of us ? It will only explain the Materialism , Atheism , and brutality of the doctrines and sects by which we have been disturbed for ten or twelve years , as the nightmare of a starving People , whose dreams have , for an object , only a frantic satisfaction of the senses . All these philosophies , or all these deliriums , are the deliriums or philosophies of the stomach ! " All this epoch , " future historians will say , " the French must have been a nation distressed by a terrible famine , to have forgotten , in so total an eclipse of the intellectual nature , the great and immortal ideas which have alone inspired even these , the human race , and rendered the revolutions of the People worthy of the regard of posterity , and of the blood of man . The Eighteenth Century must have been a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth brought forth neither fruit nor harvests , that this great intellectual People , formerly called the French People , should have forgotten their souls for a morsel of bread , their immortality for an income , and their God for a dollar ! Let us turn away our eyes and weep over that age . " XVI . See where we were when the Republic arose : happy was it that the People had at bottom more of the true sentiment of God than these masters and heads of sects . For , what would have become of us , if , in that total eclipse of government , of armed force , and of law , which followed the 24th of February , the People , masters of all , of the fortunes and lives of the citizens , of Heaven and earth , had been a People of Materialists , of Terrorists , and of Atheists ? The Revolution would have been a pillage , the Republic a scaffold , the dynasty of the People a deluge of blood . But there was no such thing . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Materialism disappeared in enthusiasm , which always exhibits the divinity of the human heart . We heard but one cry ,  --  " Honor to God ! Respect for the altars ! Liberty to their ministers ! Self-denial , harmony , protection to the weak , inviolability of property , assistance to the miserable ! " Yes ,  --  on the first day , and during the whole time that the People was alone and burning with excitement , it was religious ! It was not until after the cooling of this enthusiasm that the materialistic sects , who waited their opportunity afar off , and who now torment the People , dared to offer their sensual symbols , and to set up Capital and Interest , the organization of labor , the increase of wages , and equality of conditions in this human manger , as the sole Divinities ,  --  dared to infuse envy against the happy , the breath of hatred as the only consolation to the hearts of the miserable , lightning vengeance against the wrongs of Providence , imprecations against society , blasphemies against the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , purchased by complete forgetfulness of the moral nature , and enjoyed in a debauch of ideas , and in a deification of matter . This can not last ; the People will not allow themselves to be changed into hogs by the Circes of Atheism . Their souls will flash indignation against their transformers . A day will come when they will see that they are impoverished under the pretext of being enriched ; that , when they are robbed of their souls and of God , both their titles to liberty are stolen from them . Atheism and Republicanism are two words which exclude each other . Absolutism may thrive without a God , for it needs only slaves . Republicanism can not exist without a God , for it must have citizens . And what is it that makes citizens ? Two things ,  --  the sentiment of their rights , and the sentiment of their duties as a republican People . Where are your rights , if you have not a common Father in Heaven ? Where are your duties , if you have not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both these ways to God . XVII . Thus , look at every free People , from the mountains of Helvetia to the forests of America ; see even the free British nation , where the Aristocracy is only the head of liberty , where the Aristocracy and Democracy mutually respect each other , and balance each other by an exchange of kindnesses and services which sanctify society while fortifying it . Atheism has fled before liberty : in proportion as despotism has receded , the divine idea has advanced in the souls of men . Liberty lives by morality . What is morality without a God ? What is a law without a lawgiver ? I know well , and I shall give you the reason hereafter ; I know well , and I mourn to think of it , that , even up to the present time , the French People have been the least religious People in Europe . Is this because the intelligence of France has not that force , and that severity , which are needed to carry long enough and far enough the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ;  --  that idea , as it comes from all the evidences of nature , and all the depths of reflection , being the most powerful and the most grave of human intelligence ,  --  and the intelligence of France being the most superficial , the most light , and the least reflecting of the European races ? Is it because our governments have always been charged with thinking , believing , and praying , for us ? Is it that they have always given us gods of the Court , worship according to Etiquette , and religions of State , instead of letting us form , make , and practise our faith for ourselves , by reason , by free-will , by voluntary piety , by association , by tradition , by the sympathies of the community , of worship , and of the family ? Is it because we are , and always have been , a military People , a nation of soldiers and adventurers , led by kings , heroes , ambitious men , from battle-field to battle-field , making conquests and not keeping them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bearing the manners , vices , bravado , lightness , and impiety of the camp into the homes of the People ? I do not know ; but it is certain that the nation has an immense progress to make in serious thought , if it wishes to maintain its liberty . If we look at the comparative character , in matters of religious sentiment , of the great nations of Europe , America , and even Asia , the advantage is not on our side . While the great men of other nations live and die upon the scene of history , looking towards heaven , our great men seem to live and die in entire forgetfulness of the only idea for which life or death is worth any thing ; they live and die looking at the spectators , or , at most , towards posterity . Thus , even at the present time , while we have had the greatest men , other nations have had the greatest citizens . It is great citizens that a Republic needs ! XVIII . Open the history of America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; read the great lives , the great deaths , the great sufferings , the sublime words , when the ruling passion of life reveals itself in the last moments of the dying ,  --  and compare them ! Washington and Franklin fought , spoke , suffered ; rose and fell , in their political life , from popularity to ingratitude , from glory to bitter scorn of their citizens ,  --  always in the name of God , for whom they acted ; and the liberator of America died , committing to the Divine protection , first , the liberty of his People ,  --  and , afterwards , his own soul to His indulgent judgment . Strafford , dying for the constitution of his country , wrote to Charles I. , to entreat his consent to his punishment , that he might spare trouble to the State : " Put not your trust , " wrote he , after this consent was obtained , " put not your trust in princes , or in the son of man , because salvation is not in them , but from on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped under the windows of his friend , the Bishop of London ; he raised his head towards him , and asked , in a loud voice , the assistance of his prayers in the terrible moment to which he had come . The primate , bowed with age , and bathed in tears , gave , in a stifled voice , his tender benedictions to his unhappy friend , and fell , without consciousness , into the arms of his attendants . Strafford continued his way , sustained by the Divine force , descending from this invocation upon him : he spoke with resignation to the People assembled to see him die . " I fear only one thing , " said he , " and that is , that this effusion of innocent blood is a bad presage for the liberty of my country ! " ( Alas ! why did not the Convention recall these words among us , in ' 93 ? ) Stafford continued :  --  " Now , " said he , " I draw near my end . One blow will make my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants of an affectionate master , and separate me from my dear brother , and my friends . May God be all of these ! " He disrobed himself , and placed his head on the block . " I give thanks , " said he , " to my heavenly Master for helping me to await this blow without fear ; for not permitting me to be cast down for a single instant by terror . I repose my head as willingly on this block as I ever laid it down to sleep . " This is faith in Patriotism ! See Charles I. , in his turn ,  --  that model of a kingly death . At the moment that he was to receive the blow of the axe , the edge of which he had coolly examined and touched , he raised his head , and addressed the clergyman who was present :  --  " Remember ! " said he ; as if he had said , " Remember to advise my sons never to revenge their father ! " Sidney , the young martyr of a patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dream of the freedom of his country . He said to the jailer , " May my blood purify my soul ! I rejoice that I die innocent toward the king , but a victim resigned to the King of Heaven , to whom we owe all life . " The republicans of Cromwell sought only the way of God , even in the blood of battles . Their politics is nothing but faith ; their government , a prayer ; their death , a holy hymn ;  --  they sang , like the Templars , on their funeral-pile . We see , we feel , we hear God , above all , in these revolutions , in these great popular movements , and in the souls of the great citizens of these nations . But recross the Atlantic , traverse the Channel , approach our own time , open our annals ; and listen to the great political actors in the drama of our liberty . It would seem as if God was hidden from the souls of men ; as if his name had never been written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atheistic , while recounting to posterity these annihilations , rather than deaths , of the celebrated men of the greatest years of France . The victims alone have a God ; the tribunes and lictors have none . See Mirabeau on his death-bed . " Crown me with flowers , " said he , " intoxicate me with perfumes , let me die with the sound of delicious music . " Not one word of God , or of his soul ! A sensual philosopher , he asks of death only a supreme sensualism ; he desires to give a last pleasure even to agony . Look at Madam Roland , that strong woman of the Revolution ,  --  upon the car that carries her to death . She looks with scorn upon the stupid People , who kill their prophets and their sibyls . Not one glance to Heaven ; only an exclamation for the earth she leaves :  --  " O , Liberty ! " Approach the prison door of the Girondines : their last night is a banquet , and their last hymn is the Marseillaise ! Follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantry at the tribunal ; one long imprecation on the road to the guillotine ;  --  those are the last thoughts of this dying man , about to appear on high ! Listen to Danton , upon the platform of the scaffold , one step from God and immortality :  --  " I have enjoyed much ; let me go to sleep , " he says ;  --  then , to the executioner , " You will show my head to the People ; it is worth while ! " Annihilation for a confession of faith ; vanity for his last sigh : such is the Frenchman of these latter days ! What do you think of the religious sentiment of a free People , whose great characters seem to walk thus in procession to annihilation ; and die , without even death , that terrible minister , recalling to their minds the fear or the promises of God ? Thus the Republic ,  --  which had no future ,  --  reared by these men , and mere parties , was quickly overthrown in blood . Liberty , achieved by so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conscience to shelter it , a God to avenge it , a People to defend it , against that other Atheism called Glory ! All was finished by a soldier , and by the apostacy of republicans travestied into courtiers ! And what could you expect ? Republican Atheism has no reason to be heroic . If it is terrified , it yields . Would one buy it , it sells itself ; it would be most foolish to sacrifice itself . Who would mourn for it ?  --  the People are ungrateful , and God does not exist . Thus end atheistic revolutions ! XIX . If you wish that this revolution should not have the same end , beware of abject Materialism , degrading Sensualism , gross Socialism , of besotted Communism ; of all these doctrines of flesh and blood , of meat and drink , of hunger and thirst , of wages and traffic , which these corruptors of the soul of the People preach to you , exclusively , as the sole thought , the sole hope , as the only duty , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ease , serfs of your desires . Are you willing to have inscribed on the tomb of our French race , as on that of the Sybarites , this epitaph : " This People ate and drank well , while they browsed upon the earth ? " No ! You desire that History should write thus : " This People worshipped well , served God and humanity well ,  --  in thought , in philosophy , in religion , in literature , in arts , in arms , in labor , in liberty , in their Aristocracies , in their Democracies , in their Monarchies , and their Republics ! This nation was the spiritual laborer , the conqueror of truth ; the disciple of the highest God , in all the ways of civilization ,  --  and , to approach nearer to him , it invented the Republic , that government of duties and of rights , that rule of spiritualism , which finds in ideas its only sovereignty . " Seek God , then . This is your nature and your grandeur . And do not seek Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he is on high ! LAMARTINE , Representative of the People . THE END .
