NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . No . XXYIII ,  --  SEPTEMBER , 1852. - VOL . V. THE JORDAN . MEMOIRS OF THE HOLY LAND . BY JACOB ABBOTT THE RIVER JORDAN . THE River Jordan occupies in some respects a very singular and anomalous position in the thoughts and conceptions of men . Among the countless millions that are now existing within the limits of the Christian world , there are very *ew to whose minds the name of this stream and some mental image of its character are not so familiar as to form as it were part of their very being , and yet this image is dim , shadowy , and undefined , as if it were only a religious emblem that the name denotes , and not an actual and existing reality . Men conceive of the Jordan as a sort of metaphor  --  a type and symbol representing death considered as a separating barrier between this world and heaven ; and they give to it in their imaginations the same dim and shadowy form , as an object of sense , with which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eden , or Bunyan 's City of Destruction . Even men of philosophical and cultivated minds feel the influence of this illusion , and when at last in the course of their journeyings in the East they reach the actual river , they stand bewildered , as it were , upon its banks , as if they had expected to see something more than a common stream flowing quietly over common sands . " Can it be , " says such a visitor , as he looks upon the water , " that of that revered Jordan which my mind has dwelt upon for so many years , and around which so many solemn associations have been gathered , all that is actual and real is before me , in the form of this solitary and unpretending stream * " There is one very remarkable circumstance which marks the character , and has greatly modified the history of the Jordan , and that is its extraordinary inaccessibleness . Lying as it VOL . V.-No. 28. -E K does in the midst of populous nations , and in a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps than any other , the scene and theatre of great historical transactions , and within a very short distance , too , of the Mediterranean sea , whose waters have been in all ages the universal and perpetual thoroughfare of the human race ; the valley through which it flows is still one of the most solitary and inaccessible regions on the globe . With the exception of Africa , the interior of which defies altogether the geographical curiosity of man , there is scarcely any spot on the face of the earth , to which it has been found so difficult and dangerous to penetrate , as the country watered by this extraordinary stream . The curiosity which in all ages has been felt in respect to it , has led many adventurers to desire and to attempt to penetrate to its banks , and follow and explore its windings . These attempts have , however , almost invariably failed . They have been defeated through dangers and difficulties of various kinds , while yet it might have been supposed , from the circumstances of the case , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of success . There was no long distance to be traversed-no physical obstructions to be encountered-no pestilential miasma-no venomous reptiles , or formidable beasts of prey . Still almost all attempts to explore the valley have failed ; and it has remained , down to a very recent period , almost wholly an unknown land . CEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS . In a geological point of view , the Jordan is an extraordinary phenomenon . It is hardly to be considered as an object of nature , but rather as a process . It is something going on  --  a series of effects , produced in a remarkable place , under the influence of a remarkable conjunction of causes , with nothing real or permanent about it but its ceaseless continuance . In a philosophical point of view , the Sea of Tiberias , with all the streams that flow into it , the Jordan with its branches , and the Dead Sea , form one system , and ought to have one name- . They consist of a single series of effects , flowing smoothly and harmoniously from one combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summit and skIes of Mount Lebanon flow through a long and narrow valley toward the south , until they reach the margin of the great rainless region of Asia , where they spread out over the bottom of a deep volcanic valley , lying far below the level of the sea , and forming for // them a vast evaporating basin from which they slowly , through them , with a flow diminished are exhaled again into the atmosphere , warmed I only by the increased breadth and depth of the on the surface above by the beams of a sun J channel . which there is never clouded , and perhaps , by the influence of volcanic heat below . streams which descend from the slopes and ra vines of Mount Lebanon are the sources of sup-1 ply . The waters of Merom and the Lake of Tiberias are the upper and lower reservoirs where the waters are gathered . The Jordan is the grand conduit by which they are conveyed , and the vast evaporating basin where the pro- I cess ends is the Dead Sea . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century after century the same  --  the evaporation at the south being exactly equal to the precipitation at the north as to preserve a perpetual equilibrium . are , it is true , certain oscillations in this t*qi brium , but they are temporary in duration a limited in extent , and are sure to regulate correct themselves . If , for example , for any particular year or season the precipitation of rain or snow upon the mountains is unusually great , so as to increase the flow of water through the valley , and cause an unwonted accumulation in the great reservoir below , the water thus accumulated spreads over a greater surface , and ! evaporation goes on consequently with greate rapidity . The tendency to accumulation is soon stopped , and the surplus water is of ; and as soon as the extraordinary increase of supply is cut off , every thing returns to its original condition . On the other hand , when th' supply is small for a time , the flow diminishes , 1 the water in the reservoir falls , and the evaporating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water comes abundantly , the apparatus adjusts itself to the exigency , and there is a evaporation . When it comes slowly , then , means of an opposite adjustment , it is slow ? , exhaled . Thus by a very curious though apparently accidental result of the conditions of this process , the fluctuations to which it is liable art confined within fixed limits , which it can transcend . The Dead Sea is the third of the depressions which the waters of the Jordan spread over and . fill , in their course along the valley . There are two others , which , occurring near the source of the supply , may be considered as reservoirs . The first of these is very near the mountains . It was called in ancient times the waters of Merom ; the second is the Sea of Galilee . Thes seas are formed by the coming of the water , its descent from the mountains , to broad and deep valleys , so circumscribed and shut in , that I they retain the water which flows into them til @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water within rises to the level of some dspressed point in the boundary where the surplus can flow over and continue its course . These lakes , therefore , though serving as reservoirs , are really only expansions of the river , and , strictly * speaking , form a part of the running stream ; the current of water moving continuously , though VA Li . * c F Til E ios DAN . // GEOGRAPHICAL RELATIONS OF THE JORDAN . The valley of the Jordan lies almost parallel to the shore of the Mediterranean Sea , though nearer to it at its source than at its mouth . At its source it is many hundre* feet above the level of the Mediterranean ; at its mouth , it is many hundred feet below ;  --  the region of country in which the Dead Sea lies teing deeply depressed below the ordinary level of the earth 's surface . The distance from the Mediterranean to the river at its source is about forty miles , and at its mouth about fifty miles . The whole length of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Of course , the distance is considerably greater if the measurement follows the sinuosities of the stream . It is thought possible by some geological philosophers , that in very ancient times the river continued its course to the southward , and emptied into the Red Sea , and that the whole of the depression of the land which forms the bed of the Dead Sea , where the waters are now received and retained , was formed by a subsidence , which occurred at the time of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah . This may have been the case , or it may have been that the Dead Sea was only enlarged , and not originally created , by that catastrophe . That it was either greatly enlarged , or else entirely formed at that period , seems to be shown by an allusion in Genesis xiv 3 , where it is said that certain kings combined themselves at a certain vale , called the Vale of Siddim , which is now the Salt Sea . And the general conformation of the land between the Dead Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite probable , so certain travelers have judged , that the stream may have originally flowed entirely through . A continuous valley extends throughout the whole distance , and along the whole course of it various indications are observed , denoting that it may have been in former ages the bed of a stream . vALLEY OF THE JORDAN . The valley of the Jordan , or , at least , that part of it which lies between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea , is , and has always been fertile and beautiful . Toward the south the valley grows broader and more extended , so as at length to become , as it were , a plain , and the fertile country in this portion of it was probably still more extensive in former days , before the subsidence of the land , than it is now . It is described particularly in the book of Genesis as it appeared to Abraham and Lot , when they came up out of Egypt into Canaan . They traveled slowly with their flocks and herds , as the sheiks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasturage and water , and as on their first entrance into the country they found only limited supplies , the herdsmen of the two chieftains , each party zealous for the interests of their respective masters , fortunately became involved in a quarrel . We say fortunately , for the occurrence gave occasion for that simple but sublime display of forbearance and generosity on the part of Abraham which has stood conspicuously before mankind ever since , as a model for universal imitation , and has had , perhaps , a greater influence in preserving feelings of peace and brotherhood , and extinguishing the rising spirit of selfishness and contention , than all the exhortations on the subject that ever were penned . " Let there be no strife , I pray thee , between me and thee , " said Abraham , " and between my herdmen and thy herdmen ; for we be hrsthren . Is not the whole land before thee Separate thyself , I pray thee , from me : if thou wilt take the left hand , then I will go to the right ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to the left . " To the right hand , in this case , was toward tile Jordan , for as the chieftains were cominmr up from Egypt when these events occurred , they would have the eastern portion of Canaan on the right hand , and the western portion on the left . Lot accepted the offer which Abraham had given him . He lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of the Jordan , that it was well watered every where , even , as the sacred writer describes it , " like the garden of the Lord , " a Hebrew mode of expression meaning simply like a most fruitful and beautiful garden . So Lot chose him the plain of the Jordan , and Abraham turned to the west into the heart of the land of Canaan . It is very interesting to observe how strikingly , from these most remote and earliest periods in the history of the chosen people of God , the grand principles of a lofty spiritual morality , exhibiting themselves in these primitive and elemental forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote but distinct-simple but sublime . How pure and how perfect is the exhibition of self-sacrificing forbearance which is here displayed ; and the simplicity of the circumstances under which it arose  --  a contest among herdsmen in pastoral life , about the grass and the water of a wild country through which they were roaming-operates not only to invest the narrative with a very poetic charm , but gives immense efficiency to it as a moral lesson , by adapting it to the comprehension and appreciation of all mankind . There is scarcely any child so young , any peasant so ignorant , or any savage so brutal and wild , as not to be able to understand fully all the circumstances of the occasion , and to feel the whole force of the moral lesson which the story conveys . THE JORDAN AN EMBLEM . The Jordan formed the eastern boundary of the land of Canaan , and it was the frontier over which the children of Israel passed when they entered upon the promised land , under Joshua 's command , at the close of their long wanderings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that chiefly depend , both the interest which attaches to this stream , in sacred history , and also the peculiar typical signification which has always been so strongly and universally connected with it , in the thoughts and concep .. tions of the whole Christian world . The Jordan is the emblem of death-of death , however , not // qwq region , extended westward from the Jordan a little north of the Dead Sea . He perhaps saw the city of Jericho itself . which was then the first large town which tile Israelites would have to approach after passing the river , as it is now the last that western travelers leave in going to it . Jericho was accordingly greatly cele brated in the history of the Israelitish invasion of Canaan. as the stronghold where the invaders were to have their first serious encounter with the natives of the land ; an ( l it figures quite as conspicu ously in the narratives of modem travelers , as the point where they bid farewell , for a ttme , to the usages and habi. qwq of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Israelites were likely to encounter there . The spies executed their commission in a very bold and very successful manner . They made their way to Jericho , and entered the city . They went to the house of a wotnan named Rahab , and were received and lodged there . Not*vithstanding all their caution , however , it seems that they were observed , and the news spread about the city that two such strangers had come in , and that they were in Rahab 's house . The king sent and denanded them . He supposed that they were emissaries from the camp of the Israelites , for **26;179;TOOLONG THE RETURN OF THE SPIES . qwq sacred writer there relates it , is very valuable to us on account of the information which we incidentally derive from it , in respect to the state of civilization and advancement to which the people of Canaan had attained at this period of the world . There were indeed in those countries at that time many wandering tribes of shepherds and herdsmen , but yet some portion of the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land . Rahab had sheaves of flax upon her house , which had been cultivated , no doubt , in the neighboring fields . The dwellings of the people within the city must have been of a somewhat substantial and permanent character ; for it . was on the top of her house , where the flax had . perhaps been spread out to dry , that Rahab concealed the men . The town , though it consisted , probably , in the main , like towns of a similar size on the Continent of Europe at the present day , of a collection of laborers ' dwellings , grouped together for mutual protection-was defended by a wall , with gates to be shut at night . This wall must have been ; too , a tolerably substantial one , as it was so high as to make it necessary to let the spies down from it by a cord . Even this single word card , as well as the allusion to the scarlet line which Rahab was to bind in the window of her house , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the progress which had been made in arts and manufactures . The whole narrative shows us very conclusively that the Canaanites , at the time when the Israelites entered their land , were by no means savages . They seem , on the contrary , to have made a very considerable advancement in the arts and usages of civilization . THE CROSSING OF THE RIVER . The crossing of the Jordan by the children of Israel under Joshua , at the time of their entering into the promised land , is one of the two most important events connected with the history of the river  --  the preaching of John on the banks of the stream , and his use of its waters for the baptism of his followers . beina the other . The manner THE CROSSING . in which the crossing was effected and the cir cumstances attending it were very striking and extraordinary . On the day before the one fixed upon for the transit , the whole host left the encampment where they had been for several days reposing , and which lay back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks of the stream . The ark-which was the large gild. ed box or chest in which the covenant and th' tables of stone containing the ten commandments were borne-led the march . It was carried , as usual by the priests . The people in foilowing it were required to keep at a considerable distance from it , in order that the whole congregation might have it in view as it descended before them into the valley . Thus the whole host advanced to the borders of the stream , and took up their lodging there for the night , ready to cross the water on the morrow . In all ages of the world it has been found that when a people have made too little progress in the use of letters to avail themselves freely of written language as a means of preserving a record of events that occur , the custom arises of perpetuating the memory of extraordinary transactions by means of monuments and cairns . Joshua , accordingly on this occasion , foreseeing that the crossing of the Jordan which was about to be accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent years , as one of the most important events of their history made arrangements for commemorating it , in this manner . He appointed twelva men , one from each tribe to superintend the work . These men , aided perhaps by a sufficient force of assistants , were to take out from the bed of the river , while the congregation were passing over , twelve stones with which they were to construct a monument on the shore , to commemorate the passage . A similar monument was to . be set up in the middle of the river . When at length the time arrived for the column to be put in motion , the priests , bearing the ark , advanced to the brink of the stream , and as soon // as their feet touched the brink the waters retired , leaving the sands in the bed of the river dry . They advanced thus till they reached the middle of the channel , and here they stationed themselves and remained during the whole time while the immense concourse were passing over-the presence of the ark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a divine and miraculous , influence that attended it , in staying the waters from their usual flow , and keeping the channel open and dry . When all the congregation had safely passed over , Joshua , standing upon the bank , called upon the priests to come up to the land , and when they had done so the water flowed on as before . In the mean time the people of Jericho well aware that they were wholly unable to cope with so immense a throng of invaders , were overwhelmed with terror . They shut themselves up closely within the walls of their city , allowing none to go out and none to come in . Joshua encamped upon the plain , and after remaining there a short time to make certain arrangements , and preparations required by the new circumstances in which he found himself placed , he resumed his march and advanced into the interior , on the road leading to Jericho . BEYOND JORDAN . The Jordan , though a very marked and noted boundary , was not strictly and absolutely the frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possession of Canaan , since two of the tribes and a part of a third had their territory on the eastern side of it . There was a considerable expanse of fertile land on this eastern side of the river as well as on the westernthe whole valley forming as it were on* tract , which the river divided without however essentially separating the parts from each other . This valley became subsequently the scene of many of the incidents and events which occurred in the progress of sacred history , and it is continually alluded to in the narratives of the sacred writers . The region beyond Jordan , was a part of the national domain , and yet it was in some sense out of the way . It was easily enough accessible to enable fugitives to escape to it , and yet the river formed a species of barrier which in some sense impeded pursuit . Thus in the various periods of excitement and commotion which occurred from time to time , going over the Jordan was an occurrence on which the point and interest of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their attempts to escape from or to pursue their enemies , and generally too at the same place-that is opposite to Jericho-where the first great transit had been made in the days of Joshua . DAVID AND ABsALOM . One of the most striking of the cases which exemplify this is the case of David and Absalom . When the rebellion of Absalom broke out , David , though he had shown the most dauntless and indomitable courage in facing every other species of enemy , found that his heart failed him when the question was one of waging war against his indulged and dearly beloved son ; and notwithstanding all the efforts made by his counselors and friends to induce him to remain at his post , he resolved to abandon the city and fly . In his flight he took the road which led through Jericho toward the Jordan . Before leaving the city , however , he arranged a secret channel of intelligence by means of which he might receive information of what should take place after his departure , and of the plans and measures which Absalom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Hushaiat Jerusalem , with a charge to ascertain tke designs and intentions of Absalom , and to send him word secretly , if any thing important should occur . Hushai was to communicate whatever intelligence he might have for David , to two of the priests , Zadoc and Abiathar , who had been left with him ; these priests were to send the tidings to David by means of their sons , and in order to avoid the suspicion which might be awakened , on the part of the officers of Absalom , at seeing these young men attempting to leave the city , and the danger that they might be stopped at the gates , when departing with their message , they were sent forward beforehand to a place called En-rogel where they concealed themselves , and remained in readiness to receive any communication for David which their fathers might receive from Hushai and send out to them . Things being thus arranged , Absalom arrived and took possession of Jerusalem . After some consultation and debate with his various counselors , the unnatural and undutiful son determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his father , as if he were not satisfied with depriving his parent of his throne and his power , but must hunt him also for his life . Perhaps , however , it is wrong to characterize this conduct as unnatural , for there seems to be scarcely any connection of cause and effect in the workings of human imature more inevitable and sure , than that a child spoiled by indulgence , shall in the end return the mistaken affection of his father or mother with the most remorseless ingratitude . It always has been so , and it will probably never be otherwise . As soon as Hushai had ascertained the plans which Absalom had formed , he communicated the intelligence to the priests , and they sent out word to their sons , in their concealment at Enrogel . The messenger whom they employed for this purpose was a young woman of a humbh* class , one , who on passing out.through the gate , would be little likely to be suspected of having charge of an errand to the king . This woman succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She did not , however , accomplish her purpose without being observed . A certain lad , being attracted by something strange and unusual in her demeanor , watched her , without being himself observed . He saw her communicafing in secret with Jonathan and Ahimaaz , and then he saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz steal secretly aw uy from the place . and proceed in the direction which David had // taken in his flight . The lad immediately returned to the city and communicated to Ab*iom what he had observed . Absalom at once dis ) atched messengers with orders to overtake and seize Jonathan and Ahimaaz , and bring them to him . Thus an aged father exiled from home , and in the extremity of terror and distress , is not to be allowed even the slight relief and help which a warning of his danger might afford him His servants remained faithful and true to him , and were ready to hazard their lives to aid him in his peril , but the poor boon which they would grant him is to be struck down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notwithstanding the eagerness , howe*er , with which Absalom sent off his messengers to intercept Jonathan and Ahimaaz , the young men succeeded in evading them , and in reaching the camp of David . They were at one time in very imninent danger , for the pursuers were close upon them , and they escaped by descending into a THE WELL . well , at the house of a woman where they went to seek refuge , the woman covering the well over after they went down , in such a way as to conceal the opening entirely from view . The pursuers came to this house , inquired for the young men , and sought for them every where , but could not find them , and so went away . Jonathan and Ahimaaz then came forth from their retreat , and proceeded on their journey . They came to the camp of David , and warned him of his danger . Absalom was preparing to march against him , they said , at the head of a very great force , and they urged him to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David resolved to do so . It was night when he received this message , but he immediately put the people in motion and began to cross the river . The number of people under his command was very large , consisting not merely of the portion of the army that adhered to him , but of thousands of men , women , and children from Jerusalem , who had been terrified at the approach of Absalom , and had desired to accompany the king in his flight . It was now in the darkness of the night , and under the deepest excitement of distress and alarm , that this vast and miscellaneous multitude were to be conducted through the fords of the river . The scene was one of continued terror and confusion . The masses of people pressed forward into the dark waters , afraid to encounter the perils before them , but still more afraid of the danger that impended from behind . The strong assisted the weak : rough soldiers sustained and encouraged the helpless women and children , while captains and guides , appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or held torches , along the line of the bank to guide the footsteps of the multitude in ascending from the river to the shore . The transit was at length accomplished , and before the morning light appeared , every one of the vast company had safely passed over . The immediate danger was thus passed , and yet though the river was now between these wretched fugitives and their foes , their situation was still forlorn and hopeless . They had left Jerusalem so suddenly and in such confusion , that they had taken with them no supplies , and now they were far from home , in a remote and almost unknown district , and wholly destitute and helpless . The people of the country , however , immediately came to their relief . - They brought them supplies of food and clothing . Thus strangers and foreigners came to pity and save the aged father flying before the remorseless and deadly hostility of his son . They brought beds to spread upon the EN-HOG EL . // ground for the women and the children-and wheat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honey , and butter for food  --  and bowls , and earthen vessels , and other such equipage required in a camp . David in the mean time had withdrawn from the bank of the river , and retired into the interior of the country , to a place called Mahanaim , where he established his quarters , and began to prepare for defense . Here he soon learned that Absalom had himself crossed the river , and was coming on at the head of a great force to attack him . David drew out his forces , marshaled them in battle array , and sent them forward under the command of his generals to meet the army of Absalom . True , however , to his parental instincts to the last , he gave as his final charge to the generals in command , as they were about to move forward , to be sure and do no hann to Absalom . " Deal gently , " said he , " for my sake , with the young man Absalom . " We can not follow this story to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miserable end , and David , though he was saved from the absolute ruin which had threatened him , had to drink to the dregs the bitter cup which so surely comes in the end to the lips of the fathers and mothers , who allow themselves , through a spirit of fond and foolish indulgence , to be governed by their children . One would suppose that children spoiled by indulgence , however unscrupulous and reckless they might subsequently become in respect to the rights and happiness of others , would always be restrained from any acts of unkindness or ill-will against their parents , from a feeling of gratitude for the affection , mistaken though it was , by which the indulgence was prompted . But the revorse is the case . The heart which furnished the fatal warmth that developed the viper within them , is always the first that they turn against and sting . PRINCIPAL ROAD TO THE JORDAN . The place where David crossed the river in flying before Absalom , must have been near tIle spot where the children of Israel crossed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Jerusalem to the river passed through Jericho , and it was opposite to Jericho that the fords were situated where the Israelites came over . In fact this portion of the river was much more directly accessible than any other , and it is consequently to this portion that almost all the allusions to the stream , that are made in the sacred history , refer . It was here in subsequent times , as we shall presently see , that John assembled his congregations and baptized his converts , and it is here , at the present day , that travelers and pilgrims , journeying from Jerusalem through Jericho , come down to the river . The long and narrow valley through which its waters tlow , between the Sea of Galilee and the plain of Jericho , was the scene of very few of the events recorded in the sacred narrative , and is very seldom visited by travelers at the present day . The country is now occupied by various tribes of Arabs , some stationary , others wandering , who look upon all foreign visitors as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their wild domains by every species of hostility . LYNCH 'S EXPEDITION . Notwithstanding these difficulties , however , adventurous travelers have in all ages been found disposed to make attempts , more or less determined , to explore this secluded region . The most important , and far the most successful of these attempts , was one made in the year 1847 , by Lieutenant Lynch , an officer in the navy of the United States , who entered the Jordan at the Sea of Galilee , with three boats and a company of ten American seamen , and passed down through the whole course of the river to the Dead Sea . He afterward made a very thorough and careful exploration of that sea . It is however only with his adventures on the Jordan that we have now particularly to do . Lieutenant Lynch proposed his plan to the proper department at Washington , and after a time received an order to undertake it . He was to be sent out to the Mediterranean in command of a store-ship , laden with supplies for the Mediterranean squadron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his expedition on board this store-ship . On arriving upon the coast of Syria he was to leave the ship , and proceed across the country with his boats and men to the Sea of Galilee , and there commence his voyage . THE PREPARATIONS . Lieutenant Lynch having received his orders immediately commenced making the necessary preparations for his enterprise . He provided two metallic boats , one of copper and one of iron  --  and both constructed on the principle of the life-boats of Mr. Francis. * These metallic boats being lighter than those of the same burden made of wood , could be transported more easily , it was thought , across the country ; and besides it was expected that they would be better able to resist the shocks and collisions to which they might be exposed in descending the rapids and cataracts of the river . A wooden boat , in striking a rock , is oftentimes split and splintered , or otherwise hopelessly damaged , where an iron or a copper boat would only receive an indentation which would do it no injury other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cases where a hole is made , the opening in. the case of a metallic boat , is merely a protrusion which can often be closed again by blow . upon the inside , with a hammer . Ten skillful and able-bodied seamen were selected for the enterprise , all of whom pledged themselves to abstain entirely from all intoxicating drinks during the course of the expedition . This pledge they faithfully fulfilled , and it was to their being thus saved from the deleterious influences of the insidious poisbn , that Lieutenant Lynch attributed the remarkable powers of endurance which * For a full account of these boats , *and the mode of their constri. cion , see the article on Franciss Life Boats , in the numbec of this Magazine for July , 1851. // they afterward evinced under the toils , privations , and hardships to which they were exposed . Besides these seamen there were several other peruons attached to the expedition , in various capacities , making the whole number seventeen . The boats were so constructed that they could be separated into parts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs of beasts of burden , should it be found impossible to convey them in any other way It was hoped , however , that they might be drawn over thc land entire , and sets of trucks were provided for the purpose of conveying them . In order , nevertheless , to be prepared for either mode , whichever might seem most expedient on the arrival of the party upon the coast , one of the men chosen was a mechanic , and the necessary tools were provided for taking the boats to pieces and putting them together again , in case it should be found necessary so to do . This man was also instructed in the art of blasting rocks , as it was possible that some case might occur in which it might be necessary , in order to open a way for the passage of the boats , to remove some small obstruction by gunpowder . All the necessary arms , instruments and stores required for such an expedition were carefully provided . The arms were one large blunderbuss , fourteen carbines with long bayonets attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolvers , and ten of them had bowie knives attached to them . Each officer was armed with a sword , and all , officers and men , were furnished with belts which contained a supply of ammunition . A small but yet complete collection of mathematical instruments was procured , sufficient for making all necessary measurements and observations , and an abundant camp equipage , consisting of tents , flags , cooking utensils , preserved meats-together with a proper supply of oars , sails , ropes , and every other article which there was any probability that they might require , were all carefully provided , and securely stowed on board the ship which was to convey the party from their native shores to the coast of Palestine . The scene of all these preparations , and the point from which the expedition finally set sail , was the Navy Yard at Brooklyn , New York . THE TURKISH FIRMAN . The first thing to be done by the expedition on reaching their port in Syria , was to obtain the sanction of the government of the country to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition as this , consisting as it did of an armed force in the service of a foreign power , should leave their ships , to make an incursion into any territory whatever , without previously receiving permission so to do from the constituted authorities . Besides , independently of the question of propriety , it was very important to obtain the consent of the government as a measure of precaution and safety , for although the party were expecting to rely mainly on themselves for the means of defense against the hostility of the natives along the shores of the river , it is clear that the danger of collision with them would be very much diminished by a firman from the government , enjoining upon the inhabitants to allow the travelers to pass on in safety . Accordingly Lieut . Lynch , immediately on his arrival at Smyrua , his port of destination , proceeded at once to Csnstantinople , and there , with the usual forms and ceremonies made known his wishes to the sultan , and requested the passport .

On receiving the firman , Mr. Ly*ch immediately left Constantinople , and turned toward the south . After various proceedings and adventures which can not be here particularly detailed , his vessel , with all his party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of the expedition on board , arrived off the town of Haifa , which lies on the southern side of the Bay of Acre , and at the foot of Mt . Carmel . The town of Acre , which stands at the northern extremity of the bay , was to be the point of departure of the expedition in crossing the country to the sea of Galilee , but it was necessary to land at Haifa , and then proceed to Acre , along the shore , as the only favorable anchorage ground is on that side of the bay . Acre was itself formerly the port , but the water has become so shallow there , in consequence of the drifting in of the sands , that vessels coming upon the coast now generally make their harbor at Haifa ; though Acre is still the capital of the Pachalik , and in all respects the most important town. * At the time of the arrival of the vessel the surf was rolling in so heavily upon the beach as to make it dangerous to attempt to land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore , and accompanied by one or two attendants he undertook the task . He came very near perishing in the attempt , and was only saved by the interposition of some of the natives , who perceiving the danger came down and rescued him * For the situation of these places , and of the beach on which the party landed , see the map in the number of this Magazine for August , page 291. // qwq the mouths of two rivers to cross , the Kishon and the Belus , there were no other obstructions , and thus , partly by water and partly by land , the expedition , and the multifarious effects belonging to it , were finally conveyed to a new rendezvous under the walls of Acre . From their encampment there , the party saw , though not without some sad forebodings , the vessel which had brought them to the coast , hoist her sails and slowly recede from the shore , until at length she disappeared from view in the western horizon . Acre is a much larger and more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor of qwq The place which had been determined upon as the point of embarkation for the boats was the to ) vn of Tiberias , which is situated on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee . In fact , this sheet of water is often called the Lake of Tiberias , on account of its having upon its shores this large and important town . For a similar reason it is sometimes called the Lake of Geneseret , the town of Geneseret being situated at the northern extremity of the lake , near where the upper Jordan empties into it . It is somewhat unfortunate for this sea that it has such a nmltiplicity of names , since the want of any certain and uniform mode of designating it leads to a great deal of confusion . The town of Tiberias occupies a very picture*que and commanding position on the shore of the lake . Our party reached it with their boats and all their baggage , in safety , after a journey of three days in crossing the country from Acre . They remained several days at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some considerable time being required at this their ultimate point of departure , for their final preparations . Stores of provisions were to be procured and laid in , the instruments were all to be examined and rectified , and many inquiries were to he made , in reference to the geography of the country through which they were going to pass , the character and dispositions of the natives , and the course and navigation of the river . In the course of these preparations Mr. Lynch made quite an important addition to his flotilla by the purchase of a large wooden boat which he found at Tiberias. and which he thought might he of service to the expedition as a boat of burden . The names of the metallic boats which he had brought with him were the Fanny Mason and the Fanny Skinner . They were named from two young ladies of Washington , the daughters respectively of Mr. Secretary Mason , and of Commodore Skinner . The wooden boat bought at Tiberias was named the Uncle Sam . Th5cOURAGEMENT5 . Up to this time , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final embarkation , Mr. Lynch was continually receiving intelligence , information , and advice* of the most discouraging and disheartening character . Stories were told him of previous undertakings of a somewhat similar characterwhich had terminated most disastrously . Some travelers had been shot THE CARAVAN . // by the Arabs in going down the river-others had died of fevers taken on the low lands throut*h which they passed , or on the shores of the Dead Sea . The river was so rapid , and so obstructed by cataracts and cascades , that it would be impossible that boats of the size which the expedition had provided could navigate it ; so that even if the party were to escape the consequences to be feared from the hostility of the natives , they were sure to be overturned in the rapids , or dashed upon the rocks , and all inevitably drowned . To guard against the possibility that the boats might find it impracticable to navigate the river , Mr. Lynch intended that a detachment of his party should proceed by land along the bank , with camels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of danger , or to receive them entirely into their caravan in case it should be found necessary to abandon the river . But the owners of the camels that had been employed in drawing the boats from Acre were not willing to hazard their animals in a journey through so lawless a country as that of the Jordan , and some difficulty and delay was experienced in procuring others to take their places . In fact such was the estimation in which the wild and desperate spirit of the natives of the country was held , that when at Acre Mr. Lynch stated to an Arab chieftain that he was going to attempt the passage of the Jordan from the Sea of Galilee down through the valley , the chieftain replied that it was madness to attempt such an undertaking with such a force . " Why , the Bedouins of the Ghor , " said he , " will eat you all up The Ghor is the Arab name for the valley of the Jordan . THE EMBARKATION . Notwithstanding these disecturagements the preparations were pushed diligently forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April the expedition embarked . It had been previously organized in two parties , the land and the water party  --  a regular concert of action having been arranged between the two divisions and precise orders given to all the various officers in charge , with instructions adapted to every emergency which was at all likely to occur . The several officers who went in the boats had each his separate duty to perform . One was to take topographical sketches of the shores of the river as he passed alorvr ; another was to make geological observations and collect specimens ; a third was to note and record the incidents which should occur on the route ; while a fourth had charge of the herbarium , and was to make collections of plants and floweis . The land party was under the charge of Lieutenant Dale . It consisted of a large number of persons , many of whom were Arabs that had been employed to accompany the expedition . There were eleven camels , and thirty horsemen in the train . The land party were instructed to keep as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit . It was not , however , expected that they would be at all times in sight of the river , and a signal was accordingly agreed upon by which they were to be summoned to the boats in case of any emergency or danger requiring their aid . This signal consisted of two musket shots fired in quick succession . Any single report , such as might be expected to be heard from time to time , from shots aimed at wild animals , or nals made to communicate intelligence from one boat to another , they were not to regard . Every thing being thus arranged both divisions of the expedition took their depa*rture from Tiberias on the morning of the appointed day . The sun was bright , the air was balmy , the fields were green , and the calm and unruffled water on the lake reflected from its polished surface the green slopes of fertile hills around the shores , and in the centre the beautiful and unbroken blue of the vault of heaven . The long caravan , defiling from the gate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little distance , and then gradually turning inland was soon lost among the hills , while the boats , following each other in a line , and all heavily laden , glided smoothly along their way over the surface of the lake , toward the outlet of the Jordan . THE NAvIGATION . The expedition were occupied about eight days in passing down the river from the lake to the Dead Sea . The distance in a direct line is but about sixty miles , though the river is so tortuous and meandering in its course , that the voyage made by the boats was lengthened to more than two hundred miles , by the sinuosities of the stream . The difficulties which the party found they had to encounter in the navigation of the river were far greater even than they had anticipated , although those which proceeded front the savage character and hostile dispositions of the inhabitants were very much less . In fact , the Arabs on the banks did very little to molest the voyagers , while the cascades and cataracts of the stream seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current was generally indeed of a moderate rapidity , and the water deep and smoQth ; and in these cases the progress of the boats was safe and easy . But after a brief interval of this kind of navigation , the current of the river would gradually become more and more rapid , and am length , s*veeping round some majestic curve , the foremost boat would enter a wild ravine , where the adventurous navigators would see the whole surface of the water from bank to bank white with glancing foam ; and hear , coming up from below , through the gorge into which the river was pouring , the . sound of a roaring cataract , warning them of the approaching danger . In such cases the crews would strive with all their strength to guide the boats into the swiftest water . For in such cases the swiftest current always indicated the deepest channel ; and thus , as often happens , the only hope of safety lay in the most bold advance into the midst of the danger . In the swiftest of these cascades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to keel ) them in the channel , and in such cases , at a command from the officer , the crews would leap // qwq The metallic boats , it was found , endured the thumps and contusions which they received , with very little damage ; but the wooden boat , though heavy and strong , was found wholly incapable of sustaining such service . She became so much bruised and battered by the first two days ' voyage , as to make it evident that it would not be pos ( sible to keep her long afloat , and - accordingly on the morning of the third day she was abandoned . HARnsHIPs . Of course in such a service a this the whole company , both officers and men , endured every conceivable degree of hardship and exposure . The men were sometimes compelled to work for four or five hours immersed to their waists in water , and engaged all the time in lifting , pushing , pull- - in other similar toils , reLhe almost incessant exertion of their utmost strength . Sometimes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the shore , and then , after floating the empty boats down the rapids , they would transport the heavy packages on their backs along the rocky strand to some new point of embarkation below . In one or two cases they were THE CASCADES. obliged to leave the river altoswept do qwq for and guarded against , continual exertion at the oars was required to keep the boats in the centre of the channel , and in a position parallel with the direction of the current , and sudden and unexpected occurrences arose from time to time , bringing new and wholly unlooked-for dangers . At one time , for example , after having just cleared a dangerous rapid , and got , as they imagined , beyond the danger , they were carried rapidly round a curve of the river under a mass of low , overhanging branches , which lay so close to the water , that they threatened to sweep the men out of the boats , as they were whirled swiftly along beneakh them . ment in such cases presented a very exciting and animating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level spot on the bank of the river , sheltered if possible by a wood , and easily accessible both from the water and the land . Here for an hour there was presented a very picturesque and busy scene . Some of the men were employed in mooring the boats on the shore , and in mounting the blunderbuss for their protection . Others were engaged in raising the numerous tents , and driving the tent pins into the ground to secure them , while the wearied camels stood patiently by , waiting to be disbur dened . On some neighboring elevation , recon ENCAMPIN qwq were pitched the baggage was collected , and piled securely in the centre of the inclosure which they formed , and then supper was prepared . After supper the sentinels were posted , the bustle and movement gradually subsided , and the whole encampment became a scene of silence and repose . THE SCENERY . The general scenery of the country , as it presented itself to the party in their journeyings through the valley , was beautiful , though somewhat solitary and wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , the river being bordered with broad and fertile fields , sometimes wooded , and sometimes under a rude and simple cultivation , with ranges of mountains bounding the view beyond . The party in the boats passed many ruined bridges and mills , and sometimes their attention was attracted by the sites of ancient villages on the banks of the stream , where apparently thriving towns had once existed , but which were now the seats of dilapidation and decay . They saw very few of the natives of the country , and were only twice Tha EMCAMPMENT. // alarmed by any apprehension of danger from them . Sometimes they saw parties of Arabs encamped in the interior , and in a few instances they went to visit them in their encampments . The people were generally found to be peaceable and well disposed , though full of curiosity in respect to every thing pertaining to their strange visitors . They lived in black tents , made of a sort of coarse cloth , woven from goat 's or camel 's hair , and had their horses tethered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Bedouin or wandering Arabs . There were others who lived in rude villages which were composed of tents of the simplest and most primitive construction . At one time the expedition passed such a village on the bank of the river , and as the boats glided rapidly by , the whole population of the place , men , women , and children , came running down the bank together , gazing at the unwonted spectacle , and uttering loud and discordant cries of curiosity and wonder . These scenes , however , of life and activity were exceptions to the general silence and solitude which reigned throughout the valley . Often for miles no human habitation was seen , nor any indication whatever of the existence or agency of man . In such cases the boats glided along , in passing over the dark and still waters that intervened between one cascade or rapid to another , through scenes of rural loveliness , which would have been simply picturesque and beautiful had not the remoteness , the silence , and the solitude made them sublime . The stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosses , or festooned with climbing plants , overhung the banks , and waved their dark and luxuriant foliage over the stream . Flowers bloomed on the shore , and long grass waved in the margin of the water , while birds among the branches , of strange and unknown form and plumage , sang in mouruful notes , as if lamenting the solitude . THE PILGRIM5 ' FORD . At length on the seventh day after entering the river at the Sea of Galilee , the expedition arrived safely at what is called the Pilgrims ' Ford , which is so near to the mouth of the Jordan , that it may properly be considered as the termination of the voyage on the river . The Pilgrims ' Ford is situated at the point where the road from Jericho comes down to the river ? and it must of course be near the place where the children of Israel effected their passage under the command of Joshua , and where David and his company crossed when pursued by Absalom . The place is now called the Pilgrims ' Ford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the river at this spot , to bathe in the sacred waters . They come to this point because it is here that occurred the most interesting events of sacred history that were connected with the river . This too is almost the only spot that occurs throughout the whole of the long and meandering course of the stream , where its banks can be safely and easily reached ; though it is probable that the irrepressi ble spirit of devotion and zeal which impels such multitudes of pilgrims to journey to the river . would have led them to brave any dangers , Lnd encounter any difficulties in making their way to the spot at which they supposed the events that awakened their veneration occurred , wherever it might have been . Of these events the one which chiefly inspires the feelings of solemn awe which the approach to the river awakens , is the baptism of Jesus Christ in its waters , by John . PILCRIMS . It would seem probable from the sacred narrative that it must have been near the mouth of the Jordan , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this supposition the most ancient traditions confirm ; as the place which has been for many centuries regarded as the scene of the Baptist 's ministry , is at the ford where the road from Jericho comes down to the stream . Even the exact spot where Jesus stood when he was baptized , is pointed out to the pilgrims , and they place entire confidence in the truth of the tradition . The pilgrims come to visit this spot , in one great annual caravan , which leaves Jerusalem for this purpose in April . under a proper escort , and taking the road by Jericho they proceed in an apparently endless train to the banks of the river . Here as soon as they reach the banks they all rush down into the stream , in a state of the wildest excitement , to immerse themselves in the sacred water-the young and the old , the rich and the poor , the sick and the well , the strong and the feeble , together . When the first paroxysm of excitement is over , they proceed to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some cut stems of the young trees which grow upon the banks-willows or palms  --  and form staves of them . Some dip up the water , and fill small bottles of leather or of tin , with it , to carry away . Others have brought cloths , which they dip into the stream , and then reverently fold them up and bear them home , to be preserved and used finally as shrouds to wrap their bodies in when they die . Even European and American travelers who visit the spot , in the train of the pilgrims ' caravan , and who have no such superstitious veneration for the water , still generally take a portion of it with them when they return . to preserve as a souvenir of their visit , or to be used in the baptisms of children in their nativ land . The party of Mr. Lynch arrived at the ford . and encamped there the day before the pilgrims were to arrive . At three o'clock on the following moruing , the whole camp was aroused frow its repose by the intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste , and issuing from their tents , they beheld an immense number of torch-lights , with a dark moving mass beneath them , slowly advancing over the brow of a hill . Mr. Lynch began to fear that his camp would be overwhelmed and swept away , as it were , by this coming inundation and he accordingly ordered the tents to be struck // and all the baggage and effects to be moved back , out of the way . He then directed his Arab allies to mount their horses , arm themselves with their long spears , and taking their position in tront of the baggage , to form a sort of military cordon , for its protection . At the same time , he ordered the boats to be launched from the shore , and stationed on the opposite side of the river , a little below the place where the pilgrims were to enter the waters . These arrangements had scarcely been effected before the crowd of pilgrims came on-men , women , and childrenmounted on donkeys , horses , camels , and mules , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . This was , however , only the advanced portion of the great throng . It was not until two hours afterward that the main body arrived . As fast as the several parties came to the brink , they dismounted , and pressed forward into the water , singing , calling , and shouting , in paroxysms of the wildest excitement and enthusiasm . They were of all languages and nations , having been gathered from Europe , from Asia , from Africa , and even from America : and they exhibited every possible variety of dress and demeanor . They were of all ranks and conditions , and of every age ; young children having been brought with their mothers , suspended in baskets or panniers from the backs of camels or mules . As they came down to the brink they removed their outer robes , and then rushed eagerly down the bank into the water . Some of them had dresses made for the purpose , consisting of a white robe , with a black cross upon it . Others went in clothed in a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dipped by others , three times in the sacred stream , and then came up to the dry land again , and the ceremony was ended . So great is the eagerness of the pilgrims to rush into the river on these occasions , that many instances have occurred of their being swept away by the current and drowned-for although the place is called a ford , still in an ordinary state of the river the water in the mid-channel is very deep , and the current very rapid . It was partly with a view to guard against accidents of this kind on this occasion , that Mr. Lynch sent his boats out into the stream , when he found that the pilgrims were coming . The foremost of the pilgrims in entering the water were surprised to see the boats , and they called out to the boatmen , saying that that was a sacred place , and that the boats must not remain there . When it was explained to them , however , that the object of the arrangement was to render assistance to the pilgrims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required , they seemed very thankful for the intended kindness and allowed the boats to remain . In an hour from the time when the great body of the pilgrims arrived , they began to return ; and in three hours all were gone , leaving no vestige behind them ; so rapidly did the great pageant disappear . VOL . V-No. 28. -F , THE MOUTH OF THE MIvER . From the Fords to the mouth of the river , the distance is but a few miles . The banks here are low , the country is flat and level , and is covered with canes , willows , sedges , and tall grass , presenting a spectacle of dreary solitude and desolation . Strange varieties of wild fowl inhabit these thickets , and shoals and sand-banks , formed by the deposits of the river , disfigure the stream . whose sluggish current moves more and more slowly as its waters approach the dismal lake , where , like man descending to the grave , they are to repose for a time , and then ascend into the heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlet , they become impregnated with the salt and acrid solutions of the sea . In fact , the whole region into which they now are entering , seems filled with volcanic products , and saturated with salts . Indeed , there are , in some places , broad tracts of clayey and sandy alluvion , so strongly charged with these deadly impregnations that no plant will grow upon them , and the dreary monotony of their surface is only varied by the inflorescences and incrustations which remain in the shallow depressions where pools of water have stood , and have been dried up by the sun . It was here , as it is sup . posed , that the brass castings were made by King Hiram for the Temple of Solomon , as described in 1 Kings vii . 45 , 46 : " And all these vessels which Hiram made to King Solomon for the house of the Lord were of bright brass . In thi plain of Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. " he a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through scenes of verdure and beauty , which its fertilizing influences create , and which its graceful meanderings adorn . comes to an end at last in a gloomy region of desolation and death . Its waters rise from elevated fountains and springs that are fed by the snows and glaciers of mountain summits . They are lost , at last , in a deep volcanic valley , arid and desolate , and almost wholly inaccessible to man CHANCES . Such is the River Jordan as it now appears . How far the stream itself , and the country on its banks , may have undergone change during the twenty or thirty centuries which have elapsed since the Scripture narratives were written , it is now impossible to say . Various causes are constantly in operation to produce modifications in the physical structure of the globe , and the beds of rivers are not exempt from the general liability to change . Not only the course of a stream . but the depth and rapidity of the current may vary , through the operation of causes acting so slowly that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation , while yeL they produce very important results in the course of a thousand years . In the first place , the direction of the meanderings of a river which flows , like the Jordan , through an alluvial valley , is constantly changing . In all the concave portions of the shore the current of course sets // against the hank , arid the earth which forms the bank being thus undermined , caves in , and is carried down the stream by the impulse of the water . This alluvion is then deposited in portions on all the convex portions of the bank below , and thus forms new land , which rises higher and higher by fresh depositions , made especially in times of flood , until it reaches the level of the surrounding plain ; and , at length , after the lapse of many years , the changes in the bed of the stream bring the newry-formed bank into the concave form , when it is undermined and carried away again , and then again deposited under the shelter of salient points still farther down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes going on ; each successive portion of the alluvial plain through which the river winds its way being destroyed and reproduced again in endless alternation . This process in a great river like the Mississippi is so slow , that great forests grow upon the new-made land before its time comes for being undermined . The tre " * of these forests of course are carried down wit*. the earth on which they grow , and it is these trccs Which form the snags and sawyers by which the navigation of that mighty stream is so much impeded . Even the rapidity of the current of a river , and the quantity of water which is contained in its bed , may change very essentially in the course of centuries . It has been recently found that various portion* of the earth 's surface are subject to slow motions , either of rising or sinking - motions which are wholly inappreciable while they are taking place , but which , after a long lapse of time , produce important results . It is difficult to detect , and still more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders of the sea ; for it is only there that there is at hand a ready and sure standard of comparison . There is , however , no doubt that these slow movements of elevation and depression are all the time going on in various jarts of the earth , especially in volcanic countries . They result from deep-seated causes , the nature of which is not known ; but they are slowly working out a very extensive , and , perhaps , ultimately , a total alteration in the altitudes of continents , the rapidity of rivers , and in the configuration of ocean shures . From these , or from some other causes , the accounts which ancient writers give of the rivers of their time , do not accord at all with the appearance and the character of the streams at the present day . We might have ex 1 ) ected that this would have been the case with the Jordan ; as its bed , and especially the sea into which it empties , lie in a volcanic region , known to be peculiarly subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact not to be so , as the narratives of the sacred writers , referring to the river , and the descriptions which they give of it , apply with remarkable exactness to the present condition of the stream . souacss OF THE JORDAN . A great interest has been felt in all ages in respect to the source of the Jordan , and the fountain , which in former times was considered as entitled to the honor of originating this sacred stream , is a very remarkable and a very copious spring , which issues from a cavern in the face of a precipice of rocks , at a place called Banias , situated on the southern slopes of Mt . Lebanon , about forty miles north of the Sea of Galilee . At some distance farther up the mountain , however , in a green and secluded dell , there is a very remarkable pond , circular in its form , and filled with clear and pellucid water . It has been known from the earliest times by the name of Phiala , or The Bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ; adition , that the fountain at Banias is supplied from this little lake , as its reservoir . Josephus says , that to prove the fact some curious explorers of the locality put chaff into the lake , and then watching below they saw it come out at the fountain . In recent times another stream has been explored , which originates at a point far higher up the mountain , and descending through a long ravine , it joins the Jordan below Banias , and brings a greater supply of water than that whieji comes from the cavern fountains . The desire which geographers and travelers have , in all ages , felt to ascertain the true and original sources of the river , has led to a great deal of curious investigation and research . The nature and the results of these inquiries we shall see in detail , when we come to explore the wild and romantic solitudes of Mt . Lebanon . // TUNIS . AT Smyrna I was fortunate enough to hear of a Greek brigantine about to sail for Tunis . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undertake so unwonted a voyage ; nor did they ask why I wished to follow a route so unusual . It was voted in solemn council that I should have the occupancy of the little cabin in consideration of the payment of certain piastres , which went to swell the common fund ; for the vessel was a joint-stock affair , and all on board had a share , in the venture . The Scamandre , in accordance with the wont of the Greek Rayahs , sailed under a foreign flag ; she bore at her peak the French tricolor , though I doubt if the whole crew could have mustered a score of French words among them . Sokr*t6 , the captain , was a little , oily , goodhumored Smyrniote , whose chief occupation on board seemed to be the concoction of the soups and pilaffs , which were nominally under the superintendence of Nicolao , the cook , a superblooking Hydriote , with a magnificent mustache , dressed in snowy kilt , and scarlet leggings , with a shawl girdle round his waist , from which peeped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very embodiment of a boarding-school Miss 's ideal of one of those fascinating corsairs who used to cruise among the islands of the Archipelago . But that is all changed now ; and the picturesque Greek pirates of other days have become no less picturesque Greek mariners . Pleasantly we sailed along , winding among , and touching at the Greek islands ; for the Hellenic merchantmen do not hold themselves bound to any very definite course , and a few days , or even weeks , made no special difference to myself . The weather was delightful ; I had plenty of books on board ; and the functions of captain and cook were admirably performed , though not by the personages who bore these titles . It was not long before it was manifest that Sokr*1t6 knew little of navigation , while Nicolao was supremely ignorant of the mysteries of the cuisine ; but as the cook was a capital sailor , after the Greek fashion , and the captain proved to be a Hellenic Ude , we neither sailed nor fared the worse for the interchange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason of the mystery . The officers were appointed by the company , each having a voice in proportion to the amount of his venture ; and Sokr*t4 was the chief capitalist of the concern , while poor Nicolao 's whole wealth was comprised in his fine person and its showy adornments ; but he was , moreover , famed through the Grecian isles for his seamanship . The most important posts on board were those of captain and cook , and when the ballots were counted , it appeared that the prizes had fallen to the shares of capital and skill , the former , as usual , taking the first prize .
