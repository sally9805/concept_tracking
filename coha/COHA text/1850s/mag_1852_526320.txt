txt THE UNITED STATES CONSULAR SYSTEM . THE President , in his Annual Message to Congress in December last , alludes to this subject in connection with his notice of the outrage committed on the property of the Spanish Consul at New-Orleans , during the excitement caused by the execution at the Havana of the prisoners of the Lopez expedition . After stating the deep interest which the United States , with their wide-spread commerce , have in upholding the law of nations in regard to the inviolability and right to personal security of consuls , so long as they are guilty of no infraction of the laws of the country where they reside , he proceeds to say : " The occurrence at New-Orleans has led me to give my attention to the state of our laws in regard to foreign ambassadors , ministers , and consuls . I think the legislation of the country is deficient in not providing sufficiently either for the protection or the punishment of consuls . I therefore recommend the subject to the consideration of Congress ? ' Had the President or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , had leisure to examine thoroughly into the theory and practical operation of our consular system , we have not the slightest doubt that the result of such investigation would have been not merely the suggestion of what at best would prove but a very partial reformation , but an earnest recommendation of a revision of the entire system ; such a revision as would remedy the glaring defectiveness of that now in operation , and place it on as respectable and efficient a footing as the cor responding systems of the great commercial nations of Europe . As this is a subject with which the public in general are not familiar , we shall first state briefly the rank and position which consuls and commercial agents hold under the general law of nations ; and their rights , powers , and privileges under that law , or which are usually conceded to them by international courtesy , apart from express treaty stipulations , which.sometimes materially modifygenerally by enlarging-these attributes and functions . We shall next present a succinct and popular analysis of the powers , duties , responsibilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the present laws of Congress , and " General Instructions " issued from time to time from the State Department . We shall then proceed to show the radical defectiveness of the present system , and the serious practical evils resulting from this cause . And finally , we shall propose , for the consideration and action of Congress , a plan of revision which , by placing the system on a basis ( with some modifications ) similar to that on which are established the respective efficient consular systems of the two great commercial powers of Europe , Great Britain and France , will , if adopted , correct the many evils resulting from its present defectiveness ; and secure , through the agency of the functionaries under it , the fostering and protection of our commercial and political interests , in the various marts of commerce and centres of political action and influence , as effectually // as are those of the European nations we have above mentioned under the operation of theirs , which are better adjusted and more vigorously administered . Fortunately , this is strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way or manner with party politics ; and Congress could not better employ a small portion of its time during the present session , and in some of the intervals of party strife and collision , than by uniting , irrespective of party lines of division , in the business of revision and reformation in the matter in question . Consuls and commercial agents being , by the strict law of nations , mere commercial , and not diplomatic agents  --  the representatives of the commercial interests of the citizens or subjects of the State commissioning them , and not of the State itself , unless by treaty stipulations they are vested with diplomatic powers-are , unlike functionaries of the latter class , subject both to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the country where they reside , in the same manner as are other foreign residents and the subjects of the State itself . But still , not only a degree of consideration , but of official respect , and , in cases of personal emergency , even of leniency , is universally accorded to them , which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , any acts of outrage upon their persons or property are regarded as of far more heinous character than aimilar acts towards other individuals ; and the allowing , by the local government , of any such acts to pass unnoticed , or their perpetrators , if detected , to go unpunished , would be justly regarded by the government appointing them as occasion for serious offense , or even a casus belli , or just cause for declaring war. * While they respect and conform to the local laws , they are , by the consent and public sense of all civilized na * In a country composed of independent State local jurisdictions , like ours , a statute of the general government over the whole is peculiarly needed to protect the persons and property of foreign consuls resident within such local jurisdictions of the different States . We believe there is noprovision of the kind now existing on the national statute book ; and therefore the President 's recommendation on this partieular point meets the exigency of the case , and is timely and peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be toospeedily carried into practical erect by a corresponding Act of Congress . tions , regarded as under the especial protection of those laws . The framers of our national Constitution recognized this principle , in a provision of that instrument by which , and by the construction that has been placed upon it by Congress and the federal courts , foreign consuls stationed in the United States are privileged to have all cases affecting their rights of person or property brought to the cognizance of the federal courts , to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the State tribunals . Again , without any treaty stipulation on the subject , civilized nations usually waive , in favor of foreign resident consuls , their own local jurisdiction over the merchant vessels and their crews of the nations respectively represented by such consuls , in all cases where the public peace is not disturbed or seriously threatened , nor the persons or property of their own citizens or subjects outraged or jeoparded . A consul is also , in cases calling for interposition or assistance , the adviser , counsellor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens or subjects of the government from which he holds his commission , who are sojourning temporarily within his jurisdiction . The United States consuls and commercial agents are appointed in the same manner as are our foreign ministers . But before they can receive their necessary instructions from the State Department , or consequently proceed to enter on the discharge of their duties , they are required by law to give bond with approved sureties resident in the United States , in a sum of not less than two thousand nor more than ten thousand dollars , conditioned for the faithful discharge of their various duties . Their powers , duties , responsibilities , and compensation  --  the last consisting solely of their prescribed consular fees , except in the few instanceshereinafter noticed-are also defined and regulated by Acts of Congress and the general instructions already alluded to . Of their duties , the most usual , and , commercially considered , the most important , relate to ship-masters and seamen . By law , every master of an American vessel is obliged , under a heavy pecuniary penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or where he discharges his cargo in whole or in part , to deposit his " ship 's papers " ( register , &amp;c. ) with the United States consul or commercial agent , if there be any far // such port . And it is the duty of such consular agent , on receiving them , to give such master a certificate , with his official seal , of the deposit . He is then to retain them , as a security that the master will comply with all the lawful requisitions both of himself and also of the local authorities . When these conditions are fulfilled on the part of the master , and he present.s a regular " clearance " of his vessel to the consul , the latter is to return the papers , with a corresponding certificate of the fact , and the date of such return . In the case of the breaking up of a voyage in a foreign port , and the consequent discharge of the crew of an American vessel ; also where any American seaman is discharged by mutual consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the consul ( in the last case only if it is required of him ) to exact of such master and take possession of , for such seamen or seaman , a certain amount over and above the wages due him . In the case of sick or needy American seamen , it is the consul 's duty to provide for them , within a fixed amount per day , until an opportunity occurs to send them to the United States if they desire to return , a certain sum being by law specified , to the extent of which he may contract with any American ship-master to convey them thither on board his vessel . The United States consular agents are also clothed with the authority of polioe justices over seamen within their jurisdiction , so far as the local laws and authorities permit them to act as such . They are also constituted ex-offlcio the administrators of the personal effects of American citizens , not seamen , who die intestate within their jurisdiction . Also , the charge and disposition of American vessels wrecked , or other property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to take charge of the same , lies with the United States consul . They are also , when required , to act as the disbursing agents of money for the use of the United States Navy . Such are some of the most important of the specific duties of the United States consular agents . But besides these , there is a large and important class of general duties which do not admit , from their nature , of so exact a specification , and many of them , and those the most important , can not be legally defined in any other than a most general and comprehensive manner . Under this head may be enumerated the following duties which are enjoined upon them : To forward to the StaW Department such specimens of the productions , both of nature and art , of the country of their residence , as may be advantageously introduced into the United States ; to zealously foster and promote the commercial and general interests of the United States ; and to communicate to the State Department all important political facts and general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as may have an influence or bearing on any of the interests of our own country . Such are concisely some of the principal of the specific and general duties of the United States consular agents , and we have enumerated them somewhat in detail , in order to furnish a more clear and convincing proof of the exceeding defectiveness of our present consular system , which we shall presently examine , by showing the various , arduous , and responsible duties appertaining to the office . As we have already stated , the sole remuneration of the United States consular agents , under the present system , is derived from their prescribed fees of office , a table of which we insert below ; # *s also a list of the * The following table , compiled principally from the provisions of the Act of Congress which establishes the basis of the present system , and from the " General Instructions " to consuls , we take the liberty to copy from a little work entitled , " Manual for United States Consuls , ' * by J. Sidney Henshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129 Fulton street , New-York , 1849 ; a work that embraces in a small space a large and valuable amount of information on this and some coUateral subjects : CONSULAR FEES .

Disbursements of money for the // few exceptions there are to the preceding general rule. * Having disposed of these preliminary matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper . The defectiveness of our present consular system is a radical one . It lies , however , in a nutshell , and may be defined in a very few words : The absence of fixed and permanent salaries for the incumbents of the office ; and the consequent utter inadequacy , in most cases , of their revenue from consular fees , both as a means of livelihood , and as a remuneration for the prescribed , approNavy of the U. S. , when required , 2* per cent . Final settlement and delivery , in money , of the personal property of any U.

S. citizen , or for an alien , the fees and charges urnally allowed to notaries of the same place for similar services ? ' ( See the Table , p. 242 of " Manual . " ) * The U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary of $2,000 , in addition to their consular fees , and the former is allowed a still further sum of $2,800 for office expenses and uses . The Consul-General at Alexandria ( Egypt ) has a salary of $3,000 , and the Consul at Beyroot , ( Syria , ) a salary of $500 per annum . The U.S. Consuls to the Barbary Powers , limited by the same act to one to each of those States , are vested by treaties with those several powers with judicial and diplomatic functions , and are simply salaried officers , and are each allowed by the same act a salary of $2,000 per annum . The U. S. Consuls in China ( one to each of the five ports declared open by our treaty with that empire ) are , by it and by an Act of Congress , vested with a defined civil and criminal jurisdiction ; and , in addition to their consular fees , are allowed for their judicial services a salary of $1,000 per annum . By treaty with the Ottoman Porte , and by Act of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with judicial functions similar to those of the U.S. Consuls in China . They are not , however , allowed any salary , though an allowance is made to the one at Constantinople for certain incidental expenses . And it may be added generally that the U. S. Consuls resident in other Mohammedan and in Pagan countries are , to the very limited extent to which they have thus far been appointed , vested under treaty stipulations with defined judicial powers . ( See " Manual , " &amp;c. , for the several treaties and Acts of Congress referred to in the preceding notes. ) priate duties of the office , and the multifarious services which are required and expected of them . Though the defectiveness of the system is confined mainly , if not wholly , to this one point , and lies , as we have said , in a nutshell , it is far otherwise with the evils and mischiefs that result from it . They are diffused , in some form or other , over the world-wherever our adventurous commerce pushes its way . In the infancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our commercial relations with foreign powers of no great or commanding importance ; but above all , when , as a nation , we were feeble , and , ranking altogether as a secondary power , politically as well as commercially , in the scale of nations , we had scarcely begun to attract the attention or awaken the interest of the great commercial and leading powers , nor had as yet aroused their apprehensions and rival jealousies , it was of little consequence that our consulai agents should possess any other qualifications than integrity and the ability to properly discharge the ordinary routine duties of their office as strictly commercial agents . We were then politically isolated from the rest of the world , and our government and national legislators at that period probacly supposed we should always remain so ; very naturally , perhaps , not foreseeing that , in spite of the early and thus far never discarded maxim and practice of our government to keel ) aloof from the polltics , and unentangled with the diplomatic arts and chicanery of the States of the Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations would soon place us in a very different relative attitude towards those nations generally , and necessarily connect and involve us more or less intimately with their political as well as commercial systems , arrangements , and measures . At that period the great commercial powers of *urope had not begun to shape their policy , to adapt their diplomacy , in a word , to regulate the varied machinery by which nations acquire power , privileges , preferences , and influence , with a view to the condition , policy , or scarcely even to the actual existence of such a power as the United States . Under these circumstances , little demand was made on the time , attention , or zeal of our consular agents , beyond what was re // quired for the discharge of the ordinary routine duties of the office , and for which they were specifically paid . They had little concern with the many general and varied duties and services which are now required of similar functionaries by the change of circumstances , and the consequent enlargement of the sphere and responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injunctions of the State Department . The regular consular fees , therefore , were then , as a general rule , a just and reasonably adequate compensation for the services performed or required . But it is far otherwise at the present day , when within the sphere of consular duties is embraced , besides the ordinary routine of duties , the active and zealous supervision of our commercial and political interests , the last being not unfrequently of far greater national importance , and involving responsibilities of a much more serious nature , than either or both of the former classes of duties . Hence it is not strange that a consular system established in the early days of the Republic , and which answered very well all practical purposes then , should prove , as the one now in operation does , exceedingly defective in theory , and inefficient in its practical operation . The British and French consular systems are essentially alike , being established on the same fundamental basis . And as our own was adopted from the former , with the material modification , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original , the defectiveness of ours may , perhaps , be best illustrated by exhibiting in contrast the theory and practical operation of that from which it was derived . The consular agents of Great Britain ( and the same is true of those of France ) are salaried officers. * They are besides allowed * The highest salary paid to any British Consul ( excluding Consuls-General ) is ? 1,200 , ( $6,000 , ) and the lowest , with the exception of two or three insignificant cases , ? 300 , ( $1,500 . ) The amount of the salary is regulated quite as much with reference to the political as to the commercial imporLance of the particular post . And it is particularly in point to remark , that for many stations which , though they are unimportant regarding merely the amouiit of the trade and commerce centred in the place of their locality , are yet for any special reasons of great or considerable importance , the salary is correspondingly large . Also , that at the many stations where the incumbents are not permitted fees for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified official acts from those allowed to U. S. Consuls for similar services . Though they necessarily rank and are regarded , under the law of nations , as simple commercial agents , they are besides this  --  to all intents and purposes , and wherever the circumstances of the case actually , or probably may , require or render it politic that they should practically assume the character-governmental political agents , presumed to be more or less skilled in diplomacy , and acting and expected to act in their latter capacity openly or secretly , according to emergencies . In many instances , where the political duties of the post are important , while those of a strictly commercial nature are very limited in amount and consequence , the official and ostensible position of the consular agent is mainly intended to serve , and does in fact principally serve , as an opportunity for insuring the more efficient discharge of his political duties , especially if these be of a secret nature ; and for performing which the position and official character of consul furnish a convenient cover , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in many others , these functionaries are selected quite as much , and in many cases far more , with reference to the political and diplomatic skill and ability of the individuals , than to their c*rnmercial and general business qualifications . Those stationed at national capitals especially , or at otherwise politically important posts , are generally prohibited from engaging in trade , for reasons which are obvious . It is their rigidly to engage in trade , their salaries are generally very liberal , and such as to place them in perfectly independent circucnstances . The few salaried consulates under the U. S. system have been already enumerated . Besides these , there are about ten .4for the localities of which , see " Manual for U. S. Consuls " ) where the consular fees afford a liberal income , varying from $10,000 to about 3,000 per annum . Of the remaining list of about one hundred consulates , commercial agencies , and tfieir vices , the range varies from the last point above , downward to ten dollars per annum , with several others nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 . The instances in this " remaining list , " where the fees amount to $1,000 or upwards , are but twenty and several important posts of the residue yield* only about 200 to $500 , while the general average of the whole is only about $600 pe* annum. * ( See " Manual for U. * . Consuls p. 22I* c&amp; seq. ) // qwq that the emolument derived by our consuJar agents from their official fees barely suffices as a remuneration for the specific services for which those fees are allowed by law . In many instances , in fact , they scarcely defray the actual expenses which are incident to the office , and not chargeable to the government at home . Whence , then , is the compensation for , or where the inducement to , the faithful performance of the general and specifically undefinable duties of a commercial and political nature which are theoretically exacted of them l It is no answer to the above position , and the interrogatory based upon it , to say that the honor of the office itself ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducements to its acceptance by resident Americans of ability and character , or , where there are no American residents , by foreigners of like qualifications . Admitting this to be so , the objection to the present system still remains in its full force . For the questida is not , whether able and respectable men can be found in all and any cases to accept the office , but whether even men of that character , who may accept the office , will or will not perform faithfully all the duties and services , of whatever kind , which are incident to it and specifically required , or in a general manner enjoined upon them . Doubtless for honor alone such men may be found who will be willing to discharge definite and particularly designated duties , the performance of which is an indispensable requisite to their enjoyment of such honor . Thus far the position is correct , but no farther . It reaches , in its application to the question now considered , to the ordinary routine duties of a strict commercial agency ; and there it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large class of important consular duties of a general commercial and political nature ; unless , indeed , it be true that a fundamental principle of human nature is reversed in the case of an individual the moment he is appointed a U. S. Consul ; and that he therefore , differently from all other men , will faithfully and zealously perform , without material compensation , labor and services which he can , without detriment to his official interests , mainly or wholly avoid ; and which , moreover , a proper sense of duty to himself and to his private interests will often , under such circumstances , actually require him to neglect or fail to perform . What these duties and services are it is unnecessary to state here , as they have already been enumerated somewhat in detail when examining by contrast the similar duties of consular agents under the British system . They come directly within the principle of the rule which we have abov&amp; stated ; for obviously there can be no meaiAs devised by which to ascertain in any given case the extent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , and vigilance to be exercised in order to secure their faithful performance ; nor is there practically any readily available or reliable method by which to detect unfaithfulness , laxity , or often gross negligence even , in the performance of them . Under our system , therefore , and especially in that numerous class of cases , embracing a large majority of all our consulates , where the official fees are either quite insignificant in amount , or at best very inadequate to a reasonable support , these duties , often of great and preponderating importance , must necessarily , as a very general rule , be grossly neglected . Both these and the consul 's private business , on which latter he is obliged principally or wholly to depend for a livelihood and source of gain , will make large claims on his time , attention , and care . One or the other class of these claims must therefore , to a greater or less extent , varying with the circumstances of each particlar case , be disregi*rded ; and which it will be , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In private stations and affairs , it would be regarded as absurd to expect men to labor , whether physically or mentally , gratuitously , and yet with fidelity and zeal . It is quite as absurd , if not more so , to expect it of those who occupy official positions ; and consular agents are no exception to this rule . The defectiveness*f our present system , with all its consequent evils , arose from an oversight in the beginning , or more properly , from a disregard since , of this simple and obvious principle of self-interest , which shapes and controls , to a great degree , all human action . We shall now proceed to particularize some of the pernicions consequences resulting from this radical defect iii our consular system . As we have before remarked , it is through the operation and agency of this system that great commercial nations , in the // rivalries and collisions of their trade and general interests in marts and countries alike foreign to the respective rivals , seek to obtain , each for itself ; peculiar advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more a different mode of operation on the American continent , and the adjacent islands both in the Atlantic and Pacific , from that which prevails in other parts of the world ; and one which of itself furnishes the strongest and most imperative reasons , were there no others , for the prompt and radical reform of our consular system . We allude to the constantly increasing disposition and tendency there is to a combination , in the quarters referred to , between the great commercial powers of Europe , to promote their adverse commercial and political interests , in opposition to , and at the expense of , those of their common rival , the United States . The active measures for effecting these ends , and the diplomacy which they call into requisition , are , always to a very considerable extent intrusted to their consular agents ; and wholly so in those States where those powers have no proper diplomatic representatives . To cope with them , to counteract their schemes , and to maintain even a defensive position , to say nothing of advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such combined rivalry and opposition , are objects , to effect which requires in our consular agents not merely integrity , general business qualifications , and even patriotism , but a certain degree of diplomatic tact and skill , combined with the exercise of the utmost care , attention , and vigilance in the performance of those services which are of a general nature and lie out of the ordinary routine of their more specific official duties . These qualifications are not , and evidently can not be , generally or often secured under our present system ; and hence it is that , in the cases above referred to , on the theatre which lies nearer home and where our national interests are more immediately involved , the superiority of the British and also of the French systems in their practical operation , to say nothing of the too frequent great contrast in the general character of the incumbents themselves over our own , manifests itself in a manner and to a degree often seriously detrimental to our interests , as well as mortifying to our national pride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep themselves accurately and thoroughly informed of the general occurrences , the schemes , and movements about them , and failing to acquire that requisite though moderate degree of diplomatic skill , which the habitual and faithful discharge of all their general duties would give them , our consular representatives in cases of emergency , involving in any way these rival national interests , and producing collisions or competitions among the representatives of the different powers , too often prove themselves no match for those of the nations above alluded to . And what is the inevitable result l One of two things . From a consciousness of this fact of their own deficiency , or from indifference , they stand wholly aloof ; while the interests of their country are plotted against and perhaps seriously compromised . Or if perchance a sense of duty and patriotic zeal , or prid* of official position , induces them to mingle in the strife , their lack of information and skill , as compared with their opponents , too often involvesthem hopelessly in the mazes of diplomacy , and other difficulties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit , or the interests they represent without prejudice , or , it may be , a complete sacrifice . Again : At many stations where the consular fees are not sufficiently large to form a motive to accept the office , but where the advantages and profits of trade are sufficient inducements to devote entire personal attention to that pursuit , the absence of any salary will frequently prevent able and responsible residents , men who would regard it as a matter of honor as well as of moral obligation to perform faithfully all the duties and services required or expected of them , from applying for the office , or even of accepting it if tendered to them . Under this head comes a class of cases similar to the last above noticed , but which illustt*tes more strongly than it the defectiveness of our present consular system , and the necessity of its revision . There are not a few consular stations which , from local or other peculiar circumstances , are of treat importance to our national interests , but where , on account of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans resident , in which case these interests must now be intrusted to a foreigner ; or their number is so limited and their personal position and standing , it may be , are  --  and in such cases they certainly are // most likely to be-so indifferent , as to afford both a very limited range of selection , and a poor chance for making a good one , from among our own countrymen . Some of the stations comprehended in the cases under this head are of greater political and national importance than several of those for which the Government has provided by fixed salaries , though the regular fees of office in these latter cases afford an ample , or at least a considerable income to the incumbents . The necessary consequence is , that many of these posts are filled by incompetent and , in many other respects , unsuitable men ; men who neither by education , general intelligence , or habits of thought-not to particularize any further-are any way qualified or fitted for the office to which they are appointed ; in some instances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration or respect which should be absolutely necessary prerequisites to their obtaining the appointment ; and who , so far from upholding the honor of the American flag , committed to their charge , derive their only respectability from the adventitious honor which its shadow casts upon them . In making these strictures , or any that may follow , our sole purpose is , and will be , to fulfil our imperative duty to the subject we are discussing . We know that our Government has some very able and efficient consular representatives ; that it has others who discharge the duties of their office as creditably as , in their circumstances and under our actual system , can be reasonably expected of them . The only wonder is , that there are as many of both classes as there are . These will not appropriate to themselves these strictures , which are not intended for them . We know , also , that there are those to whom , either fully or in different degrees , they do apply ; and for such they are intended . Another evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those cases where the income from consular fees is small , and dependence for the means of a livelihood is necessarily placed on the profits of trade , the position of our consular agents is a dependent , instead of being as it should be , so far as position is influenced by pecuniary circumstances , a perfectly independent one . To keep on good personal terms with the local authorities and the community where they res de , is in this case a primary dictate of policy and self-interest . Hence , if disputes or collisions occur between American citizens , as ship-masters , temporary sojourners , or others , and such local authorities , or with individuals in the community , the temptation is strong on the part of the consul either to remain aloof when his duty calls on him to interfere ; or if he does act , to lean to the side of the local party , right or wrong . The rights of person and property of United States citizens abroad are not unfrequently in this way compromised , or actually sacrificed , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American name . Again : It may reasonably be piesumed that these functionaries are not necessarily exempt from certain frailties which are occasionally met with among men in other stations . In all positions , temptations to swerve from the line of duty and rectitude press-other things being equal-with a degree of force precisely in proportion to the exigency of the circumstances , the pecuniary necessities , the material wants and occasions of the individual to whom such temptations present themselves or are held out . And on the other hand , in proportion as these personal exigencies and reasonable occasions are satisfied , to the same extent precisely will those temptations be diminished in force or set aside . Why should this simple and universally *recognized principle be taken less into account in determining the position and establishing the method and amount of compensation of our consular functionaries , than is invariably done in the case of our mims* ters abroad , and of our judicial and executive officers at home ? - Is any one at a loss to perceive where such strong temptations exist in the case of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions where they operate with peculiar force , and , it may be added , frequently with efficacyf under our present system . For instance , a " survey " is called for to determine whether a certain American vessel in a foreign port shall be condemned or not for alleged unseaworthiness . Her damage or deterioration may very possibly be only such as has resulted from ordina&amp; wear , which , though it may have greatly diminished the value placed upon her at the time of her last insurance , is yet an uninsured depreciation . The certificate and official seal of the United States consular agent , if there be one at the port , is absolutely // necessary to render a return of condemnation of any validity at home . Is there no possibility of a chance for , and temptation to , collusion between all parties interested , and for the ppcuniary benefit of each and all , excepting always the under-writers , to throw upon the hands of the latter , and at a high price , a piece of depreciated property which it is desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done on such terms ? It would be a great mistake to suppose this a mere imaginary case , one not likely to occur , or that never does occur . For other instances , it is only necessary to recur to the several ways , as already enumerated , in which pecuniary funds , derived from the disposition of the property of American citizens , may come officially into the hands of the United States consular agents ; and it will be readily perceived how many temptations there are to malversation and breach of trust presented in the course of the discharge of their official duties . It would be absurd to deny that the influence and force of these temptations is increased or diminished very materially by the circumstance whether their official position does or does not secure to them the means of a reasonably liberal support . It was probably in view of at least some of the evils which we have enumerated as arising from the defectiveness of our present consular system , that the President , as quoted in the beginning , recommends to Congress some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring in this particular , of course , to our own consuls . If the statute law of the United States was more deficient than it is , or rather , if it had made less ample provision on this point than it actually has , * this recommendation of the Executive , * As regards our own consuls , further legislation on this point would seem quite superfluous . By existing Acts of Congress , not only are several specified acts of consular malversation made punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment of a greater or less number of years , but it is also provided generally in regard to these functio.naries , that " f ( r all malversation and corrupt conduct in office , they " he " shall be liable to indictment , and , on conviction by any court of competent jurisdiction , shall be fined not less than one nor more than ten thousand dollars , and be imprisoned not less than one nor more than five years . " In reference to foreign consuls resident in the United States , there is a Congressional penal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy fine in case he returns to any ship-master we take leave to say , would not reach the root of the evils at present existing . This can only be done , and the evils themselves removed , by correcting the radical defect of the system itself . It is an old and sound maxim , that it is better to prevent than punish crime . In the case in question , this should be done , so far as practicable , by the legislation of Congress , before recourse is had to further penalties by fine and imprisonment for crimes or malversations , to the commission of which strong temptations are needlessly permitted to exist through the unwise and impolitic neglect , by our Government , of this branch of the public service . The reason is the stronger for adopting this prcventive course of legislation , by establishing a system of permanent salaries , inasmuch as the parties to be restricted and controlled by the recommended penal legislation , are resident beyond , and generally at a great distance from , the jurisdiction of the power which must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case the difficulty of detecting and effecting a legal conviction of the delinquent parties is increased a hundred fold over that of ordinary cases occurring within such jut-isdiction . In a corre*ponding degree , also , are the chances of escape increased , and , by consequence , the force of the temptations to delinquency . In regard to the large class of duties of a general and political nature , as they do not admit of exact specification , and as there is no criterion by which to determine the extent to which they are in any given instance neglected , it would be perfectly nugatory and absurd to attempt to enforce the faithful and zealous performance of them by penal eijiactments . It is therefore perfectly evident that no patehing up of a radically defective system by half-way measures will remedy or appreciably lessen th' evils at present existing . But on the other hand , let the great temptations to neglect of duty and malversation in the consular office be removed , by placing the incumbents in an of the nation which he officially represents his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the legal custody , ) before such master shall have exhibited to him a regular custom-house clearance of such vessel .

" ) // independent position under remunerating salaries , thus furnishing an inducement and incentive to a faithful and zealous discharge of all their official duties , of whatever kind or character ; and let such reformed system be vigilantly presided over , and its faithful practical execution vigorously enforced on our consular agents , by the competent authority at home ; and more will be effected in the way of checking such malversation , of reforming present abuses , and securing a thorough and efficient performance of the various consular duties , and hence , of fostering and protecting our great national interests abroad , than could be done by all the penal legislation which the ingenuity of Congress could devise from now till doomsday . By thus reforming the system , the government and nation will have still another security for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an independent and respectable support will induce a better and more able and efficient class of men to seek or accept the office , especially at those posts where the income from consular fees is small and insufficient for that purpose . Had such a system , vigorously administered at the seat of government , and , by rigid exaction from that quarter , added to the inducement of a liberal compensation , faithfully executed abroad , been hitherto in operation , it can not be rationally doubted that the character of our foreign policy and national diplomacy would have been raised to a much higher level than that which it has yet reached : for our diplomatic functionaries would , in that case , have been materially assisted by the information and other aid furnished by our consular agents ; in the same manner as are those already stated , the diplomats of Great Britain , as we have before noticed , by her consular agents . Under such a system , thus energetically managed and executed , our national interests could never have been compromised in the manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been suffered to be . Affairs , as relating to or affecting them , could never have taken the course or come to the pass that they have in such nationally humiliating instances as those which have occurred in Central America and St. Domingo* *Viewed purely as a question of economy affecting the national treasury , as a mere matter of There are enough others , more or less aggravated , resulting from the same cause ; but these we have mentioned stand out more glaringly prominent , mainly , perhaps , because they lie nearer home . There is one more point to which we wish briefly to advert . It relates to a practical evil which springs from a different source from that of those we have been considering , and might exist under any system . We refer to a certain careless manner in which consular appointments are sometimes made . In the case of some foreign states , where perhaps we have but one agent who is in direct communicntioim with the State Department at home  --  a consul-general with other agents of the inferior grades to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputies under him at the different posts within his general jurisdiction-an individual is some*. times appointed as such chief agent whose residence is neither at the political capital , though there may perhaps be no proper U. S. diplomatic agent , as charge or minister , in such state , nor y9t at the principal commercial port , but at some point distant from both , and having few relations of any kind with either ; while the posts at these important points are filled by subordinates , generally possessing no political or diplodollars and cents , we believe it would be cheaper to pay very liberal salaries at the principal consular posts , in such countries as the above named , connected with which we have important political interests , and in many other cases of a similar kind , than is the present , we were going to say , niggardly system . We believe , not without some good reasons , that more money has been paid out from the treasury for special agencies and missions , to those two quarters at least , within the last eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular annual salaries to the same countries of at least four consular agents The difference is , that the returns of the latter would have been frequent and regular , as well as x*inute , thus keeping the State Departmetit well and minutely informed of aU that was transpiring there , and enabling the Government to take its measures and adopt its course accordingly and seasonably ; whereas the reports of special agents relate only to particular occasions , and are given at wide intervals depending on the frequency with which those representatives are sent ; the information they contain is in consequence generally unseasonable , by reason of its being imparted too late to be made use of when the occasion for so doing occurs . It is therefore filed away with care and a commendable forethought for future emergencies ; and is almost invariably thenceforth entirely neglected and for-gotten , // matic qualifications , and not unfrequently , especially in the case of mere deputies , very few of any kind whatever . The pernicious character of this occasional practice is perfectly obvious ; and the serious nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need not particularize , even had we space to do so . It only remains to consider the manner in which we propose that the reformation of our consular system shall be effected . This is very simple ; for the needed reformation is confined to the one particular or principle which we have already stated and considered , with perhaps some minor and comparatively unimportant details ; and from the records of the State Department can readily be obtained most of the elementary data from which to make the necessary estimates and calculations . Let , then , a list be prepared of all the United States consulates ( exclusive , if desirable , of those to the Barbary States ) and commercial agencies , including the vices of each , throughout the world , with a table annexed of the annual amount of official fees derived from each . Next , let the actual and relative importance among themselves of each of these stations , in a political and national , as well as in a general commercial sense , be considered ; particular reference being had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or state we have or have not resident a regular diplomatic agent ; and also , let the actual expense of a respectable , and for an official holding the position of dignity and responsibility of consular agent , reasonably liberal support , be as accurately ascertained in each particular case as possible . On the basis furnished by these latter data , let a tariff of salaries , if we may so call it , be carefully adjusted , and the amount assigned to each and all the consulates , &amp;c. , be set down in a tabular form against them in the above list of consulates , and opposite to the table of present consular fees . Leaving these last as they are now regulated by law , * let our consular agents be still required , as heretofore , to make regularly accurate and faithful returns to the State Department of the sources and amount of their fees . And finally , let this amount of fees at each particular consulate , *c. , be deducted from the gross salary assigned to such consulate , and the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In those cases  --  and there would probably be some twenty such-where the amount of fees is greater than would be the sum designated as the proper salary at such posts respectively , nothing of course would have to be paid to the incumbents , who should be permitted , however , to retain , as now , the whole amount of such fees as their lawful and proper perquisites . As it can not be expected that in every instance the law could at first fix the salary with equitable precision , the Secretary of State might be empowered , by a provision of the same law , to alter from time to time such salaries as further reliable information or experience should demonstrate to be either materially excessive or deficient . The extent of such discretionary power of addition or deduction should be limited to some definite proportion of the legally established salary , as the one fourth or the one third part . And if deemed expedient , to guard against favoritism , the Secretary might be required to report from year to year the alterations so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reasonably liberal salary basis , and vigorously administered at the seat of government at home , would possess , as we believe , all the efficiency , and insure all the practical utility of the British system ; while it would have the further recommendation of being much more economical , and therQfore better suited to our republican ideas in that particular. * * The gross amount of fees received at all the U ; s. consulates , &amp;c. , is not far from $100,000 , a proportionately very large part of which is re ceived at a few posts . Supp*e the salaries under the suggested reformed system should he so adjusted as that their general average should be , say $1,500 each , their total amount ( taking 120 as the entire number of the consulates , &amp;c. ) would be $180,000 , say $200,000 , per annum . Deducting from this the gross amount of fees , or $100,000 , there remains to be paid out of the U. S. Treasury the like sum of $100,000 , or only about $60,000 more than is now paid out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about fourteen stations . This increased outlay would go to make up various and often large deficiencies to a proper remuneration in the case of some seventy functionaries , many of them occupying very important stations , and all of them being required , in theory at least , *We would except the item of 2A per cent . now allowed for receiving and paying the wages due to discharged seamen . This ought to be stricken out from the list of consular fees . // It is full time that this matter was taken seriously in hand by Congress . And if in its wisdom it can devise a better and at the same time an equally or more economical method of securing to our consular agents a stated , sure , and reasonable compensation  --  and nothing which stops short of this will effect any real and permament rcform , as the basis of a system which shall more effectually secure the various and important ends of its establishment-than the one we have proposed , let such better method be adopted . The President has , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subject ; the interests of our rapidly increasing commerce , a wise policy in reference to the general good of the country , and our national credit , all alike urgently invoke prompt action on it ; and the present session should not be allowed to clo*e without the desired reformation being carried into thorough and complete execution .
