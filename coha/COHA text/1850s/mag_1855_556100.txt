txt ART . VII . - Art-Hints . Architecture , Sculpture , and Painting . By JAMES JACKSON JARVEs , Author of " History of the Sandwich Islands , " " Parisian Sights and French Principles , " Member of the American Oriental Society , etc. , etc . New York : Harper and Brothers . 1855 . PAINTING and Sculpture , Eloquence and Poetry , Music and the higher forms of Architecture , in all ages , may be reckoned among the most wonderful and uplifting of all the manifestations permitted on earth to the sons of men . Appealing to the senses , and not to the reason , they are felt where they are not understood . Being all children of one parentage , their relationship to a common Father is acknowledged by the great multitude . Even the rudest of our race delight in " barbaric pearl and gold , " in the " barbarian gong " and the clattering war-drum ; and all mankind are , by nature , judges of painting and sculpture , of eloquence and music , // such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grounds of their judgment . It is enough for them that they feel , - as in lifting the eye to the midnight firmament , or listening to the far-off , weltering anthem of the sea , or wondering at the beauty of woman , or the strength of man , they do not care to understand . But the mathematician , the statesman , the lawgiver , the logician , the mechanic , - what have they to do with feeling ? And what have the multitude to do with them ? Great reasoners are to be understood only by the few ; and , if not understood , are overlooked or forgotten . They are to be judged only by their peers ; and the people , knowing this , hold themselves aloof . Hence the worth of all manifestations , for whatsoever purpose , which appeal not so much to the understanding as to the senses of the many , over those that " play round the head , but never touch the heart . " If the people are ever carried away , - if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the contemplation of God 's handiwork above them , or about , or within them , or in the changes they behold among the constellations and the seas , or the mountains and kingdoms of earth , - if their hearts ever overflow with a deep and solemn thankfulness , while they muse upon the past and the future , upon their lineage and their heritage , - then are they qualified , even the lowliest among them , if not by training or experience , at least by nature , which is far better , to enjoy and to feel the power of painting and sculpture , though eloquence , poetry , architecture , and music might be well-nigh lost upon them , for lack of preparation ; since these have more to do with the understanding , and sooner throw off the simple-hearted , straightforward , unpretending earnestness of which all mankind are judges . That our people are beginning to open their eyes , and look about them and judge for themselves , without the help of the newspapers , and to feel something of that generous warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquenchable aspirations and larger purposes of a troubled spirit , just learning to understand itself , to look inwardly , and to question its hidden impulses aright , - is undeniable . The proof may be found in this very book , and in others which have 37 * // lately come under our cognizance . Prepared by Americans , and meant for the people of America , they may well be regarded as the testimony of sagacious and thoughtful men to this very point . Fifteen years ago , such books would not have paid for the printing . Now they are eagerly sought for , both abroad and at home , and must sooner or later become popular . And what is even yet more encouraging , our very newspapers are busying themselves , and warming up their millions of readers , by republishing portions of Ruskin , and Wallace , and opening their columns to well-written communications from our countrymen abroad , Akers and Page , and Tilten ( through Mr. Jarves ) , upon much that concerns the higher revelations of art . But if the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened , as we might wish , - are they to be given up ? If they do not move aright , when they are first breathed upon , are we to go by on the other side , abandon all hope , and suffer them to settle down for ever to the business of money-getting , or castle-building ? If their hearts do not always burn within them , they do sometimes , as they talk together by the way , along the dusty and crowded thoroughfares of the world , which they do not so much live in as inhabit . And , after all , is it not something for them to know that they have hearts , even though they may not always know what they are good for ? and that the uneasiness they sometimes feel in the neighborhood of their jewels and brooches , when they are in the presence of a great picture , - discoursing to them in a universal , though silent language , day after day , - is not only safe , but wholesome , and worth encouraging , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn as death if unheeded , but full of consolation if devoutly cherished ? That thousands and tens of thousands about us are dead asleep , with no wish for a change , may be admitted . But their case is not altogether hopeless ; for they are still breathing , and may yet be awakened to that newness of life which leads to a just and happy estimate of the things that perish . As all these are God 's doings , and therefore God 's blessings , it may be no safer , and no wiser ; to undervalue // them than to overvalue them . If we are to live in the midst of singing birds and flowers , waterfalls and tinted shells , glorious , ever-changing skies , and " winged jewelry , " are we not bound by our allegiance to look after them , and to enjoy them , so far as we may , with all thankfulness , just as we are bound to reverence God 's greatest work , perhaps - ourselves ? That God reverences man , who will deny ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has created him but " a little lower than the angels , " he has made him " to judge the angels , " we are distinctly told . That he deals with men , everywhere and at all times , not only as individualities , but , under some aspects , as independent sovereignties , - and with mankind at large , as a congress of nations , - withholding his power , and forbearing to trench upon their acknoxvledged prerogatives , will not be readily questioned . And if man would but take the trouble to understand what he was made for , he would reverence himself , and learn to worship God aright , with all his powers and all his affections , and not , as now , with a dwarfed and shrivelled portion of both . And to this , if we may judge by the signs about us , of which this book is one , the people are coming . Should the deep religious warmth to be found in all the writings of Ruskin , where he deals with Art as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a holier atmosphere , become contagious , or even fashionable , as it promises to be , great things may certainly be accomplished . The movement begun over sea will be propagated here with ever-growing earnestness and comprehensiveness . What he is doing for England , the author of these Art-Hints , following out the suggestions perhaps of Tilten and Page , is now doing for this country . We need thoughtfulness , -a habit of looking for the hidden power and mysterious significance of a fine picture which may outlast empires . " Art , born in freedom , " says our author , " was true to its mission so long as man worshipped in sincerity and truth . Made , however , the handmaid of Sense , it revenged its degradation , by enslaving its enslavers , and by becoming the instrument of tyranny to steel the spirit into the doctrine of passive obedience . The social and political institutions // were neglected , for the excitements of sensuality and amusement . Education , freedom of mind , and individual enterprise - the substantial bases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cunningly diverted by tyrants into corrupt channels , so that with all those races history shows the same final result . First , a development of energy and virtue ; second , refinement and power ; then speedy enervation , and consequent decay , until ignorance , superstition , and poverty have come at last to be the established order of things over the fairest portions of the globe . " - p. 8 . In other words , the history of Art is the history of nations . " The thing that hath been , it is that which shall be . " First , a rude heroic energy ; then wealth , luxury , and refinement , where the difficult is substituted for the beautiful and just ; and then corruption . What Persia was to Sparta , - the gold of the Great King to the iron coinage of that iron commonwealth , - what the silken robe and perfumed locks were to Alcibiades , after he had grown weary of the black broth , - commerce and conquest , merchant princes and overflowing wealth , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manliness , which characterize all great nations in the day of their strength ; and so will they continue to be , till man has learned to reverence himself , or at least the image of God , or what there is left of it , within himself - by rightly employing all the talents intrusted to his high stewardship , and preparing betimes for rendering up an account of that stewardship . The history of art is indeed but the history of man himself , * " the desolator desolate ; the victor overthrown . " But is there no hope ? Must what has been , still be for ever ? Or may not a timely and serious warning prepare even the people of our day for a worthier understanding of what they owe to themselves and to their children 's children ? Must corruption always tread so fast upon the heels of refining development ? Or may it not be possible so to school ourselves , and our children , as rightly to enjoy all our gifts and blessings ? Our author is quite persuaded that a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art ; and that , if there be a looking " toward the hills whence our strength cometh , " we shall not look in vain . But we must allow him to speak for himself . // " There is a uniformity of character in the Architecture of the earliest civilized races with which we have acquaintance , as , for instance , the Egyptian and Ninevite , which warrants their being classed together . Their painting is comprised in their architecture . It is simple and truthtelling , relating events as children tell tales , in the fewest and plainest words ; without variety or truth of outline ; one story being the type of all . Colors are all positive , and strongly laid on . In architecture , we have the same simplicity of forms , combined with majesty and oddity of design . It can hardly be called grotesque , yet it is magnifi .. cently ideal , suggestive of power and durability throughout . No one who examines it can fail to perceive that it is the working out of the ideas of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere machines , whose sole tasks were to repeat these ideas according to a given pattern and rule , into which their own mind no more entered than into the fashioning of bricks . Consequently , Art in these countries was the mechanical carrying out by slaves of the imaginations of their lords . There was no real life or natural variety in it . It embodied those essential elements of sublimity and power , which are the attributes of all lofty understandings born in absolute rule . In those characteristics it has never been surpassed ; but it perished with the despotism that gave it birth . " - pp. 80 , 81 . Although this is profoundly thought , and true in the main , we should be inclined to take issue with our author upon at least one point . Just what the Pyramids were , and just what Mount Athos would have been , had Alexander the Great undertaken to carry out the stupendous thought of Dinocrates , instead of respectfully suggesting that the whole country round about could not furnish food for the supply of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand of the statue , - just such are all the great predominating archetypes of earth , where the people are but the slaves of an autocrat , who , as a monarch and a priest , occupies a throne " high and lifted up , " " his train filling the temple , " and wear themselves out in hopeless drudgery , laboring to represent and perpetuate for after ages - whether in Egypt or Mexico , in Hindostan or Assyria , Greece or Rome , Yucatan or Russia , it matters not - the portentous dreaming of their inexorable master , a heartless monolith at best . And we are laboring under a strange hallucination , if we // have succeeded in persuading ourselves that the world has outgrown , or ever will outgrow , such slavery , or that the people are much wiser now in this particular than they were in the days of the Ptolemies and the Pharaohs . The laborer is nowhere the thinker , except just so far as he ceases to be a laborer . The moment the brain begins to work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The penmanship of a ready writer is a thought-gauge . The more vehemently he thinks , the more impatient you find him under all mechanical interruptions or hinderances ; a bad pen , or greasy paper , not allowing his thoughts to flow freely , if indeed he be composing and not copying , will betray itself in a change of style . From the potter , the bricklayer , and the house-builder , up to the finisher of marble statuary or of the golden cups of Cellini , the originating spirit - except among painters and moulders in clay - does not often labor , any more than the laborer thinks . The time has gone by , perhaps not for ever , when " to the nightmare moanings of Ambition 's breast , " " gods and godlike men ' * were quarried from the living rock , as by a thunderbolt , and for that very reason left , as Michel Angelo left his greatest works , unfinished . And if we claim to be far in advance of the mighty Pagans who set up long avenues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alike , without variation or shadow of change ; or hewed mountains of granite into temples , a hundred feet high , and stretching a mile and a half along an amphitheatre , chiselled and sculptured from base to summit , as at Elora , in the heart of Hindostan ; or cut a highway from sea to sea , for the passage of two ships abreast , as did Xerxes , in the mere wantonness of untrammelled power , - thus , in the language of our author , " working out the ideas of the few by the hands of the many , " - we have only to look at our railways , traversing empires ,  --  at our canals , bridges , tunnels , and monuments , - and ask ourselves how much the multitude who did the work had to do with the original thought . And here the reader may be reminded of a curious illustration of this unchanging , if not almost unchangeable , law of production , which will prepare the way for what follows about Greece . While delivering his famous lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1853 , Mr. Ruskin felt obliged to call the attention of his hearers to a new building of the Greek type , where the stone-sculptors of Edinburgh had been required to multiply from the original pattern furnished by the architect , not a long procession of gigantic phantoms n marble , sixty feet high , - not a Menai Bridge , nor a monument to Nelson , - but a monstrous , though exceedingly pitiful misrepresentation of a lion 's head , sixty-six times repeated , without the slightest variation , just under the gutter of what was intended to be a " New School of Design , " - following a glorious archetype of the elder Athens . If the landscape gardening of his day troubled Alexander Pope , what would he say of the perpetual repetitions of our day in architecture and architectural embellishment ? for here , too , " Grove nods at grove , each alley has a brother , And half the platform just reflects the other . " Ruskin found no less than six hundred and seventy-eight windows , in one single street of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty thousand , of precisely the same style , - a massive lintel , resting on square cut jambs , within the best-built part of that city of palaces . " But , " continues our author , " in Greece we find the opposite of all this . " A great mistake , by the way , if by all this he means what the words following the passage above quoted import ; for in the most beautiful types of Grecian architecture there was little or no variety , - no play of the imagination , - and no embellishment worth naming , unless we reckon the triglyphs , and capitals in their pomp of sculpture , with the warriors and horses , the Amazons and the Centaurs , altogether , not as manifestations of sculpture , but as mere architectural embellishment ; for over all the calm , severe , and awful beauty of their most wonderful creations , there lay the shadow of an everlasting , unchangeable sameness . To the North and the East - to the barbarians of the Desert , to the Goths , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for richness , variety , and appropriateness of decoration , where the birds play among the flowers , and the grotesque and the beautiful , the sublime and the whimsical , // are sometimes found interwoven , warp and woof , as into a lower firmament . But in Greece we certainly do " find the opposite of all this . It was the embodiment of physical beauty , " says Mr. Jarves , " in its most perfect forms and happy moods . The people gave vent to their imagination , and worked out the results with their own hands . " Not so , if by the people Mr. Jarves means any very large number of the people ; or any , indeed , beyond the sculptors and builders actually employed to work out the conceptions of the autocrat with whom the Parthenon , or the temple at P*stum , like the Phidian Jupiter , the " Olympian Jove , " originated . And again : " As far as their religion led them , they went . In all that they attempted , they were sincere . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to represent was the most complete and in harmony with the entire nature . " Here , if Mr. Jarves will permit us to understand that by they he means , not the people of Greece , who were very much like other people , though somewhat more enlightened and more highly privileged than their neighbors , but the few who busied themselves with working out , inch by inch , the great architectural problems of the fewer , we are not disposed to quarrel with his proposition ; though the Greeks were perhaps no more characterized by religious sincerity than were the Goths or the Saracens , the Hindoos or the Persians . But leaving this portion of the book , let us come to that where he deals more directly with the great business and want of our day in the world of Art . " The rules of Art are absolute , " he says . " They are moral laws implanted by God in the heart of nature , and are independent of human frailty or invention . Absolute they must be , because they are fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creation . It is for man to discover and apply them . He may depart from , but he can not change them . He may outlaw their truths , cramp or distort their genius , and pervert their objects , but their Divine power is beyond fraud or violence . They are superior to circumstance and human mutations , for they are Truth itself . Art is indeed often perverted , because man , from the excessive cultivation of his sensual nature , seeks the low and feeble . But whenever its professors try to accommodate // it to fashion , to follow and not lead the spirit of the age , to sacrifice its truths to the desires of a flesh-loving world , the selfish purposes of priesteraft or vainglory of rulers , and thus immerse Beauty in the slough of vulgar deceit , then it must be known for what it really is - ARTIFIcE. " - pp. 66 , 67 . The following , though somewhat in their way of thinking , is higher ground than was ever taken by Goethe and Schiller , and , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The associations of Beauty are only those of virtue and life ; whilst its converse , Falsehood , finds companionship solely with sin and death . Its mission is to soften the heart of man . By it the savage is prompted to his first step towards refinement . Among civilized races , it requires but to be exhibited by Art , in the full strength of its moraV loveliness , to purify the intellect from the dross of worldly aspiration , and to stimulate its faculties to the full expansion of their powers . Without the perfect union of Art with moral , as well as physical Beauty , there is danger of its becoming the mere instrument of mental dissipation among the cultivated classes , and of sensual excitement among the vulgar ; so that we must not consider Art as genuine in character , or as true to its mission , except in proportion as it embodies all the truth it is capable of expressing . " - pp. 67 , 68 . Such lessons are needed , and we are strongly inclined to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be true , that among the many who are supposed to be awake , watching and waiting for new revelations in the world of Art , so long foretold and so passionately hoped for , as the signs are multiplied about their way , and the openings grow larger , the skies brighter , and the glimpses clearer , are thousands of unbelievers , here because they know too much , and there because they know too little ; yet are there always a lofty few that stand like Saul among the princes of Israel , head and shoulders above their fellows , overtopping and outshining them all , who must continue to believe and hope , through all the discouragements of their day , that every form of regenerated Art will become the handmaid of Virtue , and the servant of God , - answering to the higher instincts and better wants of our nature . If these have no fire shut up in their bones , they have something better for all the common // purposes of life , - earnestness and warmth , heartiness and trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faces of the multitude in the presence of a great picture , and you will be satisfied . Their lighted eyes and agitated mouths will sometimes betray the inward stirring , and woe to them and theirs if they have to smother it , or to deny their master . We are not all earth ; and our higher nature will make itself understood , sooner or later . Even the feeblest have their paroxysms of strength , while the blindest see visions , and the lowliest among us may take upon themselves another shape , if their long-hidden , original brightness be troubled or profaned , and when we are least looking for it leap , transfigured , to their feet . Are we not , as a people , beginning to busy ourselves with many a deep question which our fathers dared not look in the face ? And are there not many among us , who desire to know the truth , and the whole truth , cost what it may , if the questioning be not unlawful , - many who are constantly asking , Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall asleep in our courses , and stop for ever on our appointed way upward ? Arid what is more encouraging , we are not so easily satisfied , or silenced , or put off , as our fathers sometimes were , with answers from the spelling-book . We are determined , in short , to see for ourselves , to understand for ourselves , to judge for ourselves , to meddle with what questions we please , and if we are led astray , being honest in our purpose , to abide unflinchingly by the consequences , - " to stand the hazard of the die , " - though a brave , yet a fearful spirit , if it wander long untroubled or unrebuked , but less fearful , perhaps , than a sluggish or self-satisfied , unquestioning submissiveness . As a people , and in our larger cities and more thrifty villages , we are no longer to be put off with tolerable music , nor with tolerable poetry , nor with anything else indeed which is barely tolerable ; we sometimes prefer the intolerable , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way , and showing that we have outgrown the prejudices of our youth and the teachings of our grandmothers . Nor should this be much wondered at ; for , as a people , we are fast approaching that period in the progress of refinement , at which the wonderful // is preferred to the beautiful and the just , and no truth is much cared for unless it astonishes . Everywhere the same spirit is to be found . Alike in our churches and our theatres , in our senate-chambers and our courts of justice , in our concert-rooms and at our platform-gatherings , we are constantly reminded of Dr. Johnson 's reply to the foolish mother , who had just been setting off her daughter upon a rattling piece of music , and wanted his opinion of the performance , it being so very difficult ,  --  " Yes , madam , " said the Doctor , " very difficult indeed , - would it were impossible ! " But with a growing desire to uplift ourselves , though we may often overdo the business , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we need a little honest help now and then , else we lose our foothold on a new path , or grow dizzy and stumble upon the dark mountains of unbelief dreary and hopeless . Once committed upon any subject , whether momentous or trifling , we are very slow to see , and still slower to acknowledge , our blunders . Abroad , according to our author , - whose large experience and great conscientiousness entitle him to be heard with favor , - " Science is degraded into a system of ways and means to best perpetuate and vary the pleasures of sense . Life is valued solely for what it offers for the enjoyment of the material nature of man . The spirit shrinks from this perversion of the true purposes of its fleshly habitation , and either dies away to an occasionally still , small voice , ' or , leaving man altogether , he becomes a believer solely in what he hears , sees , and feels with his external sense . There is no inner life left in him . A practical atheist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or analyze . " - p. 16 . With such " practical atheists , " there is no dealing to advantage . God must have no secrets hidden from them . Without claiming to be gods , they insist on comprehending God ; and there is no manifestation of character among them so universal and so distinguishing , perhaps , as a habit of propounding unanswerable questions , - questions , that is , which they know , and will if hardly pressed acknowledge , to be unanswerable , - questions , in short , which none but God can answer . Of course , therefore , if their belief is to depend upon // having such questions first answered , and such mysteries cleared up , there is an end of the controversy . They never can believe . " But , " continues our author , " the sense of beauty he can not indeed wholly extinguish ; but it is confined to external form and color , and degraded to the low situation of a pander . All nature is resolved into sense . If God there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless , and surely all capricious . Study will not find him out . Why vex our minds with what we can not comprehend ! Sufficient for us that we eat and sleep ! We can understand Nature , because we see her . Beyond this it is all dark ; cease to trouble us with theories that can not be demonstrated in matter . Such is the language common to a large proportion of the educated classes in Europe . They have shrunk from avowing themselve* 's atheists heretofore , from fear of loss of position , or some of the earthly joys for which they sacrifice their souls . Their numbers now embolden them to openly avow their sentiments . I do not hesitate to assert that the general tone of European refined society is open or concealed atheism , while the mass of the population are steeped in superstition scarcely less fatal to their true dignity as beings capable of becoming even as the angels in heaven . " - pp. 16 , 17 . There is much truth in what follows , - perhaps too much ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as every honest believer will make for himself . " The abettor of this moral ruin is the Church as now constituted . Between Protestantism and IRomanism there is indeed the wide gulf of individual freedom of thought . Consequently , the hope of man and his ultimate progress to the completion of his personality lies exclusively with the former . But the preachers of both have become blind leaders of the blind . The former limit their vision to irreconcilable dogmas and creeds , and the latter to ceremonies from which the essence has long since fled . Both are more anxious to preserve their own than God 's kingdom . Both trammel thought , though in different ways . Both not only fail in satisfying the entire man , but shock his reason and cramp his soul . Protestantism is not exclusively under the control of priestcraft . IRomanism is . Which is better for man as a whole , their respective boundaries show . The difference between the two is the actual distinction between England and Spain , Italy and the United States . Still , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both IRomanisin and Protcstantism , among the cultivated classes , is now toward scepticism . " - pp. 17 , 18. // This , if true , were indeed appalling . But is it true ? Are we to understand our author to mean , that the tendency of the cultivated classes is more strongly toward scepticism than it has been in any previous age ? If so , we are ready to take issue with him . That there is such a tendency , always and everywhere , we admit ; but we are *lisposed to deny that it has been growing stronger since the days of Charles II . and Rochester and Bolingbroke , Bayle and Hobbes , Descartes and Volney , Voltaire , Frederic of Prussia , and Thomas Paine , to say nothing of the French Revolution , and the horrible atrocities that followed the national renunciation of God , a4d nothing of the Encyclopedists . But to the main object of the book , - that which concerns Art , and especially Painting . " The law of Taste is harmony . It creates refinement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nation deficient in taste may be sincere , vigorous , and powerful ; but neither can be in complete harmony with themselves and the surrounding world until they have submitted to its softening influences . Consistent with virtue , it adds grace to religion . To man it is what Beauty is to Nature , - its smile . " - p. 84 . Of the four hundred pages going to make up the volume , three fourths perhaps abound in vigorous and thoughtful criticisms upon the old masters and a few of the modern , - such criticisms too as no mere connoisseur or amateur could have written . They are evidently the result of long and careful study and practice , and are oftentimes elaborated with so much significance and truth , as to show that none but a painter full of enthusiasm and ripe experience could have suggested them ; and though we can not agree with some of the opinions about Correggio , Domenichino , Claude , Salvator Rosa , Murillo , Turner , and others , yet in the main we coincide with the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to believe , that such a book at this very time is wanted , and will be sought for , studied , and highly prized by the cultivated classes of our land , whatever may be their tendencies toward unbelief and after a time by the people themselves . The very best portion of the book , however , and the newest by far , has to do with landscape , - a department of painting 38 // which seems to have sprung into fresh life within a few years , - like " Minerva from the head of Jove , " all " armed in golden panoply complete " ; and everywhere , while reading these pages , one is constantly expecting some great landscape painter to appear . Nor will he be disappointed , if he can satisfy himself with suggestions and glimpses . For example : - " The Carracci led the way to a genuine love of landscape . Earnest , industrious , and universal in their studies , they sought to free this portion of Nature from its merely subordinate position in Art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , it had been used simply as an accessory . Symbolism had given it a pure and sincere ideality , without variety ; hinting at its elements rather tban expressing them , yet carrying the spectator always into clear skies and pleasant fields , leaving him amidst its sweetest flowers . There was always a congeniality between the celestial and earthly simplicity and beauty , which appealed warmly to the heart . Titian was the first great natural landscapist. " - pp. 258 , 259 . Here we have a glimpse of the preparation for raising landscape to a just and equal companionship with the highest poetical , religious , and dramatic achievements in pictorial representation . " Titian , " he continues , " made sparing use of variety ; but his feeling was true , and his expression correct . When we reflect on what he suggested of the great harmonies of the natural world , even in the secondary part he gave to landscape , it is really wonderful that artists did not see its value as an independent source of beauty and instruction . A century passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - p. 259 . " Correggio , considering his time , took perhaps the greatest step in divesting landscape Art of its previous stiffness and formalism . He attempts the freedom and grace of Nature , particularly in his foregrounds . To Titian , however , landscape is most indebted . Although he never wholly freed himself from the old system , yet his landscapes , as a whole , are simple and broad in character , giving the general features of Nature , though not its variety . That which , however , he rendered in foreground detail is given with perfect fidelity of form and color . Grandeur and majesty were his chief aims Sometimes , as in his St. Catherine in the Pitti palace , the clouds are hard // and monstrous , rendering his distant hills of blue , in comparison , quite transparent . These effects were , however , before his style in this branch was fully formed . Later , particularly in his trees , he was unrivalled , both in truth of quality and outline . In general , his water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the sky , while his light is subtly and equally diffused throughout his pictures . " Tintorelli felt landscape , and had a greater grasp of imagination , but with less ability in technical expression , than Titian . " - pp. 380 , 381 . " Salx ator Rosa gives confused representations of the natural world . Much that is false in quality or strained in sentiment he mixes with occasional bits of truth , fresh and vigorous from Nature . He had power and will , but lacked judgment and patience . " - p. 382 . " Salvator Rosa seized upon a few features , and in a half-robber , halfartist-like manner vigorously gavevent to his new passion , in a medley of coarseness and refinement , truth and falsity , that alternately perplexes and pleases . To Claude Lorraine was reserved the key of Nature 's loveliness , in her great elements of earth , sky , and water . He introduced the complete , healthful landscape , striving to express both particular and general truth . " - p. 259 . Beatitiful and just as is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage , only those can attest its truth who have had an opportunity of studying him at their leisure , and neither through copies nor through such specimens as are most of the renowned pictures of the National Gallery and the Louvre , but in others of much less pretension , cooler and quieter . For the distinguishing characteristics of Claude , after all , are not those which soonest catch the eye , and are most frequently repeated , filling the hearts and the memory of the multitude with the golden glow of a summer atmosphere , or with that everlasting sun in a fog . By far the most wonderful of his pictures are modest , unobtrusive , low-toned , and full of elaborated , unexaggerated truthfulness . In the rendering of space , and in the representation of water that feels damp , and air that you can breathe , he is unequalled . His power is not evinced in the huddling together of huge , unshapely piles of architecture , such as you find in so many of his larger pictures , where he introduces the Villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ostia ; or the columns and temples of the Forum , into all sorts of pictures . These are // the painter 's idiosyncrasies , which may be successfully counterfeited , or caricatured , and are always remembered ; they are not his characteristics , which are inimitable and untranslatable . " In Claude we see more truthful results from inferior natural abilities . He had no invention or taste in composition . Consequently his landscapes in general are unpleasantly artificial , indeed , I may say , little in thought. * But in his direct studies from Nature , - at all events in one , the Roman Campagna before Sunrise , ' in a private collection , comparatively untouched , - there are more breadth , space , and atmosphere , than I have ever seen in any other painting of his.t An uninjured Claude is a rare object . Almost every one of his pictures has been more or less skinned , to use an expressive term , by the carelessness of cleaners4 " A sea-view of Claude 's , in the Academy of St. Luke at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a small picture , called , I believe , the Enchanted Castle , ' and two others in the collections of Mr. Rogers and Mr. Baring , most favorably present his rare merits . In depth and unity of color , subtle gradation of light and shade , sparkling liquidity of water , solidity of stone , and opacity of earth and transparency of atmosphere , they are unrivalled . " - pp. 382 , 383 . Here perhaps we have another glimpse of the truth . " During the summer of 18*54 I was in Venice refreshing my mind amid its artistic treasures . Being one day in the church of Santa Maria della Salute , or rather in the sacristy , I noticed enter a young American , whose appearance denoted a cultivated mind . His observant eye ranged at once over the pictures , selecting instinctively those of most merit , and sparing neither time nor painful observation to * How artificial I If he had no invention or taste , he must have copied what he saw , and with great faithfulness , which must of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial picture , however unpleasing . It may be mentioned here , that this fine picture is now in the Athenreum Gallery of Boston , where it is to remain awhile , we understand , before it goes abroad . * In the picture referred to in the preceding note , there are to be found only two passages of a questionable character : one , a light sweep , along the left base of the mountains , not easily distinguished ; and the other , a brownish tint in the middle distance , among the houses , of two or three inches in length , perhaps , by a quarter of an inch in breadth , according to our present recollection ; harmonizing well enough , to be sure , though not like the touches of Claude himsclt* , and clearly of a much later period . A picture of this great master which has not been seriously tampered with , nor mended , nor spoiled by varnishin* , nor skinned , were well worth our most patient study . // make himself master of their spirit and treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings . In this instance the best are placed at a most awkward height , considering the narrowness of the room , for the range of the eye , while Titian 's occupy the ceiling some forty feet above the head , and can be seen only by lying flat on one 's back on the stone floor , and gazing upward . In this position , forgetful of all else , did the young American place himself , for the more full gratification , or I should say appreciation , of the masters , whose works he had come to study . His deportment and criticism showed a determination to test the respective merits of the artists , regardless of personal discomfort , and to the full extent of his knowledge and circumstances . " - pp. 2 , 3 . How could the following suggestions have been made by any but a landscape painter ? What connoisseur - what amateur - ever talked in this way , or ever felt what is here said of effects ? " The chief quality of water is liquidity ; of earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of air , transparency . That Which unites qualities into one harmonious mass of color , each tint , light or shadow , subdued to its proper gradation , or unison in respect to the effect as a whole , is called tone . ' These two are the key-notes of painters . Without a proper comprehension of both , their labors are as unknown tongues . " In sky , the first effect that we should seek is space . Unfortunately it is that which is least often given . Tricks of chiaro-oscuro will bring objects out of a canvas , but that art which takes the eye in , and obliges us to feel the quality of an atmosphere , warm , transparent , alive , infinite , the tremulous movement of the vapory air , or the clearness of the cloudless sky , into the abyss of which the sight may gaze until the eyeballs ache to bursting and not find a spot on which to rest , has never been more than suggested by a few artists . Yet it seems to me that the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence upon color . Clouds having no bodily shape are to be drawn in color . If its gradations are managed as Nature manages hers , imitating her subtle transitions and aerial touchings , avoiding loading the canvas with positive or opaque colors , alternating and scumbling , not by scores of times , but by hundreds , and more with the fingers than the brush , something approaching Heaven 's handiwork may be given . It is not my object , however , to treat of Art technically . Each artist has his favorite methods , the result of his experience . Therefore , what may appear to me as worthy of experiment may , after // all , be but the approved practice of hundreds . Still , in cloud effects , aerial perspective , and , in fact , in earth and water generally , where breadth and depth are to be given , I think that the careful study of the principles by which Nature produces her qualities of light , will lead to a new era of landscape Art . " Hitherto , with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sky , fiat , hard surfaces of opaque color , coming forward of anything else in the picture , and often firmer than the rock beneath . Indeed , we feel that we should get such paintings nearer right by inverting them . Then the earth would have something firm to rest upon , unless the artist has unfortunately attempted water , and libelled that into a black and glutinous mass , like the seas of Backhuysen . We can walk dry-shod over almost all the water ever painted , and as for skies , they would echo the strokes of a hammer . I appeal to the galleries of Europe for the truth of this assertion . " - pp. 120-122 . Supposing all these to be what we have taken the liberty to suppose , the suggestions of a living landscape-painter , then we are justified , not only in hoping for , but in expecting , a new era . But if , on the contrary , they are but the notions of Mr. Jarves himself , who says , " For my own part , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reading , investigating Art itself in place of studying erudite treatises ; in fact , I have read but little on the subject ; my time for several years has been mainly occupied in seeking to comprehend Art-language , and to test the correctness of intuitive feeling by the sculptured and pictorial truths of its masters " ; - then have we little to hope ; and that which has been will continue . But we believe better things . And we find our justification in two or three valuable foot-notes by Mr. Jarves , where he speaks of Mr. Page , of his talents , and of certain discoveries lately made by him , of great importance in the world of Art ; one being a scale whereby the gradations of a picture may be instantly measured and guaged ; and the other a law of proportion , whereby the human figure may be divided into three equal parts with unerring precision , by any tolerable draughtsman , so that an error may be instantly detected . And then we have the following , the truth of which there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the promise of a distinguished artist in Mr. Tilten , // now in IRome. * Among the few landscapes that he has painted , there are some that are natural poems , vital with thought . He has yet fully to express himself . But in the qualities of the landscape , the making felt the difference between earth , atmosphere , and water , his works in these particulars are unrivalled . The eye brings not up upon opaque paint , but passes into space ; quivering , moist air , peopled with cloud-forms , varied and delicate in shape and color , like the harmonies of Nature itself . So surprising are his atmospherical effects , that , upon inverting his pictures , the spectators have complained of being made dizzy by the apparent aerial motion.t Mr. Page , another American at Rome , in color , expression , and feeling has the attributes of a great artist . No painter of modern times , in color and scientific knowledge , particularly in his portraits , so nearly approaches Titian . " - pp.392,393 . But our notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , though we would willingly give other extracts , and call the attention of our readers to other elevating opinions , if the reasonable limits of a review would allow us to do so . We will conclude , therefore , with another reference to Titian , which may be ranked among the finest and truest passages in the book ; and we are the more ready to do this , from the fact that we have now on exhibition here , side by side with the Claude above referred to , a cabinet Dan&amp;d by Titian , lately discovered , which is beginning to be acknowledged for a masterpiece by some of the best judges , and , among others , by Page himself , certainly qualified , if ever man was by long years of study and great original genius , employed in copying Titian 's pictures , to speak advisedly in the matter . " The Yenus ' of the Tribune at Florence is his most wonderful exhibition of artistic skill in color . Those who are not technically acquainted with the difficulties to be overcome in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Titian did not paint this picture to show a nude figure , but to exhibit his power over light and color in their most difficult combinations , without the aid of the usual effects of shadow , and other art-subtleties , by which an inferior artist * Lately here on a visit , bringing with him the Titian and the Claude now in our Boston Athennum Gallery . I This will never be thought possible but by those who have stretched themselves out upon their backs , or looked , while stooping , at a wide landscape and floating sky , or at any sky , as we see it reflected in clear , untroubled water , as when looking down from a bridge . // would have sought to cover his weak points . As a work of Art , it is far superior to the renowned Venus de ' Medici , ' which stands beneath . He has given the delicate roseatic tints of flesh their most lovely expression , in contrast with the white of linen , and in the full glare of daylight ; treating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner so faithful to Nature , that no artist has yet been found to rival him . Examine the outlines of his flesh ! There is no sharpness in them . They disappear gradually in atmosphere , in soft and distinct form , half displaying and half suggesting the natural curvatures . As in looking upon the best Greek statues , we feel that the anatomy is perfect , but do not think of ft . His flesh is warm and springy . So subtly are his tints managed , that the entire unity of glowing life reposes in the figure . Generous blood lies underneath that soft skin . Look also at the transparent shadows : they darken , but conceal ; you know they are trembling shadows , not opaque paint , as with common artists . With what consummate art has Titian husbanded his power of light in this picture ! It illuminates itself ; and yet there is nothing in it higher than half-light . Every tint is subdued and cool , but the whole picture is transparent and harmonious Where he can not rival Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we forget her scale in his Art . There is labor incalculable in this picture , but no evidences of it are obtruded upon the sight . Indeed , so natural is the whole , that its merit is often forgotten in the apparent freedom of execution . " - pp. 371 , 372 . Much of all this would apply with equal truth to the Dana* , now here . She is lying at full length , upon a low , sumptuous couch , partly supported upon her right elbow resting on a rich velvet cushion , heavy with golden fringe and cotton tassels , the beautiful hand falling with that expression of languid warmth , and sleepy , indolent helplessness , which the patriarch of painters delighted in representing even to the last , and which must have been copied from the living flesh and blood of a hand that he loved , or rather transferred ; for though he sometimes modelled or moulded such a hand , as if he were toying with that of a beloved daughter , he never copied what he saw as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and , like Giorgione , and others of the great Venetian school , he would not stoop to drawing , where it was possible to represent by manipulation . Everywhere , throughout the whole picture , we have the // burning impress of power , and still nothing unchaste or unholy , nothing voluptuous or sensual , but rather a sort of doating tenderness or affectionateness , with a reverential regard for the sanctities of youthful womanhood ; as if the instincts of untroubled innocence were in his thought , and every pulse , and every throb , at the age of nearly threescore and ten , were registered with awe . The sky , the golden fretwork , and heavy tumbled fringe , the half-light , everywhere to be found , even where the half-transparent drapery would be mistaken for white by the eye of a common artist ; the sharp touches and sparkling brightness here and there , as in the wet roses and rich embroidery ; the flesh tints of the two other figures , a Love with uplifted hands and lighted eyes , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heaps of gold , as they drop slowly , on their lingering way to earth , overflowing the couch and sinking into the drapery ; the whole arrangement and composition , together with the careless and costly , though tender and compassionate , trifling ; the very defects , indeed , - the unfinished feet and false drawing , - are all so thoroughly characteristic of Titian , and of nobody else , when taken together , that no one well acquainted with his labors , professionally or otherwise , would ever think of questioning this picture now , in its present beautiful condition , so far superior to that of the Flora , as Page himself declares , with the dust of ages wiped off , and the brightness of the original image restored . But we must leave our author and his work , trusting that such fine , free , spirited handling of these great subjects , painting and architecture , may be properly understood by our people . Next after Ruskin , whose influence upon almost everything that has appeared on kindred subjects , ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stones of Venice , " and " Lectures , " may be traced , not only in the writings , but in the buildings and paintings , of the day , we are disposed to rank Mr. James Jackson Jarves , author of these " Art-Hints.
