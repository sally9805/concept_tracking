NE* SERIES . 8 // tax-payers , through the agency of government : that if the , Rothschilds , for instance , lend the goverment a million at 5 per cent . they have lent it to the tax-payers , who ought to consider it a very advantageous loan . But if the tax-payers are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenders of the money . Whether the transaction is a good one , or not , depends upon the manner in which the money is expended . If it is well employed by the government , in such enterprises as will yield a fair return to the public ; it can not be set down as a loss . The capitalists , in that case , have invested their money in a national enterprise , for which the people pay them interest , and neither party are the losers . If the national wealth is increasing at the rate of 5 per cent . per annum , or more , by the general and distributed industry of all the tax-payers , other things being equal , they will not find it a disadvantage to borrow money at 5 per cent . If , on the eontrary , the body of the nation is not increa*. ing its substance at that rate , it will be a loser by such a bargain . The most serious objection to a natienal debt is , however , that it facilitates the employment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Capitalists are eager to lend . Ambitious and unjust governments are eager to borrow . The taxpayers are unthinking and ignorant . The consequences are , a dreadful waste of the substai*e of the nation . When governments refuse to borrow , capital is thrown into manufactures , commerce , agriculture , and other forms of industry . In these it increases rapidly , and with it increases the ability of the nation to pay such taxes as may be necessary at the time when they are needed . It matters not what may have been the nature of the enterprise , the lender must have back his money . Had he invested it himself he would have been responsible for his own losses ; but , for public loans , the tax-payers are responsible . On . party manages the enterprise , ( a war , for example , ) and another is responsible for the cost . The great secret of economical government will then be , to bring the opinion of the taxpayer to bear directly upon the project itself ; and by making the pa yment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the case of a war , ) to load the taxpayer ( i. e. voter ) himself , with the responsibility of the thing , as in a private speculation . This policy would not only prevent all engagements in unnecessary and unjust wars , by keeping the conscience of the people in harmony with their pecuniary interests , ( a sure means of making men honest and considerate , ) but it would lead them to invest the public money in such projects as would reimburse the nation for its expenses . The democratic party maintain a speculative opposition to funded national debts . Were they to maintain , what they dare not do , a direct opposition , they would probably not have been able to force duty-payers into a support of the Mexican war . Another and highly important objection to a system of public debt , even when we suppose the money to have been justly and profitably employed , and to the advantage of the nation , is that it converts the government itself into a monied corporation , employing a prodigious capital for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings of thousands of individuals are thrown into its hands , to be employed at its discretion . The Government of England is a monied corporation , which has sunk its capital , and taxes the people to pay interest on the money it has lost , and which yields it nothing . Thus , instead of being the agent and representative of the popular will , and the national industry , it has become nn irresponsible corporation , with the right of raising funds by force . This is the effect of keeping the tax-payer separated from the government by the intervention of an unlimited credit system . A principal objection to the of late very democratic system of contracting public debts is , that the loaning of great masses of property , to government , deprives the tax-payers of a double advantage ; first , that of having a capital , created out of small and scattered sums , employed for the general good ; and , second , the use , to a great extent , of the concentrated means of capitalists . A million of poor tax-payers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us suppose that the money is justly applied for their defence , and for the assistance of their industry , by the government . A good government is almost the creator of 1850. 115 // national industry . The dollar they have each paid in , well employed by their representative agents , will enable them all to increase their little wealth , some once , some twice , and some an hundred fold . At the same time , the capitalist , unable to make the government his debtor , is compelled to employ the million he would have lent , in industrial projects for his own and their advantage , realizing for them and for himself a much larger return , than if he had lent it ; though , indeed , with greater labor . It is better , therefore , to pay a dollar to-day , than two dollars twenty years hence , inasmuch as we thereby enjoy in addition to the benefits of a good and wealthy government , devoted to the protection of industry , the employment offered by the capitalist whose money must now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by these arguments , to impress the idea , that we have already incurred a great and immediate danger , by the increase of the national liabilities . The commerce of the nation is , doubtless , fully equal , under an equitable system of specific duties , to cancel , by degrees , all our obligations . We would not even propose a sudden and violent change of policy , in regard to the contraction of debt . We desire only the gradual payment , not by any delusive system of a sinking fund , which , like a spend-thrift 's reservation , puts conscience asleep ; but by a method , first , of economical administration , and , second , of direct appr*priations , of which the people will see the merit , and feel the force . On the 1st of July , 1850 , by the estimate of Mr Meredith , there will be a deficit of nearly six millions , for which no provision has been made . On the 1st of July , 1851 , there will be a deficit of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen millions , which , if provided for by loans , temporary or funded , will be merely an addition to the national debt . The actual public debt already exceeds $64,700,000 , the greater portion of which is redeemable before the year 1868 . Under the system that has been pursued for the last three or four years , of contracting debt upon debt , and putting the day of payment as far as possible into the future , it is not unreasonable to suppose that the public debt will , within twenty years , have risen to $100,000,000 . Meanwhile the expenses of the government have been greatly incr*ased by additions to the national territory . The great increase of the business of the country , requiring an additional number of inspectors , guagers , weighers , will add considerably to the cost of collecting the revenue . The act of March 3d , 1845 , limiting the number of these officers , will need to be revised for the more effectual prevention of breaches or evasions of the revenue laws . The warehousing system , introduced by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that service . The necessity of creating new collection districts in Texas and California , in addition to those already established , is also a necessity for new expense . In the jugdment of the Secretary , no reduction is practicable in these branches of service ; on the contrary , the force will have to be increased . Nor are the expenses of the army , on a peace establishment , likely to be at all diininished . The necessity of protecting the frontier of Texas and New Mexico , and of maintaining military posts in the new territories , will draw largely upon the public purse , and there is every reason to believe that public opinion will soon demand a large addition to the navy for the protection of a commerce which attracts the attention and excites the jealousy of our commercial rivals . These latter suggestions are not , however , made by the Secretary of the Treasury . In a word , every thing points to a necessity for the adoption of the most efficient and economical means of increasing the revenue . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , or of specific duties , or the augmentation of the national debt . Concerning the first method , the imposition of direct taxes , it is unnecessary to say much at present . If democratic economists think it a popular measure , they will not fail to propose it to the people . To all the influence and popularity which can be gained by saddling the country with excises , corn taxes , land taxes , taxes on legal proceedings , on churches , school houses , live stock , and the various necessaries of life , they are welcome ; we shall not grudge it them ; but we confess we are ambitious of the honor , the credit , and the praise which will belong to us if we sue-116 Feb. // ceed in paying the expenses of the government by the direct and economical method of specillc duties . While at the same time we deprecate , nay , earnestly seek to avoid , the odium which must follow , if not in the present , then in the succeeding generation , of that slack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward the national liabilities into the future , and fix upon us , as a nation , the habit of paying in promises to be kept by our posterity . Not only , therefore , to meet our present necessities and provide for the increased expenses of our government , but to nip this great evil in the bud , to keep our national liabilities within manageable limits , we can not but give a warm support to the proposition of the honorable Secretary of the Treasury . Mr. Meredith has given us a statement of the excess of army and navy expenditure , occasioned by the war with Mexico . The excess of army expenditure for that purpose has been more than $58,800,000 , and to this , added the excess of naval expenditure , makes a total exceeding $63 , 600,000 . The increase of debt by the use of the public credit , to meet the additional expense , was only $49,009,000 ; leaving $14,600,000 to be paid out of the revenue . Land warrants to the amount of $18 , 000,000 have also been issued ; thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefrom accruing , in the sum of , perhaps , 2,000,000 . To this , howe v*r , no reasonable objection can be raised , as the issue of a land-warrant is a cheaper process than the sale of as much land at auction . Mr. Meredith estimates that had there been no unusual expenditure , there would have been a balance in the Treasury , on the 1st of July , of more than $12,600,000 . The Secretary attributes the deficit declared for the coming years to the extraordinary expenses of the war and treaty with Mexico ; and that the justly high public credit of the United States is not endangered by the fact , that a new h*an will be required . He proposes , therefore , that a loan not to exceed $16,500,000 , be authorized on such terms of interest and repayment as the President , in his discretion , shall , previous to their being issued , see fit to order . Mr. Meredith adds : " To provide for the payment out of the revenue of the instalment which will be due to Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure the raising of a fund for the gradual extinguishment of our heavy public debt , and to place the revenue on a sure basis of sufficiency for all the expenditures of the Government , it will be necessary to adopt measures for increasing the revenue ; and the most available means to that end are to be found in raising the duty on imports . That an economy as rigid as may be found compatible with the necessities of the country will regulate the appropriations , under existing circumstances can not be doubted . " " In proposing some alterations in the existing tariff , with a view , as well to the necessary augmentation of the revenue as the encouragement of industry , I think it right to present distinctly the views entertained on the latter subject , in the hope that a course may be adopted by the wisdoin and patriotism of Congress which may tend to harmonize discordant feelings and promote the general prosperity. ** Under this head , he says he entertains no doubt of the rightful power of Congress to regulate commerce and impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country . It will no doubt , at some future time be matter of wonder that it should ever have been necessary for any government , performing its natural duties , to defend such a position . The jevenue , in whatever shape , or by whatever means , or under whatever theory it is collected , has to be expended , after , its collection for the protection of the national industry and property . To this end forts are built , an army and navy is maintained , commerce is defended , territories are purchased from foreign nations , post-offices are established , light-houses are erected , and the rights of each and all are defended . By what species of argumentation are we then to be convinced , that these ends are to be thought solely during the expenditure , and never during the collection , of the public revenue . Lighthouses are established in order that those who engage in commercial enterprises may not wreck their property on rocks and shoals . Light-houses are there for the protection of persons engaged in navigation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live upon the products of the soil ; but it is 1850. 117 // not deemed expedient by Government that men should be solely farmers , or that the profits of the farmer should be limited to an exchange with his immediate neighbors ; it is deemed expedient that a new branch of industry should be created and fostered by that beneficent agency which wields the sovereign power of the people ; and for this reason light-houses are built and navies are maintained , and as yet our democratic theorists have raised no argument against this wide stretch of sovereignty ; they rather seem to glory in it . They have even been at the pains to fabricate a theory for its particular defence ; the theory of Free Trade . " I find no obligation written in the Constitution , " says Mr. Meredith , " to lay taxes , duties or imposts , at the lowest rate that will yield the largest revenue . " Can it be doubted for a moment that an injunction of the kind would directly contravene the intention of the constitution itself , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public good ; or that the power to regulate commerce and enforce duties given by the constitution , was given for the public good ? And would not that be , in spirit , an unconstitutional regulation which destroyed a branch of the national industry ? Let us suppose that one third of the population were already engaged in manufacture ; would not that be in spirit an unconstitutional regulation which impoverished that third in order that the remaining third might be enabled to live , for a time , more economically ? And was not the tariff of forty-six opposed to the general spirit of the constitution when it broke down the national industry and threw out of employment the workers in cloth and iron in order that the cultivators of the earth might procure foreign luxuries at a little lower rate ? Is it not protection with a vengeance , to make regulations for the little finger of industry which paralyze the right arm ? to make regulations for commerce , tending to a lessening of the material of commerce , and to a de*ession of that power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intelligence of the artizan ? " If it were true , that a duty laid on a given article with a view to encourage our own productions is unlawful , because it may operate , by discouraging importation , as a partial prohibition , the proposition would be equally* true of every duty laid with that intent , whether it were above or below the maximum revenue rate . But , as under the power to regulate commerce , it is competent for Congress to enact a direct and total prohibition of the importation of any article , it can be no objection to an act levying duties , that it may operate in partially preventing importation . Whether it be wise or just so to levy duties , is another question . What I mean to say now is , that there is no prohibition of it in the constitution . The proposition is maintained , as universally true , that the express grant of a power to Congress gives to that body the right of exercising that power in such manner as in its opinion may be most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances of the exercise of the power of regulating commerce , may be mentioned the prohibition of importations , except at designated ports ; the prohibition of the coasting trade to all foreign vessels , and to all American vessels , not licensed and enrolled ; the prohibition of certain trade to foreign vessels under the Navigation act of 1817 ; the prohibition of certain trade to American vessels by the Non-intercourse act , and of all trade by the Embargo act ; the drawback on the reexportation of foreign goods ; finally , the prohibition of the introduction of adulterated drugs into the country by the act of 26th June , 1848 . " Under the power to levy taxes , duties , and imposts , I refer to the discriminating tonnage duties on foreign vessels , the discriminating duties on their cargoes , the preamble to the first law imposing duties passed under the constitution , and the enactments of most of the subsequent ones . " These enactments show that at most or all periods of our history the views which I have expressed appear to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , conferring a certain power , or range of power , upon Congress , is given with the understanding that that power shall be exercised with discretion , and in no instance to the detriment of the national health , liberty , or prosperity . The maxim of Free Trade , that government shall collect its revenues with regard only to its own financial neces l 's Feb. // sities , taken as it is commonly understood , has not only an aspect of inhumanity , but contravenes its own intention ; for it might be contended that a system of policy tending to increase the internal resources of the country , that is to say , that a policy established for the protection of agriculture and manufactures , would be of necessity advantageous to commerce . It is hardly necessary to urge , that as the commerce of the country is measured by its internal wealth , its material being the exchangeable surplus of that wealth , regulatzons for the protection of agriculture and manufactures are ejjectually regulations for the augmentation of commerce itself Moreover , as the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that which yields the largest return to the country which engages in it , is a commerce in manufactured articles . " Great Britain exports chiefly what she has first brought to the form in which it is ready for ultimate consumption ; it is at the stage of its highest value , and her market is almost co-extensive with the civilized world . " All history shows that where are the workshops of the world , there must be the marts of the world , and the heart of wealth , commerce , and power . It is as vain to hope to make these marts by providing warehouses , as it would be to make a crop by building a barn . " And again : " Commerce is the machinery of *xchnnge . It is the handmaid of agriculture and manufactures . It will not be affirmed that it is ever positively injurious-but it will be more or less useful as it co-operates more or less with the productive industry of the country . The mere carriage of commodities by sea or land is necessarily profitable only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be useful or not to others , according to circumstances . The farmer finds a railroad a great convenience , but he understands that it is better employed in carrying his crop , than in carrying away his seed-wheat and manure . " The commerce which should consist in carrying cotton-seed abroad , 4o be there grown , would not be so useful as that which is now occupied in exporting the raw cotton grown at home . We should easily understand , also , that the commerce thus employed would be much more limited in amount and much- , less profitable to the carriers than what we now have . Yet our commerce is , in fact , of the same nature with that above described . The seed bears to the cotton the same relation which cotton bears to the cloth . If we now export cotton of the value of about sixty-six millions , the same cotton , when converted into cloth , would make an export of some two hundred and sixty-four millions , or some two hundred and forty-five millions after deducting the fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption ( in addition to the portion of our present manufactures , consumed at home ) , and our imports would be thereby in like manner increased . England , at this moment , derives a large portion of her power from spinning and weaving our cotton . When we shall spin and weave it ourselves , make our own iron , and manufacture our other staples , we shall have transferred to this country the great centres of wealth , comn*erc e , civilization , and political , as well as moral and intellectual power . " Political economy seems to be , with most men , an affair of the imagination ; in fact , a department of poetry . We hear much of the white wings of commerce whitening the shores of continents . A ship is indeed a very beautiful object , but so also is a well-cultivated farm , diversified with grass fields , copses , and slopes of golden grain . Viewed in the purple light of morning , while the misty hollows are yet fresh with dew , it is a sight that sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the good Father under whose inspiration Man has accomplished so beautiful and so good a work . Nor is our wonder less excited and our admiration awakened by that other evidence of the Divine skill guiding the human hand , the workshop of the artizan . Winding by some rugged pathway along the declivity of a mountain , we hear far below a subterannean thunder . The rigid leaves of the pine tremble above us . The forest quivers with the din . We descend , and here , fixed upon rocks , under the spray of a cataract , we discover the shop of the iron forger . A mighty hammer , in shape and bulk like a frngment of rock , leaps frantic at its task , moulding the glowing metal with a terrible 119 // facility and precision . The blind forces of nature are controlled and tempered by a little cord in the hand of a child . Here , too , there is room for the mysterions pleasure of contemplation . In all those works wherein reason appears , Divinity also is made evident ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is a weak and ill-cultivated intellect that suffers its admiration for a particular result of human skill to draw it from the true aim of statemanship , the common good . There is a sublimity in the contemplation of the public good , of the moral and physical wellbeing of a people , far more exalting and satisfactory to the intellect than in these contemplations oe art and nature . In the recesses of his heart the sincere and liberal statesman must carry the weight of an awful responsibility , and the latent strength of the man , or if we may be allowed the expression , his nearness to God , appears then most when he is called to guide the opinion and advance the interest of a nation . Of the moral effects of intercourse with foreign nations , much may be said ; but the moral effects of intercourse are not measured by the *extent of trade . The moral and intellectual power exercised by Germany over America , during the last twenty years , has been so great , it can be compared only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution of ideas , manners and opinions , silent but irresistible : and yet the trade with Germany , measured by imports and exports , is so small , its loss wouh* be hardly felt a year or two after its cessation . Were a prohibition laid upon ships from Germany , the mighty industry of America would , in twelve months , supply the void : but Germany would not cease therefore to be the intellectual master and teacher of the American people . Were our commercial intercourse with England , even , suspended for a term of years , who doubts that the capital and the energy afloat in that vast and profitable trade , would seek and find new fields of enterprise . Great as such a calamil*y would indeed be , it would be by no means a permanent or an irretrievable one : not as injurious as the destruction of a*single branch of industry : a period of ten years would perhaps be sufficient to heal the wound laid open , to fill up the breach made , to give a new course to power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the . cotton plantations , or of the manufactories of Massachusetts . hnngine a blight of corn , devastating one-half the country ,  --  what would be the extinc tion of an English commerce compared with that ? We over-estimate the pecuniary advantages of commerce . The Hon. Secretary says that he will not admit that commerce can be ever injurious ; but , with all deference , we think it may become so , when its protection becomes a mania with politicians , who , at the same time , are too perversely blind , or too ignorant to see what its true interests are ; and who would convert its favor in the minds of the people into an argument for the destruction of that by which it best thrives-for the destruction of manufactures . The industry of the carrier can not be set up in rivalry against , the industry of the producer . The horse who carries flour to market is not more valuable than the horse who carries it to mill . The carrier himself is not a more estimable man , by vocation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of this argument the friends of free trade have either neglected to observe , or have kept out of view , the fact that a commerce is more or less valuable as that which it carries has received more or less value from the industry of those who have sent it forth . A trade in gold may indeed prove a very unprofitable trade , even when it is a monopoly . A varied commerce sustained by manufactures , the ship of the exporter conveying the goods which the capital or the industry of his friend or his brother has created out of a coarse and worthless material , other things being equal , must lead to wealth . Mr. Meredith assumes that all legislation designed to favor a particular class to the prejudice of others , or , worse still , to injure a particular class for the benefit of others , is manifestly unwise and unjust . What then more unjust and injurious than the tariff of 1846 , which was enacted , first , to favor the commercial interests to t113 prejudice of the manufacturers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of the agriculturalists and the commercial classes ? for though it seem a hard judgment , it is impossible to deny that the advocates of free-trade have discovered a spirit positively and openly 120 // inimical to the artizan . By every argument in their power they have endeavored to diminish our respect for him ; they have represented him as lower in the moral scale than his brother the agriculturalist , and they have discovered no remorse for the injury which their measures have inflicted upon him . By inviting a foreign rival to compete with him , they have cut down his wages , and when he came to them with bitter complaints of the injustice , their reply has been , change your business , - seek a new employment ,  --  learn a new trade . Nay , they have so far insulted his misfortune and his natural rights as a man , as to say to him : - you have mistaken your business ; you should have been a tiller of the earth ; American citizens have no business with manufactures ; nature intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishmen and Frenchmen who shall be permitted to work it up and confer value upon it by an intelligent industry . The fallacies of public economy are perhaps the most subtle that confuse and agitate the human mind ; for this department of knowledge is not , as many have imagined , a science reducible to propositions , and capable of syllogistic forms . The deduction of its first principles is from a wide arid general experience in the business and intercourse of life . It is perhaps impossible for one wholly unacquainted with affairs to understand it . To feel the value of its rules and maxims we must be , or we must l*ve been , in a double contact with the world ,  --  a social and an economical contact . Every step in the reasonings of public economy must be taken upon a firm ground ; there must be no leaping or striding with the lifts of imagination . The wings of anticipation must be pinioned to the side , and every nerve of sense suffered to come rudely in contact with reality . What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enlarged and generalized experience of an individual with his own ? and that , too , not of a one sided or partial activity , narrowed by following too iRtently a single line of occupation , but by a general observation and understanding of all businesses , and an appreciation of their value compared with others . A complete and accomplished farmer , banker , or negotiator might very easily be a wretched economist in public affairs ; but the knowledge of banking , in reference to the general business of the community , and of the arts of agriculture and general negotiation , as they are integral parts of the national industry , may be well conceived to be indispensible to the statesman . " As every producer , " says Mr. Meredith , " in one branch of useful industry , is also a consumer of the products of others , and as his ability to consume depends upon the profits of his production , it follows , that to give prosperity to one branch of industry , is to increase the rest . " A proposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means limited to a single , narrow line of occupation , but either versed in , or by thorough observation well informed of the positive and relative value of many . We find , in this report , a principle developed , which has already been alluded to but which , from its importance , requires continual enforcement and reiteration . " No country can attain a due strength of prosperity that does not by its own labor carry its own productions as nearly as possible to the point necessary to fit them for ultimate consumption . To export its raw material and re-import the articles manufactured from it , or to neglect its own raw materials and import the articles manufactured from that of another country , is to pretermit the means which nature has provided for its advancement . " For instance , we exported , during the fiscal year , ending 30th June , 1848 , raw cotton to the value of about sixty-six millions of dollars . If that cotton had been spun and woven at home , ( supposing its value to be increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of about one-hundred and ninety-eight millions in addition . What would have been the effect of this increased production on the prosperity of the country . " * * * * * * " The manufacture of cotton cloth is begun with the planting of the cotton-is carried to a certain point by the planter , and then taken up and perfected by the spinner and weaver . The planter and manufacturer are not engaged in different branches of industry , but in the same-the one commences the process which the other completes . Cotton seed of insignificant value being by regular stages of labor deve. * 1850. 121 // loped and brought to the form of cotton cloth , has acquired a value of about two hundred and sixty-four millions . " The planting States have added many millions to the annual production of the country by the culture of cotton . By continuing the process they could quadruple that addition . " The planter would then have a market at his door for all his produce , and the farmer would in like manner have a home market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breadstuffs , but of every article useful or necessary in the feeding , clothing , and ho using of man , would be vastly increased  --  the consumer and producer would be brought nearer to each other  --  and in fact a stimulus would be applied to every branch of productive industry . " It is gratifying to know that the manufacture of cotton has already been introduced into several of the planting States , and it ought not to be doubted will rapidly be extended . " The manufacture of iron , wool , and our other staples would lead to similar results . The effect would be a vast augmentation of our wealth and power . Upon commerce the effects might be expected to be still more marked . It is not enough to say that no country ever diminished its commerce by increasing its productions-and that no injury would therefore result to that interest . There would probi*Ay be not only a great increase in the amount , but an improvement not less important in the nature of our commerce . The single article of cotton is taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important than some others ; for it is perhaps the greatest misfortune that can befal a manufacturing people to have its attention directed upon a single material of industry to the neglect of all others . * * * * * * We must refuse to admit , ever* for the sake of argument , that the rules of economy differ either in their economical or moral foundation , fron those which ought to regulate private affairs . The people never can know anything of " reasons of state ; " - if they are to be sovereigns , as it is claimed they are , then the government must . be managed in their manner ; that is to say , by the rules of common honesty , and common prudence . Let kings and subtle ministers go on refining ; of their subtleties the people have no knowledge ; and if they or their representatives depart from those simple rules of construction , by which the massive framework of the state is held together , the fabric ifiust fall about their ears . The equitable working of this system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , that were foreign goods admitted duty free , the revenue would have to be collected by direct taxation . This taxation would have to bear equally upon every species of property . The taxes for the general govcrnment would probably be collected by the same agents who collcct for the State governments , and upon the same species of property . No other system would be esteemed equitable . If extraordinary expenses were to be met , excises on liquors and other luxuries would probably be tried . By the system of direct taxation the expenses of the general government would be severely felt by every tax-payer . Poll taxes are always inequitable , as they bear more heavily upon the poor ; the revenues would consequently be collected upon real and personal property . A sudden addition of forty millions to the general taxes would be severely felt by a population of twenty-one millions , of whom only a third or thereabouts would be the real tax-payers . The annual importation of foreign luxuries would become cheaper , other things being equal , to the amount of taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions cheaper . Were the duty-payers the same with the tax-payers , it would make but little difference to them , whether they paid a land tax or paid a duty , the one would not be more burdensome than the other . It might , however , be more agreeable to pay a vo ! - untary tax for luxuries which they were not obliged to use , than to pay a forced and inevitable one on real estate , &amp;c. , collected by a government officer . But the tax-payers would not be the same as the duty-payers . The tax-payers would be every holder of property in 122 Feb. // the nation , under an equitable and democratic system . The rich man who used only a few foreign luxuries would have an enormous tax to pay , and the poor man who used none would have still a tax to pay : while those who owned no land might live luxuriously , paying no taxes at all . Foreign cloths , foreign wines , foreign fruits , foreign jewelry , in short every minute article of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be indulged in by those who owned no land but were , nevertheless , spenders of money . Republics are governments for the poor , and it is agreeable to their institutions to discourage luxury . The doctrines of free trade are for the benefit of the idle and luxurious , removing the burthens of wealth to the back of poverty and industry . We have said , that if general tax-payers were , to the same amount , under a tariff system , duty-payers , it would make but little difference to them , except as they might prefer a voluntary to an involuntary payment . This , however , is not strictly true . The constant effort of ownership is to escape taxation . Taxed property is more troublesome than untaxed . If the entire taxation of the country rested upon land alone , the selling price of land would be depressed not only to the entire amount of the taxation , but much more than that ; because of a general aversion among property holders to taxation as a system . In cities , houses would be built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over small spaces of ground . Provisions would be dear , and farm wages low . Ground rents would be high , and the profits of the owners small . Capital would generally avoid investment in land . The number of those who live by ingenuity only , and by trade , would increase beyond the natural limit , while the number of agriculturalists would diminish , and the small farmers in general be broken up or crushed with mortgages . Can any one doubt the injuriousness of such a system ? The general theory of democracy fa'wrs the laud owner , and the cultivators of the soil . It ought , therefore , to demand the removal of taxation from land and its imposition upon every other species of property . The endeavor of the opposition leaders is at present , however , the reverse of this . The people are invited to remove every restriction from trade , and to give that branch of indu*stry a privilege of exemption , throwing the entire burden of taxation upon agriculture and manufacture . The fact that their system of measures is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sufficient proof of its absurdity . Every important act of legislation in England has been with a view to sustain her manufactures against our own . If she admits the raw material of industry duty free , it is for the benefit of the manufacturing capitalists . If she admits corn at a low duty , it is that her operators may be content with low wages . Her manufactures are her wealth . She has the world for a market , and must retain it or yield her place as the wealthiest and most powerful nation . England stood ready to admit corn and cotton almost duty free from Amer. - ica , and only desired America to admit her manufactures in exchange  --  a state of things precisely the most favorable to her and the most disadvantageous to ourselves . We had but one market for our corn and cotton ; she had a thousand for her manufactures . Bread stuffs and cotton are difficult and costly of carriage ; manufactures cheaply and easily transported . By abolishing the navigation act , she reduced freights to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enlarging the profits of the manufacturer , who could thus procure more cheaply his raw material , and transport his commodities at less cost to himself . At the same time , every argument was employed by England to urge America into a larger production of corn and cotton , that the prices of their commodities might be as far as possible reduced . A theory of free-trade constructed by closet politicians , and seized upon by the shrewder sort as a valuable tool for their purposes , was sent over and formally pre .. sented to the democracy here as a testimony of esteem from the capitalists of England . Mr. Walker and his friends received the mischievous keep-sake with transport , never observing the grin of malign satisfac .. tion with which the gift was accompanied . During all this great controversy , which has now agitated England and America for an entire age , has any person , either in the closet or out of it , taken the pains to inquire into the causes of the controversy it-* 1850. 123 // self ? Has any person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-trade doctrines in America and at home ? Come , then , let us see whether any light will spring out upon such a question . England was once the workshop of all nations . She had no rival . She protected her agriculture by corn laws , her commerce and manufactures by tariffs and navigation laws . All at once a rival appears , and , as usual , she picks a quarrel and begins a war . An embargo , forbidding the use of English manufactures , creates a new spirit of enterprise among the people of America , who begin instantly to manufacture for themselves the conveniences for which they had before depended upon England . The war is ended . England has gained nothing by it . On the contrary , she has only added a new element of power to the strength of her rival , who has now learned the secret of selfprotection , and by keeping up her embargo in the form of tariffs , not only protects her own industry but begins to compete with England in the market of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain he depresses the wages of his laborers to the starving point at home . Ruin impends . A new thought seizes him . He invents , in the retirement of his closet , a theory of free-trade , a specious bait for philanthropists , a rare morsel for the discontented in America . It is the ha*uit of the English mind to examine the facts before concocting the theory . The facts were , that a greater freedom of trade was necessary in the commercial and manufacturing pre-eminence of England ; the theory followed of course . Its application to America was a happy stroke , a piece of excellent wisdom . The tar*Jfs of the United States have been , and are the causes of the present freei cm of trade in England . Had England never had a rival , free-trade would have been unnecessary for her , and , therefore , unthought of . Shalli weedar&amp;to say that the destruction of the protective system in America , would soon be followed by its re-establishment in Engli*nd ? Such is at e ast our own opinion . The constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection is , that they favor one class of the community at the expense of another . Nothing could b&amp;more absurd . Where does the tax fall ? On the consumer ? Let it be admitted that it does so , and exclusively too . A tariff of 40 cents a yard is laid on a particular kind of cloth . It is optional witW consumers of that cloth to use it or not . A large revenue is raised thereby . So far all is right , the object of the tariff is to raise a revenue , the higher the tariff under a certain limit , the larger the revenue , and its specific imposition keeps it free from fluctuation and fraudulent valuation . The choice will be among articles of cxpence and luxury , chiefly cloths , cutlery , &amp;c. , of a description not absolutely necessary to life , and too costly to be made at home . So far , there is no injustice done ; the democratic principle of equality and freedom has been adhered to : the object was to raise revenue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every tariff , however great , however small , is protective . The 30 per cent . ad va oi em on English cotton cloths is protective , and powerfully so . It protects a certain grade of manufacturers . A higher tariff would protect still higher grades . The fact of its protective operation has not yet been cited against it . The largest revenue will be raised by tar*Js upon articles which are used but not manufactured in this country , and these at the same time will be the most protective in their operation . Let us suppose , for example , that a certain kind of expensive broad cloth is largely used in America but not manufactured there , because of the outlay required for its manufacture . The price will be kept by the English manufacturer as high as possible , as long as he fears no competition . The American capitalist knows that the price demanded by the importer is factitious , and can be lowered in an instant . He , therefore , wisely abstains from engaging in the manufacture of the article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there is no limit to this species of extortion except the competition of rival houses in England , ( a danger which they can obviate by a compact among themselves ) or the inability of buyers in America to pay what is asked . The importer will therefore fix the price at the point of largest profit ; a point very disad // vantageous to the purchasers . Importers and foreign manufacturers operating together , with this absolute control over prices , can easily crush all attempts at a home manufacture of the article in question . And they systematically do so , acting on the natural instincts of acquisition . Let the government now ascertain the difference between the highest and lowest values of this species of goods . Let it be 50 cents the yard . If a specific duty is then laid at perhaps 40 cents the yard , it will yield a large revenue . At the lowest values the importers will make a profit-at the highest he will injure his market by putting the goods beyond the reach of most buyers . The imposition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that now the range of fluctuation in its value is limited to 20 cents the yard . Still , however , the market is not injured ; a fair profit is made by the importer ; but he is unable to raise his prices higher than is necessary for a fair profit , since by doing so he injures his market . He has a hearty good will to keep the price at the highest , and would have done so at any rate . He is now compelled to do so for other reasons . It is , therefore , in this particular instance , not the consumer , not the public , but the manufacturer and the importer who pay the duty . It comes out of their pockets . England and her supporters were already taking the money out of the purses of Americas consumers , but by a judicious tariff the government transferred these exorbitant profits to the national treasury . Could anything more just or expedient have been imagined ? The deep river of wealth that was flowing toward England is turned , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the end . American capitalists begin soon to discover that the article , thus taxed , can now be manufactured at home ; the foreign manufacturer having it no longer in his power to lower the price beyond a certain point . Then begins protection , as a natural consequence of a system calculated for the time to raise the largest revenue . The goods begin soon to be made at home . They are at first of an inferior character , and are forced with difficulty into the market . Two years is a short term for the establishment of any manufacture . Another year will be consinned in , forcing the home fabric into equal competition with the foreign . At first , every manufacture is expensive ; but as machinery improves , the article improves and the price goes down . A term of five years is perhaps necessary for this effect . Meanwhile , the revenue is gradually diminished by the disuse of the foreign article . After five or six years , the tariff begins to operate as a prohibition , and the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cheapen every process and improve their manufacture to the utmost The specific duty has to be lowered . Again the foreign commodity comes in . The process is continued to that point where a fair and equal competition has brought the foreign and home manufacturers so*near to an equality that a very moderate revenue can be realized by a tariff equal to their difference , and this solely by the adjustment of a duty calculated for the time to raise the largest revenue . The tariff in that particular article of commerce has ceased , indeed , to yield a revenue , but a vast increase of wealth to the country at large has been the consequence . Such is the operation of a truly protective tariff . Knowing , as we do , that had prices been left to English manufacturers to regulate , they would have kept them at the highest possible level , and that a competition among foreigners themselves , with the markets of the world at their control , is not sufficient to bring prices down to their just limits , the charge that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absurd . It may do so in particular instances ; but when prices are high , it is a necessary cbnsequence , that the loss by duty falls upon the foreign manufacturer . The duty is simply a diversion juto the public treasury of a stream of wealth that would otherwise JIow into the pockets o the foreign manufacturers . That the profits to the treasury are gradually lessened by the substitution of the home article , is not an injury to the people . In that case , the stream which was diverted from the purse of the foreigner into the national treasury , is now diverted , in stead , into the purses of the farmers and artisans who supply food and labor for the mannI facture of the article ; and is it not better 125 // so , than as at first ? In a word , it is impossible to conceive a more certain , safe , and just method of enriching and swelling the strength and numbers of a people , than the method of Protection . In the instance taken for the illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits of importation first into the national treasury and finally into the purses of the people , prices were assumed to have been raised to the highest point by the eagerness of importers and foreign manufacturers ; but if the prices of foreign imported commodities have been reduced by the competition of foreigners among themselves , if a duty is affixed , the consumers will have either to pay the duty or do without the commodity : if it is one of the necessaries of life , they will purchase , notwithstanding the injury inflicted by the excessive price . A tariff , in this case , is equivalent to a direct tax laid upon the consumer by government in the exact ratio of his consumption . If the duty so far elevates the price of the commodity as to tempt home industry to try its strength with the foreigner , the duty raised for revenue merely will have a protective influence upon home industry . If itbe an ad valorem* duty , varying directly with the price of the commodity , this protection will be greatest when the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent. - then , if the price of the article be one dollar , it would be equivalent to a bonus of thirty cents for every dollar of capital cxpen*ed by the home manufacturer : as soon , however , as the home manufacturer " *1 will proceed to state the nature of the modifications which it appears expedient to make in the existing tariff , and , if required , will hereafter present a plan in detail . " 1 . The rates of duty are , in my opinion , too low , especially on articles similar to our own staples . I conceive that the revenue has suffered materially from this circumstance . Indeed , I am compelled to believe that it would have been greatly diminished but for the extraordinary demand for our bread-stufl* and provisions , produced by the famine in Europe in 1847 , and to a great extent continued by the short crop abroad in 1848 . ( See statement marked M , hereto annexed . ) Even under these favorable circumstances the average revenue from woollens , cottons ; hempen goods , iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen under the act of 1846 from $14,162,107 to $13,392,624 50 , taking the average from the receipts of 1845-1846 , and those of 1848-1849 ; being an average diminution of $769,982 60 , as engages in producing the article , the price of the foreign ' * commodity is lowered to under-sell him ; but as the price falls , the revenue accruing is diminished . If the price fall fifty per cent. , the revenue will be diminishdd one-half , &amp;c . Thus we see that the natural effect of an ad valorem duty is at first protective , and in the second stage of its operation tends to diminish the revenue . The commerce of the United States will not yield a sufficient revenue to the government with a system of duties generally low . Thirty per cent . on every valuable species of importation , excepting tea and coffee , barely yields a sufficient revenue . If the costs of production in England are in general a third less than in America , thirty per cent . specific or ad valorem is a protective duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that the removal of the present duty , small as it is , would have disastrous effects . Let us now consider whether any injustice can be charged upon the system considered as one of protection , ( as , to a certain extent , it truly is , ) under the supposition that the duty is paid by the consumer , the profits of the importer remaining the same . And first , it is necessary that a revenue should be raised ; it is necessary , also that it should be raised by the most economical process . A tariff is believed to be the most economical process ; but under all circumstances it is a transient method , serving its purpose only for a certain number of years , because of its pro- will be seen by table marked ( N ) , hereto annexed ; the loss of annual revenue being as follows : On cottons $918,894 00 On hempen goods 81,794 50 On sugar 181,741 50 On salt 348,438 50 On coal 70,030 00 $1,580,898 00 The gain as follows : On woollens $355,592 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 40,083 00 $810,915 50 " The very small increaseon the staples of woollens , iron , and unmanufactured hemp , compared 126 Feb. // tective influence creating home manufactures which continually diminish the amount and value of foreign importation . The consumer learns gradually to prefer the home manufacture and to dispense with the foreign , and the character of commerce is in consequence continually changing : the raw material and luxuries of other climates being substituted by the importers for those foreign manufactured articles which , in consequence of a home competition , they find no longer profitable . While this change of imports is going on , an analogous change of exports is going on at the same rate . An exportation of manufactured articles takes the place of an exportation of raw materials . And this is the present condition of England : that country derives a considerable revenue from the importation of materials used in the arts . The same series of events is now happening in America , and the time is perhaps not far distant when a sufficient revenue can no longer be realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injury been inflicted upon the country by a course of legislation which changes its commerce from an importation of manufactures and an exportation of raw materials to the reverse ? Is that an injurious system of policy which causes the raw material of industry to be consumed at home and provides a supply of manufactures for exportation ? which , in fine , is fa* giving to America the advantages for which England is contending with with the vast injury occasioned to our production , and the diminution thereby of our power of consumption , can not fail to attract attention-while on the other articles named , the revenue and production have both suffered materially . It is believed that the revenue could be greatly increased by increasing the duties on these and other articles . " 2 . I propose a return of the system of specific duties on articles on which they can be conveniently laid . The effects of the present ad valorem system *. re two-fold , viz. : on the revenue and on our own productions . Experience has Pthink demonstrated , that looking exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed , more favorable to commerce , more equal and less exposed to frauds , than any other system . Of course such a duty is not laid without reference to the average cost of the commodity . This system obviates the difficulties and controversies which attend an appraisement of the foreign market value of each the entire force of her population ? " But the instance ! the instance ! you elude the instance ! " exclaims our free-trader . " You can not deny that a tariff working a sufficient protection of iron , for example , is an injustice to the community , who arc thereby compelled to pay a higher price for it ! " By no means . It is not an injustice to the community to raise a sufficient revenue upon iron , an article of general use . On the contrary , it is a very equal mode of taxation . The tariff is laid for revenue ; its direction only , and specific application is for protection . The largest revenue is raised where the largest protection is given , when an article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed very soon diminish that revenue ; but with what effects ? Plainly , the transfer of the profits of iron-making from English to American industry . The profits which passed over to England , now remain with the American farmer who supplies food to the iron-worker , and the American artizan who converts the ore into articles of use . And does a legislation which does all this , work an injustice to the community ? " But the community must now pay a higher price for iron , and by this system they are taxed for the support of a particular manufacture . " Granted that they are so , temporarily ; does it follow that thereby a greater injustice is worked than must be by every system of tariffs , be they for protection or not ? Every duty laid upon an imported commodity , benefits a particular invoice , and it imposes an equal duty on equal quantities of the same commodity . Under the ad valorem system , goods of the same kind and quality , and between which there can not be a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nevertheless may often pay different amounts of duty . Thus the hazards of trade arc unnecessarily increased . " To levy an ad valorem duty on a foreign valn. ation equably , at the different ports , is believed to be impossible . That the standard of value at any two ports is precisely the same at any given time , is wholly improbable . The facilities afforded to fraud upon the revenue are very great , and it is apprehended that such frauds have been and are habitually and extensively practised . The statements annexed , marked ( 0 ) , to which I invite especial attention , exhibit in a strong light the dangers to which this system is necessarily exposed . " As the standard of value at every port must 1850. 127 // class of producers . This effect is inherent in the system . The farmers who supply the workmen of the coal mines with food , are directly benefited by a tariff upon British coal . They , however , in their turn are consumers . The more they have , the more they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also distribute . As they increase in numbers and in wealth , they buy more and bett6r clothes , and thus they confer a direct benefit upon the cotton and wool-grower . All that the cotton-grower asks , is a liberal market . By creating a population of iron-workers and miners in the country , he provides a steadier and for the first five or six years ; but he has created a home market for his cot- at last depend upon the average of the invoices that are passed there , every successful attempt at under-valuation renders more easy all that follow it .

As long ago as 1801 , Mr. Gallatin urged the extension of specific duties on the ground now repeated-of the prevention of under-valuation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language : " Without any view to an increase of revenue , hut in order to guard , as far as posssible , aganat the value of goods being under-rated in the invoices1 it would he eligihle to lay spec*lc duties on all such articles now paying duties ad valorem as may be susceptible of that alteration " At that time specific duties were already laid on spirits and wines , sugar , molasses , tea , coffee , salt , pepper , steel , nails and spikes , hemp , coal , cordage , and several other articles . * * * * * * * " In England it is believed to have long been a ton , wrought into cloth , which yields him a profit ten or a dozen , or even an hundred times beyond his increased expenses . " All men , " says Mr. Meredith , " are by turns producers and consumers , ** and in this view we are ready to give an unequivocal denial to the dogma of free-trade , " that protection extended to any branch of industry , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an injustice , unless it is awkwardly and injudiciously applied . There is indeed no good , that may not be converted , by misapplication , into an evil . The tariff for which we argue is a judicious and reasonable one , calculated first for the immediate raising of a sufficient revenue , and secondly , to work protection to the food-growers and artisans of the United States . settled point that specific or rated duties ( which are ad valorem on an assumed value , ) are in every respect better for revenue and trade than any other system . " The effect of the existing system on production is also striking . See document marked ( ) annexed . It tends to aggravate the great fluctuations in price which arc so injurious to trade as well as industry . " When prices abroad are very high the duty is high also and when they fall to a very low point the duty is low in proportion . It is a sliding scale of the worst kind . If the duty forms a part of the price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other by a per percentage on the range equal to the rate of the duty . If the fluctuation abroad be from $50 to $20 , the range is of course $30 . A specific duty of $15 would leave the range still $30 . But at an ad valorem of 30 per cent. , the highest point would he $65 , and the lowest $26 , making a range of $39 . On every account I strongly recommend a return to the system of specific duties on all articles to which they can be conveniently applied . "
