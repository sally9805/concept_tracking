IT is fortunate for the people of the United States that their interests do not often depend , to any great extent , upon the legislative action of Congress . In the distribution of authority between the National and the State Governments , so much power is reserved to the latter , so many subjects fall exclu-19* // sively within their control , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to act , if it should fall asleep , or remain in a comatose state , for a year or two , no great harm would result . At any rate , it might easily provide for such a long suspension of its activity , by merely appending a clause to each of the annual appropriation bills , providing that if Congress did not come together again for five or ten years , the government might draw from the national treasury , for each of those years , sums equal in amount to those appropriated by the bill for the first year , and might expend them for the same specified objects . Perhaps it should also be provided , that each of these sums might be increased from year to year in the same ratio with the growth of the population . If a general appropriation bill of this character were passed , we are quite confident that the interests of the country would not suffer , and its reputation would certainly be increased , if Congress should adjourn to the next century . This opinion may appear extravagant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to appeal to the action , or rather the inaction , of the present Congress . The Senators and Representatives , collected from all parts of the Union , and chosen with great care in each case , - the honor of an election being highly and almost universally prized , - have now ( May 23 ) been in session , and have apparently been hard at work , for nearly six months ; and how much have they accomplished ? They have passed just four laws ; only one of which , that for taking the seventh census , is of any public importance . The urgency in this case was very great ; for if provision had not been made in season for taking the census this summer , the whole number of representatives for the next Congress could not have been apportioned among the several States , as the Constitution requires . The Representatives , therefore , could not have been chosen ; and our supposition would have been more than fulfilled ; - the present Congress would have been the last of its race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so desirable did it seem that Congress should not again be exposed to the danger of dying out in this discreditable fashion , that , at the eleventh hour , amendments were introduced into the bill , fixing the ratio on which the Representatives should be distributed among the States , and ordering that the present bill should continue in force if Congress , // ten years hence , should fail to provide a substitute for it . We think the contrivers of these amendments showed great sagacity , and a proper appreciation of the character of the honorable body to which they belonged . The first amendment indicates their apprehension lest , after the whole number of persons in the country shall be determined by the census , the present Congress at its next session should become involved in so long and so warm a dispute as to the number which shall be taken as a divisor of the whole , or which shall he allowed to choose one Representative , that the fourth of March , the limit of Congressional life , would arrive before the dispute could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their fears lest , ten years hence , Congress should wholly fail to enact any law for taking a new census . With admirable statesmanship , they provide for both contingencies ; they provide for the probable future inability of Congress to legislate at all , even in regard to the measures absolutely necessary* for the continuance of its own existence . If they would append similar amendments to the annual appropriation bills , they would earn the lasting gratitude of all future Congresses , for relieving them from the very slight measure of work which it is still absolutely necessary for them to perform . They might then meet , to wrangle , make speeches , and call the yeas and nays , for the whole period of one year , three months , and four days , which is the constitutional limit of their existence ; and the whole country would regard their proceedings with perfect indifference . We would not treat this matter lightly , nor manifest any want of respect to the individual members of both houses of our national legislature , many of whom enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and patriots . The Senate , in particular , is composed , for the most part , of men who might honorably have sustained their part in the most distinguished legislative assembly which has been convened in any country or in any age ; and among the Representatives , there are a few who would not disgrace any post of public service to which they might be called . And even when the members of Congress are taken collectively , or in a mass , we are aware that the evil of which we complain is not to be ascribed exclusively to them , hut partly to the system , and partly to the constituencies by whom they are elected . But , // by whatever causes produced , the evil in question has now attained so great a height , that it would be criminal to affect any further delicacy in pointing it out lest individuals should feel themselves aggrieved by our plain speaking . We complain , then , that both houses of Congress have been virtually transformed into noisy and quarrelsome debating clubs , to the almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of which is postponed to the last two or three days of the session . Then , all the bills which have been proposed , only a very few of which have undergone any discussion , are huddled together , and , after calling the yeas and nays almost continuously for many hours together , the laws which are most essential to the continued existence of the government , such as the appropriation bills , are passed under the pressure of " the previous question , " and the others die a natural death , or go to sleep till the next session . Among the bills which thus come to nothing are most of those which have been debated during a greater part of the session . Thus , the two functions of Congress , debating and legislating , are effectually separated from each other ; some bills are debated without being enacted , others are enacted without being debated . What is called " the long session** of each Congress usually continues about eight months , of which perhaps seven months and twenty-five days are passed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other five days are given to legislation . The expense of such a session to the country is nearly fifteen hundred thousand dollars . These statements appear so extraordinary that we must give the figures to support them . Of the 66 laws enacted during the first session of the 28th Congress , 40 , or nearly two thirds of the whole , were passed during the last three days of the session . At the second , or short , session of the same body , 24 laws , just half of the whole number , went through their last stage on the last day of the session . At the first term of the 29th Congress , out of 79 public laws , only 27 were enacted during the first six months , while 29 were passed during the last three days ; at the second term , out of 47 , all but 19 were completed on the last two days of the session . The 30th Congress paid a little more attention to the public business ; at its first term , out of 102 laws , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its close ; but at its second // term , only 16 laws out of 60 were enacted when the Congress had but two days more to live . The present , or 31st , Congress , as we have seen , has made a woful beginning ; it has been six months in session , and it has enacted but four laws . The Representatives were three weeks in session , and balloted 64 times , before they could choose a speaker ; three snore weeks elapsed before a clerk and a sergeant at arms were chosen , and the organization of the house is not yet complete , for a doorkeeper and a postmaster still remain to be elected . But speeches have been delivered by the cartload and public documents printed by the ton , though not a tenth part of the former were listened to , nor a hundredth part of the latter read , by the persons to whom they were immediately addressed . If these results are compared with the action of any of the State legislatures in the Union , the contrast exhibited will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak definitely only of that State with whose legislative action we are naturally most familiar , - of Massachusetts . Her General Court , as it is called , is usually in session only about four months of each year ; and during this period , in 1849 , it passed 248 general and special statutes , and 120 resolves ; 25 of the former and 15 of the latter were completed during the first two months of the session , though the members were chiefly occupied during this early period in the committee rooms , in maturing the several measures which were afterwards to be discussed in the House at large . A greater variety of subjects came before them than those which claim the attention of the national legislature , and many of them were more complex in character , and more important and far reaching in their effects . Among them were general and special laws affecting banks , railroads , manufacturing corporations , the judiciary , the militia , the State system of popular education , charitable establishments , the repression of crime , the public morals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other matters which seldom or never come before the Houses at Washington ; while the management of our foreign relations , of the army and navy , the tariff , and the post-office , are almost the only subjects which frequently claim the attention of Congress , while the State has nothing to do with them . Yet the Massachusetts legislature finds leisure to spend some // time in concise but earnest debate upon almost every law which it enacts ; and even , in imitation of a very bad example , it can afford to waste a week in discussing some very idle abstract resolutions about slavery , a subject with which , as the domestic law-giving power of the State , it has about as much to do as with the practice of infanticide in China . Of course , we are not commending the legislature merely for the multitude of laws which it enacts ; we subscribe most heartily to the general principle , that the world is governed too much , and that the fewer new laws which are made the better . Some excuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them which are enacted by the individual States , especially by Massachusetts , in the fact that many special subjects , or matters of detail , necessarily come within their sphere of action , which must be treated separately . As we have just shown , where cities , banks , railroads , manufacturing corporations , and the like , are to be chartered , where police and sanitary regulations are to be established , and public charities to be dispensed , legislative acts must be multiplied , or the work can not be done . Still , the point of the contrast we are now drawing in favor of the State legislatures , ( among whom we claim no preeminence whatever for that of Massachusetts , ) is , not that they do many things , hut that they do much . Non multa , sed muitum . Their action is practical , efficient , business-like ; they evince a disposition to act rather than to talk . Impertinent and long-drawn debate is discountenanced ; the tedious and inefficient speaker is laughed at , and receives such mortifying tokens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into silence . Precisely because there is much work to be done , great diligence is shown in performing it . Congress has comparatively little to do , and therefore comparatively does nothing . No one will suppose , of course , that there is any deficiency of important subjects on which Congress nuglmt act , on which , in truth , the great interests of the country imperatively require it to act , if the members did not thus scandalously separate discussion from legislation . Matters of transcendent importance , - the revision of the tariff , the reduction of the rates of postage , the amendment of the consular and diplomatic systems , the modes of depositing and transferring the public funds , and many others , - have been awaiting the // leisure of our national legislators during the whole six months which they have thus far wasted in hot debate about pure abstractions . During this period , most of the members have been talking , and many of them have been actively engaged in parliamentary mamzeuvres , the avowed purpose of which was to prevent or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the North , and about as many from the South , professing respectively , in their most violent and exaggerated form , those doctrines in regard to slavery which belong to their respective localities , were able to paralyze for many weeks the action of the House , by obstructing its organization , and declaring virtually that no business should be transacted , till their extravagant demands were satisfied . These two fractions , or factions , of the House , the antipodes of each other in principle , adopt the same policy , and play into each other 's bands . The fanatical opponent , and the fanatical advocate , of slavery adopt the same policy , and lock the wheels of government , in order to compel the vast majority of the members to submit to their dictation . They unite in repudiating the cardinal principle , upon which all our institutions are based , that the will of the majority , when manifested under the forms and through the channels prescribed by the Constitution and the laws , shall rule ; and though their united force hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred and twenty independent representatives to adopt their opinions , and to vote for their measures and men , under the penalty that Congress shall otherwise be disfranchised and disabled from the performance of its appropriate functions . Is it going too far to characterize such conduct as factious , anarchical , and anti-republican ; as directly calculated to suspend the action of all government , and to reduce society itself to chaos ? Is it reconcilable with the oath taken by every member to support the Constitution and the laws ? It is miserable chicanery for such persons to affirm , that they are only exercising their undoubted privilege to vote according to their consciences and their best judgment , when this privilege is exercised with an object avowedly hostile to the purpose for which it was granted ; it was given to them that they might assist the House to act , not that they might prevent its action . Every one knows , that a violation of the spirit of an oath is a higher offence in morals than a // transgression of the letter ; inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intentional perjury . Suhmission to the legally expressed will of the majority , or resignation of his seat , is the obvious duty of every member of a legislative asseinhly ; he was not made a legislator in order that he might prevent all legislative action whatever . We use strong language upon this point , because the greatest danger to which our republican institutions are now exposed proceeds from this inclination on the part of the discontented few to ohstruct all action whatever , and rather to have no government at all , than a government which is in some respects distasteful to them . They adopt this principle as frequently in the primary assemblies for the election of a Representative , as in the hall of debate where the elected convene . If every congressional district in the Unitcd States had followed the example which has been pertinaciously set , during the last year and a half , by one of our own ( listlicts here in Massachusetts , and if , in every case , as it is here , an absolute majority of all the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present House of Representatives could not have come into existence ; the national government would have been brought to a dead pause , a tern porary suspension of all its faculties , to be soon followed by the death-struggle of a revolution or a civil war . Under a government like ours , we hold it to be the self-evident duty of every citizen , as well as of every legislator , when it has become obvious that no one party out of three or more can obtain an absolute majority , either to refrain from voting , or to cast his vote in such a manner as will promote rather than prevent an election or a decision . Otherwise , either a different rule from that of the majority must he established , or the government must come to a stand still , and democracy roust end in anarchy and ruin . This rule does not take away the privilege of voting at all ; at the worst , every one has still a choice left between two , an alternative to which we are often reduced by the providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing , and to prevent others from doing any thing , when they will not do precisely what the individual 's sovereign pleasure requires , though a prominent , is not the only cause of the disgraceful inactivity and inefficiency of Congress . A more frequent // obstacle to the transaction *f business arises from the fact , that members are less disposed to give time and labor to their appropriate legislative functions than to vindicating their own position with their constituents . Their speeches are addressed not to each other , not to the whole House , not even to the proper subject of debate for the moment ; but to an audience some hundreds or thousands of miles off and to all the topics in which they suppose their constituents to be interested . Sometimes a member is frank enough to declare , that he does not wish for any audience but the speaker and the clerk , for what he purposes to say is addressed to his constituents , who are on the hanks , it may be , of the Mississippi or the Connec. - ticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this intention , he should travel as far as Washington , when it would be so much more convenient for him to address them at home . Of course , a number of orations delivered for such a purpose do not constitute a discussion or a debate . One is not made as a reply to another , nor does any one of them have any effect upon the proceedings of the House , except to delay its action . We take at random , from the National Intelligencer , a specimen of the manner in which the Representatives at Washington have occupied the hours of each daily session for the last few months . After specifying the merely formal business of the opening of the session , such as correcting the journal , presenting petitions , and the like , the report for the 21st of May last goes on as follows - " On motion of Mr. Thompson , of Mississippi , the House resolved itself into Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union , ( Mr. Boyd , of Kentucky , in the chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President transmitting the constitution of the State of California . " Mr. Haymond being entitled to the floor , addressed the committee in a speech on the subject of slavery , which occupied his allotted hour . " Mr. Gerry followed , and also spoke an hour on the same subject . " Mr. King , of Massachusetts , also spoke an hour on the same subject . " Mr. Thomas then obtained the floor , but yielded to a motion that the committee rise ; which being agreed to , the committee rose . " And the House adjourned . " // 530 The Action of Congress on Only alter the names from day to day , and this record might he stereotyped as a journal of the proceedings of the House during a greater part of this session . As the present number of members is 231 , it was found , a few years ago , that even a nine months ' session , would not suffice , if each one should deliver a speech as long as he saw fit . Accordingly , the " hour-rule " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through three , and when it is very industrious , even four , speeches a day . A very easy calculation , then , will show , that the speech-making upon any given subject ought to be finished in a little more than two months ; for the spirit of the rule undoubtedly requires , that no member should " deliver his sentiments more than once upon the same topic . But the more loquacious are not content till they have spoken three or four hour-orations , reports of which can be sent home to their constituents as proofs of their activity and diligence as legislators . If the discretion of the speaker will not allot them the floor a second time when the grand theme is ostensibly before the House , they can perchance obtain it when the tariff , the post-office , or some other nearly related topic is under consideration , and still occupy the hour with an essay upon slavery , either in continuation of their former remarks , or as a rejoinder to the oration of some other member delivered several weeks before . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays upon the subject of slavery in the Territories have been spoken in the House during the last six months ; their delivery has occupied almost the whole time which was not given to balloting for the speaker and the other officers . The Senate , having only 60 members , has not found it necessary to adopt the hour-rule ; and accordingly , the speeches which have been delivered before it upon the leading topic of the day , have seldom been less than five or six hours in length , and many of them have been extended through the greater part of two days . These lengthy orations have usually been of a high order of excellence ; most of them have been grave , dignified , and argumentative discourses , showing a profound study of the subject , great familiarity with constitutional law , and remarkable acuteness and ingenuity in setting forth the speaker 's peculiar views , and defending them by a formidable array of facts and reasonings . Apparen*tly // not an inch of progress has been made in the attempt to bring the question to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowing with great precision the opinions of each Senator upon every branch of the subject , and , as might be expected , when the topic is so very comprehensive , that no two Senators think exactly alike about it . Every degree of the thermometer , every shade of color in the solar spectrum , is represented by the various doctrines that have been maintained on the floor of the Senate , from the " extreme right " of Mr. Calhoun and Mr. Clemens to the " extreme left " of Mr. Seward and Mr. Hale . No one scheme for settling the whole difficulty can possibly obtain the hearty and undivided support of more than one Senator . If these various opinions were held only by the individuals who have advocated them before the Senate , there would still be a hope that the community at large might come to an agreement , and that public opinion , having finally settled a plan of compromise , might present it in a manner so authoritative as to secure its adoption by Congress . Unluckily , this is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be noticed hereafter - has delivered precisely that opinion which he believes to be the prevalent one in the State which he represents . Obviously , then , without concession , without compromise , without a disposition to give up a part for the sake of securing the remainder , the difficulty can not be settled ; its final or even its partial adjustment is impossible . We are not vain enough to suppose that , within the narrow limits of an article , any thing could be said upon this perplexing topic which has not already , and far more ably , been presented to the Senate in that unparalleled debate , which has now lasted full six months , and in which the greatest intellects of the country have participated . That debate , if reported and printed at length , would occupy at least ten octavo volumes , each containing twice as much matter as a number of this Review . Let those who would know all that can be said upon all branches of the subject address themselves to the perusal of those volumes , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to the acquisition of a new language ; we shal not aim to give even an abstract of them . The titles of half a dozen of the more remarkable of the speeches which have been delivered in the Senate are quoted at the head of this // article ; and since most of these are in favor of some conciliatory measures , some plan of compromise , we have added to them a speech and a letter hy a distinguished representative from our own State , Mr. Horace Mann , who has presented the ablest argument that we have seen in favor of doing nothing , or-what amounts to the same thing-of insisting that the extreme Northern doctrine shall be carried out upon every point , yielding to the South nothing , and of course giving up the hope of any settlement . These speeches and documents are now before us , and with their aid , we propose to look at the subject in the only aspect , perhaps , in which it has not yet been considered ; the effect which the further agitation of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its proper functions as a legislative body , and to acquire or maintain a reputation as an assembly of wise and practical statesmen . The main question is , whether the introduction of slavery into any part of the territory recently ceded to this country hy Mexico shall be directly prohibited by law . Most of the members from the Free States maintain that it ought to be so prohibited ; to oppose the diffusion of slavery seems to them a moral obligation , resulting directly from the laws of conscience and of God , and , therefore , overriding all considerations of expediency , and constituting an end to be pursued , if necessary , by the sacrifice of all other rights and interests whatsoever . The Southern members affirm , that this ceded territory is the common property of all the States , to which all the inhabitants of our country have an equal right to migrate , and to carry their property along with them ; that the Georgian has as good a right to transport his slaves thither , as the New York emigrant has to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of slavery is recognized in the Constitution by the clause directing the surrender of fugitive slaves , and by another clause which allows three fifths of the slaves to be counted in making up the number which is requisite for sending one representative to Congress , and as the Constitution is extended over the new territory by the very act of its cession to the United States , slavery also is extended along with it ; so that the direct prohihition of slavery in this territory would be both illegal and unjust . In this way , issue is joined , and either party refuses to budge an // inch from its position ; and as each possesses the power , either by its numerical majority , by infinite speech-making , or by endless calls for the yeas and nays upon frivolous motions , to prevent all legislation , not only upon this matter , but upon any other which may claim the attention of Congress , it is obvious that the disgraceful inactivity of this session may be continued for an indefinite period . Congress must either virtually cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compromise . The question arises , then , whether the point at issue is important enough to induce either party to maintain its ground in relation to it in this desperate and discreditable fashion . We maintain that it is not , but that it is a pure abstraction , so that , whichever way decided , it will not affect the conduct or the interests of a single inhabitant , either of the Free or the Slave States . And first , as to the moral obligation to prevent the diffusion of slavery , which is alleged to be the chief motive for insisting upon the enactment of the Wilmot Proviso . Other reasons , it is true , may be alleged in favor of the prohibition ; but as they relate only to expediency , or to an equality of privileges between the North and the South , they do not furnish a motive of action sufficiently strong to justify a rejection of any compromise , and to require the supporters of the Proviso to adhere to it at all hazards , even at the cost of breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jessness and inaction . Now , the diffusion of slavery is a very different thing from the creation of it . All that can reasonably be said is , that we are morally bound at all hazards to prevent any person now free from being made a slave , except as a punishment for crime ; if he is already a slave , and it is confessed that we are under an obligation to allow him to remain so where he is , we are not morally bound to resist unto death any attempt to transport him from Georgia to California . Looking at the thing exclusively in its ethical aspect , it is a matter of indifference whether he lives in one State or another . The wrong , the crime , of slavery attaches to persons , not to places . For all that we know , the condition of the slave himself may be ameliorated by such transportation . It is not expected , it is not even pretended , that the passage of the Wilmot Proviso would immediately cause the manumission of a single slave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would reduce a single freeman to bondage . It is admitted on all hands , that the number of slaves within the limits of the United States would not he directly increased or diminished by one , however this vexed question may be decided . The moral and religious obligation , then , which binds us to open the prison door of the captive and to let the oppressed go free , has no application whatever to the point . at issue . But it may be said , that the indirect consequence of prohibiting the introduction of slavery into the Territories will be to hasten the decay and fall of the institution in the States where it already exists ; because , as the field of employ mnent for slave labor in its present locality is limited , and large portions of it are diminishing in value from exhaustion of the soil , while the number of slaves is constantly increasing , they must , finally , if prevented from migrating to a virgin soil , come to be rather a burden than a profit to their masters , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be answered , that it is a very doubtful morality which urges us to do indirectly , by subterfuge or stealth , that which all admit we have no direct power to accomplish ; namely , to abolish slavery within the States where it now exists , and has existed ever since their formation . But let this pass ; we will not impugn the casuistry , questionable as it may be , of a party most of whom are certainly governed by high conscientious motives . It is better to meet them on their own ground , and ask them if they are seriously prepared to maintain , that we are under a paramount moral obligation to do every thing , and at all hazards , ( for here is the pinch of the difficulty , ) which , according to our fallible judgment , may tend , however remotely , to discountenance the institution of slavery , or to shorten the period of its existence . If so , then a very grave and farreaching duty is certainly incumbent upon them . They must immediately cease to consume what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton , eat no sugar or rice , use no tobacco , and have no trade or intercourse , direct or indirect , with slaveholders . In respect to all these things , their motto must be , Touch not , taste not , handle not . Are they prepared to accept this doctrine with all its consequences ? We are not refining unduly . Nothing is hazarded by the assertion , that , very numerous as their party is , who for conscientious motives now call for the enactment of the // Wilmot Proviso , the universal rejection by them of all slave products , followed , as their example surely would be , by the more rigid opponents of slavery in England , would be a far more direct and serious blow to slavery , than to inhibit its diffusion into New Mexico and California . But we go farther . Slavery is not the only evil and crime of so fearful a character that the obligation to oppose it at all risks extends even to the causes which may be supposed indirectly or remotely to encourage or promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally disastrous and wicked . How far , in this case , are we bound to look into the future , and to avoid the slightest speech or action which by any possibility , or in its farthest results , can tend to kindle or to widen the conflagration ? Perchance , in avoiding the Scylla of one offence , we may fall into the Charybdis of another . Zeal is not the only quality which promotes good works ; the fiery energy , which stimulates our efforts against a particular evil , may wholly consume the habit of circumspection and watchfulness which alone can guard us against many others . We deny , then , that there is any peculiar sacredness or stringency whatever in the obligation of the Representatives from the Free States to support the Wilmot Proviso . The prohibition of slavery in the Territories stands upon the same ground with other proposed legislative measures ; it is supported by grave considerations of utility and political expediency . It will not affect the freedom or the natural and inalienable rights of a single human being ; but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utah , and California . It is open , then , to compromise and final adjustment upon the same principles which have decided many other contested issues in Congress . That dogged determination , which often proceeds as much from native obstinacy of disposition as from conscientious adherence to principle , is just as much out of place here as if it were manifested upon the question of cheap postage . Thus far , we have stated the argument as if the prohibition of slavery in the territory recently acquired from Mexico were still an open question ; as if slavery would unquestionably go thither , if Congress should not directly prohibit it from going . But this is a mere supposition , and it is not true . Slavery is // already shut out from this territory , ( Texas , with its disputed boundaries , excepted , ) not by the law of Congress , but by the law of God . The physical characteristics of the country are adverse to the existence of African slaves ; the soil and the climate will not tolerate their presence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have acted for themselves , and have made assurance doubly sure ; they have excluded the dreaded institution by express enactment in their constitution . Congress may refuse to admit California into the Union , but it can not compel the people to undo their own work , and to admit what they have solemnly determined to exclude . The same considerations , which have induced the Californians to act in this manner , will unquestionably lead the people of Utah and New Mexico to follow their example ; they will exclude slaves because the nature of th6ir soil and climate must ever render slavery unprofitable . Throughout this broad region slavery never had any more than a nominal existence ; and it was directly abojished by the act of the Mexican government in 1829 , which act was confirmed and ratified by the Mexican Congress in 1837 . The habits of the people being thus formed and their inclinations directed , the emigration thither - what there is of it - being also almost exclusively from the Free States , there is no doubt that the inhabitants , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution which they see to be unprofitable to them in their present circumstances , and must apprehend as a future curse . Cotton , sugar , rice , and coffee , will not grow in their territory ; and where these products can not be raised , slaves must be rather an injury than a profit to their masters . The country has now been , more than two years , the property of the United States , and no evidence has yet been produced that a sii*gle slave has been carried thither . Yet the whole South was eager to plant the peculiar " domestic institutions ' there , in order to secure a claim to the terntory* no legislation as yet prohibits it , though the danger at one period appeared imminent that Congress would soon change the famous Proviso into a law . With all this inducement for slaveholders to be speedy in their action , and to secure that possession which constitutes nine points of the law , not one of them has been willing to peril his property by removing slaves to the territory . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction of slavery to do ? If they insist upon prohibiting it by law , it is morally certain that Congress will adjourn without accomplishing any thing , without admitting California into the Union , without establishing any government for the Territories , without abolishing the slave trade in the District of Columbia , and , very likely , even without passing the annual appropriation bills , which are necessary for the continued e*-istence of our own government . No reasonable person , who has watched the proceedings of Congress during the present session , can deny that this result , or want of a result , is inevitable . If an insignificant fraction , only a dozen members , were able to delay the organization of the House for many weeks , it is certain that 96 Representatives and 30 Senators , who come from the Slave States , can prevent any action for the remainder of the session . We say nothing of the peril of disunion and civil war , because we do not believe that any such peril as yet exists . But the danger that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without accomplishing any thing , does exist , and is of fearful magnitude . Suppose , then , that we are willing to encounter this danger , and to make the sacrifice , however great , which will result from the breaking up of the national legislature without the enactment of any law , except the four already passed . Do we thereby secure our main object , and gain the prize that we have been contending for ? By no means . Inaction is ust what the *S1outh demands . The North asks for legislation upon the subject ; it asks that California may he admitted into the Union , with its present constitution that forbids the existence of slavery . The South wishes to postpone or prevent a rneasure which will simply add two votes , both in the Senate and the House , to the party of the Free States . The North asks that slavery may be prevented by law from extending into the Territories of Utah and New Mexico ; the South does not wish for a law that will directly sanction or enjoin the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , without any legislative guards or prohibitions whatsoever . It simply denies the power of Congress to legislate at all upon the subject , whether for the restriction or the diffusion of slavery . Of course , its object is gained if Congress adjourns in confusion , without passing a compromise or any other law // affecting the Territories . This is the universal Southern doctrine ; both the Missouri compromise and the resolutions for the annexation of Texas declare , that such States as may he formed south of the parallel of 360 30 ' " shall he adnitted into the Union with or without slavery , as the people of each State asking admission may desire ; " and in such States as shall be formed " north of said Missouri compromise line , slavery or involuntary servitude ( except for crime ) shall be prohibited , " whether the people desire it or not . Mr. T. B. King , member of Congress from Georgia , and recently the United States government agent in and for California , in his Report to the President , speaks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution for themselves , and excluding slavery . " They were not unmindful of the fact , that while Northern statesmen had contended that Congress has power to prohibit slavery in the Territories , they had always admitted that the States of the Union had the right to abolish or establish it at pleasure . " On the other hand , Southern statesmen had almost unanimously contended that Congress has not the constitutional power to pro . hibit slavery in the Territories , because they have not the power to establish it ; but that the people , in forming a government for themselves , have the right to do either . If Congress can rightfully do one , they can certainly do the other . " This is the doctrine put forth by Mr. Calhoun , in his celebrated Resolutions of 1847 , introduced into the Senate of the United States , among which is the following : - " Resolved , That it is a fundamental principle in our political creed , that a people in forming a constitution have the unconditional right to form and adopt the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prosperity , and hap. piness ; and in conformity thereto , no other condition is imposed by the Federal Constitution on a State , in order to be admitted into this Union , except that its constitution shall be " republican ; * ' and that the imposition of any other by Congress would not only be in violation of the constitution , but in direct conflict with the principle on which our political system rests . ' " President Polk , in his annual message , dated 5th December , 1848 , uses the following language : - " The question is believed to be rather abstract than practical , whether slavery ever can or would exist in any portion of the acquired territory , even if it were left to the option of the slaveholding // States themselves . From the nature of the climate and productions , in much the larger portion of it , it is certain it could never exist ; and in the remainder , the probabilities are that it would not . " But , however this may be , the question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the separate and several States as equal co-partners in the confederacy , should not be disregarded . " In organizing governments over these Territories , no duty imposed on Congress by the constitution requires that they should legislate on the subject of slavery ; while their power to do so is not only seriously questioned , but denied by mar*y of the soundest expounders of that instrument . " Whether Congress shall legislate or not the people of the acquired Territories , when assembled in convention to form State constitutions , will possess the sole and exclusive power to determine for themselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limits . ' " The people of California , therefore , acting in conformity with the views thus expressed , and what seemed to be the generally admitted opinion in the States , had every reason to suppose , and did suppose , that by forming a constitution for themselves , and deciding this question in accordance with their own views and interests , they would be received with open arms by all parties . " We add another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our general position , that the soil , climate , and other physical circumstances of the territory recently acquired from Mexico are so adverse to the existence of slavery , that slaveholders themselves , when they have removed thither , are opposed to its introduction - " Some intimations or assertions , as I am informed , have been thrown out that the South was not fairly represented in the convention . I am told by two of the members of Congress elect from California , who were members of the convention , that of the thirtyseven delegates designated in General Riley 's proclamation , sixteen were from slaveholding , ten from the non-slaveholding States , and eleven who were citizens of California under the Mexican government , and that ten of those eleven came from districts below 360 30 ' . So that there were in the convention twenty-six , of the thirty-seven , members from the slaveholding States , and from places south of the Missouri compromise line . " It appears on the journal of the convention , that the clause in the constitution excluding slavery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than California for the presence of slavery . They are high , cold , mountainous regions , barren for the most part , and yiekling not one of the products on which slave labor has ever been employed to any advantage . It is hard to imagine a stronger case than is here presented against the continued agitation of the subject of the Wilinot Proviso , considered in reference only to the new territory recently ceded to us by Mexico . It has been shown that there is no moral obligation whatever to press the subject ; that slavery was abolished throughout the whole region thirteen years ago , and has never been revived there ; that the elements themselves fight against it , the laws of nature being unalterably opposed to its introduction ; that the country has been entirely open to slaveholders for the last two years , and not one of them has chosen to transport his slaves thither ; that the inhabitants , a majority of whom came from slave regions , as soon as they began to legislate for themselves , voluntarily and unanimously decreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the more the Proviso is pressed in Congress , the more certain it is that nothing will be done , and that the South will obtain all it wants , - freedom from any legislation on the subject . Really , it requires all the courage and ingenuity of Mr. Mann to stand out against this plain statement of the case . The following extract from his " Letter , " in which he combats Mr. Webster 's doctrine , that slavery is excluded from California and New Mexico by the law of nature and of physical geography , is a fair specimen both of his logic and his rhetoric - " Now , this is drawing moral conclusions from physical pre . mises . It is arguing from physics to metaphysics . It is deter . mining the law of the spirit by geographical phenomena . It is undertaking to settle by mountains and rivers , and not by the ten commandments , the question of human duty . It abandons the second commandment of Christ , and all bills of rights enacted in conformity thereto , and leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , to be determined by the accidents of earth and water and air . To ascertain whether a people will obey the divine command , and do to others as they would be done by , it looks at the thermometer . What a problem would this be ! - Required the height above the level of the sea at which the oppressor " will undo the heavy burdens , *nd let the oppressed go free , and break every yoke , "  --  to be determined barometrically. ' // 241 Alas ! this can not be done . Slavery depends not upon climate , but upon conscience . Wherever the wicked passions of the human heart can go , there slavery can go . Slavery is an effect . Avarice , sloth , pride , and the love of domination are its cause . In ascending mountain sides , at what altitude do men leave these passions behind them ? Different vegetable growths are to be found at different heights , depending also upoa the zone . This I can understand . There is the altitude of the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pine , and , far above them all , the line of perpetual snow . But in regard to innocence and guilt , where is the white line ? How high up can a slaveholder go and not lose his free agency ? At what elevation will the whip fall from the hand of the master and the fetters from the limbs of the slave ? There is no such point . Freedom and slavery on the one hand , and climate and geology on the other , are incommensurable quantities . " Does Mr. Mann wish to be understood , that he thinks the slaveowner is*quite as likely to remove his slaves of African descent from a sunny and fertile region , producing an abundance of cotton , sugar , and rice , to a cold and mountainous one , yielding little but maize and potatoes , as he is to keep them where they are ? If not , if he admits that so great a difference will probably induce most planters to keep their slaves at home , then , and to the full extent of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and " determines the law of the spirit by geographical phenomena , " and " undertakes to settle by mountains and rivers the question of human duty , " and " looks at the thermometer to ascertain whether a people will obey the divine command , " and does half a dozen other antithetical and strange things , which all , however , amount to the same thing , namely , to the simple proposition that men of property are usually also men of sense , and will not often remove their property from a place where it is valuable to one where it will he entirely worthless . But does the ground which we have here taken amount to an abandonment of the Wilmot Proviso , when considered as a principlQ of public law , or as a rule for the legislation of Congress ? Certainly not . For what is the principle of this famous Proviso ? It is that slavery shall he prohibited by organic law - that is , by the law constituting or admitting any new Territory or State - from extending into any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist . But , according to the view here taken , and which has been pre* // sented with surpassing ability in the Senate by the two great statesmen of the country , the leading minds respectively of the North and the South , Henry Clay and Daniel Webster , this prohibition is inapplicable and needless in respect to the territory lately acquired from Mexico , simply because slavery is prevented from going thither by other causes . The Proviso is already enacted for this territory by a higher power , and the act is enrolled in heaven 's chancery . The principle , then , is affirmed , not abandoned . Accordingly , both the great statesmen just mentioned , who have advocated the course here pointed out , have also declared , with perfect consistency , their inflexible determination to support the Proviso in any and every case where it is needed and applicable . But they are not thereby bound , to adopt the illustration of Mr. Webster , to append it to a bill for the annexatiqn of Canada , if such a bill should ever be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , a law was passed to organize a territorial government for Minnesota , which contained no prohibition of slavery ; the Missouri compromise , it is true , was applicable in this case ; but if it had not been so , any attempt to append the Wilmot Proviso to the bill would only have met deserved ridicule . In spite of Mr. Mann 's nnwillingness " to look at the thermometer to ascertain whether a people will obey the divine command , " the generality of mankind at the present day persist in believing , that ice and snow and a winter that lasts through nine months of the year are more effectual preservatives against African slavery than all the laws ever framed by Parliament or Congress . It is true , that the action of Congress has been a good deal hampered by the previous action of the legislatures of the Free States , all of which , before the opening of the session , advised or instructed their representatives in the two Houses at Washington to insist upon an absolute interdiction of slavery in the newly acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , these instructions were given before the circumstances of the case were known . It was generally believed , a year ago , by those who had paid no special attention to the subject , that Utah and New Mexico opened as profitable a field for the employment of slave labor as Texas ; and that California particularly , with its long reach of sea-coast on the Pacific , and its abundance of the precious metals , // would be very attractive to slaveholders . Allowance was not made for the probability , that , as the gold deposits were mostly upon the surface of the ground , and cover large tracts of land which were literally common property , no private individual having any valid title to them , there would be an immediate rush of free laborers and adventurers to the new El Dorado from the four quarters of the globe and from the farthest isles of the sea . Now the question between Freesoil and Slavesoil , in these modern days , is always practically decided by priority of possession ; for the two kinds of labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be enticed at the South to work with the negroes in a cotton-field ; you might as well expect , at the North , that he would allow himself to be yoked into the same team with his own horses and oxen . This is the great economical evil of slavery - the great harm done by the institution ; it depreciates - it ruins - manual labor in the estimation even of the free ; manual labor becomes work fit only for slaves . Free adventurers swarmed to the rich placers , or gold-washings , of California , as soon as the existence of gold in this region became known , and before a single slave could be transported thither ; and the question was then virtually decided . These men , most of whom had seen better days , would not tolerate the presence of a gang of slaves working beside them ; they would either emancipate them on the spot , by Lynch law , or they would hunt them off the ground , like wolves . If they had been slaveholders themselves , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution under present circumstances would be only the more conspicuous ; it would be degradation worse than death to shovel and wash earth cheek by jowl with a slave . It is not at all surprising , then , that the free inhabitants of California , former slaveholders and all , repudiated slavery with one voice ; they declared that it should never pollute their shores . The same result must follow in Utah and New Mexico . The soil , which is very poor soil , is already in possession of the free , who are tilling it with their own hands . Even if slaves should be sent thither , these men would drive them back again . Their vast tracts of elevated table land , torn into frightful fissures and gulphs by earthquakes and volcanic action , are , like the moun // tains of Switzerland and Vermont , singularly propitious to freedom . These facts and considerations not being generally known , the legislatures of the Free States were eager to rescue the territory from the blight , supposed to be imminent , of slavery . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely adjourned when the news arrived , that California of its own accord had determined to be free ; that it had not merely nippe ( I the evil in the bud , but bad prohibited the seed from being sown . If the news had come one month earlier , - when a silly report was in general circulation at the North , that President Taylor had entered into a conspiracy with the Southern planters to smuggle the abhorred institution into California , and thereby to anticipate the action of Congress , - there is little doubt that the legislatures would generally have remained passive . But when they had once t*ommitted themselves , by the passage of the resolutions , we fear it is not probable that , even if they had continued in session till the intelligence from California had arrived , they would have rescinded them . It is too much to expect of any public body , that it will confess by its own vote that its former action was precipitate and based upon imperfect or mistaken information . But farther ; we must be permitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair expression of the opinion of the people whom they represent , though it was doubtless intended to be such . For , in the first place , these legislative assemblies , elected for the sole purpose of making laws upon a limited range of subjects which are allotted to them with great precision in the Constitution , confessedly transcend their powers when they adopt measures or pass resolutions , which are no laws at all , which have no binding force upon anybody , and which relate to subjects that are admitted not to be within their province , but are expressly reserved by the Constitution for decision by a different legislature . With all due respect to the General Court of Massachusetts , and for the corresponding body in any other State , we must say that the resolutions which they occasionally pass upon such subjects as slavery , the tariW the post office , and other matters , with which , under the Constitution , they have no right whatever to interfere , are entitled to just as much consideration as the // " resolves " gravely voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention of all the universe " assembled in a village schoolhouse , - and to no more . When the legislature wastes its time on such resolutions , it sinks to the level of a mere electioneering assemblage . Of course , " the voice of Massachusetts , " ( if we must use the vulgar electioneering slang of the day , ) ought to he heard in the national councils ; but then it should be heard through its regular representatives constitutionally appointed for that very purpose ; and with such men as Webster in the Senate , and Winthrop in the House , we have no fears but that it will be heard in tones which will echo from Maine to Texas . The paltry excuse , that the State legislature has a right to instruct the representatives of Massachusetts in the United States Senate at least , since these Senators are elected by the legislature , is abundantly confuted by the fact , that the Senators , when elected , have a constitutional right to hold their office for six years , while the members of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can the acts of the legislature of 1845 , to which the constitution expressly gives validity , and immunity from repeal , for six years , be legally repudiated by the legislature of 1850 ? Or can anybody give a reason , why the Senators and Representatives of Massachusetts in Congress ought rather to be advised or instructed by the Senators and Representatives of Massachusetts sitting in the State House at Boston , than that the latter should be advised or instructed by the former ? To our simple appreh ension , it seems , that as the former are entrusted by the people with office respectively for two or six years , while the latter are trusted by the same people only for one year , the former have the better right of the two to give instruction or advice . The mere idea of a large assemblage of Berkshire farmers and Boston lawyers and editors undertaking to give advice to Daniel Webster about the proper performance of his duties , or about nice points of constitutional law , is sufficiently ludicrous . Our second reason for doubting whether these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the States from which they came is , that , in most cases , notoriously , they did not convey the real sentiments of the very legislators who passed them and sent them to Washington . 21 * // Drawn up and enacted , ( if such a phrase he applicable in such a case , ) for electioneering purposes by legislators who were acting for the time in a mere electioneering capacity , and intended to conciliate the good will of a party , often the smallest out of three , which was yet supposed to hold the balance of power in the State , they truly express the political creed only of a portion of the community the least significant in point of numbers , though the loudest and most earnest in defence of their peculiar doctrines . Of course , we speak now without reference to any particular party , or to any particular views of the Constitution or of public policy . We are only explaining the general manner in which the machinery of electioneering action and the manoeuvres of contending parties often produce an appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gone mad on some special subject , which was never heard of three years before , and will hardly be mentioned again three years afterwards . It was thus that the Antimasonic excitement , the Native American excitement , the Oregon question excitement , and now the Wilmot Proviso excitement , have hroken out at different times , and after raging for a while , like the influenza , have then subsided with quite as little effect as the influenza would have produced upon the general constitution of the patient . If any one should judge , from the violence of the symptoms at the moment , that our whole community , - sober , pains-taking , and practical , as they usually appear , - are still liable to these periodical attacks of frenzy , he would do that community great injustice . Not one in five among them cares a straw about the matter , though he will still encourage his delegate or representative to agitate the matter very earnestly , as he is told that this course will operate to the advantage of " his party. ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably permanent parties in the United States , the Whigs and the Deniocrats , corresponding in some respects to the Whigs and Tories in England , between whom the voting population are so very equally divided , that a very slight accession of numbers to either is usually enough to turn the scale , and decide a Presidential election . Such an accession may often be obtained by judiciously picking up some topic of agitation , in which a very few persons are so deeply interested , that the // ties which bold them to either of the old parties are comparatively of little strength or moment . They will then vote either for Whigs or Democrats , according as they may think the one party or the other is more favorable to the one darling object or scheme which monopolizes their affections . These are usually called men of " one idea , " because they ignore or scout all other legislative or diplomatic questions , and will pay no attention to any of the great interests of the country , lest their minds should be diverted for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depends the salvation of the universe . In regard to this aim or scheme , every one of them appears to have taken Hamlet 's oath - Yea , from the tafle of my memory I 'll wipe away all trivial fond records , All saws of hooks , all forms , all pressures past , That youth and observation copied there ; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the hook and volume of my brain , Unmixed with baser matter : yes , by heaven ! " The exaltation of mind and temper under which such an oath is taken is apt , of course , to render the individual very noisy . The clamor raised by a party in this country , like the harking of a dog , is usually in inverse proportion to its size . For a while , the few obstreperous persons who compose it are only laughed at ; and as a crowd in the street are often amused by the impotent passion shown by a very small puppy , so the community generally seems to regard the outrageous noise made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Morrnonism and Millerism in these days can find many converts , by and by it is discovered , that the number of these monomaniacs , or men of one idea , is very considerable , - that , although quite insignificant in comparison with either of the two great parties that divide the country , they are yet numerous enough , in a few States , to hold the balance between them , and give the victory to the one which they may prefer . As soon as this discovery is made , and especially if an important el&amp;ction he at hand , the Whigs and Democrats begin to vie with each other in courting the favor of this new party ; lately an object of general derision , it is now installed in the place of honor , and all politicians bow down before it . The demands of such a party are usually inordinate enough ; but when it is fairly put up at auction between the Whigs and Democrats , to be knocked off at the highest price that can // be obtained , the extravagance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three months ago , a few individuals appeared to have lost their wits upon one topic ; now , the whole community seem to have caught the infection , and to have gone mad in good earnest . They have very recently discovered , that a Free Mason is little better than a pirate ; and the town-clerk of a little village in New England is turned out of office , because it is violently suspected that he is not willing to go to war with England for the sake of obtaining the whole of Oregon up to 540 40 ' . This sketch is not drawn at all in the spirit of caricature , but in sad and sober earnestness ; and we appeal to every cool observer of the play of parties in the United States during the last twenty years , whether it be not , on the whole , a faithful one . The manner in which " the public opinion** of this country upon any political topic is manufactured , and the awe and trembling with which all politicians regard it , remind one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail ; pussy jumps i*ound with amazing quickness , but the object that she pursues being carried round by her own effort , and with her own speed , remains just as far off as ever . Deference for an assumed public opinion at the North , which their own electioneering maneuvres have created , constrains one portion of Congress to vote for applying the Wilmot Proviso to territories where it is about as much needed as a law would be to prevent the falling of snow in the island of Barbadoes . In the popular vote for the election of a President , which was given in November , 1848 , the Freesoil party , as it is called , which was pledged to support the Proviso by the sacrifice of all other objects , counted less than 300,000 persons in all the Northern States , and could not choose a single elector ; the Democrats , who had triumphed at the preceding election through their advocacy of the annexation of Texas , - a measure which added many thousand slaves to our population , anti one Slave State to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States within a few years , - numbered over 1,200,000 ; and the Whigs cast more than 1,300,000 votes for the election of a slaveholder . It was obvious , then , that three Freesoilers held the balance of power between twelve Democrats and thirteen Whigs ; and both the parties last named , of course , began to bid against each other for the favor of the three who // could decide between them in the next coming election . Under the influence of this rivalry , the legislatures of all the Northern States , before November , 1849 , had passed fiery resolutions in favor of the Wilmot Proviso . Are these resolutions , then , the expression of a real , or a factitious , public opinion ? Unfortunately , the question which is now agitated in Congress does not relate exclusively to the admission of California as a Free State , and to the application of the Wilmot Proviso to Utah and New Mexico ; it has been complicated with all the other debatable matter relating to slavery , till it has become manifest that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Slave States must now be taken together , and all adjusted at once , or that no progress can be made in the settlement of any one of them . Within the brief space that now remains to us , therefore , we must glance at each of these topics , in order to see whether any of them places insuperable difficulties in the way of the settlement of the main question , or is so important that , for the sake of it , Congress must be reduced to inaction , the wheels of government must be stopped , and all the other great interests of the country must suffer . It is in these relations alone , that we have looked at the main subject , and in these alone it is proposed to consider each of the other questions which have been grouped around it , without any bond of connection between them but that they all affect the institution of slavery . In one respect , as already intimated , it is a misfortune that they have been linked together ; for the settlement of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once seems nearly hopeless . But on another account , we are not sorry that the topic of slavery is now so fully presented , that , if decided at all , it must be decided in all its political relations , and cease to be a cause of popular agitation and political manoeuvres for many years to come . Lord Ashburton and Mr. Webster , who negotiated the treaty of Washington in 1841 , deserve the lasting gratitude of both England and America for not resting satisfied with the mere adjustment of the dispute between the two countries as to the Northeastern Boundary , but for settling every other matter of controversy between them which was then ripe for action . The Oregon question alone was left , as an affair comparatively // easy to adjust , when the public attention should be sufficiently turned towards it , and when not complicated with other disputes . The first collateral question that is presented relates to the boundary of Texas . The dividing line between this State and Mexico was wholly undetermined at the time of the annexation of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo , our own southwestern boundary was extended to the Rio Grande , and California and New Mexico were added to our territories , we received from Mexico , also , her unadjusted dispute with Texas as to boundary . A portion of the disputed ground , the tract lying between the Nueces and the Rio Grande , as it is of little value to either claimant , and can never support a population large enough to constitute a State by itself , will probably be abandoned to Texas without controversy . Not so with the Santa F6 district and the other portions of New Mexico lying on the east bank of the upper Rio Grande . The native inhabitants of this region , the population of which is not likely to receive any large increase by immigration , cherish sentiments of bitter hostility towards the Texans , who now threaten to extend their disputed dominion over them by force . A border warfare must ensue , if Congress does not intervene to settle the difficulty . Slavery can not be introduced into this region , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north to recompense any other than free labor ; but if the laws of Texas are extended over it , it becomes a portion of a slave State , and whatever political power it may subsequently obtain will be lost to the cause of freedom . Both humanity and policy require , therefore , that the North should submit to any reasonable sacrifice for the purpose of severing this region from Texas , and adding it to the free territory of New Mexico . Now , by the terms of the proposed compromise , the sacrifice required is a very trifling one . Texas is willing to sell her claim to the disputed region for what she calls a fair price , - for a few millions of dollars ; and the United States are bound in equity to cause the creditors of Texas to be paid a sum at least equal to this price , because the revenue from the customs of Texas , which is now paid into our national treasury , was formally and solemnly pledged to these creditors as a security for their debt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to see that the debt is paid ; and it can be paid with the price of the claim to the disputed region . The South makes no objection to this arrangement ; Texas , as we have said , consents to it ; and the North ought to be satisfied with it , because , first , it will preserve the national faith , and , secondly , it will rescue a large tract of country from the dominion of a Slave State , and , by joining it to New Mexico , add it to the " area of freedom . " The next collateral question , relating to slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia , may be very quickly disposed of . In the compromise offered by the Committee of thirteen Senators , it is proposed to abolish the slave trade in the District , but to leave the institution of slavery there to die a natural death , which , according to all appearances , is not far off . Since the retrocession of Alexandria county to Virginia , in 1846 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north hank of the Potomac , and which , in 1830 , had a slave population of 4,505 ; this number was reduced in the next ten years to 3,320 , a ratio of decrease nearly equal to 30 per cent . If the diminution has continued in the same ratio , the number at present can not much exceed 2,000 . Now , if slavery were abolished in the District , it is not likely that any one of these slaves would be emancipated ; their owners , to avoid a loss of property , would send them off into Maryland or Virginia before the law came into operation , - a change which would certainly be a great hardship to the slaves themselves , by breaking all their ties of attachment to their former owners and homes . Where , then , would be the gain to the cause of freedom from this operation of sweeping out a few slaves from a little tract , embracing sixty or seventy square miles , in the very heart of a great slave region ? There were at least eight counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 100 slaves each ; they had hut 634 in all . Who would advocate the removal of these 634 poor blacks into the neighboring and more populous slave counties , for the sake of obtaining an extent of " freesoil " at least twenty times as great as the present District of Columbia ? Moreover , by insisting on the abolition of slavery in the District , the compromise will be defeated , and the slave trade will continue . Shall we reject a part , because we can not // obtain the whole ? We hesitate not to say , that by abolishing the traffic in slaves near the capital , a greater good would be accomplished than would follow from the prohibition of slave labor there , if it was still allowed to bring slaves thither for the purposes of trade , but not for continued residence . " It is a trade sometimes exhibitin revolting spectacles , " say the Committee of Thirteen , a majority of whom are from the South , " and one in which the people of the District have no interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it should be discontinued . Most , if not all , the slaveholding States , have , either in their constitutions or by penal enactments , prohibited a trade in slaves as merchandise within their respective jurisdictions . " The bill which the Committee present for abolishing the trade in the District is " framed after the model of what the law of Maryland was , when the General Government was removed to Washington . " We come now to the last of these collateral questions the most painful and perple*xing one of all - the extradition of fugitive slaves . This surely is a case for mutual concession , for deference to the feelings and opinions of others , which have been made wholly irreconcilable with our own by the force of circumstances and by the accident of birth and education in different localities and under opposite influences . Southern planters are naturally irritated at losing a portion of their property , which is expressly guaranteed to them by the Constitution , and which would be preserved to them if the Constitutional provision upon the subject were strictly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to recognize the fact , that it is an odious and hateful thing for their brethren at the North , who have been educated to an abhorrence of such an institution as slavery , to arrest the trembling fugitive from an unjust servitude to which he has been condemned by no fault of his own , and to deliver him bound into the hands of his pursuers . There are some things from which human nature revolts , and our spontaneous impulses in regard to them seem armed with a higher authority than any human law or human compacts can bestow . But those who feel the full weight of this primal obligation ought , not only in charity , but in justice , to remember , that the inhabitants of one half of the States of this Union utterly deny , - and , in the case of so vast a number of persons , we are constrained to admit , that // most of them conscientiously deny , - that there is any such obligation whatever ; and it should also be remembered , that we are not entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own moral convictions , at the expense of others , whose impulses and convictions point directly the other way , when we might gratify or follow them at our own cost . Let it be granted , then , that the obligation to protect the fugitive slave , who has reached our shores and claims our hospitality , transcends all others in importance . Still , if we can protect him by paying the price of his freedom just as well as by causing his owner , who acknowledges no obligation in the case , to be defrauded of that price , when it has been guaranteed to him by the solemn compact of the Constitution , then we are bound to take upon our own shoulders the burden and the charge of following our own convictions of duty where they differ from those of others . We have little respect for the conscience that luxuriates in following its own impulses just as long as it can throw upon others the only sacrifice which is required for compliance with them . We are serious in this matter . Speaking as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abhorrence of the " peculiar domestic institution , " that we should much prefer that no fugitive slave should ever be allowed to leave the soil of Massachusetts , because reclaimed by his owner . But we do not , on that account , hold to robbing that owner of what he deems to be his just property , or to breaking a compact in one point , where it militates with our convictions of duty , while we hold to it in all other respects , because in these it advances our own interests . Let the State ransom the poor fugitive ; let individuals ransom him . The cost of this proceeding will not be very onerous ; it will not bankrupt us . The legislature holds its session at an expense to the State of about $750 a day ; and the charge , during the last two sessions only , for those days which have been devoted to the discussion of this very subject , would have been more than sufficient to ransom all the fugitive slaves who have been carried back from the soil of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose very delicate consciences will not allow them to favor an appropriation of the public money to satisfy the deinands of a slaveholder , though these demands are sanctioned by the Constitution , may get out of the dilemma by advancing // a very small sum from their own pockets for the purpose of helping the poor fugitive forward on his way to Canada , where no law or claimant from the United States can touch him . For the statistics of ' this matter , we borrow from Mr. Webster 's recent letter to the citizens of Newburyport . " To ascertaia the truth , in this respect , I have made diligent inquiry of members of Congress from the six New England States . On a subject so general I can not be sure , of course , that the information received is entirely accurate , and , therefore , I do not say that the statement which I am about to present may be relied on as altogether correct , but I suppose it can not be materially erroneous . The result , then , of all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged fugitive slave has ever been made in Maine . No seizure of an alleged fugitive slave has been made in New Hampshire . No seizure of an alleged fugitive slave has ever been made in Vermont . No seizure of an alleged fugitive slave has been made in Rhode Island within the last thirty years . No seizure of an alleged fugitive slave is known to have been made in Connecticut , except one about twenty-five years ago , and in that case the negro was immediately discharged for want of proof of identity . Some instances of the seizure of alleged fugitive slaves are known to have occurred in this generation in Massachusetts ; but , except one , their number and their history is uncertain ; that one took place in Boston twelve or fifteen years ago ; and in that case , some charitably disposed persons offered the owner a sum of money which he regarded as less than half the value of the slave , but which he agreed to accept , and the negro was discharged . A few cases , I suppose , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice , nor so far as I can learn , caused any complaint . Indeed , I do not know that there ever was more than a single case or two arising in that place . Be it remembered , that I am speaking of reclamations of slaves made by their masters , under the law of Congress . I am not speaking of instances of violent abduction and kidnapping made by persons not professing to be reclaiming their own slaves . " On this subject , also , it behooves us to see how recent are our own convictions , whether of expediency , legality , or duty , which now come into serious conflict with the asserted rights of our brethren from the South . If it is within some fifteen years only , that our own eyes have been opened to the sin and shame of allowing that provision in the Constitution to be enforced , which says that all fugitives from labor , on the demand of their owners , " shall be delivered up , " we ought // to have some charity for others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to a knowledge of the truth . Upon this point , we can offer only an abstract of the facts which have been collected and presented with great force by Mr. Webster . He first cites a clause from the articles of confederation between the four New England Colonies , which were established as early as 1643 ; that clause provides , " that if any servant run away from his master into any other of these confederated jurisdictions , that in such cases , upon the certificate of one magistrate in the jurisdiction out of which the said servant fled , or upon other due proof , the said servant shall be delivered , either to his master or to any other that pursues , and brings such certificate or proof . " Then , coming down to our post-revolutionary history , he shows that the act of 1793 , enacted under the administration of General Washington , entitled " An act respecting fugitives from justice , and persons escaping from the service of their masters , " appears to have been well considered , " and to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time in the United States Senate by George Cabot and Caleb Strong ; and the bill " appears to have passed the Senate without a division . " She was represented in the lower House by Fisher Ames , Mr. Goodhue , Mr. Gerry , Mr. Bourne , Mr. Leonard , and Mr. Sedgwick , all of whom , with the exception of Mr. Leonard , supported the bill , which finally passed by a majority of forty-eight to seven ; and of this small minority , two were representatives from slaveholding States . We have never heard that the enforcement of the provisions of this act created any ill-feeling , or gave rise to any disorder or opposition , before 1835 , the period when the agitation against slavery commenced . Yet it did not provide for a trial by jury in the State where the fugitive was apprehended , or anywhere else ; and in this respect , certainly , it was inferior to - it was not so favorable to freedom as - the bill which has just . been reported to the Senate by the Compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South . Surely , when we have learned our own lesson respecting our duty to fugitive slaves so very recently , we can afford to have a little patience with others , who have not had the advantage of studying in so good a school . But the importance of this subject is leading us away from the strictly limited topic which alone we proposed to consid // er ; - whether the precise question now offered for the decision of Congress covers so much ground , and is of such vital importance , that all compromise or concession with respect to it is impossible , and the national legislature must be allowed to adjourn in confusion and uproar , without taking any decisive step in relation either to slavery or to any other portion of the public business . Whatever may be the position occupied by any party or any individual upon this delicate affair , we have a right to call upon him or them for a definite answer to the plain query , What is to be done ? What course do you propose with any reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections to any scheme that can be offered , to show that in some respects it is inexpedient , and in others that it falls below our convictions of right , unless the objector is prepared either to bring forward another project which is not open to these exceptions , and which Congress can probably be induced to pass , or to prove that inaction , doing nothing , is the smaller evil of the two . What , then , would be the consequences of inaction , - of an adjournment of Congress without any law being passed upon any of the subjects that x*ie have here considered , - a result which will be sure to follow , if the North insists that its whole claim in regard to this matter shall be granted ? Tire law of 1793 will remain in force , and fugitive slaves will still be liable to be carried back to the State whence they escaped , without any chance being afforded , through a trial by jury , of preventing a mistake as to the person . The process of law , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling fugitive may be rescued by a mob , and in defiance of the courts and the Constitution . But however such a result as this may suit the views of a few half crazy fanatics , we know that the great body of the people from the Free States would regard it with indignation and horror . Better that the North of its own accord should dissever this glorious Union , and resign the whole country to the plagues of anarchy and civil war , than that it should deliberately determine to break its own plighted word , to renounce its reverence for law , and to seek a triumph by brute force over the constituted authorities of justice ! We do not hold to stealing the weapons of the devil , even for the purpose of fighting the battles of heaven with them . If it be conceded that something must be done , it remains // to be shown how far the difference between the North and the South upon this subject has been practically narrowed down , and what is really the issue between them ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter before the people , as if the question were , whether the North should openly trample the Constitution under foot , and refuse to give up fugitive slaves under any circumstances ; no such demand is made , no such result is contemplated , by one out of a thousand of our voting population . The obligation to comply with the distinct requisition or compact in the Constitution , when reasonably interpreted and with due precautions against mistake or fraud , is almost universally recognized . And fanatics in the opposite extreme must not take it for granted , that the South claims permission for any of its inhabitants to enter a free State at his pleasure , and , seizing any person whom he may meet , whether white or colored without producing any proof of his assertion that he is a fugitive slave , instantly to drag him away into hopeless bondage . Certainly , no Southern member of Congress ever hinted at the necessity of putting forward so monstrous a claim . Yet , from exaggerations as gross as these most of the present jealousy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject has arisen . The precise question , the whole question , which Congress now has to determine is , whether the person alleged to be a fugitive shall have the benefit of a trial by jury , to ascertain whether he is a slave or not , in the State where he is captured , or in that from which he is said to have fled . Here is the whole point in controversy ; this is the length and the breadth of the present difference between the North and the South on this painful subject . The North admits , that if it be satisfactorily proved , that the person arrested is a slave of the person who claims him , then the former must be " delivered up . " The South admits , or is willing to grant , that the fugitive shall have the benefit of a trial by jury , that he may establish if he can , the fact that he was born free ; but it insists that this trial shall be held in the State from which it is charged that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of whom are from the South , recommend two additions to the fugitive slave bill now before Congress ; according to the first , " the owner of a fugitive from service or labor 22* // is , when practicable , to carry with him to the State in which the person is found a record , from a competent tribunal , adjudicating the facts of elopement and slavery , with a general description of the fugitive . This record , properly attested and certified under the official seal of the court , being taken to the State where the person owing service or labor is found , is to be held competent and sufficient evidence of the facts which have been adjudicated , and will leave nothing more to be done than to identify the fugitive . " The other addition to the bill may also be explained in the Committee* s own words . " Whilst the Committee conceive that a trial by jury in a State where a fugitive from service or labor is recaptured would be a virtual denial of justice to the claimant of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal to execute the provisions of the Constitution , the same objections do not apply to such a trial in the State from which he fled . In slaveholding States full justice is administered , with entire fairness and impartiality , in cases of all actions for freedom . The person claiming his free . dom is allowed to sue in formd pauperis ; counsel is assigned him ; time is allowed him to collect his witnesses , and to attend the sessions of the court ; and his claimant is placed under bond and security , or is divested of the possession during the progress of the trial to insure the enjoyment of these privileges ; and if there be any leaning on the part of the court and juries , it always leans on the side of the claimant for freedom . " In deference to the feelings and prejudices which prevail in the non-slaveholding States , the Committee propose such a trial in the State from which the fugitive fled , in all cases where he declares , to the officer giving the certificate for his return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Committee have prepared , and report herewith , two sections , which they recommend should be incorporated in the fugitive bill pending in the Senm*te . According to these sections , the claimant is placed under bond , and required to return the fugitive to that county in the State from which he fled , and there to take him before a competent tribunal , and allow him to assert and establish his freedom if he can , affording him for that purpose all needful facilities . " These provisions , of course , will not be satisfactory to that portion of the people from the North , - a very small portion we trust ,  --  who declare that the article of the Constitution relating to the delivery of fugitive slaves ought not to be enforced , // and shall not be enforced , if by any means they can prevent or evade its action . To such persons we have nothing to say , except to urge upon them the obvious duty , if they repudiate the Constitution in one respect , to repudiate it in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution of the Union . Let them , like the ultra abolitionists , cry out with all their might , " Down with the Union ! down with the Constitution ! for it is a compact with sin , and an engagement to do evil ; " and we shall then respect their manliness and consistency , whatever we may think of their discretion . But of those who are determined to act up faithfully to all the requisitions of that instrument - itself a compromise - under which we and our fathers have lived and prospered for more than sixty years , however hard some of its provisions may be , merely resolving to put a rigorous construction upon those clauses in it which seem adverse to the great principles of human freedom , - we would respectfully ask , whether the safeguards here offered are not enough to prevent any abuse of the article in question , or any iniquitous application of it to purposes not contemplated by its authors . Can they honestly say they have serious fears , even after these precautions are adopted into the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered up to slavery , who is fairly , under the Constitution , entitled to his freedom ? Impossible ! they can not say it . For the law of 1793 , which does not provide for a trial by jury anywhere , had been forty years in force before the current of popular feeling at the North had even begun to obstruct its action ; during all this time many fugitives were captured and carried back ; and not one case among them has yet been cited in regard to which even a suspicion existed that the person reclaimed was not a slave . There have been instances of kidnapping ; but the kidnapper , like the burglar and the assassin , lies in wait for his prey in the hours of darkness , and does not come forward under the light of heaven to claim the benefit of an article in the Constitution of the United States . No fugitive is ever likely to be reclaimed except by a Southern planter , whose fortune and position in life , however harsh a judgment we may pass upon his willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any temptation to turn kidnapper ; the mere supposition is injurious to him ; and he does right to repel it with scorn and indignation . And now , // when conscious that the public sentiment of the whole civilized world , and especially of the Northern States , is strongly excited against him as an owner of slaves , and still more as a pursuer of one of them who has fled from hond age , he will be very loath to exercise the privilege secured to him by the Constitution , except in a very urgent case , and where not a shadow of doubt rests upon his claim . For this reason , though thousands of slaves have escaped by crossing the Ohio River , or Mason and Dixon 's line , during the last five years , no attempt has been made to reclaim them in more than one case out of a thousand . Then , rejecting the supposition of an attempt to kidnap , will there be any reasonable fear , after the safeguards abovementioned have been adopted into the fugitive slave bill , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " delivered up , " and in spite of all his efforts be retained for life in bondage ? We think not . Trials are not very infrequent at the South , in which a reputed slave claims his freedom as a right , and establishes that claim . Many cases might be cited from the legal reports to sustain this remark ; but we prefer to quote the plain and manly assertion made by Mr. Clay , in a recent speech in the Senate - " The statement in the report of the Committee is perfectly true , that the greatest facilities are always extended to every man of color in the slaveholding States , who sues for freedom . I have never known an instance of a failure on the part of a person thus suing , to procure a verdict and judgment in his favor if there were even slight grounds in support of his claim . And , Sir , so far is the sympathy in behalf of a person suing for his freedom carried , that few members of the bar appear against them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I myself never appeared but once in my life against a person suing for his freedom , but have appeared for them in many instances , without charging them a solitary cent . That , I believe , is the general course of the liberal and eminent portion of the bar throughout the country . One case I made an exception ; but it was a case where I appeared for a particular friend . I told him , Sir , I will not appear against your negroes , unless I am perfectly satisfied that they have no right to freedom ; and even if I shall become , after the progress of the trial , convinced that they are entitled to freedom , I shall abandon your cause . ' I venture to say , then , that in all that relates to tenderness of treatment to that portion of our // population , and to the administration of justice to them , and the supply of their wants , nothing can he found in the slaveholding States that is not honorable and creditable to them . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyler confirms this statement in very decided language , and adds his own experience of the same character with that of Mr. Clay . The truth is , in a case of this sort , public sentiment at the South takes just the same direction that it does at the North ; it is aliogether on the side of the claimant for freedom , and is sometimes expressed so strongly as to interfere with the deliberate action of the proper tribunals . At New Orleans , a few years ago , a singular trial was had , in which a supposed yellow girl , who had certainly been a slave for many years , claimed her freedom on the ground that she was in fact a German , with no negro blood in her veins , who had been stolen from her parents , poor emigrants , when they first came to the State , many years before . The supposed parents had deceased ; and there was no evidence in her favor but that of some German women , who had come over in the same ship with them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her person , though they had entirely lost sight of hei during the long period in which she had lived as a slave . Her claim was admitted , and she is now free ; perhaps the testimony , as the case was certainly a strange and doubtful one , fairly entitled her to the verdict ; hut if the object had been , to prove that she was the child of these German parents in order to enable her to inherit their property , and not to rescue her from servitude , we think most lawyers would admit that the case would have been decided the other way . However this may be , the public sympathy for her , in New Orleans , was shown in a very decided manner . Fears were entertained , if the court had decided differently , that the mob would have invaded the court house and rescued her by force of arms . After her release , she was received with a sort of public ovation ; a grand ball was given , at which she led off the dance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner ; and so much indignation was excited against her former owner that he deemed it necessary , several months afterward , to publish a pamphlet in his defence ; in which , to say the truth , so much additional evidence was cited , tracing the history of the girl // from infancy , as to leave very little doubt that she was born a slave . We have no wish to argue the legal question , whether a fair construction of the article in the Constitution requires that the alleged fugitive slave should have the benefit of a trial by jury in the State where he is seized , or in that to which his captor proposes to carry him . Eminent counsel learned in the law , as we do not pretend to he , differ on this point ; and after making but two remarks upon it , we will leave it in their hands , as the decision of it does not affect our argument . The first is , that the great similarity of the language in the two contiguous paragraphs of the second section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which directs that fugitives from justice , and the other that fugitives from service , shall " he delivered up " for the purpose of being carried into another State where the crime was committed or the service was due , create a pretty strong presumption , that the same place for the final legal investigation was contemplated in the two cases ; and it is admitted on all hands , that fugitives from justice are to be tried , not in the State where they are seized , hut in that to which they are to be carried . Our second remark is , that because the Constitution describes a fugitive slave as a " person held to service or labor in one State under the laws thereof , and escaping into another , " the question whether he is a slave or not must certainly be decided by the laws of the State whence he has fled , not by those of the State in which he has taken refuge ; and it seems most natural and equitable that he should he tried in the State whose laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now finished our brief review of the questions at present before Congress relating to the institution of slavery ; and it may safely be left to the decision of any reasonable man , not unduly affected by philanthropic declamations , sectional jealousy , party spirit , or the fear of public opinion , whether they involve any considerations of so vast moment , or any imperative moral obligation , which make it improper that they should be settled by a fair compromise of opposing views , and which render it absolutely necessary that the whole Northern or Southern claims should he insisted upon , at the certain cost of an adjournment of Congress in an uproar , with the postponement or defeat of this and all other // public business . We might safely leave this question to be answered by the Senators and Representatives themselves , if it were not for the jealous and fearful reference , which , as we have already noticed , they all make to what they suppose is the state of public opinion in the district or State which they represent . Each one endeavors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure his own seat in Congress , by advocating in their most exaggerated form the political doctrines which he knows to be most current and popular in his own region . His own zeal , he thinks , is measured by the violence of the language that he uses , and by the extravagance of the demands that he makes . Let others take the responsibility of legislating for the whole country ; he will legislate , as he makes speeches , only " for Buncombe . " He holds his seat only to assert the rights , to support the interests , and to maintain the opinions of Buncombe . His adherents at home , anxious to defend his claims against a formidable competitor , quote his most exaggerated expressions with applause , and strive to show how faithfully he reflects the minds of his constituents ; while his opponents are on the watch , eager to detect the first symptoms of flinching , and to oppose to them the more uncompromising language and conduct of his rival . The words of both parties , uttered in reference only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere as evidence of the state of public opinion in this particular district ; and its representative in Congress , together with his colleagues from the immediate vicinity , is goaded on to new and almost frantic efforts to keep ahead , if possible , of the progress of public sentiment in his State . Thus extravagance and fanaticism are generated by a sort of reciprocal action between the congressman and those who elect him ; each acts upon the other ; each does his part towards manufacturing the " public opinions ' before which he bows down and irembles . Our object , we repeat it , is not to cast obloquy upon the proceedings or the members of the present Congress , but only to expose the tendency of the system or scheme of party politics under which they act ; a tendency which is becoming more marked and fatal in its effects with the lapse of every year , and which is almost the sole cause why every great question , upon which opinions in different parts of the country are much divided , is pressed with so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conciliation and compromise in regard to it being scouted by persons who look only to their own political success , and not to the reputation of the national legislature as a whole , or to the welfare of the Union . Furious menaces and bellowing exaggeration take the place of calm and dignified debate ; the balls of the capitol often present scenes which would disgrace a bear-garden ; and Congress attains the unenviable fame of being the most helpless , disorderly , and inefficient legislative body which can be found in the civilized world . Intolerance and extravagance are the easily besetting sins of our national character and political organization . The fanaticism of the South is fairly matched by the fanaticism of the North ; and the only proper corrective of the evil in one case is a fair exposition of its magnitude in the other . If the people of New England would study the objections made to Mr. Clay 's compromise plan - the denunciations of it - by the Senators from Louisiana and Alabama , and if the constituents of these Senators would lend a hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seward and Mr. Horace Mann , we doubt not both parties would agree , that the plan on the whole was reasonable and just . Moderation and fairness in the national councils upon this subject , as one might have expected , have been displayed by those whose position is most independent , - either by those who expect soon to retire to private life , or by those whose commanding fame , being rather national than local , raises them above the influence of slight oscillations of public opinion in their native States . The two great statesmen of the country , magis pares quam similes , have nobly cast aside all reference to local jealousy and prejudice , and spoken out manfully fo.y the whole Union to whom their reputation belongs . The veteran Senator from Kentucky , at an age which places him far beyond the hope of any earthly reward , and when he might well claim to be excused from all public duties , has come forward to bear the burden and heat of the day in maturing the plan of compromise , watching over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vigor and activity of his youthful years , and repelling with graceful courtesy or triumphant eloquence the attacks that were made upon it from every quarter , but especially from // his home and the place of his affections , the slaveholding South . His words of conciliation and wisdom , though they fell upon many deaf ears in the United States Senate , have awakened a feeling throughout the country which ensures the ultimate success of his plan . When all his former public services , great as they are , have been forgotten , and not another record of his eloquence remains , his noble declaration , made at the opening of the debate , that although a slaveholder himself , and standing there as a Senator from a slaveholding State , he would never consent to the introduction of slavery into a territory where it did not already exist , - " No , Sir ! never ! * - will be remembered , and will carry down his name and his praise to all generations . The South has attacked Mr. Clay ; the North , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose course upon this question has been equally magnanimous , wise , and conciliatory . In his great speech of the 7th of March last , he amply redeemed the pledge that he gave in its first sentence , that he would speak " not as a Massachusetts man , nor as a Northern man , but as an American , and a member of the Senate of the United States . " No one had a better title to use such language ; for he had earned it by the devotion of his transcendent abilities throughout his whole public life to the interests and the policy of New England and the rest of the North , whenever and wherever these interests could be maintained consistently with the higher duty which he owed to the Constitution , to the Union , and to his own conscience . We need not speak of the value of the services thus rendered ; there is no man living at the North who is ignorant of them ; there is no man living who could have performed them in his absence . We prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has appeared , as he now appears , not as the champion of one State , nor yet of New England , nor even of the whole North , but in the broader and more glorious character of an American statesman , acting for the whole people , defending them against foreign encroachment and internal dissension , or interpreting and vindicating the instrument which is the charter of their liberties and the safeguard of their prosperity . In many a fearful crisis of this sort , when all these interests were imperilled , he has been our " pilot who weathered the storm . " When the grand attempt was made in 1833 to nullify the // Constitution and the laws , he bore the brunt of the battle in the Senate , concurring for that purpose with a President whose policy in other respects , both before and after , he uniformly and strenuously opposed ; when , by the rash experiments of the same President , who " took the responsibility " of tampering with the currency and the public funds , every bank in the country had suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of the contest still rested on his broad shoulders ; and still later , when a war with England seemed imminent , as questions were at issue with her which stirred up public feeling from its very depths in almost every State of the Union , then , breaking loose again from his former political connections , he appeared as the pacificator between two mighty nations , and preserved the peace of the world . And so it has been through his whole public career . Whenever the clouds have blackened the whole heavens , and the winds have lashed the ocean into foam , and the ship seemed surrounded by the breakers , the trumpet tones of his coinmanding voice have been heard above the roar of the tempest , rebuking the spirit of mutiny or cowardice in the crew , while his firm hand has seized the helm and guided the vessel safely into port . In the same spirit which moved him on these grand occasions , he has now again come forth , at a time equally big with momentous results , to stand between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace , to rebuke the spirit of intolerance and fanaticism on either side , and to teach both parties the respect which they owe to the Constitution and to their own plighted faith . It is the fault of his own New England , if that rebuke has fallen heavily upon her ; in the ardor of her sympathy with the fugitive slave and with the cause of freedom in the Territories , she had forgotten the terms of that solemn compact with her sister States , which she is not at liberty to violate in one respect , if she does not consent that it should cease to he binding in all . There is a moral grandeur in his position upon this subject which ought to be admired and respected even by those who can not fully understand it . He was one of the first to sound the alarm against the proposed annexation of Texas , and fought manfully against it , when half of the North was recreant to its duty upon the subject , and his own native State voted against // him ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact is executed , he declares that its conditions are binding , and that the public faith is pledged to their strict performance . He declares that he will resist to the last the doctrines of Nullification , whether they are advanced by South Carolina or by Massachusetts . Equally resolute to oppose the extension of slavery into any territory where it does not already exist , he declares that he will not vote for the Wilmot Proviso for the mere purpose of insulting the South , or advocate its enactment for a region where it has been already enacted , and engraven on the rock by the finger of God . His doctrine and language upon these points are in strict accordance with the noble and appropriate motto which he has chosen for his speech , and inserted in the dedication of it to the people of Massachusetts - " His ego gratiora dictu alia esse scio ; sed me vera rro gratis loqui , etsi meum ingenium non moneret , necessitas cogit . Vellern , equidem , vobis placere ; sed multo malo vos salvos esse , qualicumque erga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose love of freedom , or of any thing else , is too blind and furious to allow them to hearken to words like these , or to reverence the statesman who utters them ! This is not the time , ours is not the country , where we can afford to ostracize our greatest men whenever they dare to follow out their own convictions of truth and right at the expense of our cherished prejudices . The canker which threatens to eat away all noble sentiment and upright conduct in our public affairs is a cowardly reference to public opinion , to the supposed will of a majority of the people , in place of an immutable standard of right and wrong , and the laws of God . If we can not support even such statesmen as Clay and Webster in breaking away at times from this pitiful slavery to their constituents , the doom of public virtue under such political institutions as ours is sealed ; we shall be worse than the Athenians , who banished Aristides and Demosthenes , and raised such men as Cleon and Chares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the people of the North wish their Southern brethren to support Mr. Clay in the generous declaration which we have quoted from him , they must set them an example by not flinching in their own adherence to Mr. Webster . It is a poor business to search the former speeches and // writings of men like these , in the hope of finding some scrap or fragment which may convict them of inconsistency . Their present doctrine is avowedly one of conciliation and compromise , some portion of which is probably dictated not by their own best judgment , but by the magnitude of the present occasion and by the pressure of circumstances . The debt of gratitude that is due to them for their past services can be repaid only by having confidence in them now ; and by trusting all to their management , we firmly believe that the country would best consult its own interests . There are some pleasing indications , that the sober and reflecting portion of the people are inclined to take these matters wholly out of the hands of the professed politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere , and to confide them to the only persons who can conduct them with discretion and fairness . The opinion in favor of a compromise seems to be daily gaining ground in all portions of the country .

And from New England a loud voice has gone forth in cordial approbation of the course of their great statesman . Men who never meddled with politics before , except to cast a vote on election day , - presidents of colleges , professors of theology , grave merchants , eminent lawyers , and the like , have signed a letter to declare their undiminished confidence in him , and to urge him to persevere .
