txt ART . VII. - CHRISTIANITY APPLIED TO SOCIAL QUESTIONS . Conf&amp;ences sur le Christianisrne dans son application aur Ques. - tions Sociales . Par EDMOND DE PRESSENS* . Paris : Imprimene de Marc Ducloux et Comp . Rue Saint-Benoit , 7. 1849 . Librairie Philosophique de Ladrange. pp. 335 , oct . THE Author of this work is co-pastor with Rev. Louis Bridel of the chapel Taitbont , Rue de Paris . These Confirences , or familiar lectures , were delivered in that chapel in the months of April and May , 1849 , to a large and very miscellaneous audience , attracted by the theme at a tune when Socialism was threatening to enguiph the new republic in a sea of blood . They were thought by the friends of evangelical religion in Paris to be timely and useful ; and yet we find the author in his preface , a few weeks later , raising the question whether the lectures were still opportune , " since in these times weeks amount almost to years "  --  a striking comment on the fluctuations of French politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which could be more opportune , not only in France , but in this country , than this very subject of the application of Christianity , the spirit and the principles of the Gospel of Christ , to all questions relating to the organization and the economy of society . It demands just now the special attention of the Christian patriot and // 265 philosopher . These grave questions should not be left to be determined by theorists who discard Christianity as antiquated or effete . In the present article our object will be simply to introduce the subject and to indicate some of its bearings by giving an outline of Mr. Pressens* 's lectures , with occasional comments . His first lecture is on the " Connection between the Relicious Problem and the Social Problem of the Age . " In showing this connection he treats of the pre-erninence to be given to the principle of love both in systems of religious faith and in social institutions ; of the necessity of solving the first or the religious problem before the second or social problem , through the rejuvenescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different schools with respect to this double problem . The problem of society is not yet solved . The goal of political progress has been reached in democratic institutions ; institutions the most favorable to the moral development of a people , and having sufficient suppleness or elasticity to admit of the free movement of national affairs , and even of the inevitable oscillations of a crisis , without breaking a constitution or invoking a revolution at every step of progress . But the grand question of the true organization of society remains unsettled . Interests and not principles have hitherto been consulted in all attempts to solve that problem , the frequently conflicting interests of classes . But the progress of society is always by means of ideas . And in this view religion may be regarded as the pivot of society ; for as is religion such is society . The great movements of history have sprung from movements of the religious sentiment for better or for worse . What is needed therefore for the renovation of society is a religious renovation , a renovation in the religious ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the times demand . From the religious principle or sentiment must come the motive power in a new order of things . But what is the state of religion itself as related to this work ? Neither Catholicism nor Protestautism , as these systems now exist in Europe , is adequate to the wants of society . Since the revolution of February , Catholicism in France , instead of addressing itself to those spiritual wants of the nation which that revolution disclosed , has only sought how best to maintain itself by alliances with the government in its successive changes . By its incessant intrigues for secular power it has lost all moral authority , and has forfeited the respect of the people . Nor is the Protestantism of France much better . With more of true dignity and self-respect than Catholicism , and with a party of progress earnestly seeking in the truths of the Gospel a solution of the questions that agitate society , it has yet looked more to its own conservation than to the remedy of existing evils . // There is need of a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its practical pow*r . Christianity is essentially progressive ; for while its principle is unchanging , its tendency is always to apply that principle so as to bring about a better state of things , first in our own conceptions , and then in the institutions of society . Every epoch of the Christian era which has a marked character is to he regarded as a development of the Gospel , since this has caused all social agitation and reform . Thus intimately connected are the religious and the social problems of the day . It remains for us to develop the interior spirit of Christianity , the principle of love toward God and man , and to make every thing gravitate about that principle . When once that principle shall have overcome those erroneous principles of philosophy and of religion which have been arrayed against it , a complete revolution in the social and political order will immediately ensue . In vain are the questions that agitate society submitted first to Socialism in its numerous systems , next to the philosophy that combats Socialism , then to the Catholicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignores it . In all these there is only a conflict of interests ; the divine principle of love alone can meet the case . A religious revolution which , overturning dogmas and forms , should develop the Christian principle of love , would lead not only to the solution of the religious questions of the age , but to the solution of the social questions also : for the two are one . In his second lecture Mr. Pressens* inquires into the cause of the impotence of Socialism , and shows that its pantheistic tendencies crush the spirit of love . He draws a vivid and beautiful contrast between the principle of mere justice and that of love ; the former defining strictly the boundaries between meum and tuum and giving " an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth ; " the latter teaching us not merely to respect the nghts of a neighbor , but to seek his welfare in all possible modes even to the extent of much personal sacrifice* This spirit cherished in the heart and life of the individual will diffuse itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never violate the principle of justice , will yet modify all social institutions . But Socialism suppresses this spirit and tends to annihilate it . This will appear from the slightest consideration of the fundamental principles of Socialism . Socialism tends to subordinate individuality to society ; indeed it may be said that under this system individuality is absorbed and annihilated . With that moral law which makes it the duty of each freely to subordinate his own interests to the interests of others , and to use his own liberty for the good of others , Socialism has no concern ; it would efface as far as possible individual character whether with respect to faith , // actions , or habits of life . According to this system , the state , society , is a sort of mint in which the thoughts and the souls of all are to be stamped with the same image ; the effigy of society displaces individual physiognomy . The national work-shop and the phalanstery are but reservoirs in which individuality is swallowed up . As a consequence of this , society being all-powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent confiscated to the authority of society . And hence results , as a third principle of Socialism , the negation of moral evil ; for since man is a mere thing of society and not a responsible being , it is not just to impute to the perverseness of his own will that which is simply the result of the bad organization of society . To reform man one need do nothing more than to reform institutions . Nay , Socialisin goes yet farther ; it rejects the idea of an invisible world . It destroys in man the world of conscience , the world of duty , that invisible world within , which is God in us , speaking to us and revealing his designs . But the same shadows that enshroud this inward heaven , veil also that other heaven , the vast heaven of our hopes . In vain does the soul endeavor to find its place in the theories of Socialism ; it sees nothing but the earth , always this present earth ; the permanence of personal identity , the immortality of the soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The restriction of individuality and of liberty , and the negation of the laws of conscience and of the invisible world , this is the philosophy of Socialism wherever it has developed itself in a formal system . Herein we trace the close affinity between Socialism and Pantheism . The prime feature of Pantheism is the subversion of the barrier between the visible and the invisible world by confounding the Creator with the creature . Under whatever form it is presented , instead of contemplating the divinity in the mysteriousness of an absolute liberty , it regards the divinity as diffused through the universe , circulating in it like the blood in our veins , and from the stone to the man passing through divers orders of existences without ever terminating in a distinct personality , whirling in the vortex of being whose agitated waves are everywhere and whose source is nowhere . And wherefore does Pantheism thus abolish all distinction between heaven and earth , and make an apotheosis of the creature ? Because it wishes no superior ; it prefers to lose itself in the vast whole , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it flows , because in coming to a distinct self-consciousness it comes to the knowledge of a master whom it does not desire . Pantheism is suicide . Our author next proceeds to discuss the origin of Pantheism in human nature , and to trace its progress from rude beginnings among idolatrous nations through the ancient oriental philosophy , // down to the systems of Spinoza , Kant , Fichte , Schelling and Hegel . He shows that Pantheism is fatal to the principle of lov* for love in man rests only upon divine love . Substitute for a personal divinity , for an intelligent being who knows and loves his creatures , a mere vague divine essence or principle diffused through the universe , and there is no God for mau to love , rio object to command his supreme affection . The God of Pantheism , the God of Socialism , a divinity pervading matter in the gross or parceled out in innumerable fragments , can not be an object of love . No body can love an abstraction . Equally impossible is it to love man under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of the individual . Thus Socialism lacks , yea , it destroys , the one vital principle of social reform . The third lecture is devoted to an analysis of various systems of Socialism ; in particular those of MM . Lamenriais , Pierre Leroux , Fourier , Louis Blanc and Proudhon . We need not follow the author in this analysis . With a philosophy at once keen , discriminating and profound , he shows that these several systems are alike based upon the selfish interests of men and preclude the divine principle of charity . We may hereafter find occasion to enter more fully into his reasonings on this point . From the theories of Socialists the author turns in his fourth lecture , to the anti-socialist philosophy , and argues that the deistic spirit of that philosophy is equally fatal to the spirit of love . The spread of doctrines that threaten to subvert the existing order of society has called forth from its academic retreats the philosophy of the schools  --  the official philosophy , as our author terms it , which , hitherto courted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in open field with the popular philosophy of the Socialists . But neither the brilliancy of Cousin , nor the clearness and force of Thiers , nor the scientific acumen of Blanqui and Chevalier can supplant the Socialists in the minds of the people . And herein the anti-socialist philosophy betrays its weakness ; for when a doctrine can not penetrate the mass , it either has no power , or its day is gone by . The people are led either by an error which deceives them or by a truth which sways them . When therefore you would overthrow what they have embraced with enthusiasm and what falls in with their prejudices and tastes , you must attack it with a powerful truth , and though they may awhile resist they will yet feel its force . The instinct of truth is not blunted within them ; its chords vibrate sonorously in their hearts . But it is not conventional forms of speech , it is not brilliancy of style or elegance of diction that will reach the popular mind . Thought , naked thought , strong , earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been beyond the limits of that artificial society where men sport with ideas as with words , which has never breathed the vast free air of the open world , and // which when it comes down to talk with men can not throw aside the mantle of the school arid speak to the multitude a word that shall be felt and remembered-such a philosophy is doomed . What then is the inherent weakness of the official philosophy ? It is that that philosophy does not embrace the principle of love . The official philosophy is nothing but deism . Aside from faith in revelation there is nothing possible but pantheism or deism ; for to unaided reason either God is nothing but the creation in its immensity , or the universe stands without the direct agen cyof God , fixed by immutable laws , with no other intervention of divine power than what is necessary for the preservation of those laws . If pantheism confounds the Creator with the creation , deism separates the two so that they can never again be joined . Deism represents the Deity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unconscious law , a dumb law , a law of iron . The legislator of the world is like the legislator of antiquity who promulgated his code to a single city and disappeared . He is impassible to all the woes of humanity , an abstraction , without pity . The God of the deist d*vells apart in solitary grandeur , ever ready to defend himself against his creatures , *vrapped up m himself , living only for himself . Between such a Creator and his creatures there can be no love . Such a God can not bestow kindness ; for an express act of kindness would be a miracle , and deism denies the possibility of a miracle , and good which comes by a necessary law is not an expression of love from one intelligent and voluntary being towards another . In like manner deism alienates and indurates mankind by its law of destiny , and thus admits of no charity between man and man . It ignores all history , and destroys all hope . Every thing is fixed by an unalterable destiny . Even pantheism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent , self-existent God without affections , without emotions , without regard of any sort for his creatures . " I prefer , " says our author , " that grosser divinity diffused through the universe , unintelligent , material , to a divinity which though spiritual is implacable . I had rather worship an idol than an idea . I had rather not know where to find my God , than know where he is when that knowledge to me is useless . I had rather not see the threshold of his habitation , if the door is never to be opened for me . I had rather never speak to him , than to speak to him in vain . " The necessary result of deism upon the social organization is to leave each individual in the isolation of his own rights , and to relax more and more the bonds of community . Extreme individualism is its idea . Society is nothing but an assemblage of monads ; all organization is designed to preserve their isolation . The office of society is that of a constable . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may be united , but that they may // be more surely isolated . The state plays the part of the deistic providence . It has nothing to do with the wants or the miseries of men . The whole policy of deism is an absolute laissez faire , letting things be as destiny has ordained . The deism of our day is but a reproduction of the better phase of the philosophy of the last century . M. Cousin , in his preface to the republication of the &amp;ivo yard Vicar endorses the philosophy of Rousseau . Cousin , in his treatise on Justice and Charity , Mignet in his Life of Franklin , and Thiers in his work on Property , all take more or less distinctly the ground of the deistic philosophers of the eighteenth century . The doctrine of M. Thiers is Fourierism reversed ; his deism runs aground upon the same materialism as does pantheism ; he defends in the name of interest what the opposite school attack in the name of interest . The principles are the same on both sides ; and however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight they are as little honored on one side as the other . Deism breathing the same air with Socialism only arms the passions of the high against the passions of the low . The conflict of the official philosophy with Socialism is the dashing together of two vessels whose sails are filled by the same tempest . It is not by this philosophy that the problem of society is to be solved . Our author proceeds in his fifth lecture to discuss Catholicism in its relations to the subject under review . Neither of the two great forms of the Christian religion in the world , Catholicism and Protestantism , is a full realization of Christianity . This is apparent from the existing state of society ; for since the pivot of any community is its religious faith , and as is its profession so is its constitution  --  the mass being under the influence of the doniinant religious idea  --  the fact that the masses are now either pantheistic or deistic and that the social system does not rest upon the principle of love , is conclusive evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the spirit of the Gospel . If Christianity were doing its appropriate function this state of things would not exist . What then is the defect of the prevailing forms or developments of Christianity ? We have seen that there are two ways in which the principle of love may be extinguished ; one by denying individuality and liberty and thus destroying all capacity for doing good , the other by making personal liberty isolated and immovable as fate . Socialism and deism tend respectively to these extremes . Looking at the general spirit and the fundamental idea of Catholicism and Protestantism , we shall see that neither of these systems has more than half healed the wounds thus inflicted on either hand upon the principle of charity . Catholicism is a religious Socialism . This is affirmed , not of Catholicism as it appears in Muller , Newman , Bautain or Lacordaire-in // whose mouth it assumes a modern tone and a tone of conciliation which do not belong to it  --  but of Catholicism as it appears in the protocols of that Sovereign Council which has promulgated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church ; as it is preached in village churches and apprehended by the popular mind ; as it is taught in the seminaries ; as it is contained in homilies and catechisms . This actual Catholicism , so little understood , Catholicism as defined by the last council , and not that fictitious Catholicism which assumes so many phases to correspond with political changes , is the system with which we are now concerned . Catholicism is a religious Socialism , and so far forth it seriously compromises the principle of charity . The first feature of Socialism , as we have seen , is the complete subordination of the individual to society . So an essential principle of Catholicism is the absolute subjection of the individual to the religious society . The church is not a mere voluntary society of believers , it is an entity by itself , armed with vast power , and imposing itself upon us forcibly and without appeal . We may not have a thought , we may not form an opinion for ourselves ; every thing must be subordinated to that collective being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the state represents in the Socialist world . The church believes and acts for us , as according to Socialism the state should do . Catholicism would not have us obey God directly ; but its aim is to absorb us in the religious society , and the submission which it demands is nothing short of the annihilation of our individuality . It is the most absolute monarchy of which we can conceive . The Catholic church is the national manufactory of belief , of religious ideas , in which every one sluggishly depends upon the central power which minutely prescribes his task , which reduces him to the place of a machine , and provided he does not work , think , meditate on his own account , assures him of his wages at the end-salvation and eternal rest . Under this system we can have no property in any thing moral or religious ; our minds are magazines in which are deposited the truths of which the church is guardian . These must remain there immovable , untouched ; we can not appropriate them by a personal faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the thing , of a religious power which binds us on all sides . Thus in the absorption of individuality , Catholicism and Socialism are alike . But it would seem at first view that there could be nothing in Catholicism corresponding to the pantheism of the Socialists . Catholicism does not confound God with the creation ; it recognizes his personality , it worships him as in heaven , in his absolute sovereignty ; yet nevertheless it comes to the same result with pantheistic Socialism . The aim of pantheism is to free man // from the power of God ; to make him his own end , having not other laws than those of his own reason and will . This it accomplishes by denying the supernatural and invisible world , and leaving nothing but this material world in which man is lord . Now Catholicism , by the natural reaction of the rebellious heart , seeks to restore to man the glory of which the Gospel has spoiled him . To effect this , it puts the invisible world at such a remove from us that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies , which exercises no authority over them and thus suffers them to form an independent government . The viceroy is more really king than the true sovereign whom they never see . Thus does the Catholic church put man in the place of God . Catholicism does not recognize the spiritual union of man with God . It brings God into contact with man only externally . Integrity and virtue , instead of being the internal fruits of man 's renovated nature , are outward gifts bestowed by God through a certain channel . Hence arises the principle of authority in the Catholic church ; its pompous worship ; its doctrine of realpresence ; and its priesthood , through whose intercession alone we can have access to God . Thus man is represented as a being so miserable and degraded that God disdains to allow him direct access to himself ; and while God is thus put afar off in his ideal sovereignty , the real sovereignty has passed to the priest . And here it is that Catholicism like Socialism destroys the principle of love . For how can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote , and man whose every attempt to am proach him is repelled by rigorous and debasing exactions ? What room is there for the exercise of a true charity between man and man , when deeds of kindness are made deeds of penance , and every religions duty and privilege is converted into a satisfaction for sin ? Catholicism is the enemy of Liberty . The question of liberty necessarily takes precedence of all other questions pertaining to society . That question Catholicism has considered only to condemn it as a damnable heresy . True , the Catholic church has sometimes eulogized liberty , but only in times of imminent peril to itself ; at this very day it embraces the most open enemies of liberty . When has Catholicism , being in power , loved liberty , favored its spread among the people , given it a benediction ? Passing by the holy Inquisition , the massacre of St. Bartholomew celebrated by the Te Deum , the fire and the sword ever ready for those suspected of liberal opinions , we need but look at contemporaneous history to satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of social progress . What is it that has stood longest in the breach for the defense of ancient privileges ? that has uniformly endeavored to gag thought ? that has denounced the first principles of popular liberty as monstrous // errors ? that has combated even with violence the principles of the Revolution of 1789 ? Catholicism ; Catholicism , not all Catholics , but the Catholic church . And this opposition of the Catholic church to civil liberty grows out of the very constitution of that church , out of its fundamental idea , that man is incompetent to discern truth for himself , and must therefore be subject to authority . But if man can not comprehend truth in one sphere , neither can he comprehend truth in another . Truth is not divided into parts . There is not one truth for earth and another for heaven ; one truth for a religious body and another for civil society . Both religious and political society rest upon the same principles ; and if individuality and subjectivity are expelled from the one , by parity of reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholicism applies the principle of authority to civil order as well as to ecclesiastical order . A divine right consecrates the priest of the state as well as the priest of the church . The king and the pontiff are anointed with the same holy oil . The official orders in the state correspond to the orders in the church . The same principle of authority , of despotism , prevails in both . The absolute incompatibility of Catholicism and liberty has been sufficiently manifested in the reign of the present Pope , who it would seem , loved liberty until he began to realize that its touch was deadly to the church which he represents ; and so Pius IX . has conquered his people , not by spiritual arms but by foreign bayonets . Catholicism can render no aid in the solution of the social question . In his sixth lecture our author discusses the insufficiency of Protestantism . Having rejected Pantheism , Deism and Catholicism as all alike inadequate to the wants of modern society , he does not find even in Protestantism a supply of these wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insignificant as the present influence of Protestantism appears to be in France , it has yet stamped its impress indelibly upon the history of mankind , and is an element of the existing social constitution of France itself . Not that Protestantism as a dogma is acclimated in France ; but that it exerts there a moral power which is felt in the whole structure of society . Banished and persecuted as it has been , like the retreating Parthian it has left a mark upon the heart of the country which can not be effaced . The right of private judgment , asserted by Protestantisni , lies at the foundation of civil liberty . But liberty of opinion is not the whole of Protestantism . Valuable as this is , it is but a negative principle and would not go far to remove social evils . Protestantism connects the right of private judgment with a higher religious principle . VOL . VIII . // The Protestantism which our author takes for his standard is that of Calvin and the Synod of Dort . Of this he affirms th'at it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter modifies the principle of love in a socialistic sense , the former modifies that principle in a deistic sense . While the Catholic doctrine tramples under foot the sovereignty of God , the Protestant doctrine exalts that sovereignty in such a way that it assumes more or less of that absolute , inflexible character which Deism ascribes to it . This very view of sovereignty in one sense ennobles man . Protestantism emancipates us by bringing us into subjection to God ; for there are no distinctions in his presence , l ) ut all are alike humble and abased before him . The petty sovereignties which have degraded us now disappear ; and priests and Popes with all their insignia , their sacerdotal vestments , their lofty words and usurped powers , these false servants who in the absence of their master have made themselves ridiculous by putting on his apparel , are covered with confusion by his return . The end sought by the Reformation was sacred , the exaltation of God , the sanctification of man . But it is not a caricature of Calvinisrn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illimitable and irresistible power acting on the creation as if he were acting upon nonentity without the codperation of any being , setting up this , casting down that , molding souls and consciences as he shapes insensible matter , assigning men to happiness or misery eternal , according to his unsearchable decrees . In contrast with such a being , man is presented as utterly weak and helpless . It is here that dogmatic Protestantism inflicts a blow upon the principle of love both in God and man , in God by the very absolute manner in which his sovereignty is presented , in man by the destruction of his moral liberty . Deism does not admit of love , because every thing from God to man moves on by natural laws which nothing can suspend or turn aside . in its anxiety to represent grace as sovereign and unconditional , Protestantism has struck upon the same rock . It presents the power of God without that atteunperament which in the sacred Scriptures harmonizes it with his other attributes . Every thing is referred to an eternal and immutable decree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tism affiliates with Deism. * * In a note on this view of Protestantism , Mr. Pressens* observes that " the place which an idea holds in a system is of great importance in determining its signification . If it is not the sole pivot of the system , then whatever precision may be given to it in the formula , it may be modified or rendered complete by other ideas . Thus in the Scriptures the sovereignty of God is at times presented in a manner almost as absolute as in the dogmas of the Reformation ; but at the same time , the Bible is all life and freedom , and the image of God which it leaves on our hearts , when we regard the total impression , is not that of a God eternally intrenched in the inflexibility of his decrees . " // Our author proceeds to trace the deteriorating or suppressing influence of this view of divine sovereignty upon the principle of love whether in God or in man , and maintains that Protestantism viewed dogmatically , is but a semi-Catholicism . After having nobly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another chain . The formula of doctrine which it puts forth is declared to be the truth par excellence , and one must accept it entire . One may not contemplate Christ for himself , but must take the new and imperfect image of Christ which men have given . The resolves of Synods are imposed as were formerly the canons of Councils , and persecution is waged in the name of the new dogma . The New Testament , instead of being a history from which we derive the life of Christ , by which we are brought in contact with him and subjected to his authority , is too often made a code from which to draw statements and formulas . The letter is sometimes invested with a power which does not belong to that of which it is the mere envelop . And yet in spite of those remnants of servitude the principle of liberty has been asserted by Protestantism , and is destined to revolutionize Europe . The conclusion at which M. Pressens* arrives from his criticism of dogmatic Protestantism is , that this will not suffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its practical influence in countries which have been molded under that influence , we discover that it secures political liberty , and nothing more . Germany and Great Britain illustrate this fact . In the former , Protestantisrn is seen contending for the ancient regime ; in the latter , Protestantism enters as an element into the constitution , and while it secures civil and personal liberty , is yet the ally of a powerful aristocracy and maintains its own hierarchy . The debris of the middle ages has been deposited upon the soil of England . In Germany , in France , in England , in Switzerland , Protestantism , as a system , has combated Socialism , without attempting to solve the problem of modern society . In England , side by side with the splendid mansions of aristocracy , are manufacturing towns crowded with misery ; while Ireland writhes in the horrors of famine . Protestantism has not there effected a true social reform . Moreover , Protestantism itself is falling into decay . Everywhere in continental Europe it is crumbling under the storms of revolution . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the revolution which has shaken Europe has not yet reached it ; but when that revolution shall shake England also , or shall pour forth there its burning lava , that crust will be broken through arid scattered to the winds . The hope of the world does not lie in Protestantism . It must be borne in mind that our author speaks of Protestantism as it exists for the most part in Europe ; hard.shelled , dogmatic , // cold , formal , incrusted with pride and with age , allied or seeking to be allied with the state ; the burning waves of refoirn themselves congealed into mountains of stone . From such a Protestantism we in this land are mercifully delivered ; yet there are those who would impose upon us just such a Protestantism ; who would cover this virgin soil of liberty with the debris of the crumbling dogmatism of the old world ! Had Mr. Pressens* been more conversant with the workings of the voluntary principle , and with the fruits of the Protestant spirit in the United States , he would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet it is to be questioned whether even in this country Christianity has permeated the substratum of society , and infused itself into the whole social order , or whether indeed it is likely to do so with the present spirit and efforts of Christians or associations of Christians which call themselves Protestant and evangelical . The seventh lecture of Mr. Pressens* 's course treats of those aspirations for the future which are the harbingers of important events . Great desires precede great things . Under this head are presented in succession the eclectic Deism of Jouffroy  --  a leader of the young eclectic school in philosophy ; the practical deism of the masses ; the religious aspirations of Socialism , as seen in the system of Buchez , and the aspirations of Fourierism in the writings of Gilliot ; the young Catholic school both political and theological ; and the aspirations of Protestantism as seen in Vinet and Adolphe Monod . It is shown that the grand obstacle to religious reform is in the union of church and state ; that the state perpetuates antiquated forms of religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that state protection is an injury to religion ; and that it is the duty of men who are convinced of these evils to avow their convictions and seek to enlighten public sentiment in this regard . The eight and last lecture aims to show that this universal aspiration after a better state of things , must terminate in a return to evangelical Christianity . It is an essential condition of true love , that it shall not compromise either liberty or justice , and that it shall be bestowed as a voluntary gift . In the Christian system Love is based upon one grand fact , the cross of Christ . Around that cross our hearts must center that we may there meet the heart of God poured forth in love for us ; and catching the mighty impulse of that love we shall return to society to breathe only love , peace , good-will to others . Our author proceeds to show how this spirit diffused through society , reigning in the hearts of all individuals , would attemper systems of religion , would modify government , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy and happy brotherhood . He concludes by urging upon each individual the cultivation of this spirit . // We have now given our readers a digest , mainly in our own language , of these admirable discourses . The subject they open to view is one of vast moment in its bearing upon the elevation of society and the final success of Christianity in the world . Christianity has not yet been given to the poor . By this we do not mean that the poor have not been furnished with Bibles and tracts , and with the preaching of the Gospel ; but the spirit of Christianity has not yet been applied to the physical and social condition of the masses , with a view to their permanent elevation . Christians have been disproportionately intent upon the spiritual welfare of mankind , overlooking the close connection between the physical and the moral in their condition , and too little regarding Christ 's method of doing good . The moral renovation of the masses in great cities is well nigh hopeless , while their physical condition remains what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical and judicious plans for the improvement of society , wherever in a word , the great interests of humanity are to be promoted , there Christians should take the lead . We believe that the world is to be saved by the church ; not by organizations , nor by creeds ; but by living Christians applying the spirit and maxims of the Gospel to all the details of human affairs . They who throw aside the church as an a of the religious element 0ent of reform , divest reform which is its sole vitality . No reform can succeed from which that element has been cast out , or into which that element does not fully enter . Christians therefore must look to it that this element is infused into every needed reform ; they must themselves be forward in every such reform , in the spirit of love , the spirit of Christ . This is their responsibility . Instead of expending blows upon the dead carcass of Fourierism , let them direct their aim at the monster evils before which Fourierism has fallen . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a great scale with philosophy , with formalism , and with infidelity , so it shall be suffered in France or on some other field to make full proof of schemes of social reform without the Gospel . But let the church avert the bloody and disastrous trial . The great problem-nay , that is not a problem for the Christian , which Christ himself has demonstrated  --  the great duty of the Christians of this age is the application of Christianity in its principles and spirit to all interests of society and of humanity .
