CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY . IN Washington , March 31st , 1850 , died JOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN , aged sixty-eight years and fourteen days . Mr. Calhoun had been of late in failing health , and the excitement of the recent events in Congress , proved too much for his undermined constitution . His death was like his life , self-sustained and unfaltering . For nearly half a century , Mr. CALHOUN had been in public life . During the whole of that period , his position was a prominent one . Crossing swords in debate with RANDOLPH , with CLAY and WEBSTER , sought in counsel by MADISON and MONROE , his foot never failed him in such dizzy heights , his self-poised presence of mind never deserted him . Too much of a Statesman for a successful politician ; too sectional in his views and feelings for a man of the nation , he was for that section all that a leader could be . In such capacity , his character was wellsuited to arouse enthusiasm and lasting regard . Immovable in his principles , of clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , ambition , the greatness of most men , was Mr. CA*OUN 'S only weakness . Kind and just in his domestic and social relations , he sought his only relaxation from official duties in the society of his friends and family . His conversational powers were remarkable , and contributed not a little to his political success . Lie possessed alike the confidence of his constituents and the respect of the great men with whom he was ever associated . Had the qualities which drew forth these feelings been less real and sterling , he could never have maintained this proud position . Mr. CALHOUN commenced his public life in the Legislature of his own State . After serving there a few years , he was transferred to Congress , and at once took his pktce among the great minds of the country . His maiden speech was in defence of the resolutions recommending a declaration of var with Great Britain . He spoke in reply to one of the most brilliant efforts of RANDOLPH . He sustained the reputation he had earned at home , and gained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The course he pursued in his responsible position as Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs is now national history . At the age of thirty-five , he was invited by President MONROE to a place in the Cabinet . He was appointed Secretary of War . The affairs of this department were in the most complete confusion ; so much so , that Mr. CALHOUN 'S friends doubted the prudence of his accepting a situation that demanded a business talent for affairs . He applied his powerfi*l mind to the task , and organized the Department on a footing that stands to the present day . The unsettled accounts of the Government , amounting to near fifty millions , he reduced to less than three millions* The annual expenditure of the army he found four millions , and effected a saving thereon of one million three hundred thousand . At the close of MONROE 'S administration , he was elected Vice-President , and was re-elected in 1828 . During the difficulties between South Carolina and the General Government , he resigned and was elected Senator in place of Hayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his partizans . But the doctrine of nullification , however grateful to his own State , was odious to the rest of the Union ; and Mr. CALHOUN 'S prospects of the Presidency , and career as a national man were effectually checked . He continued to represent South Carolina in the Senate of the United States for eleven years . In 1844 he was appointed Secretary of State by President Taylor . During the year he held that office , he was mainly instrumental in bringing about a measure , that is now , in its effects , convulsing the country to its centre . His diplomacy cleared the way for the annexation of Texas . The English Government convinced from Mr. CALHOUNS energetic remonstrances that the United Stat2s would permit no interference , suffered that country to fall quietly into our hands . Mr. CALHOUN in carrying this measure was true to the political instincts of his whole life . He denied his nationality as an American citizen , and admitted no claims hut those of his own State and his own section . Staunch to his post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this policy that he drew his last breath . // " But he is gone  --  a man whose faults were few : A nobler treads not Senatorial halls ; To his own views of right intensely true , To Heaven 's great aim magnificently false ! With steadfast will , that none could bend or break , A kingly victim he to a profound mistake ! He stood a bulwark gainst the advancing tide Of Human Progress , but the conquering wave Kissed as it sank , that brow 's majestic pride , And wailed regretful murmurs o'er his grave . Long be his resting place a hallowed spot , Till Dignity , and Truth , and Manhood are forgot . " * On the announcement in the Senate of Mr. CALHOUN 's death , Mr. CLAY spoke in eulogy of his virtties . " My personal acquaintance with him , " he said , " commenced upwards of thirty-eight years ago . The Congress of which we then became members , was that among whose deliberations and acts was the declaration of war against the most powerful nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preliminary discussions which arose in preparation for that great event , as well as during those which took place when the resolution was formally adopted , no member displayed a more lively and patriotic sensibility to the wrongs which led to that awful event than the deceased , whose death all unite now in deploring . Ever active , ardent and able , no one was in advance of him in advocating the cause of his country , and in denouncing the injustice which compelled that country to arms . In all the Congresses with which I have had any acquaintance since my entry into the service of the federal government , in none , in my opinion , has been assembled such a galaxy of eminent and able men as were those Congresses which declared the war , and which immediately followed the peace . In that splendid assemblage , the star which has now set , stood bright and brilliant . It was my happiness , sir , during a great part of the life of the departed , to concur with him upon all questions of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared we were messmates , as were other distinguished members of Congress from his own patriotic State . I was aflorded by the intercourse which resulted from that fact , as well as from subsequent intimacy and intercourse which arose between us , an opportunity to form an estimate not merely of his public but of his private *fe , and no man with whom I have ever been acquainted exceeded him in habits of temperance . and in the simplicity and tenderness of social intercourse . And such was the high estimate I had formed of his transcendent talents at the end of his services in the executive department under the administration of * Tribune Newspaper . Mr. MONROE , that had'he been translated to the highest office of the government , I should have felt assured , that under his auspices the honor and prosperity and glory of our country would have been safely preserved . Sir , he is gone . No more shall these halls witness in yonder seat , the flashes of his keen and penetrating eye . No more shall we listen to that torrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . Sir , this is not the proper place , nor should I be the proper person to attempt a delineation of his character , or of the powers of his mind . I will only say that he l ) O55*55* a lofty genius , that in his powers of generalization of those subjects of which his mind treated , I have seen him surpassed by no man , and the charms and captivating influence of his colloquial powers have been felt by all who have ever witnessed them . Mr. WEBSTER , on the same occasion , spoke in high testimony of the character of the departed Statesman . " I made my first entrance , " he said , " into the House of Representatives in 1813 . I there found Mr. CALHOUN ; he had already been an efficient member of that body for two or three years . I found him then an active and efficient member of the assembly to which he belonged , taking a decided part and exercising a decided influence in all its deliberations , from that day to the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and politics , there has subsisted between us always and without interruption , a great degree of personal kindness . Differing widely upon many great questions belonging to the institutions and government of the country , those differences never interrupted our personal and social intercourse . I have been present at most of the distinguished instances of the exhibition of his talents in debate . I have always heard him with pleasure , and often with much instruction , and not unfreqiiently with the highest degree of admiration . Mr. CALHOUN was calculated to be a leader in whatever association of political friends he was thrown , he was a man of undoubted genius and of commanding latent . All the country admit that his mind was perceptive and vigorous-it was clear , quick and strong . Sir , the eloquence of Mr. CALHOUN , or the manner of the exhibitions of his sentiments in public bodies , was part of his intellectual character-it grew out of the qualities of his mind-it was plain and strong , sometimes unsurpassed still always severe , rejecting ornament , not often seeking far for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , in the closeness of his logic and in the earnestness and energy of his manner . These are the qualities , as I think , that have enabled him , through such a long course of years , to speak often and yet always to command attention . His demeanor as a Senator is known to us all-is appreciated and 535 // venerated by us all . No man was more respectful to others-no man conducted with greater decorum and no man with greater dignity . I think there is not one of us but felt , when he last addressed us from his seat in the Senate , with his form still erect . with a voice by no means indicating such a degree of physical weakness as did in fact possess him , with clear tones , and an impressive and *nost imposing manner-there is none of us , I think who did not imagine that we saw before us a Senator of Rome , when Rome survived . Sir , I have not in public nor in private life , known a more assiduous person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man who wasted less of life in any pursuits not connected with the immediate discharge of his appropriate duties . I have known no man who wasted less of life in what is called recreation , or employed less of life in any pursuit connected with the immediate discharge of his duty . He seems to have had no recreation but the pleasure of conversation with his friends . Out of the chambers of Congress he was either devoting himself to the acquisition of knowledge pertaining to the immediate subject of the duty before him , or else he was indulging in those social interests in which he has so much delighted . My honorable friend of Kentucky has spoken in just terms of his colloquial talents . They certainly were singular and eminent-there was a charm in his conversation . He delighted , especially , in conversation with young men . I suppose that there has been no man among us who had more winning manners in his intercourse and conversation with young men , than Mr. CALHOUN . I believe one great power of his character , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that as well as a consciousness of his high integrity , and the highest reverence for his talent and ability , that has made him so endeared an object to the people of the State to which he belonged . Mr. President , he had the basis , the indispensable basis , of a high character , and that was unspotted integmity , unimpeached honor and character . If he had aspirations , they were high and honorable . There was nothing grovelling , or low , or selfish that came near the head or heart of Mr. CALHOUN-Iirm in his purpose , perfectly patriotic and honest , as I am quite sure he was in the principles that he espoused and in the measures that l* defendecl . Aside from that large regard for that species of distinction that conducted him to eminent station , for the benefit of the republic , I do not believe that he was imbued with selfish feelings . However , sir , he may have differed from others of us in his political principles , those principles and those opinions will descend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lived long enough-he has done enough , and done so successfully , so honorably as to connect himself , for all time , with the records of his country . " On Tuesday , March 19 , Mr. Hale addressed the Senate in reply to Mr. Calhoun 's speech on the slavery question . He proposed examii*ing the history of the agitation of this subject , the account of which , he said , as given by Mr. Calhoun , sounded more like romance , than the truth of history . That gentleman had asserted that these agitations consisted in a series of aggressions by the North on the rights of the South ; and that these aggressions , resulting in the loss of the equilibrium between the two sections , had commenced in the ordinance of 1787 . But how , he asked , could that ordinance be termed an aggression , when the only dissenting vote , on its adoption , was from a Northern state This ordinance , he said , which is no other than the original of the Wilmot Proviso , was passed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Congress that assembled under the federal Constitution , and has continued to be re-enacted , in substance , from the time of General Washington , who sig ned the first act , down to President Polk , who signed the same provision in the Oregon bill . And this principle , the power of Cangress to legislate on the subject of slavery in the territories , or between the United States and other countries , has been assumed in every act of the Federal Government , organizing territories from that time to this . In proof of this , Mr. Hale , referred to an act passed in 1794 , prohibiting the carrying on the slave trade from the United States to any foreign place or country ; to the act of 1798 , making it umilawful to bring slaves into Mississippi Territory , from any place without the United States ; and to the Oregon bill of 1848 . With regard to the assertion of the Senator from South Carolina , Mr. Hale continued , that the direct attacks on slavery in Congress have commenced within the limited period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 1776 , and he would find one of the most " agitating " and " fanatical " papers that he could well find , beginning with the declaration that all men are created equal . He would also refer him to a petition dated 1776 , from Benjamin Franklin as President of the Pennsylvania Society for the abolition of slavery . He referied also , to the action of Congress upon a petition of the inhabitants of the territory of In ( liana , prayi ry might ng that slave be permitted within that territory for a limited period . Mr. Randolph , Chairman of the Committee to whom the petition was referred reported as follows : " That the rapid population of the State of Ohio , proves , in the opinion of the Committee that the labor of slaves is not necessary to promote the 536 // growth and settlement of colonies in that region* That this labor , demonstrably the dearest of all , can only be employed to advantage in the cultivation of products more valuable than any known to that quarter of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpedient to impair a provision wisely calculated to promote the happiness and prosperity of the Northwestern country , and to give strength and security to that extensive frontier , and they believe* that in the salutary operation of this law , the inhabitants of Indiana , will find , at no distant day ample remuneration for a temporary privation of labor and of emigration . " Surely , continued Mr. Hale , these instances sufficiently prove that the ordinance of 1787 was not the act of a part , but of the whole country , that its spirit was impressed on the legislation of the country at the earliest period ; and that it has continued them to the present day . Another cause of agitation , and of disturbance of the equilibrium , the Senator proceeded , is sought in the Missouri compromise . But this compromise , whenever offered , uniformly receives the votes of the South , while the North , as a body , are opposed to it . A third cause of disturbance is pointed out in the Oregon bill ; but this bill was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year and a half . The next in this series of aggressions is what is called the unequal system of revenue and disbursement adopted by this government . But this revenue has been mainly raised by duties on imports , and such duties , Mr. Hale considered always fall upon , and are paid by consumers , be they where they may . A state then , having ten times the population of another *te pays ten times more revenue . Wherever the imports go , there the revenue is collected . With regard to the charge of unequal disbursements , the Senator thought it completely opposed to the whole testimony of history . " The expenditures of government are not made in the North , the officers of the government do not come from the North , nor are the great contracts made there . What is it that consumes one half , aye , three fourths of your revenue , but the army and the navy , and where is it expended * Why , where your Indian wars occur , your Seminole and Creek wars , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . " The various tariffs , too , have been invei*hed against by the Senator from South Carolina , as oppressive to the South . But this system of policy has been fastened upon the country by the force of Southern votes , and originally against the wishes and interests of the NewEngland States . The whole legislation of this country has been , in fact , under Southern influence . The Presidents of the United States hr*ve been Somfthern men . The bench of the Supreme Court has been filled from the Sotith . And no man , he said , has done more to stamp upon our Councils the character and features of that section , than the honorable Senator from South Carolina . Mr. Hale then referred to the charge that the abolition societies of the North , although apparently disowned , were in reality courted and pampered by the rival factions in those states . Notoriously said he , these societies have been , until lately ; under the ban of public opinion . Their presses have been destroyed , their orators mobbed , their meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas was effected , that the public sentiment at the North began to lean towards abolitionism . But they saw in this measure , a settled purpose to aggrandize the South at the expense of Northern rights and feelings , and to use the power of the general government to spread the baneful institution of slavery . The annexation of Texas , Mr. Hale continued , was effected in an unconstitutional manner ; and the rights claimed by that state to form new slave states out of her territories , were founded on a contract obtained in fraud and consequently void . Congress has a right to admit states . So far , then , as concerns the admission of Texas , the compact was binding on the United States , and on Texas . But Congress has no right to connect with such admission , a treaty with a foreign nation , fixing obligations on this government . All rights then claimed by Texas on the strength of this treaty were without proper foundation . Mr. Hale then commented on the proposal for severer laws for the arrest of fugitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws * You come upon an individual , who has been born and nurtured in the North , owing allegiance , and entitled to protection there . You come upon him with an affidavit taken a thousand miles off , and you seize him . Where is that man 's right ? Where is the trial by jury * Where is the habeas corpus * Where is the protection which the constitution guaranties to the nearest citizen living under the law * Now , I am free to say , once for all much as I love the Union , much as I reverence its institutions , fond as are my memories which cling around its early histories , I would sacrifice them all to-day , before I would consent that the citizens of my native state should at one blow be stripped of every right that is dear to them , and for which their fathers bled and died . During the last month , little of interest has taken place in Congress . The House has been awaitiiig the action of the Senate on the question of the admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaited the action of the country . Speeches have been made for the benefit of constituents , predictions of speedy dissolution by Southern members , and incredulous responses on the part of the North . Meantime four motiths of the session have gone by , and little of the large amount of business on hand has been transacted . On Thursday , April 4th , the special or*ier of the day being the resolutions of compromise , submitted by Mr. BELL , and the pending question thereon being a motion , by Mr. FOOTE , to ! refer the same to a select committee of thirteen , Mr. WEBSTER reminded the Senate of the great delay in the discharge of their public duties , and thought the time was come , when , without encroaching on the liberty of discussion , they might proceed to some action on the subjects that had so engrossed their attention . He should endeavor , so far as lay in his power , to bring this question of the admission of California per se , to a decision by the Senate . After that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had no wish to check the liberty of debate ; but he urged the necessity , instead of keeping all these subjects open and before them , from day to day , to take up some measures of a practical kind , and debate on that , until they were ready to act upon it . With regard to the proposition of Mr. FOOTE , he had no objection to coining to a vote upon it , but it was his opinion that every man was , by this time , as well informed upon these general subjects as he could possibly be after any report from a committee . He was for acting at once on California , and then upon the territorial bills reported by Committees on Territories . He wished this for th' sake of the satisfaction it would give the country , and the relief to men 's minds . He wished , too , to enable Congress to go through with its ordinary duties , and he despaired of any wise , temperate , and just legislation , until these disturbing causes be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this question-brought upon us by the events of the last two or three years somewhat unexpectedly-should be settled . I wish it to be settled upon the true principles of the constitution of the United States . I want no new platform . I ask for no concessions upon one side or the other-no new compromises . The constitution is enough-broad enough , full enough , efficient enough ; and if we c*tn bring ourselves to act with moderation , and temperance , and candor , and liberality , and I will say-what is chiefly important-with fraternal regard and sympathy upon the questions before us , in the spirit of the constitution , we are able to rescue the country from its embarrassment . tVe-we who sit here , clothed with this high authority for a moment-are able to rescue this country , to relieve it , and to satisfy the public judgment and the public feeling of the extreme North and the extreme South , and from ocean to ocean . I believe it . " Mr. FOOTE , in reply , objected to taking up the California bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California per Se , the nonslavery party in Congress would adopt the inaction policy proposed by the administration . This course of proceeding , he said , is already zealously advocated by leading Whig presses in the North . It has , even here , been openly avowed this session in both houses of Congress . Pass the California bill , and gentlemen will be heard to cry out that New Mexico and Deseret can do very well without government for the present , at least , until they have population sufficient to entitle them to demand admittance into the Union as States . He thought that to carry a suitable bill for the government of the Territories , especially without the Wilmot Proviso , would require all the favorable circumstances that the forbearance and tactics of its friends could bring to its support . And he assured Senators that the admission of California by herself , " would awaken a feeling of chagrin , of irritation , and flaming indignation throughout the whole South , which in his judgment , would make all future attempts of adjustment hopeless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the generous ambition of the Senator from Massachusetts to ward off and prevent . " The next day the same question being before the Senate , Mr. CLAY spoke as follows . lie deplored the mutual distrust , both of honor and fidelity , which had arisen between parties during the present agitation . He did not partake of that feeling to the extent that others did . It had been his anxious desire , from the first , to see these great questions settled amicably , and harmony and fraternal*feeling restored to this divided country . Every proposition offered , that had this result in view , he had hailed with delight . He was , therefore , ready to vote for the proposition of Mr. FOOTE , though far from sanguine as to the result . For one , he was ready to vote for California either separately , or in conjunction with the other territories , and with , or without the boundaries she has marked out for herself . He thought , in fact , California should have . been admitted on the instant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this measure , that he now believed the only way to insure her prompt admission would be its combination in the same bill with provisions for the government of the rest of the territories . The accusation that such a course savored of disrespect , seemed to him completely imaginary . He saw no disrespect . What was there incon 538 May , // gruous or improper in apportioning , by one arrangement , their various governments to the different territories acquired at the same moment from Mexico * Another recommendation of this proposition was , that we are aiming at a compromise ; and a compromise , he thought , should settle as many as possible of the distracting questions before the country . He doubted the propriety of admitting the bill for the recovery of fugitives , but in all that related to California , all that related to governments , for the other two territories , and even , if necessary , the adjustment of the boundaries of Texas-though that , he thought , might as well be left out-all these kindred subjects should be associated under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the amendment to Mr. FOOTE s resolution , excepting from the other questions before the committee on all reference to the subject of California . April 8 , Mr. BENTON continued the debate on these subjects , as follows : He was Ol ) pOsed to the joining the question of the admission of California with any one , much more with the whole , of the distracting questions arising out of the slave institutions of the United States . " California is a State , and should not be mixed up with anything below the dignity of a State . She has washed her hands of slavery at home , and should not be mixed up with it abroad . She presents a single application , and should not he coupled with other subjects . What are these subjects * They are , " said Mr. BENTON ,  --  " 1 . The creation of territorial governments in New Mexico , and in the remaining part of California . " 2 . Th* creation of a new State in Texas , reduction of her boundaries , settlement of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory to the United States . " 3 . Recapture of fugitive slaves . " 4 . The suppression of the slave trade in the District of Columbia . " 5 . Abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia . " 6 . Abolition of slavery in the ports , arsenals , navy-yards , and dock-yards of the United States . " 7 . Abolition of the slave trade between the States . " 8 . Abolition of slavery between the StMes . Anda non-enumerated catalogue of oppressions and encroachments upon the South . " He was opposed , the Senator coniinued , to this mixture of diverse questions , separately and collectively . Ott the score of general considerations , he objected to it , because no other State had been subjected to a like indignity ; because the subjects coupled with the admission of CaliVOL . V. NO . V. NEW SERIES . fornia were distracting , angry , and threatening dissolution and secession , while her application was conciliatory , national , and proP fering increase and strength to the Union ; because every principle of fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits , unaided by stronger measures , unimpeded by weaker ones ; and because California herself objects to this mixture , by that provision in her constitution , which says that " every law passed by the legislature shall contain but one object . " He objected also to this admixture , Mr. BENTON continued from the incongruity of its ingredients : 1 . The government of the two territories brings up the question of the Wilmot Proviso , which is unconstitutional in the opinion of some , inexpedient in the opinion of others , and both constitutional and expedient in the opinion of some others . It is an angry and sectional question . California has freed herself from its trammels , by refusing to admit slayery within her borders . How wrong , then , to connect her admission with the other matters concerning those neighboring territories , which alone can justly come under the the action of this Proviso ! Moreover , the question of her admission is clearly constitutional , for Congress has the expressed power to admit new States . While the Wilmot Proviso power is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor absolutely denied . Oaths to the Constitution can not be compromised , and , therefore , doubtful questions should never be mixed with those of undisputed constitutionality . He believed slavery to be extinct in New Mexico and in all California , and was ready to vote them governments without provision on that subject . 2 . Texas , with her large and complex question , should equally , with California , object to this conjunction . They present incongruous subjects , and large enough each to demand a separate consideration . The settlement of the Texas question depends partly on the action of that State . It would be Texas , then , -* and not the United States , that would decide upon the admission of California , as well as other questions connected therewith by the resolutions of compromise . The Texas questions should be adjusted , should have been , in fact , at the time of her annexation . He should vote accordingly for their settlement , but only as a separate and substantive measure . 3 . The fugitive slave bill . This again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for she has no slaves to lose , and from her distance can receive none . He protested , too , -* against the dishonor offered to California , by mixing up the high question of her admission 35 1850. 539 // with a bill for the arrest of runaway negroes . There was already before Congress , said Mr. BENTON , a bill for the recovery of slaves . He was ready to vote for it , for any thing , in fact , which would be efficient and satisfactory on this score . It was the only thing , he thought , in which the North , as States , had given just cause of complaint to the slave-holding interest . But he saw , in this body , no disposition to evade legislating the remedy . He saw no greater diversity of opinion than in any ordinary measure before Congress ; no line dividing North from South , the East from the West . 4 . Suppression of the slave trade in the District of Columbia . Here , again , California is in no ways especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be put in the balance against the admission of a State . The measure is right in itself , and there seems but one opinion in Congress concerning it . During his thirty years ' experience in that body , he had seen no state of parties in which this revolting traffic might not have been suppressed . 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia , abolition of slavery in the ports , arsenal3 , navy-yards , and dock-yards of the United States , abolition of the slave trade between the States , and abolition of slavery in the States . None of these questions would he submit to a committee . He would not take them under consideration . The agitation in the South on these subjects was a false alarm . Congress had never evinced a disposition to meddle with them . These rights of the slaveAiolding interest were guarantied by the Constitution and needed no additional sure*ty of Congressional compromise . Sixty years ' refusal to act , sixty years ' disclaimer of power , is the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its duty . " These are all the specified causes of alarm to the slave States from any cowduct , or apprehended conduct , on the part of Congress , of which I have heard complaint . I 4o not trouble myself with those who have no power to act-with individuals or societies . Congress is the effective power  --  the representative of all the States  --  and of that I speak , and say , that I know of nothing in its conduct which can give the slave States amiy cause for complaint or alarm . " Undefined complaints there are , the Senator continued , of aggressions and encroachments , but for these he knew of no'foundation . Offensive legislative resolutions there certainly were , but nothing that in their character amounted to aggression or encroachment . But he did n't know of forbearance in Congress from exercising one undoubtedly Constitutional power , and which might have been used to the manifest ann*iyance and aggression of the South . The slave property ot that section , valued at more than a thousand millions , and which no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxation of which , there were the precedents of 1798 and 18t3 , this rich source of molestation to the South , and of profit at the expense of the South , no Northern member has ever proposed or hinted at . If , then , Congress refuses to exercise a right clearly constitutional , and fraught with mischief and oppression , what reason have we to imagine a tendency to measures which will accomplish that purpose no more surely , and have not the safe ground of the Constitutition to stand on ? But Congress does not stop at forbearance , said Mr. Benton . In the very year that saw the commencement of the slavery agitation , so little was Congress affected by abolition societies and petitions , that it actually increased the area of slavery , and at the expense of the Missouri compromise line . The annexation of the Platte country to Missouri , gained to that State six new counties carved out of free soil . Behold Texas ; ceded to Spain , by a Southern administration in 1819 , recovered by the help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeemed from the Indian by Northern votes , and the white man and his slave *tllowed to go where actually slavery never existed before ! Mr. BENTON then spoke of the objections raised against the admission of California . It was urged by her opponents that her State government had been formed without previous action of Congress . But eight of the United States had been admitted in a similar manner , in a period of sixty years , running back from the year 1846 to the time of Washington . There were aliens too , it was said , having a voice in the adoption of the Constitution of California . The same objection was raised in the case of Michigan , but Congress overlooked the irregularity , for there was no alienism in its Constitution . Neither is there in that of California . It is an American Constitution , and thoroughly republican . A third objection was , that its population was not sufficient to entitle it to admission as * State . But there were 100,000 male adults in California , and in the usual calculations it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , there was omie male adult . The 100,000 voters then in California would correspond to 600,000 inhabitants in the older States . He supposed that the attraction of the sexes was as true a natural law as the attraction of gravitation , amid California would soon* doubtless have its proper proportion of women and children . With regard to the territorial extent of California , he compared it with that of Texas . He main-540 May , // tamed that the boundaries adopted were the natural limits . Deduct her mountains and wastes , and her soil adapted to cultivation was not as extensive as that of Missouri or Illinois . Mr. BENTON then spoke of the charge brought up of interference by the administration . He had no belief that there had been such interference , and how , if there had been , * ' could it affect the question of her admission * How should the fault of the Executive be allowed to deprive the people of California of their rights * In the House of Representatives , March 6 , Mr. STANLEY spoke as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroachmentson the South -- -aggressions on the South . " Some cause there was , he admitted , of complaint , but that the whole North were open to the sweeping censures cast upon them , he denied . He had watched the times , and it was now his settled conviction that most of this hue and cry originated in a malignant wish to embarrass the administration . The most unkind , and improper , and furious , though feeble , aspersions have been cast in a number of the speeches here , upon the motives of the President . In most of them , the Whig party has been fiercely denounced . He believed he could shew that all this agitation was for party purposes . It was as a Northern man with Southern principles , and by casting the stigma of abolition principles upon the Whigs that Mr. VAN BUREN rode into power . XVhen Mr. HARRISON was nominated for the Presidency , he , too , was denounced as an abolitionist . Mr. CLAY was denounced as an abolitionist ; and the only allies of the South were Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all these protestations , the event has fully shewn . Mr. STANLEY would not admit that either of the great parties at the North were hostile to the South . Some fanatics there are , but the great body of Northern people he could not believe were enemies to the Constitution and the Union . Mr. STANLEY thought that the complaints made by agitators in the South and echoed by their doughfaced friends in the North , on the one hand , and the ravings of the fanatical Wilmot Proviso men on the other hand , proceeded from a keen relish for party spoils . By thus spreading their nets , they hope* to drag in votes from both wings of the country . In this political game , one of the main points is the excitement raised concerning fhe refusal to surrender fugitive slaves . It is true the North has behaved badly in this respect , but have slaves never escaped before to the Northern States * Did this difficulty in recovering fugitives only commence with General Taylor 's administration * It is certainly singular that from 1838 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to General Taylor 's election , no effort had been made to demand additional legislation upon this subject . Another reason given us by disunionists , is the annoyance the South receives from the agitations of abolitionists , and the abolition petitions that besiege Congress . But before th' repeal of the " twenty-first rule , " Southern gentlemen said that if that rule should be repealed and these petitions received , the Union would be dissolved . But the rule was repealed , and still the union holds together . The petitions were received , and how stands the fact now * We have been here , said Mr. Stanley , more than three months and not a single abolition petition has been presented . The fact is , that in this favoured land , our people from " excess of ease " continually run into extravagances . When they could not war against the twenty-first rule , they form peace societies , societies for the rights of women , ' &amp;c . Denunciations only makes these people fold the cloak of prejudice more closely around them . Persecution brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless . But complaint is made that the North does not interfere to stop their aggressions . Who can silence the fanatic * or can not quiet her own anti-renters . New York , Massachusetts , Philadelphia can not prevent mobs and destructive riots within their own borders . Neither are all who are opposed to slavery disposed to interfere with slavery in the States . The Quakers in North Carolina , and elsewhere are opposed to slavery . Their petitions for the adoption of measures to secure its final extinction have been presented and received by our own Legislature . And these men are among our best population , industrious , sober , orderly . Another " aggression , " is that Massachusetts in 1843 passed resolutions recommending a change in the Constitution of the United States . But though the Legislature of Massachusetts did wrong in this instance , it does not follow that while the present constitution stands , she would interfere with slavery in the Southern states . If her conduct evinces a disposition to interfere , it admits also a want of power under the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks on the slave trade in the District of Columbia . But these attacks are not by Northern men alone . Southern members had reported bills against this traffic , and for himself , he was ready at any time to pass a law breaking up these miserable establishments carried on under the very eyes of Congress itself . As regards the abolition of slavery in the 1850. 541 // District , no man in his senses could believe that Congress would ever be guilty of the folly or the outrage of such interference . " Such an act would justly be regarded by the Southern Sates as a declaration of hostility on the part of the North , and they would act accordingly . " " Yes , " said Mr. Stanley , " the South has been terribly oppressed ! Out of the si*cty years since the Constitution was framed , the South has had the Presidents all of the time except twelve years and one month . We have had our share of other high offices . How is it now * In the midst of this formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , we have elected a southern President , who was said to be the owner of more than two hundred slaves ! and that , too , against the nominee of the Baltimore convention , when it was said there was no slaveholder on their ticket ! ' " We have a southern Speaker , with whose manner of discharging the duties of the chair I have no complaint to make . And what a spectacle his election presented ! So strong was party feeling with some gentlemen from the non-slaveholding States , that when the issue was a northern or a southern Speaker , they refused to vote for a northern Speaker . This speaks volumes ; party feelings must always influence us , must always be felt by the North and West , and southern votes will always be wanted . A majority of the Cabinet are from slaveholding States . In the Supreme Court we have five to four . In the army and navy we have our full share . Of the foreign ministers we have more than our share . But still " GoTT 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles us . Let me record another instance of northern liberality . When General HARRISON died , Mr. TYLER became President . Mr. SOUTHARD , of New Jersey , was chosen President of the Senate ; he died , and did the North practise aggression on us l Did they elect a northern President of the Senate l No ; they elected a distinguished Senator ( Mr. MANGTJM ) from my own state . " Mr. STANLEY then alluded to the speeches of certain agitators on that floor . Harsh and cruelly uncharitable speeches had been made , apparently with the only view of wounding the feelings of the South . Horrible pictures have been drawn of the miseries aifrl the despotism of slavery . The fearful consequences of disunion have been gloated upon with apparent delight . And what has been the effect of men holding aud publishing such opinions as these * Emancipation in the southern States . which was going on daily , has been completely stopped . . Free negroes voted in North Carolina until the year 1835 . In one town , where he had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were free blacks A simple petition , then , to the Court on half*a sheet of paper , at the request of the master , alleging that he alone had rendered meritorious services , and the slave was made free . And now emancipation is a difficult matter . Their laws allowed slaves to be emancipated by will , but not to remain in the State . " Sir , " said Mr. STANLEY , " I remember well when we had negro meeting houses , and negro preachers , some of whom could read and write well ; but your philanthropiststhose men who would rather look on rivers of blood than that slavery should be extended one inch , and have such horror of chains , shackles and despotism-they sent incendiary documents among our slaves , exciting them to insurrection . As an inevitable result , education was forbidden . Self-protection required it-protection for the slaves required it . And this is another fruit of your sympathy for the slave ! But we do not deny them religious instruction . In one town in my district , the negroes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a Methodist church . I wish northern gentlemen could see them , neatly dressed , with cheerful faces , as they are going to worship . I wish they could hear their heart-rejoicing songs , when they sing praises to their Maker . They would think better of slaveholders and less of Abolitionists . Our people regard slaves as property , but not as cattle raised for market . ii tell these Abolitionists , you are the men who have " riveted the chains . " But for your efforts , thousands of slaves would have been educated and emancipated-would have been returned to Africa and Liberia , under the influence of the Christian religion-would have realized what the psalmist said : Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God . " ' With regard to the Wilmot Proviso question , continued Mr. Stanley , whether constitutionaj or unconstitutional , it would be gross injustice to the South to enact any such measure . He was opposed to disunion ; the people of his own State regarded the thought of disunion with horror . But , if the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility , they would feel forced to provide for their own security in such manner as the world would justify . The North should remember that all tyrannous legislation would produce sectional animosities . With regard to the charge that the revenue system of duties on imports imposes undue and peculiar burdens on the planting interest of the South , he considered that any tax that the Government can impose , so far as it operates on consumption , can only compel the Southern planter to share in the burden which all consumers have to bear . Nor can this burden be 542 May , // to the whole amount of the duty , for the foreign producer must hear his proportion of it , in the diminished profits of capital . Nor has the price of Southern produce fallen since such duties were imposed , while the prices of articles of Southern consumption have even sensibly diminished . Mr. STANLEY then spoke of the California question . It has been pronounced the " test question , " hut only hy those he believed , who wished to bring about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her admitted-. the sooner the better . He believed in the great principle of the right of man to self-government . He would not consent to remand her , for her people were for the most part our own citizens , and there would he danger in compelling her to form a government without our aid . In regard to the matter of territorial governments , he saw no plan better than that recommended by the President , and should cordially support it . In the House of Representatives , April 3 , Mr. I*I'CLERNAND , of Illinois , gave notice of his intention to offer at the prayer time , as a compromise to the question of slavery , a bill having for its basis the following objects : 1st . The bill provides for the admission of the State of California into the Union with her constitutional boundaries . 2d . The bill provides for the erection of a Territorial Government , to include that part of the territory of the United States lying south of the 42o north latitude east of the State of California , north of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers , and the main easterly branch of the latter to its source ; thence west of a due north line to the summit of the mountain range divid-S ing the waters flowing into the Pacific from those flowing into the Great Basin ; thence west of the summit of that mountain range to its intersection with the 42e north latitude . This Government is styled the Territory of Utah . 3d . The bill provides for the erection of a Territorial Government , including all the residue of the territory of the United States , acquired by the law treaty with the Mexican Republic , not included in the State of California and the Territory of Utah , more or less , including , of course , the department of New Mexico , with its rightful limits , and not more . The Territory thus erected , or the Territorial Governments to be formed therefrom , are provided for by a pledge that they shall be admitted into the Union , with convenient limits , as States when their population shall be sufficient , and when they shall have presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 4th . The bill provides that , if the State of of Texas shall consent to and confirm that part of the southern boundary of the territory of New Mexico , as defined , extending from the intersection of the 340 north latitude with the Rio Grande , upoa direct line to the intersection of 100* of longir tude west from Greenwich , with the Red river on the main or Salt Fork thereof , and shall quit claim all the territories north of said boundary , to the extent of her claim to the United States ; in that event certificates of five per cent stock , amounting in all , to $10,000,000 , are to be delivered to Texas by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States ; provided that if Texas shall thus reduce her boundary as claimed by her , such reduction shall not alter the number of States authorised to be admitted into the Union without any restriction as to slavery in the joint resolution for annexing Texas to the United States ; and provided further , that if the State of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth proposition shall be null and of no effect by inteudment or otherwise .
