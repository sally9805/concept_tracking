txt ART . 111. - REVIEW OF CLARKE ON THE FORGIVENESS OF SIN . The Christian Doctrine of Forgiveness of Sin . An Essay . By JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE . Boston : William Crosby and II . P. Nichols , 1852. l6mo. pp. 172 . THE author of this little book is ranked with the Unitarians . Yet he seems , in this work , to have taken a position in advance of the great body of Unitarians , with respect to some of the points of controversy between them and the Orthodox . Indeed his aim is to act as arbiter between the two parties , and to point out opinions and theories on both sides , which in his view are contrary to , or fall short of , the true doctrine of forgiveness . Looking from the orthodox point of view , we have been gratified to see the earnestness and candor with which the matter is discussed , and still more to find a close similarity of the author 's views in some cases , and the entire accordance of them in others , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is admirably clear , direct and terse , and as free as possible from the technical terms of the theological schools . Without apology or preface , the author proceeds directly to the discussion which he has undertaken , as one who feels that his subject is weighty , and that it now presents itself in such a form to the minds of both the Orthodox and the Unitarians , as to demand a new examination with reference to the points of difference . For our own part , we care not how frequently discussions of these points of difference take place . Such discussions are to // be strongly desired , if they be conducted with the fine temper and style which characterize this essay ; and no other than a good result is to be expected from them . If ever the two great classes of professing Christians , the orthodox and the unitarian , are to " come into the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God , " it can only be by means of friendly discussions , like that before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise points of difference between the two parties , and to set them forth in such a way , that they shall be mutually understood , and mutually acknowledged to be fairly stated . It scarcely need be said , however , that an agreement between the two parties will never be purchased by the Orthodox , at the cost of what they now hold as fundamental truths of Christianity . However much in the progress of such discussions forms of statement may change , as it is an historical fact that they have repeatly changed , yet none can ever be regarded as orthodox Christians , who do not hold as fundamental the great truths which the Orthodox now receive , and which the great body of Christians have always held . There can be as little doubt that speculative theories of Christian truth , will , in the minds of many , be renounced , and that the distinction between the human theory , and the revealed fact , will be more and more clearly drawn . Modified forms of statement of Christian doctrines will come into use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both sides with whom the error is more in the head than in the heart , more in the knowledge than in the faith of the Son of God , will be drawn together into such an agreement , as will ( 10 honor to the Christian name , and give a powerful impulse to Christianity . To changes in the form of stating Christian doctrines , there certainly can be no solid objection . It is not necessary to adopt the precise form of words of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster , or at Saybrook , in order to hold the truths which they held , or in order to hold a clear and settled creed . The truths contained in those forms may be taught in other words as well , and perhaps even better , at least better for these times , and nearer the level of the apprehensions of men of this day . Ancient creeds have their peculiar sign ificancy. in that they were shaped with reference to the exigencies , philosophical and theological , of the age in which they arose . Creeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical statements of the Christian doctrines , are now as forms of doctrine virtually dead , whatever efforts may be made to revive them . They are dead , because the mode of philosophizing , and other von . *i. 4 // circumstances which gave them their peculiar character , have ceased to exert influence upon religious belief . It is not only vain , then , but it is ridiculous , to urge an antiquated creed upon the adoption of a later age . For even though it may be intrinsically the best , yet wanting adaptation , as it may easily be conceived to do , to another age , and to the apprehensions of men under a different training , it becomes inoperative . And he who attempts to wear a creed which is thus out-worn , makes as seemly a figure as would one who should go about dressed in the old-fashioned , mouldy and threadbare clothes of his great-grandfather . It is not necessary , in order to be a Puritan in spirit , that one should adopt the peculiar fashion of dress which was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this , to believe in clothes , and to wear good Christian clothes . So may we have a good orthodox creed , a creed as sharply defined as need be , and yet as a form of words that creed may vary , and rightfully vary , from the orthodox creeds of other times . What is most needed , then , in the matter which lies between the Orthodox and Unitarians , is , that by discussion and comparison of the modes of statement employed by each other , such forms of words may be reached as shall embody in a manner least objectionable to all , the whole Scriptural truth , and nothing but the Scriptural truth , with respect to the points at issue . We have been insensibly led into this course of remark by the tenor of the book before us . The author has been very successful in shunning the phraseology of creeds , and in presenting his views in clear language suited to all minds . He approaches the subject as though there had never been any such thing as theology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which on such a subject could hardly be original . How far he will succeed in harmonizing the views of the two parties , is another question . This can be better determined after a direct examination of the contents of the book , which we now proceed to make . We doubt not that others , as we ourselves have been , will be gratified to see in it , an entire agreement with the Orthodox in many fundamental Christian doctrines . The reader will find in most , we are sorry not to be able to say in all instances , a correct statement of the doctrines taught by the Orthodox , quite unlike those caricatures which have so often and so absurdly been put forth by Unitarians , as truthful accounts of orthodox views . The book is divided into five parts , entitled severally : 1 . State of the Question . 2 . Nature of Forgiveness. 3 . Faith and Works ; or Conditions of Forgiveness. 4 . Obstacles // and Helps to Forgiveness. 5 . Results of Forgiveness . We propose , following the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view is correct in his statements , and in a spirit of friendliness and candor to notice his mistakes and deficiencies . In the first part , the author very justly assigns a high rank among Christian doctrines to the doctrine of Forgiveness , as having great prominence in the teachings of Christ and his Apostles , and as being found in Christian experience , of absolute necessity in order to spiritual peace and progress . It is a pretty good proof of the impartiality of the author , and of his earnestness for the truth , that he takes occasion , under this head , to utter in its most rigid form the profound truth , which is however a doctrine of the stiffest orthodoxy , that " the moral law makes men worse instead of better . " This he maintains to be a Scriptural doctrine , and explains it satisfactorily , on psychological grounds , and on the groun.d of the depravity of the natural desires of men . The revelation of a perfect standard of duty does not give man power to perform the duty . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , he does not wish to perform . The sense of failure and guilt , in case an attempt to obey is made , produces discouragement and desperation . But this truth is so well stated by the author , and affords so good an instance of his coincidence with the Orthodox , besides being a fine specimen of his usual style , that we will allow him to speak to our readers in his own words : We all know that the conscience , when unenlightened or misinformed , may lead to crime ; and that men ( like the apostle Paul ) have " verily thought that they oa*qIst to " persecute heretics and burn errorists . But the apostle Paul was the first to recognize the fact , which no one since his time has dared to state as plainly as himself , that moral teaching by itself , instead of strengthening , may weaken the moral energies . " The law , " he says , " is holy , just , and good ; " but " though ordained for life , it becomes death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8-13 . ) Sin , " he says , " taRes occasion by the commandment , " and being dead before the moral law comes , is developed by it , and becomes active . The way in which this takes place is plain . The law ( that is , the sight of moral truth ) arouses the conscience , and shows us our duty , but does not give us strength to perform it . It produces a disproportion between our moral powers and our moral aims . In order that we may make moral progress , two things are necessary ,  --  a new aim , and a new power ; a clearer sight of what we ought to be , and stronger motive to induce us to become it . Now , the moral law only fulfills one of these conditions . It shows us what we ought to he . We endeavor to obey it , and may succeed to a certain extent , but never wholly ; for the moral law ( lemands perfect obedience , and consequently it always leaves us with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . But more than this . It sets before us duties which are opposed to our wishes , and which we do not even try to fulfill . This leaves us not only with a sense of failure , but with a sense of sin , of guilt . But a sense of guilt no one can endure ; and to escape from it , we must stifle the voice of conscience , cease to think of duty , and plunge recklessly into that other kind of satisfaction which comes from the gratification of desire . Consequently , we go further into guilt than we should have done if the conscience had not been enlightened at all . // A revelation of a perfect standard of duty is indeed necessary , in order to the reformation of man . But it is only the first step , and proves worse than useless without the second step , which is supplied by the revelation of forgiveness . There are , according to our author , two ideas of forgiveness : " It means either that one ceases to be angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offense , or both . When the executioners , who were about to kindle the pile , which was to consume the Maid of Orleans , asked her forgiveness , they did not mean to ask her for a remission of punishment , for they were not exposed to any punishment ; they meant to ask that she would not be offended with them , for what they were compelled to do . But when a condemned criminal asks forgiveness of the executive power , he does not ask that the king or governor in whose hand mercy lies shall not be angry with him ; for he knows that they entertain no such feeling . He asks for a remission of the penalty of the crime . " Applying these views of forgiveness to God , a difficulty at once arises , in Mr. Clarke 's mind , in supposing God to forgive sin in either sense . Cease to be angry or displeased at sin , God certainly can not , so long as sin is not entirely removed from the character . Nor so long as sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness , in the sense of a remission of the penalty . For the penalty , that is , the evil consequences of sin , must remain upon the man , until he grows perfectly holy . It would seem , then , impossible that , in either sense of forgiveness , God should forgive sin . And yet the author believes that God does forgive . He finds the same apparent contradiction in the Scriptures which teach , now , a full and free Forgiveness , and again , a strict retribution rendered to every man according to his works . Our author escapes from this dilemma only by imagining that the two horns of it are two opposite poles of truth . By the aid of a little convenient transcendentalism , he manages to sail over the head of the logical specter which he has conjured before him , and thus to avoid the dreaded conclusion to which it would lead him . He looks at one horn of the dilemma and reads " Free Forgiveness . " He faces about and g'azes at the other , and reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain mind these are contradictory terms , and can not both be true of the Divine administration . But no , says our author , both are true . They are antagonist truths . They are opposite poles of truth . Mr. Clarke undoubtedly thinks that by the words , " antagonist truths , " and " opposite poles of truth , " he has given a satisfactory solution of the difficulty . But his explanation certainly stands // in need of being itself explained . Until that is done , it can not be certain that it has any meaning , and much less can it be admitted , as setting the question proposed at rest . That retribution and forgiveness are things opposite to each other is plain . That both may find place under the Divine administration and belong to a full and harmonious expression of the Divine character may easily be admitted . But then , that God should both freely forgive , and strictly punish , the same zndividual , is certainly a contradiction in terms , nor is it at all relieved by using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our author , we come to the state of the question , between the Orthodox and the Liberal Christians. * According to Mr. Clarke , the Orthodox have seized on one of the two antagonist truths ; the Liberals on the other . Both have excluded from view , the truth which is antagonistical to that which they have received . The Orthodox have adopted the doctrine of Free Forgiveness , but have rejected the doctrine of an Exact Retribution rendered to those who are forgiven . Liberal Christians have held to Retribution , but in the attempt to make retribution consistent with forgiveness , have substituted a gradual forgiveness for that present and full forgiveness offered in the Scriptures . Whether or not any of the Liberal Christians will accept this , as a just statement of their tenets , is doubtful . It is very certain that none of the Orthodox will acknowledge the correctness of the representation of their views . The latter do indeed hold that " there is no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus ; " and they do not hold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no condemnation . Nor do we see how any man can hold doctrines which are so expressly contradictory . Yet , all that Mr. Clarke contends for under the name of retribution , the Orthodox do most certainly hold . They do hold that the rewards of the righteous will be proportioned to their works , and that those who spend their lives in sin , and come to a late repentance , or are unfaithful in the Christian life , will meet with an everlasting loss . Such deficiency of blessedness will not , however , be intended as a punishment , and.therefore it is consistent with an entire forgiveness . Yet there will be , the Orthodox maintain , a real loss , and that just according to the deficiency in the character and works of the Christian . It is not , then , true , as Mr. Clarke asserts , that " the only argument * For convenience we use Mr. Clarke 's designation , Orthodox or Evangelical Christians , and Rational or Liberal Christians , although the terms themselves are not opposed to each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procrastination , is , that one may die suddenly without an opportunity for adequate repentance . " What Mr. Clarke declares to be the true argument that every hour in which the real work of life is postponed , is so much utterly and forever lost , is , in fact , urged by the Orthodox . The assumption of the author , therefore , that the low state of practical piety among the Orthodox is due to this deficiency of doctrine , is quite gratuitous . The supposed fact is not a fact , and , if it were , hardly ought to be made to bear the weight of such an inference by one who so eloquently and beautifully sets forth the power of a present forgiveness , as a motive to holy obedience . On the other hand , Liberal Christians are represented by Mr. Clarke as meaning by forgiveness nothing but this , that " when a man has repented of any course of evil conduct , and has reformed his character , so as to be as good a man as he was before , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " or , as we understand it , that forgiveness is nothing but the happiness of mind , which results from reformation of character . If this be a true account , it is indeed a serious error , inasmuch as there is no act of God in such forgiveness . But we more than suspect that few , if any , Liberal Christians will acknowledge the correctness of the picture . Liberal Christians , as a body , believe in a present forgiveness , as the act of a personal God . A portion of them do , indeed , at the present day , carry their views of retribution so far , as seriously to impair the conscious blessedness of the future life of the Christian . But , we apprehend , that the number of them is small , who empty the word forgiveness of meaning , in the way Mr. Clarke supposes . But let this be as it may , the weightiest question between the two parties still is , as it always has been ; What are the conditions of forgiveness ? or rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , and since there is no question about the nature of repentance , ) What is the object of that faith which , in the Scriptures , is made necessary in order to forgiveness ? We come , now , with our author , to consider the nature of forgiveness , which he had before briefly described , but treats of more at large in the chapter alloted to it . Forgiveness , in the author 's view , is the removal of the evil consequences of sin ; and the main point of inquiry with him , is , how far these consequences are removed , when God forgives the sinner ? The evil consequences of sin are two-fold . There is a sense of the displeasure of God , and there is deterioration of moral character . The sense of the Divine displeasure is , in Mr. Clarke 's view , the heaviest penalty of sin . Is that removed // in forgiveness ? It is . Forgiveness in this sense is immediate and absolute . But is the displeasure of God removed as well as the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God is reconciled . But the other evil consequence , the deterioration of character , is not wholly removed . Although the change which takes place in forgiveness does much in the way of its removal , still in the nature of the case , time is required to bring to an end the depravation of the man , which is the result of a course of sin . The sinner is not , in this sense , forgiven , but must suffer the penalty of sin , which he will do , with cheerfulness , and even gladness , since the law of God is honored in his punishment . The consideration of a positive infliction , as the penal consequence of sin , is postponed , as that which , being at all events a future thing , does not pertain to the question of a present forgiveness . These are Mr. Clarke 's views of the nature of forgiveness . We think we have stated them fairly , although briefly . Are they correct ? Let us first take the matter of a two-fold forgiveness . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paitly forgiven , and partly unforgiven ? Are the words , " 1 forgive you , " ever sincerely used in common life with the meaning , " I partly forgive you ? " Would not such a qualification of the word forgive , make void at once its sincerity , to the mind of an offender ? It seems to us that forgiveness is in its very nature a thing complete . It must be whole and entire , or it is nothing . It is true , that one who has committed two or more offenses , may be forgiven one , and not forgiven the rest . But so far as there is any forgiveness , it must be an entire forgiveness . It strikes us as a mere mockery of the necessities of guilty man , that God should be supposed to proclaim a partial forgiveness . Come what may of our theories , we must take the ground , that when God says to man , " Thy sins are forgiven thee , " it is a sure pledge of entire deliverance from punishment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in holding that a sense of the Divine displeasure is the inevitable and fearful consequence of sin . But the propriety of calling it the punishment of sin is to us doubtful . The sinner feels that he has incurred the displeasure of God by his sin . But it is the expression of displeasure by God , in the way of the maintenance of law , which is punishment . A child who has knowingly disobeyed his parent has a sense of the parental displeasure . But it is not until *that displeasure is in some way expressed towards him , that the child is punished . So the expression of the Divine displeasure towards himself , in the way of the maintenance of law , is the sinner 's punishment . If it be considered // as expressed in the sense of that displeasure which arises in the mind on the commission of sin , there is , then , no objection to giving to that sense of it the name of punishment . It may be viewed as expressed thus , or in the remorse , agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the sinner , or in any natural evil with which he is visited . In whatever way the displeasure of God towards himself as a transgressor of law is expressed , and known to be expressed , in that way he is punished . And not only deterioration of character , but the various physical evils which are the consequence of sin , in fact , all evil of every sort which the unforgiven sinner suffers , is his punishmen t . Mr. Clarke seems to have the same view . But his mind labors at a point which is not without difficulties . It is this . If all natural evil which is suffered before forgiveness must be viewed as the punishment of sin , how can one be said to be entirely forgiven , while yet the evil consequences of sin remain with the sinner ? The drunkard , for instance , does not recover his vigor of body and mind , although he has become a reformed , penitent and forgiven man . He may carry a diseased physical frame , an enfeebled mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of sin which he suffers are no longer to be regarded as punishment . It is plain that if the displeasure of God is removed from the sinner in such a kind and to such a degree , that he no longer determines to punish him , then he does no longer punish him . If the Divine displeasure is removed , then every expression of it ceases . Whatever evil results of his sin abide with the sinner after his forgiveness , though outwardly they are the same , yet in their real nature they are changed . To the mind of the sinner , they are no longer accompanied with a sense of the Divine displeasure as expressed in the way of punishment . They are no longer the penalty of sin . The sinner is not then partly forgiven , and partly unforgiven , but is in every sense forgiven . What , then , it may be asked , shall the evil results of sin which remain with the sinner after forgiveness , be called ? If they are not punishment , what are they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , but only to show what they are not . There may be difficulties and obscurities attending them , but one thing is easy and clear , that they have not the same character either to God or to the sinner which they had before forgiveness . Whatever they now are , they are not the penalty of sin , and it is contrary to the very idea of forgiveness to suppose it . If we still ask what these evil consequences are , and why they remain , after forgiveness , we start a question // which only infinite wisdom and love , the same wisdom and love which prepared forgiveness for man , can answer . We may conceive reasons for the sickness , pain , sorrow and gradual decay , from the effects of sin , of the child of God , entirely consistent with the promptings of fdrgiving love . To Illustrate this matter , we will suppose a subject of Queen Victoria to have been banished to Australia for some offense against the laws of England . After a number of years , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time , as he is now in Australia , and has become accustomed to the mode of life there , and is in a situation in which by digging gold and herding cattle , he may do better for himself by remaining than by returning to his former circumstances , the Queen is induced by the same benevolentfeelings which prompted the pardon , to direct him to remain in the Colony . Now the outward condition of this man , immediately after he is pardoned , may be much the same as it was before , but by the fact of a pardon , the whole character of his privations and hardships is changed at once from a curse to a blessing . If he be of a right spirit , he will be grateful to his sovereign , who has directed his continuance for a good end under the same circumstances , which were , before the pardon , felt to be an expression of the royal displeasure at his crime . So , it is quite conceivable , to say the least , that the evils which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wise and gracious end , even after his complete forgiveness . We have thus far limited our views of the punishment and the forgiveness of sin , to those bounds within which Mr. Clarke has seen fit to confine his , viz : the present evil consequences of sin , and their removal . He purposely waives the question of future positive inflictions , although , if we may judge from what he elsewhere indirectly says , he views it as a settled point , that there is no punishment hereafter except the natural consequences of sin . If we mistake not , it is quite a frequent thing to hear from Orthodox pulpits the admission , that the natural consequences of the violation of moral law is probably all that is refelTed to in the fearful threatenings of the Scriptures . That these consequences will , in the progress of the man , grow to be inconceivably dreadful , may well be conceived . Yet it is to be wise beyond the record , to assume that these are the whole punishment of sin , when the Scriptures naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarke , while he waives this question , also thinks it unnecessary , in treating of a present forgiveness , to take the future into account at all . He appears to be under the impres // sion that a present forgiveness must have reference to punishments that are presently felt . Whereas forgiveness , under the unchangeable government of the everlasting God , must , in order to be satisfactory , have respect chiefly to liability to future punishment . That the sinner may have a peaceful sense of pardon , it is necessary that he be assured of exemption from all liability to punishment in all future time . And of this he is assured in the Scriptures on condition of repentance and faith . There is one more difficulty , in the view of Mr. Clarke , in conceiving of a complete forgiveness , which he endeavors to remove in connection with what he says farther on in the Essay , of the relations of the forgiven sinner to Christ . We do not , as will be seen , assent to his explanation , and therefore shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The question is , how can God be perfectly reconciled to one who is not wholly free from sin ? Must not God hate all sin , and be displeased with all who commit it ? It is a sufficient solution of this difficulty , so far as forgiveness is concerned , to say that there is no such displeasure on the part of God towards the forgiven sinner , as renders the latter liable to punishment . More than this , also , is true . The sinner having repented as a condition of forgiveness , being changed in principle and in heart from an evil to a good man , the displeasure which God before entertained towards him as evil at heart , ceases . The change then on the part of God towards the sinner is a very great change ; so great as to create in the mind of the sinner a prevailing consciousness of being reconciled to God , and a strong belief that God is reconciled to him . Nor is there anything inconsistent in this with the idea that God hates all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though displeased , he is not displeased so that he does not fully forgive . We now come to consider the Conditions of Forgiveness . Although there seem to be many conditions of obtaining forgiveness mentioned in the New Testament , as repentance , faith , forgiving spirit , confession , yet the author justly says , that the only real difficulty on this subject lies in the question , " Are we forgiven in consequence of faith , or in consequence of works ? " Adhering still to his peculiar theory of a forgiveness , consisting of two parts separable from each other , the author is led to conclude that so far as there is a present immediate forgiveness. consisting in a removal of a sense of the Divine displeasure , we are forgiven by faith . The moment the sinner believes in the forgiving love of God , that moment , the blessedness of reconciliation comes into his soul . But as to that part of forgiveness which consists in the removal of the depravation of the moral // constitution , we are forgiven or justified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is indeed true that the evil effects of sin are to be removed by the gradual work of man himself , directed and aided by the Holy Spirit of God . But this is not forgiveness , nor is it called forgiveness in the Scriptures . It is there called sanctification , and is so called by the Orthodox . Nor is there any more propriety in calling that gradually increasing blessedness of the Christian which is consequent on his sanctification , by the general name of forgiveness . A sense of God 's forgiving love in continually pardoning particular acts of sin , is indeed a chief part of this blessedness . But so far as this portion of it is concerned , it is dependent directly and continually on the exercise of faith in Cod 's forgiving love . What then do the Scriptures mean , when they represent works , for instance , the particular works of forgiveness of injuries and confession , as conditions of forgiveness ? Simply this , that good works are the natural fruits , and so the proper tests of a genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , it is because works are an inseparable result of a saving faith , which is , in its very nature , an energizing , operative faith . Thus the Orthodox view the matter . Mr. Clarke does the same . He sets forth with great beauty and power the living connection between faith and works , and the influence of forgiveness , as an animating motive to obedience . But , then , in order to carry out his theory of a two-fold forgiveness , Mr. Clarke finds it necessary to assign to good works a separate and peculiar part in the transaction . We are sorry that this Essay , fraught as it is with living truths , uttered with simplicity and power , is disfigured by this theory . The realities of the Christian system , so far as we have gone , he plainly holds , viz : a free forgiveness and its animating power , a gradual deliverance from the effects of sin by patient continuance in well-doing , the living connection between faith and works , rewards proportionate to works . Yet he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names , and in other cases in assigning to them wrong places . The next question which arises , is , What is that faith in Christ which is the Condition of Forgiveness ? We will not argue the point , although we do not in all respects agree with Mr. Clarke as to the nature of faith in general , as distinguished from knowledge , from belief , and from opinion . He regards it as an organ of the mind , framed for the discernment of spiritual things , as the eye for the intuition of colors . The difference between faith and speculative belief he illustrates in the following manner : // " One man believes that Jesus Christ is God ; another believes that he is the Son of God , and subordinate to the Father : but both trust in him as a Saviour , able to save to the utmost ; as a Teacher whose word is always truth ; as a Friend whose love is the most valuable treasure they possess . The belief of these two men is evidently very different . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jesus . The man who believes that he is subordinate to the Father , trusts entirely in him ; and the other can do no more . Again , they may differ as to the way in which Christ saves the souL One may believe that it is by paying a debt due to God , and bearing the penalty of human transgression . The other may believe that it is by manifesting the truth and love of God to the soul , and by creating a new life therein . But , while holdin these different beliefs as to the way of Salvation , they both are receiving daily peace and strength from communion with their spiritual Friend . B3th rely on him practically in the same way , and therefore must have the same faith . Meantime it is evident that two men m. y hold precisely the same belief , and accept intellectually the same creed ; and , while one of them has a strong faith , the other may have no faith at all . For do we not see every day , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creed , but who have not attained thereby , as yet , to any Christian faith ? " All reflecting Christians will admit that a saving faith may co*ixist with an erroneous . Yet all must hold that there can not be faith without the speculative belief of some revealed truth . We do not understand our author to claim that faith , in the sense in which he uses it , can be exercised towards Mahomet or the Virgin Mary . We suppose him also to mean , though we wish he had expressed himself on this point more definitely , " spiritual things " in the Scriptural , and not in the mystic o-philosophical sense , when he defines faith to be the " organ of spiritual things . " God , Christ , Heaven , are spiritual things . This being admitted , the Christ supposed in the illustration , must be the real , revealed Christ , Christ as he is offered in the Gospel , and not the Christ of human imagination ; otherwise the supposed faith is not faith . What amount of speculative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of Christ , may be so mixed with right apprehensions of him in any mind as to consist with his being received by that mind with saving faith , is a question not easily decided . It is true , as Mr. Clarke asserts , that in the sense in which he uses the words , there can be belief without faith . It is also a not less important truth , that there can not be faith without belief . And the more correct the belief , the stronger , other things being equal , will be the faith . But we pass on with our author to the question : What is Christian faith-that faith in Christ which is the condition of forgiveness ? Having said that in Nature and in Conscience , the soul that has sinned meets with no word of pardon from God , but finds only inexorable law , an assertion which is not quite true , we think , as respects Nature , but is certainly far enough from the weak sentimentalism of many Unitarians , Mr. Clarke proceeds : // " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness , is an act of reliance on the reconciling love of God , shown to us in Christ . It is essentially , therefore , an ACT , not a belief nor a feeling . So far , indeed , as it is a sight of God 's love , it has an intellectual character . So far , too , as it is a loving reliance on that love , it has an affectionate character . But it is in its essence a moral act , an act of choice and will ; and yet a receptive act ; the opening of the heart to God . It is choosin0 to lean on him , to repose on his goodness , to rest in the bosom of the Father , to wait on the Lord , and so renew strength . It is ceasing from our own works , that God may work in us and by us . It is " feeding the mind with a wise passiveness , " and becoming the channels through which the spirit of God may flow . When we can thus come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to him with a perfect childlike trust , we may lay down our sins before him , and receive a peace which passes understanding into our souL This peace is the result of no effort of ours : it is the pure gift of God . All that we have to do is to believe in it , wait for it , and receive it . Faith , then , becomes the organ by which the holy spirit enters the soul , and helps us to cry , Father . " Had Mr. Clarke added to his definition , so that it might read thus , an act of reliance on the reconciling love of God , shown to us in Christ , in harmony with his holiness and justice , it would seem to us a definition in which all believers might acquiesce , as containing in the most general form all the meaning which they attach to the term faith , as the condition of forgiveness . We think , judging from all he says , that Mr. Clarke would not object to such an amendment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of the Orthodox . That which has been just defined seems to us a saving faith in God as he is in Christ , because it is a faith which ignores neither his holiness nor his love . An exhibition of the Divine holiness and justice by itself is , as Mr. Clarke has said , too forbidding to the guilty sinner , to favor the hope of pardon . On the other hand , an expression of the Divine love alone rouses not the soul to a sense of sin , and the need of forgiveness . But when both as in Christ are heard in unison , each of the mingling chords adding intensity to the other , then indeed a note sounds forth , of Divine power and sweetness to the sinful soul . It is just this reconcilement of the Divine holiness and the Divine love , which the sinner needs to see plainly expressed . There must be , in his mind , no doubt respecting either the one or the other , nor respecting the entire consistency and harmony of the two . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In him God is exhibited as willing , nay , earnestly desiring , to take his sinning child by the hand , and to lead him away from all his transgressions , only he would give those transgressions such a look of abhorrence as he passes by them , and turns his back upon them forever , that his forgiven child shall never forget that his Father is still a holy Father . God would make sin appear more dreadful than ever , // by the very mode in which he expresses his forgiving love . God as he is in Christ would win back his sinful children to himself , that they may be partakers of his holiness . Mr. Clarke , if we may judge from the tenor of this and the following chapter , finds in Christ an exhibition of the Divine holiness , no less than of the Divine love . But he seems to us to regard it too much as the moral want of the human race , that there should be a revelation of the Divine character , in the form of forgiving love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sinner 's apprehending separately either God 's holiness , or his forgiving love . The great difficulty lay , in seeing that harmony , and believing in both at once . And , therefore , the great want of the race was , such a plain and imp ressive exhibition of them in their harmony , as was made in the person and work of Christ . To use a phrase of Mr. Clarke , who seems fond of the philosophical theory of dualisms and antagonisms , Christ was the " Synthesis of Law and Love . " We have purposely deferred the consideration of the work by which Christ especially meets this great want of man , because the author himself discusses it in the next chapter , the title of which is " Obstacles and Helps to Forgiveness . " The chief obstacle to forgiveness , according to Mr. Clarke , lies in the conscience of the sinner . The sinner thinks he has no right to be forgiven . Owing to the absence of a forgiving spirit in himself also , he can not believe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he finds it difficult to believe in pardon . It strikes us that this is but a loose and feeble account of the obstacles to forgiveness , if we look only at those which lie in the state of the sinner himself . " No right to be forgiven ! " What right to be forgiven can there be ? Forgiveness is founded on the absence of right in the forgiven party . Again , because we are unforgiving , we naturally believe that God also is disinclined to forgive . But how is it with one of great natural leniency of disposition ? Why can not he , judging of God by himself , as easily believe that God may forgive , as the vindictive man , that God must punish . And what in that case becomes of the author 's solution , as an universal one ? Mr. Clarke approaches nearer to the true account of the obstacle as it lies in the human mind , when he says that " one who is not a Christian , is obliged by the law of his own mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if God should forgive instead of punishing . " This is in fact the chief obstacle in the mind of man , unenlightened by revelation . How can God be holy and maintain a holy government , and // yet forgive the sinner , is the question spontaneously arising in the mind of every man when conscious of sin and guilt . And this question is satisfactorily answered-this obstacle is fully removed-only through the person and work of Christ . The difference , if there really be one , between us and Mr. Clarke , lies then just here . He finds the main obstacle in the mind of sinful man to be , the difficulty of believing in the forgiving love of God . The Orthodox find it to be the difficulty of believing in the reconcilement of God 's perfect righteousness with his forgiving love . Mr. Clarke believes that Christ , as expressing the forgiving love of God , removed the difficulty . We believe that Christ , by expressing the forgiving love of God , and his holiness , and the harmony between the two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lies in the convictions of the human mind , experience must be appealed to , to decide on what view it is , that the obstacle as a matter of fact is removed . And we fear not to leave it to the universal voice of man to decide , which view presents most fully both the obstacle and the mode of its removal . Mr. Clarke believes that Christ made known the forgiving love of God . The Orthodox believe that as cordially as be , nor do they come one step behind any Unitarian in their esteem of the condescension and tenderness of the forgiving love of God , as shown in Christ . But while the Orthodox believe this , they also believe more . They find more in Christ than forgiving love . They find revealed in him that other fact , which is most pertinent to the wants of man as a sinner . They find the forgiving love of God as shown in Christ with its fulness , freeness and tenderness , not only not in the least impaired , but , let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its being perfectly and sublimely harmonized with holiness and justice , thus satisfying at once both the conscience , the affections , and the intellect of man . The " subjective " difficulty , as the author styles it , being removed by the expression of the forgiving love of God in Christ , an inquiry arises as to the " objective " difficulty . Christ reconciles man to God . Does he also reconcile God to man ? To state the question in our own words : Did Christ in his person or by his work remove any obstacle to the forgiveness of the sinner , which did not lie in the sinner 's own mind ? Or thus , did Christ perform a work for the sinner , the chief design of which was not to influence the sinner to turn from sin , so that the work would bave been necessary to be done by him on the sinner 's behalf , even if the latter be supposed to // have no knowledge of what was done , or of the necessity of doing it ? The author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what we had almost despaired of seeing , we find the prevalent theory of the Orthodox of New England , fairly stated by a Unitarian : " The death of Christ was a manifestation of God 's displeasure against sin , and was necessary to enable God , as a moral governor , to forgive sin , without impairing the respect due to the moral law . " Viewing all theories on the subject as matters of belief and opinion , and not matters of faith , as things pertaining to theology and not to religion , and thinking that the most correct theory is yet to come , after each school shall have contributed its own solution , the author proceeds to offer his own explanation . He concludes that " If there be any objective difficulty in the way of human forgiveness , it must be from the essential hostility of the Holy character of God to all unholiness . And again , that , if Christ 's death removes this difficulty , it must be by communicating to the sinner his own perfect holiness-by removing from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him really , not le*ally , holy in the sight of God . " If this theory has any relation to the subject of forgiveness , it must , we think , be this , that having holiness positively imparted through the death of Christ , the believer is viewed as " really not legally " one with Christ , and the object of God 's complacency . Mr. Clarke protests against theories being held with such tenacity as they are . Yet judging from the earn estness and solemnity with which he propounds his own theory , we can hardly help thinking that he holds it quite as tenaciously , as the Orthodox hold theirs . But all this discourse upon theories is quite aside from the real question . The question about the Atonement between the Orthodox and their opponents is one not respecting a theory , but respecting a revealed fact . Did Christ by his sufferings and death remove any obstacle , that did not lie in the mind of the sinner ? The Orthodc ? x maintain that the Scriptures declare , as a fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly interpreted , teach no such fact . Both parties hold that believers are delivered from sin and condemnation , by means of what Christ has done and suffered . Unitarians claim that believers are delivered from condemnation by being delivered from sin ; and that they are delivered from sin by the moral influence of the person and work of Christ on them , and the spiritual life imparted from Christ to them . The Orthodox believe this , and they believe more . They // believe that the Scriptures must mean more than this , when they speak of Christ as dying " for our sins , " as procuring " the remission of sins that are past , " as " bearing our sins in his own body On the tree , " as reconciling us to God , by his death , " when we were enemies . " They conclude from these and similar passages , that the sufferings and death of Christ had an efficacy in procuring for mankind forgiveness , distinct from and exterior to their influence on the mind of the sinner himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which God presents himself to sinners , in the attitude of a placable Being . The Orthodox find this to be not only a fact but a leading fact of Revelation . We can not at this time go into an elaborate Biblical criticism . We are chiefly anxious , that it be clearly understood by all , that the question about the vicarious work of Chri*t , is not , as Mr. Clarke supposes , a question between opposing theories , nor between theory and no theory . It is a a simple question of fact and sound interpretation . With Mr. Clarke , we believe that the only spiritually profitable reception of this , as of other Scripture verities , is by faith in them as revealed facts , not belief of them as established or even as corroborated by human theories . And our care must be to give the chief place in our faith , to the lending facts of the Scriptures . Now that Christ did in fact die for our sins , for their remission , that he who knew no sin was made sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as present powers within us but as opera operata , for the remission of sins expressly called sins that are past , that by his death he completed a work of reconciliation for liian , even while man was yet viewed as an enemy , are the reiterated assertions of the Scriptures , which can not , we maintain , be construed by the theory of mere moral and spiritual influence , without an unnatural distortion . The vicarious death of Christ is a fact as plainly recorded , as often repeated , and reached by as unforced interpretation , as any other revealed fact . It is set forth in the greatest variety of forms , and the vast majority of Christians have concurred in receiving it as a revealed fact , without any effirt to explain it by the theory of a moral aud spiritual influence exerted on the mind . Yet it is also , be it observed , a fact which if believed in its simplicity is , and is declared in the Scriptures to be , fraught with the highest moral influence . The doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , has an efficacy attributed to it in the Scriptures , which is attributed to no other doctrine , inasmuch as the doctrine of the cross is declared to be to those who perish , " foolishness ; " but to those who are saved , " it is the power of God . " It is this revealed fact , which voL. xi . 6 // more than all other facts respecting Christ , not only , as Mr. Clarke would have it , sets forth God'a forgiving lov* , but exhibits the intensity and the concord of the Divine holiness and the Divine love , in such a manner as at once irresistibly to draw the sinful heart to God , and to give it security in its approaches to him . It furnishes the sinner with a clear and broad standing place prepared for him , anterior and exterior to his own repentance and faith , to which he may struggle forwards from the entanglements , and filth , and darkness of his own guilty soul , aud find security and strength . Thousands and tens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their souls with serenity and joy . They may not in their own consciousness have separated it from other revealed facts respecting Christ , nor from the influence of his person . It probably is unwise as a matter of religious self-culture thus to separate it . The Orthodox , we think , have erred in presenting the doctrine too abstractly and too theoretically . But we can not but view it as still more unwise and unsafe , to tear out this great central fact from the Christian scheme , for the purpose of rejecting it . We pass from this painful topic ; - painful because of the confessed difference between the two parties , on a point which one party not only believes but feels compelled to hold , as a matter of vital belief . We would simply express the wish that both these bodies of the professed believers in Christ , may be contented , ahandoning their speculative theories , to sit down together at the feet of Jesus and his Apostles , and hear their words . In presenting the Helps to Forgiveness , the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sinner and the Church perform , in the work of forgiveness . Christ , as we have seen , manifests the forgiving love of God . God spiritually reveals himself to the sinner , as he is in Christ , and bestows the gift of faith . The sinner feeling his dependence upon God , is at the same time to put forth efforts to believe . On the points of the co-working of God and the sinner in the matter of faith , and of the practical attitude which the sinner must take , as dependent yet striving , Mr. Clarke is orthodox . and even highly Calvinistic . The work of the Church is to show a living faith , strongly to sympathize with the sinner who is seeking an experience of God 's forgiving love , to pray with and for him , to instruct and guide him , and , as it were , to believe for him . We presume our readers will thank us for the following extracts upon the duty of the Church . The thoughts presented may well instruct and awaken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // " In the order of Providence , it depends upon him to whom God has given faith , whether others atound him shall have faith or be without it . If he is true to his faith , if his life is rooted in it , if his words are colored by it , if his tone and temper are constantly informed by this pure and subtle spirit , then he carries with him a sphere of influence by which to produce a like faith in all who are prepared to receive it . God to him is no name , but a reality ; Christ , not an historical Messiah , hut a present Saviour ; eternal life , no future , hut a present immortality . By the contagion of this faith , he awakens like convictions in other minds and to them also God in the Soul , Righteousness , Eternity , and Heaven come forth from the region of abstractions into that of realities . This is the true key to the kingdom of Heaven ; and , in the famous passage to which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests upon those who have this key of faith in their pos. ssion . So surely as they ne* , lect to use it , the door of heaven remains closed . And those who , by the sight of their faith , might have been quickened into a new life , remain , throub h their negligence , where they were before . This responsibility and privilege belongs not to Peter alone , nor to the Apostles alone , nor to bishops , priests , and preachers alone , hut to every man to whose heart , as to that of Peter , God has made a revelation of the reality of spiritual things . " * * * " The work of the Church in the Forgiveness of Sin is twofold . First , by preaching the Law to awaken the desire for goodness , the effort for obedience , and the sense of separation from God ; and , secondly , by preaching the Gospel , to produce the knowledge of forgiveness , and to communicate , through its own faith , that faith which ill bring pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , the Church feel itself to be the appointed and natural agency by which pardon is to be obtained . When the seeker is unable to have faith for himselt ; the Church should have faith for him . When he is discouraged , the Church should have courage for him . When ha would despair , the Church should hope for him . When he can not pray for himself , the Church shbuld pray for him . For if the Church has faith in forgiveness and in the power of prayer , it should exercise that faith on behalf of those who are unable to exercise it for themselves . And , in point of fact , this is what all sincere and practical Christians actually endeavor to do . In all churches there are those who , by their words and their prayersendeavor to bring faith to those who need it ; and they thus become in reality the means by which it is obtained . But what is wanted is , that the whole Christian Church should understand that these efforts are its legitimate work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege to which its Master has called it . And also that it should do its work , not occasionally as a doubtful experiment , but in the conviction that it has been made the certain and appointed channel through which faith and forgiveness shall come . When the Christia* Church has learned its duties and privileges , it will be able to show to each seeking soul the way of Salvation , and enable him to enter it . It will be able to remove all doubt and all uncertainty as to what each one must do to be saved . As the types and shadows of the Jewish ritual were fulfilled by the realities of the Gospel , so will the Roman Catholic sacrament of confession and absolution be fulfilled by the Church , which has become the medium of communicating , not an external and formal Remission of Sins , but an inward and real Sense of Pardon , For this sacrament , which has come down from the middle ages , will stand as a symbol till it is replaced by the reality ,  --  wihl remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the promise . Men go to the Catholic Church because it seems to offer them a surer outward aid and help . But this help is formal , technical , not living and human . Somethiog greater and better is needed ; and something better , as God lives , shall yet come . " The concluding chapter upon the Results of Forgiveness , is one of exceeding beauty of thought and of style . Objections might justly be made to portions of it . But we have rather felt disarmed of criticism , and disposed to present portions , of which it would be indeed faint praise to say that they are Unobjectionable . // The chief result of Forgiveness is a new spiritual life . " And by this we mean , not merely a new course of action and conduct , but the formation of a new vital principle . As tfie temporal life of man or animal consists , not merely in outward actions , but also in an invisible principle , by which those actions are prompted ; so the spiritual life consists , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of a new principle , out of which these actions naturally flow . Therefore Christianity , as to its inward principle in the soul , is constantly described in the New Testament as a life . This eternal life is not merely immortality in the future world , for it is spoken of as a gift specially bestowed upon Christians as the consequence of their faith , ( John iii , 15 , vi , 47 ; ) nor is it the future happiness of the good hereafter alone , for it is spoken of as something abiding in the soul here , ( John vi , 54 , 47 , v , 24 . ) The analogy of the spiritual life to temporal life appe " rs in many particulars . As temporal life begins with our birth , so the spiritual life begins with the new birth . As the temporal life is supported by food , so the spiritual life has its food also , which is the body and blood of Christ ; in other words , his whole human history , his active and passive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear ; which must he not merely looked at , thought about , and remembered , but , like the food which we take into the body , become a part of . ourselves . As our earthly existence is divided into rest and labor , repose and action , night and day ; so the spiritual life consists of alternations of faith and works , trust and obedience , prayer and labor , quiet waiting and active obedience . In our temporal life we are surrounded by Natur* by sky and earth ; mountain , forest , and ocean ; drifting clouds , fallin rains , the vegetable and animal worlds ; and the speaking face of man and woman . In our spiritual life we are surrounded by a Spiritual World of holy truths , gentle affections , farreaching hopes , noble aims , and sympathies wide as the world . As the vital principle of plant or bird shows itself especially in the fact of growth , so one characteristic of the spiritual life is development and progress . The largest definition , per . haps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEvElOPMENT . " * * * * " This new Life in the Soul is , in its essence , LovE ; and , by means of its organ Faith , renews itself continually from on High . But this Life in* the Soul has a twofold character , and acts in a twofold direction . It alternates between labor and rest , effort and repose , activity and receptivity , obedience to the law and trust in the gospel . C'hristian Goodness , therefore , differs from the Goodness of Nature in being principle , and from the Goodness of Morality in being spontaneous ; and is the purest union and harmony of both kinds . For Goodness in general is of these two kinds , consisting of Intention on the one side , and Character on the other . The* Goodness of Morality or Intention consists in effort , struggle , and conflict ; and is esteemed great in proportion to the temptation resisted , the trial borne , the obsta. ale encountered , the difficulty overcome . The Goodness of Nature or Character is not conflict , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in natural good tendencies and pure tastes , or in acquired habits of goodness . The Goodness of Intention is meritorious ; the Goodness of Attainment is beautiful . We respect the first ; we love the second . The absence of one implies guilt ; the absence of the other implies depravity . He who does not try to do right and to become good is guilty . He who has no love for goodness , no true , kind , and noble tendencies , is depraved . The seat of the one is the conscience or will ; the seat of the other is the instinct or natural tendencies . " * * * * " The essential peculiarity of the Christian Life is , that it is the complete harmony , THE ABSOLUTE SYNTHESIS OF BOTH KINDS OF GooDNEss . It distinguishes them , in order that it may unite them . It is able to unite them , because it has first distinguished them . Christian faith , revealing the high Law of God , awakens the conscience , and rouses the will to effort to overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , creates new affections , and attracts the soul upward , ascending by its proper motion . The love of God moves us to effort ; the effort enables us more entirely to rely upon and realize His love . Faith and // Works ; Love and Labor ; Prayer and Action ; the Reception of the Holy Spirit , and the Endeavor to impart it ,  --  these follow each other like Day and Night ; repose preparing us for labor , and labor for repose . In the Lord 's prayer , the clause , THY WILL BE DONE , ' has in all ages received a double interpretation ; as being either a prayer for all men , that they may obey God ; or as being an act of personal submission . Probably it includes both meanings ; and so the Christian , in every moment of his Christian life , may unite the sense of responsibility and the sense of dependence , obedience , and love . His aim is , by his every act and his total influence , to advance the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every act , and in his total influence , the organ by which Christ shall act , the channel through which Christ 's influence shall flow . " From a sketch of the history of the Doctrine of Forgiveness , with which the chapter closes , we give the following concluding extract . " The doctrine of justification by faith , proclaimed by Luther , was the vital principle of the reformation of the Sixteenth Century , and again became a new impulse of life to the human race . Its negative work , its work of denial , conflict , and overthrow , is easily seen and measured ; but the positive result of Luther 's Reformation was faith in the unbought love of God to the human soul ; and there is no modern reform , nothin which diffuses comfort , intelligence , power , among the millions , hut may be traced to this great spiritual movement of the Sixteenth Century . But now , standing in the midst of the Nineteenth Century , we may ask , Is NOT A NEW REVIVAL OF THIS GREAT DOCTRIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have not the works of the reformation once more eclipsed its interior principle ? One party supposes that the essential principle of the reformation consists in the creeds and opinions held by the Reformers ; and another party supposes that it consists in their assertion of the Sufficiency of the Scriptures , and the Right of Private Judgment . Consequently we have a new idolatry of forms ; and we worship , in our day , Creeds , the Letter of the Bible , and self-formed Opinions . And so again we cut ourselves off from the current of that inspiring Life which creates creeds , scriptures , and opinions , but is never created by them . Once more we need to go behind all these works of our own hands and alinds , back to God 's free love , which can again make all things new . As , when the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost , a rushing and mighty wind filled all the house where they were sitting ; so the houses of doctrine and form must be filled by a new inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Heavens ; not the world only , but the Church . The new Revival of the doctrine of Grace will by no means express itself in the old language ; for each age has a new form of application for the same truth . The language of Luther differed from that of Augustine . The language of Augustine differed from that of Paul . The human race repeats evermore the same experiences , and passes through the same errors ; yet the truth each time is attained in a larger and higher form . The human race does not revolve in a circle , but ascends in a spiral ; passing , indeed , again and again through the same errors to the same truths , but passing through them each time on a higher plane . Thus , though no man can predict what form the doctrines of Grace will take in that new manifestation for which our century is waiting , we may be sure that such a manifestation must come . And among its negative results we may expect to see the destruction of Sectarian ramparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a merely polemic Theology , and a merely ecclesiastic Ritual ; while among its positive results we may expect the foundation of a new Church collected out of all sects under heaven ; a Church not of the Priesthood nor the Clergy , but of the PEOPLE , whose ritual shall consist of action as well as of prayer , of humanity as well as piety ; and the central points of whose creed shall be , that GOD IS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER , AND THAT ALL MANKIND ARE BRETHREN .
