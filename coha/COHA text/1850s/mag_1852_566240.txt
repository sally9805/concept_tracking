txt ART . YIJ. - JOIIN PITKJN NORTON . SINcE the publication of our last Number , Yale College has been called to suffer a severe loss in the death of Prof. Kingsley and of Prof. Norton . Our readers will expect from us , we presume , some account of these gentlemen , the one of whom was so well known from his labors of fifty years in the cause of sound learning , and the other from the promising commencernent of labors , which bid fair to be long protracted and extensively useful . The death of John Pitkin Norton is one of those events of Divine Providence , which are designed as " trials of faith , " and tests of the infinite value of eternal hopes . In the case of those who are removed from life , not until they have completed their appropriate work , we mourn , but not because we see plans unfinished , aims frustrated , and the unity of life marred and broken . We miss the friendly greeting , the trust of welltried affection , the communication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sundered , and we are saddened at the natural suspension-only a suspension , we may hope-of the offices of love and friendship . But when those are taken away who have made faithful preparation for the responsibilities of manhood , and have just commenced the serious business of life , with the fairest prospects of success , we mourn besides for plans broken off , labors unfinished , hopes disappointed , affections crushed in the bloom , and , in this reversal of the ordinary course of nature , we can only bow with reverence before the mystery of Divine Providence . // We attempt a memorial of our friend , not alone from personal considerations , but on account of his pure moral and Christian character , and also of the service , which , in his short course , he rendered to his country , in the earliest establishment , in our land , of a Collegiate School of Agricultural Chemistry . John Pitkin Norton was born at Albany , N. Y. , July 19 , 1822 . In 1835 , the family returned to its ancient seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early education in the well-known school of Simeon Hart . From an early period , young Norton was a student of nature . For his was one of those minds , which have in their original structure , a decisive impulse towards a definite course of action-an inclination towards a particular form of development . This aptitude , however , was not for the mere enjoyment of nature , a poetic impulse simply ; it was rather a philosophical turn of mind , which led him to the observation of the material world , and of the phenomena of animal and vegetable life . He studied as well as enjoyed-he reflected as well as saw . This disposition is sometimes misunderstood . An intense , but quiet interest , such as youth of a particular bent of genius possess , often produces an indifference to studies out of a certain range . There is activity of mind enough , and power enough , but it is not manifested in the usual way . It has been said of several men of great genius , that they were dull in youth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactive where others are active ; the stream flows , only not in the usual channels , and all the deeper for flowing by itself . That boy is not inactive , a mere idler , who lies upon the ground by the hour , watching the spider spin its web , or the insect wing its flight , or even the worm trail its way on the slime . He is not an idler who follows the bee in its industrious toils , and the birds in their busy pleasures , to learn their ways of life . He is not an idler , who gathers the pebbles and the crystal stones , not as playthings to be admired , but as objects to be arranged , and somehow put into classes . Mr. Norton belonged to this order of minds . He had an original genius for natural science ; he took an absorbing pleasure in the observation of natural objects . We were much interested in an account of his first scientific study , which we received from Theodore Dwight , Esq. , of New York , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent from home to school . Mr. Dwight says : " In my first interview with John , I found he had a decided aversion to every branch of study , especially Latin and Greek . I sought for some pursuit in which he might feel some interest , but went through the whole range of sciences and // literature without success , when at last I mentioned mineralogy . There I found him alive , and willing to answer questions , and I soon learned that he , for two years or more , had appropriated his money to the purchase of minerals , and had a large collection . I inquired anxiously how he had arranged them ; and he replied that he had made three attempts to arrange them , according to their colors and names , and had found that they could not be classified by anybody . I assured him of the contrary , and told him that the proper principle was that of their composition . He immediately inquired how any person could know what stones are made of . I explained , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he should begin the next day to decompose minerals , and ( what pleased him more , although he did not half believe it possible ) compound and form some himself . " Henceforth , there is no want of interest in his studies ; and from the hour of this conversation , he became one of the most hard-working scholars of his time . A certain modesty of disposition , and a diffidence of himself , which was increased by his inaptitude to the ordinary studies of the schools , had hitherto hindered the free , natural development of his powers ; and he did not get upon the right track , till the sagacity of Mr. Dwight pointed it out , and set him forth upon it . It had been determined he should be a farmer . It was his own choice , and his father had readily acquiesced in it , although very wisely making it a condition of his assent , that he should be educated for that business . It may seem strange that we give prominence to this circumstance . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad scale , was a thing almost unknown at that time in this country , and if it is more common now , it is in great part owing to this very example . This education was to be no superficial one ; it was to be both practical and theoretical . The summers were to be spent in work , and the winters in study . We will draw out the course of his education a little in detail , as we think it a very good one , and it may suggest valuable hints to others . The farming season of 1838 was spent with E. C. Delavan , at Ballston Centre , N. Y. , who had an extensive farm , worked by intelligent Scotch laborers , with whom he was employed almost constantly . The fall and winter of 1838-9 was passed in Albany , studying French , mathematics , music and drawing . The working season of 1839 was spent on his father 's farm in Farmington , and the following winter in Brooklyn , N.Y. , under the direction of Mr. Dwight , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1840 ) was spent in Farmington , in work // on the farm , and the following winter ( 1840-41 ) in New Haven , attending lectures upon Chemistry , Mineralogy , and Natural Philosophy . We must not omit to mention also , that he attended the lectures of Dr. Taylor , on Theology , for , though it is a part of an Agricultural education which might be omitted , it seems like going back to a better age , to behold the science of Theology brought within the range of the studies of a well educated man . Mr. Norton made this year his first public effort . He delivered a well written and interesting lecture before a Lyceum , in the place of his residence , upon the subject of birds , and defended their cause so well , as to secure the passage of a law , at the next town-meeting , for their protection . The summer of 1841 was spent as usual on the farm , and the winter ( 1841-2 ) at New Haven , in the laboratory of the Professors Silliman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the following winter ( 1842-3 ) in Boston , where he attended courses of lectures on Chemistry and Anatomy , and also the lectures of I ) oct . Harris , on Entomology , and of Prof. Greenleaf , on Law . The summer of 1843 was spent in Farmington , and this season he took the entire charge of a portion of his father 's farm , trying the experiment of farming on his own account . The winter of 1843-4 was spent in New Haven , again in the Yale College laboratory , under the instruction of the same distinguished teachers . The extensive course of study which Mr. Norton had been pursuing for the past six years , had opened before him a new and wide field of usefulness . He felt the necessity of a more specific course of Agricultural education than could be obtained in this country , and he determined to prepare himself to become an instructor in Agricultural Chemistry . This was done with no ambitious views of attaining to any higher distinction , but solely with the purpose of making himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had identified with his own . Agriculture was the first pursuit that strongly awakened his feelings , and the promotion of its interests was the ruling purpose of his life . Rarely have the powers of any individual been more exclusively devoted to one great end , than were those of Mr. Norton to Agriculture . Having determined to prepare himself to give instruction in Agriculture , he resolved to make that preparation as complete as possible . All his plans in this respect were fully approved by his father , who from the first had taken the most enlarged views on this subject . After due inquiries , he decided to go to Edinburgh , and an arrangement was made by Prof. Silliman with Prof. Johnston , the distinguished professor of Chemistry , // in the laboratory of the Agricultural Chemical Association in Edinburgh , to receive him as a pupil . He left this country in the spring of 1844 , and remained in Edinburgh till the spring of 1846 . Mr. Norton was well prepared to take advantage of the valuable instructions now within his reach . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period sufficiently long to have carried him through a collegiate and almost a professional course of study ; for the interruption by the labors of the summer , would not amount to much more than the usual vacations in College and Professional schools . He was quite well acquainted with the French language , and could read German with ease . He had enjoyed the best instruction in chemistry which the country afforded , and was , indeed , already a good practical chemist . He felt too that he was now entering upon an extensive field of usefulness-that he was laboring in the service of his country and that on his return , he would possess a power for good within his sphere which would perhaps belong to no other one of his countrymen . He entered upon his studies , therefore , with the greatest enthusiasm . He spent all the working hours of the day-light-from nine o'clock in the morning till six in the afternoon-without interruption , in the laboratory , while the evening till mid night uniformly , and often later , was devoted to reading in French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , in addition to the Journal which he kept for many years , and the long family letter which was weekly forwarded to his home .  --  and we hesitate not to say that this correspondence and Journal , if they were to be published , would make as interesting and instructive a volume of " Foreign Residence , " as any one that has been published by our countrymen. - Such was the ardor with which he prosecuted his Chemical researches , and so closely did he confine himself to his single pursuit , that even the romantic scenery around Edinburgh and the neighboring places , famous in song and story , could not draw him from the laboratory . It was not till the arrival of a friend from America , that he visited the objects of interest in Edinburgh and its environs . Nor did this devotion to his studies arise solely or mainly from the ambition of distinction . It sprang from a higher principle , a principle of duty , which ever controlled him . " it seems to me a duty , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one object in view-diligently to improve the extraordinary advantages of my situation . This can only be done by withdrawing my attention from other objects and devoting every faculty to this alone . I feel sure that I am fast // laying up a store of knowledge . that under the providence of God , will make me to be of much use in my own country . The field opens wider and wider as I advance , and I often feel discouraged at the mountain of labors which rises before me . These were not idle words . They meant all that they express . We have never known the man whose conduct was more governed by a sense of duty . These unremitted labors were not without their results . Mr. Norton soon attained to great accuracy in his experiments , and his analyses could be entirely relied on as faithfully made . He shunned no toil , he concealed no mistakes . If any analysis did not come out as it should have done , he knew not the art of conjecturing what the figures should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress was such , that Professor Johnston advised him to prepare papers for the British Association , which he did . Two papers of his were read at the meeting of that body in Cambridge , and were well received . By the advice of the same judicious instructor and friend , he entered into a very minute analysis of the Oat . These investigations cost him the labor of almost eighteen months , and when they were completed , the memoir was presented to the Highland Agricultural Society , and received the prize of fifty sovereigns , which it had offered for the best essay on the subject . We can not give to the uninitiated anything like an adequate conception of the labor expended upon these researches . We may say in general , using the language of the Journal of Science , in which the memoir was re-published , that " commencing with the young plant , he followed it throucrh its successive stages of growth and development to its maturity . The results are presented in thirty-nine tables , containing hundreds of accurate and minute analyses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plant , separately , viz : the leaf above and below , the stalk , the knots , the grain , &amp;c. , besides the organic constitution of the grain . " This is by far the most thorough examination of the oat which has ever been made  --  and his labors possess the advantage that subsequent inquirers may implicitly rely upon them , and begin where Mr. Norton left off . But beside the scientific labors of the laboratory , Mr. Norton made many Agricultural excursions in company with Prof. Johnston , into different parts of Scotland and England , in which they examined the best cultivated farms in the kingdom . Mr. Norton 's personal experience in farming , enabled him to turn these visits to the greatest advantage . He also attended Agricultural festivals , and was called up for speeches at the // festive board . Full accounts of these expeditions were published in the Albany Cultivator , of which he was a regular correspondent during his residence abroad . His opportunities in this respect were unsurpassed , and the practical knowledge which he thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great judgment to the different circumstances of Agriculture in this land . For the great advantage accruing to him from these expeditions , he was indebted to Prof. Johnston , by whose means he was introduced into the society of Agriculturalists , which would not usually be accessible to young students from abroad . Indeed , we can not leave this part of our subject , without expressing the gratitude which the friends of Mr. Norton feel , and which we know he always felt , to Prof. Johnston , for the fidelity with which he directed and watched over his studies , for the kindness which he manifested towards him in the social relations of life , and for the interest which he took in his reputation and success as a man of science . While in Scotland , Mr. Norton worshiped in the Free Church , and rejoiced in the enthusiasm and martyr-like spirit , which accomplished that wonderful movement . He heard most of the distinguished preachers of that church . Sunday was ever to him a day of enjoyment , and though a stranger to his fellow-worshipers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice with the congregation in their praises of God . Mr. Norton returned with a very high estimation of the Scotch people . In one respect , however , he found himself not a little at variance with them . He had grown up in the most unqualified observance of the strictest temperance pledge , and it is not known that he ever , except as a child , tasted any alcoholic liquors . He also had been trained to the early New England strictness , in keeping holy the Sabbath day . In his various excursions and visits , his principles on each of these points were severely tried , but in no single instance did he in the least degree deviate from them . Nor was this with him a matter of singularity or a proud defiance of public sentiment . It cost him , on the contrary , as appears from frequent reference to it in his letters , a very great sacrifice of feeling . But it was a question of duty , and he firmly did what he thought to be right . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the satisfaction of knowing that his example had a beneficial influence in two or three particular cases . But , universally , Mr. Norton was a strictly conscientious man , and the severity of his daily studies was never permitted to interfere with his religious duties . Mr. Norton returned to this country in the spring of 1846 , // having first made a flying visit to the Continent with reference to pursuing his studies in some one of the celebrated laboratories there . On Mr. Norton 's return to this country , it was thought important to secure the services of so able and valuable a man to Yale College . Professor Silliman , Sen. , with his usual promptness in the cause of science , took the matter in hand , and appearing before the Corporation , at their annual meeting , at commencement , in 1846 , presented the importance of having such a professorship in some way connected with the College . This proposal was made at a most fortunate time . It had long been the wish of the College officers to have a department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , philology , pure mathematics , and the like , might be prosecuted by graduates under systematic instruction , and in which also , not only graduates , but others not graduates , who should be properly qualified , might be trained to fulfill in a manner creditable to the country , the office oti the civil engineer , of the scientific miner and geologist , of the scientific Agriculturalist , and the like ; - thus furnishing society with a body of highly educated men , in its various departments , and introducing in fact , new liberal professions among the learned professions . This movement in behalf of the physical department , fell in with this long cherished desire ; the matter was discussed on general principles ; and from this discussion arose what has since been called , The Philosophical Department of Yale College . As we regard this movement one of great importance to the College , and to the country , and as Mr. Norton was the founder and architect of one of the most important branches in this department , we have thought it best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . The first document is the resolution of the Corporation , establishing two new professorships , passed August 19 , 1846 : WHEREAS , It has been represented to this Corporation , that a benefactor of the College proposes to give five thousand dollars for the endowment of a professorship of Agricultural Chemistry , and of Vegetable and Animal Physiology , provided that twenty thousand dollars be raised for that purpose , L- . Resolved , That there be established in this College a Professorship of Agricultural Chemistry and of Vegetable and Animal Physiology , for the purpose of giving instruction to graduates and others not members of the undergraduate classes : and that the Corporation will now proceed to elect a professor of those branches of science , that while efforts to complete the endowment are in progress , he may devote himself to studies preparatory to his entering on the duties of that office-it being understood and provided that the support of this professor is in no case to be chargeable to the existing funds or resources of the college . Resolved , That there be also established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving instruction to others than members of the undergraduate // classes , in respect to the applications of Chemistry , and the kindred sciences to the manufacturing arts , to the exploration of the resources of the country , and to other practical uses ; and that a professor be now appointed to that office , whose compensation , till other provision can be made , shall be derived exclusively from fees for instruction , and for other services . Resolved , That President Day and Professors Silliman , Kingsley , Olmated , Woolsey , and Salisbury , be a Committee to report at the next annual meeting of the Corporation , or at any intervening meeting which may be convenient , their opinion of the expediency of arranging under a distinct department of the University , those courses of instruction which are , or may be given to others than members of the undergraduate classes , and which are not included in the departments of Theology , Law , and Medicine , and that if in their opinion such a department is expedient , they report such arrangements and regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . These two professorships were filled by the appointment of Mr. Norton to the former , and of Mr. Benjamin Silliman , Jr. , to the latter . Instruction in these professorships was postponed till the year following . We may remark , that Mr. Norton , did not accept a professorship in " Vegetable and Animal Physiology , " although his name appears as Professor of those branches , in the College Catalogue of that year . We give next the report of the committee , whose appoint* ment is recorded in the preceding resolution . It was present ed to the Corporation , August 19th , 1847 , and accepted : " The committee appointed by the Corporation of Yale College , to consider whether it is expedient to form a fourth department in this college , for the instruction of other than undergraduate students , beg leave to reportThat in their judgment it is expedient to form such a department , and that for several reasons . Some of these reasons are : 1 . That there is a demand on the part of our graduates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted , or can be given in the college course . 2 . We have several endowed scholarships for graduates , and are likely to have more ; and the advantages arising from these endowments , will be greatly increased by having instructions provided for the scholars upon them , and not leaving them to themselves . 3 . From time to time new branches of study are called for by the public ; which if introduced into our undergraduate course , would greatly crowd it and interfere with its object as a course of training for the mind . 4 . It is believed that students resident here for the purpose of pursuing a specific branch will be industrious , and will have a good effect in promoting the spirit of study among the undergraduates. 5 . We have at present the materials of such a department here on the ground . It is believed by your committee , that some system introduced into them , will greatly add to their usefulness . Your committee being also charged with the duty of reporting regulatioas for the organization of said department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg leave to report the following : 1 . There shall be a fourth department of instruction for other than undergraduate students , who are not in the departments of Theology , Medicine , and Law , to be called the Department of Philosophy and the Arts . ' The department is intended to embrace Philosophy , Literature , History , the moral sciences other than Law and Theology , the natural sciences excepting Medicine , and their application to the Arts . VOL . X. // 2 . Instruction in this department may be given by professors not belonging to the others , by professors in the Academical departments , and by such others as the President and Fellows may approve . But no second course of lectures on the same branch may be given , without the consent of the previous lecturer . 3 . All graduates of this or other colleges , and all other young men of fair moral character , may be allowed to pursue such studies included in this department as they may desire . But dismissed students of this or other colleges , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall not enjoy the privileges of this department . 4 . The instructors in this department may make such arrangements as it respects remuneration for their instructions , as they may think proper . 5 . The faculty of the department shall consist of the president , and such professors as are actually engaged in the instruction of the department ; and regulations passed by the faculty , and approved by the Corporation , may be the regulations of the department . " It will be noted that there was no provision made for conferring degrees in this department , as is done in the departments of Law and Medicine . This was postpone ( l for farther consideration . We will here anticipate the course of events , and present the doings of the Corporation in establishing the Degree of Bachelor of Philosophy , in this department . Through the influence and exertions of Profe*sor Norton , a petition was presented to the Corporation for the establishment of such a degree , at their meeting in July , 1851 . A committee , consisting of President Woolsey , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confer upon this subject , and to report at the next annual meeting . The following is the report : The committee appointed last year to prepare rules for giving degrees in this department , if they should deem the giving of such degrees expedient , report the following rules : 1 . Students in this department of the age of 21 years , who have resided at the college two years , and have pursued their studies for nine months in each year , may receive on examination the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy . 2 . The examination shall embrace , at least , three branches of study , and a certificate of the examiners must be produced to the effect , that the examination in each branch has been satisfactory . 3 . This examination in the case of students in the physical sciences , shall embrace two departments of physical or mathematical science , and either the French or German language . The fee for graduation shall be the same as for Bachelors of Arts , or Bachelors of Laws . Whereupon , voted to adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department shall be given . In the consideration of this subject , the committee had the advantage , it is proper to remark , of the experience of Harvard and Brown , where degrees of this kind had already been established . The degrees were conferred at Yale , for the first time , at the commencement , in July , of the present year . We would call the attention of our readers to two or three points in the establishment of this new department in the college . // In the first place , it was put upon the same basis as the professional schools of Theology , Law , and Medicine , and is to be regarded as a fourth professional school . It was intentionally separated from the college proper , or the Academical course of instruction . The principle , laid down in the Reports to the Corporation , written by President Day and Professor Kingsley , on the subject of the study of the classics , that a collegiate education is merely a preparation for a professional education , a general course of study fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life may require , and that the two should not be intermingled , was strictly observed . Pains were taken not to introduce any partial or half-way system of education into the four years ' collegiate course . It was hoped , on the one hand , that there would be some , as there have been , who would become professional scholars in the departments of philology , philosophy , mathematics and the like ; and , on the other , that there would be a large number of graduates , who would prepare themselves , by a strictly professional course of instruction , for those pursuit* of life , other than Theology , Law , and Medicine , which require a peculiar education . This has been the case to some extent , and the tendency in that direction is increasing . It is beginning to be felt that college education , in the discipline of the powers and the balancing of the faculties of the mind which it gives , not only does not disqualify , but lays , in general , the best foundation , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightened merchant , and of men in the various departments of active life , which manufactures , railroads , mining , and the like , open to the e*ducated . In the second place , the establishment of this new department recognized the fact , that there are very many in the community , who for various reasons , can not go through with the preparatory studies in a coll*giate course , and was intended to give such the best opportunities possible for their professional education . The age ( twenty-one ) which the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy requires , shows that it was regarded by the Corporation as a testimonial of a completed preparation for the active duties of life-as is the case with the degrees in Law and Medicine . Finally , in the institution of this new department , the Corporation of the College proceeded with cautious steps , and with a wise foresight of the necessities of education in our land . Schools of physical science might be dissociated from the University , as is sometimes done . We think , however , that in connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of civil engineering , with the general department of philosophy , and making the whole one of the Professional Schools connected with the College , the Corporation have acted with the wisdom which has uniformly characterized their proceedings . It places the interests of the higher education of our land in the hands of those who will give to it an elevated and liberal character . In all these views of the Corporation , Prof. Norton fully acquiesced . Indeed , his own education , ( of which the Corporation had expressed their estimate , by conferring upon him the honorary degree of Master of Arts , ) had been of too liberal a kind-in point of time equal to the full Academical and Professional course , and in point of acquisition and discipline not inferior to that of our first scholars  --  to permit him to wish for a low standard . It was entirely accordant with his wishes , that the requisitions for the degree in this department were made high . Mr. Norton returned to Europe in the fall of 1846 , and entered the laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid and satisfactory . He went forward in his analyses with somewhat of the confidence of a master , and he frequently speaks in his letters , with enthusiasm , of his " beautiful results . " He pursued his researches here with the same laborious diligence as at Edinburgh , often being in the laboratory twelve or fourteen hours a day , and reserving the hours of the night , till after midnight , for the study of German and Dutch , for writing for the Cultivator , and for his extensive correspondence with his family and friends . He was again very fortunate in his teacher . Mulder took a great interest in his success , and devised and forwarded useful plans of study for him . During his residence there , he made an Agricultural excursion through North Holland , to become acquainted with the practice of farming in that region . He returned in July , 1847 , having been with Mulder nine months . Mr. Norton had now completed his education , and was prepared to enter upon the serious business of life . He com* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was married to Miss Elizabeth P. Marvin , of Albany , N. Y. , in December of the same year , and having the means of living in a liberal and elegant manner , soon became a householder , and took his part in all the duties of social life . Universally esteemed in society , beloved by all who knew him , and uncommonly happy in his own home , he began life with the fairest prospects . The Philosophical department , as we have already remarked , embraces several branches of study . Most of these had for // some years previous , been more or less pursued by a few of the graduates of the college , and by others . Some had studied philology , philosophy , and mathematics ; there had been several scholars in the laboratory . The only effect of the establishment of the new department as to these , was , to give more system to the instruction . There were no new professorships in them . The professorship of Practical Chemistry was a new one , and would have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been early called away to a wider field , in the Medical College , at Louisville , Ky . We shall , therefore , limit our subsequent remarks to the single professorship of Agricultural Chemistry . Indeed , the Philosophical department , so far as it was new , rested entirely upon that professorship . We are to speak now of the work which he accomplished , in the few years of manhood  --  a little less than five years ,  - -  which were allotted to him . The department of Agricultural Chemistry was to be created . lt was new in the country . It was doubtful whether the public sentiment was strong enough to support it . The external resources for such an undertaking were sufficiently humble . The professorship was without a salary , and no better laboratory could be furnished than the wooden house on the College grounds , formerly occupied by President Dwight , and afterwards by President Day . But Professor Norton was well fitted for the work he had undertaken . His acquaintance with the operations of the farm , gained by personal experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple and gentlemanly bearing , won the regard of the farming community ; and he took unwearied pains , through addresses , lectures , more formal treatises , and numerous publications in Agricultural Journals , to disseminate elevated views of the necessity of scientific knowledge to the farmer . His influence was extensively felt , and was becoming stronger every year . Within the school , the more immediate sphere of his labors , his influence was equally great . He was a most admirable instructor . His hopeful , joyous , sympathetic disposition , his great equanimity , his pleasant , familiar manner , his quiet humor , rendered his presence in the laboratory always agreeable to the scholars , while his interest in their studies and welfare awakened a strong personal attachment . Although discouraged at his first attempts , he was fast becoming one of our best lecturers . He had firm possession of the knowledge he had acquired , and was thus able to give precise and definite information . His natural opposition to vain show kept him from the folly of professedly fine speaking and rhetorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , led him to // communicate all the knowledge possible in the hour , and by perspicuity of style and skill of arrangement to make it the most available to the student . We have the testimony of the best scholars that they attended no lectures where they got more information . The number of scholars the first year was small , but it each year increased , till at last the experiment of the school was decided , a new department of professional study in the University was created , and a liberal and scientific pursuit opened to the young men of our country . And it is due to his memory to say , that during these five years of incessant toil , he received no salary whatever , and that the remuneration from tuition , after paying necessary expenses , would not amount to the wages of a day laborer . At the same time he had been offered a foundation of twenty thousand dollars , in one of the large Colleges of the country , with a salary of three thousand dollars , if he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and from time to time other lucrative places were pressed upon him . He however regarded the interests of Agriculture as paramount to all others , and was not to be diverted from his devotion to them . He had chosen Yale College as the best place for the establishment of such a school as he was desirous of found in* he had there principally received his education , and he was deeply interested in its welfare . Indeed , when we consider how much he gave up in rejecting the large salaries which were offered elsewhere , and how much he expended from his own resources in the five years of his unpaid labors in the institution , amounting of course to many thousand dollars ; and his generous bequest , made within a few hours of his death , of all the apparatus of the laboratory , together with the books and other articles , ( valued at more than $2000 ; ) we place him prominently among those benefactors who , besides their services , their scientific and literary reputation , and their lives , have given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laboratory was only a small part of his labors. his publications were numerous , and of permanent value . He was a frequent writer for Agricultural Journals . He had been a more or less frequent writer for the Albany Cultivator from 1844 , but in 1850 , he commenced a new series of letters , which , the editor says , constitutes " one of the chief attractions of the Cultivator . " He also delivered numerous addresses before Agricultural Societies , in different parts of the country . Eight or nine of these have been published . His last public effort was the " Introductory to the Course of Lectures , " at the opening of the University of // Albany , N. Y. , in 1851 . All these are written with perspicuity , and contain much valuable information . But his most important work is , his Elements of Scientific Agriculture . This essay was written for the prize offered by the New York State Agricultural Society , and was successful . it is a most admirable treatise . We said when it was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of every farmer in the land , and we think still it is the best treatise , for the object it had in view , which has ever been written . The more it is examined , the more its value will appear . His last work was his edition of Stephens 's Farmer 's Guide , to which , by the particular desire of the Edinburgh publishers , the Messrs . Blackwood , he added notes and an appendix , which would of themselves make a small volume , and which much increased the value of the original work . We most fully agree with the editor of the Cultivator , that Professor Norton was " the most practical Agricultural writer and thinker of the present time , and that his efforts promised more permanently beneficial results than those of any other man . " Nor was his more strictly scientific studies neglected , though , judging it important first of all to awaken an interest in such studies by the dissemination of Agricultural views founded on science , he had not devoted so much time to this branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What he did publish , however , was valuable . We mention " Researches and Observations on the Potatoe Disease , " published in the Journal of Science , vol. ii , 281 ; iv , 70 ; on the " Proteine Bodies of Peas and Almonds , " published in the same Journal , vol. v , 22 ; " on the Value of Soil Analysis and the Points to which especial attention should be directed , " read before the American Association at Albany , August , 1851 , and published in their proceedings . In this paper , he was aided by William J. Craw , first assistant in his laboratory . This was his last contribution to science , and the elevated views which it contains of the high office of the scientific man , in relation to agriculture , only make more manifest the loss science has suffered in his death . But we draw nigh the closing scene . The session of 1851 was the most prosperous one his school had enjoyed , and it was now made certain that a large chemical school would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he took a deep interest in the projected University of Albany , in which Agricultural chemistry was to have a prominent place , and agreed to deliver a course of lectures in that city , on that subject . Everything was now prosperous with him . Useful , honored , and beloved , he enjoyed the present and saw before him an equally // honorable and useful future . But , alas ! his days were numbered , and he was approaching the grave . On his first journey to Albany , he spit a little blood in the cars . Thinking little of it , he gave his lecture as if nothing had happened . He raised a little blood several times afterwards ; at last , the hemorrhage became so great , as to cause anxiety . A council of physicians was called , who pronounced the case alarming , though not hopeless , and advised a sojourn in a warmer climate . He went with his brother to Florida , and there somewhat recovered . But on his way home he took the measles in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On his return to New Haven , he looked better . He continued improving somewhat through the summer . He himself , as usual , was hopeful , though friends were fearful . He was able to do a little . His last public labor was conducting an examination of several of his scholars , who were candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy . It was perhaps too much for him , but he felt a deep interest in the matter , as it was the first time of conferring degrees in that department . His last act in the service of his school , was indeed all that remained to its complete establishment , as an institution giving both the reality and the recognized title of a Professional education . About commencement , he was seized with a violent hemorrhage-. - recovered somewhat-went to his father 's in Farmington-and there died , in the bosom of his own family . But how did he die ? How endured he to relinquish his promising plans of future usefulness , and quench these hopes in death ? How endured he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly bliss ? He resigned them all cheerfully , even exultingly . When informed at Albany , in the latter part of the day , that his case might terminate fatally , he slept that night as soundly as if he had been told he would soon be well again ; and when his wife , thinking he must have misunderstood the decision of the physicians , asked him if he knew what the physicians had said , he replied that he did-it was the will of God , and He would do what was best . When again , twenty-four hours before his death , the same faithful friend broke to him the message from his physician , that he had but few hours to live , he said , this is sudden , and begged , as his head felt confused , to be left to himself a little while . He closed his eyes and continued in prayer and meditation , for perhaps half an hour , and then opened them , exclaiming , " 0 Glorious Imrx*ortality : All is peace ; " and , from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one who was about to set out on a pleasant journey . On Sunday morning , the day of his death , contrary // to the expectation of the family , who supposed they had taken their last earthly leave of him , he opened his eyes , which beamed with their wonted animation and cheerfulness , and he spoke to them all again with a kind of heavenly composure , and then fell " on sleep . " He died on the 5th of September , 1852 , aged 30 years . Although in the account of his life , we have indicated the principal traits in the character of Professor Norton , we wish , for the sake of the example , to dwell upon them a little longer . His mind was bharacterized by strong powers of perception and observation , by the capacity of long continued attention , and by sound practical judgment . Ho possessed in combination many of the qualities which belonged to his distinguished progenitors , Governor John Treadwell , and Senator Timothy Pitkin . He took liberal and comprehensive views . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uprightness of mind which kept him from being misled by prejudice or fanciful speculations . For the same reason , whatever he undertook turned out well . He had no useless knowledge ; he wasted no time in chance wanderings over the field of science ; he studied with definite and well matured aims . There was also a certain joyous activity of mind , which made hard study in his favorite pursuits a positive delight . Nor was he deficient in fancy and imagination . He took a deep interest in the fine arts , especially in music , of which he was no mean proficient . And over all this there was thrown the charm of a quiet humor , mellowing the firmer and more serious parts of his character . Professor Norton was a thorough student . He was a model in this respect . His time was systematically divided , and each portion scrupulously spent in its allotted work . There were no idle moments-no waste time . Whatever was to be done , was done at once . He carried the prompt habits of a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguishes student life from a life of business , that it is possible much more frequently to postpone the labors of the day to a future opportunity . Every student forms plans of study , but there are few who do not suffer them to be broken in upon or frustrated . But we should as soon have thought of the merchant postponing the payment of a note till after banking hours , as of Professor Norton postponing the allowed work of the hour to another time . Professor Norton studied with the pen in his hand . No German student could excel him in the diligence with which he took notes of the lectures he attended , or recorded his own observations on what he was studying . He composed with // great facility and in a good style , and was fond of writing . He has left behind many volumes of manuscripts . He was in every respect a scholar , thorough , exact , and profound . As a man-as a member of society-he was everything that could be desired . The frankness and ingenuousness of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him a favorite in the social circle . He was always interested in the details of social life-took part in all innocent amusements-and having worked hard enough and long enough , in his study-he left his toils behind him . He enjoyed life himself and helped others to enjoy it . What he was in the dearer and more intimate relations of life , we will not attempt to describe ; there are joys , there are sorrows , which even near friends may not enter into . But , after all , it was as a man of Christian principle , that Professor Norton was most conspicuous . He early united himself with the Christian church , and Christian principle controlled the actions of his life . His firmness under trying circumstances has already been mentioned . But the same firmness was seen in every thing . He was always on the right side ; no one ever doubted on any moral or religious subject , where he would be found . He made the Bible the man of his counsel , and the guide of his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His life had been an uncommonly happy one . Prosperity smiled upon him . We have never known the individual who was so uniformly blessed of Providence , in all his undertakings . And yet , at the unexpected summons , in the morning of life , and with every thing to live for , he was ready-he was cheerful . If he had a care , it was for those he was to leave-for the aged and venerable grandmother , who leaned upon him-for the father who had done so much for him-for the family circle which surrounded him-for the wife of his tenderest affections . He knew , he did not strive to conceal from himself  --  the pangs that would pierce them ; and the thoughts that were diverted from Heaven , were for them , to comfort and console them . His affections clung around his laboratory to the last moment . He spoke of it with the deepest interest . After executing a brief will , he made many verbal bequests , among them the one to the college . " My apparatus and books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to the college , if the department shall be continued . I hope it will be kept up ; it has cost me a great deal of labor . " The public loss in this death is great indeed . With that intense devotion to one great end in life , in which he stood // alone in this country in his department , and we suppose the number of such men is not large abroad : with those habits of diligence which made him master of the vast amount of knowledge , necessary in his profession , and that soundness of judgment which kept him from all speculative schemes : with that confidence which he had already inspired into the Agricultural community : with the state of Agriculture in the land , just in a condition to need and profit by the labors of such a man-with all this in view-we were authorized to anticipate , and we now take pleasure in expressing the anticipation , that he would have risen to the highest distinction in his profession , that he would have reflected high honor upon the college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been of the most important service to his country . But our friend did not live in vain . He accomplished a good work . He left a name without a blot . He bequeathed an example which others may be satisfied to equal . He founded a school , which , in accordance with his dying wish , we trust , the community will not suffer to languish , but will rear up to be his perpetual monument ; and in after years , when it shall have risen to wide-spread renown , and multitudes on multitudes shall have enjoyed its blessings , honored will be the name of John Pitkin Norton , its founder .
