ARTICLE 111. - MR . DANIEL LORD AND THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY . A NEW question has arisen in the American Tract Society , more important than any question of mere expediency , or even of the performance of a specific duty ; a question which reaches into the very organism of the Society , and the foundations on which it rests . Has the Society , under its charter and constitution , the right to control its own affairs , or has it so divested itself of authority , that its Executive Committee , elected by it , are absolute and uncontrollable , and may conduct the business of the Society in accordance with their own views , uninfluenced and unassisted by the expression of the opinions or wishes of the Society itself ? This is a question of vital interest . The relations which this Society bears to the churches of the country , and to the great interests of religion , are so multifarious and extended that this question rises in importance above every other , and must be settled in such a manner as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society depends for support . The officers of this Society , and of all our benevolent Societies , must be responsible , not merely to their own consciences and to God , not simply to the public sentiment of the community , in that general sense in which every man is so responsible , not only to the churches , from which contributioi*is are received , but to the Society from which they derive their appointment , which should have the right and the power to demand and enforce a strict specific responsibility . If the members of the Society have no rights which the Executive Committee are bound to respect , the plan of a voluntary Society for benevolent ends must be abandoned . Better the system of ecclesiastical boards , better the system of priestly control , than a so-called voluntary system , which allows no volition and no freedom , except to the agents and officers of the Society . // It will be remembered that at the late annual meeting of the American Tract Society , a resolution was offered by William Jay , Esq. , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed to publish , during the coming year , one or more tracts on the moral evils and vices which slavery is known to promote , and which are so much deplored by evangelical Christians . " Whereupon Daniel Lord , Esq. , rose and opposed the adoption of the resolution , and advanced the idea that the Society has no right to instruct or advise its officers . So conclusive did he regard his own argument and so thoroughly exhaustive of the subject , that he concluded by moving to lay the resolution of Mr. Jay on the table , for the expressed purpose of preventing any debate or reply . We propose to examine this question by reference to the charter and constitution and practice of the Society , and such principles of law as seem applicable to the case . If in so doing we detect the fallacies , and expose the errors of Mr. Lord 's argument , we do so with a high regard to his character as a man , and to his legal reputation . For we are not of the number of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an argument it is necessarily conclusive , since we know that it is the duty of an advocate to sustain the interests and vh*ws of his clients as best he can , and that a professional man of high attainments is not always employed on the right side , and that such an one sometimes uses arguments which do not meet the approval of the courts of last resort . To the Christian community , Mr Lord has referred the discussion , and to that tribunal of last resort the decision may safely be left . We proceed then to an examination of the charter and constitution of the Society , upon the construction of which two instruments the legal aspects of the question depend . The charter passed May 26 , 1841 , provides : I. James Milnor , * * * * and William A. Ilallock , and all such persons as now are , or may hereafter become members of the American Tract Society , formed in the city of New York in the year 1825 , are constituted a body corporate , // by the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious publications . 2 . The net income of said society , arising from their real and personal estate , shall not exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars annually . 3 . This corporation shall possess the general powers and be subject to the provisions contained in title third of chapter eighteen of the first part of the iRevised Statutes , so far as the same are applicable and have not been repealed . By this charter an artificial being was created , a being known to the law as a corporation , a being having a will and capable of exercising that will in reference to the particular object for which it was formed . Previous to their incorporation the members of the society had the right , and had exercised it , to transact the same business , as associated individuals , as after this act was passed , but they found or expected to find advantages from acting in a corporate capacity , and so became subject to the general principles relating to such corporations , and to the statute on the subject referred to in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , thus defines a corporation : " An aggregate corporation , at common law , is a collection of individuals united into one collective body under a special name , and possessing certain immunities , privileges , and capacities , in its collective character , which do not belong to the natural persons composing it . Among other things it possesses the capacity of perpetual succession , and of acting by the collected vote or will of its component members , and of suing and being sued in all things touching its corporate rights and duties . It is , in short , an artificial person , existing in contemplation of law , and endowed with certain powers and franchises , which , though they must be exercised through the medium of its natural members , are yet considered as sub . sisting in the corporation itselg as distinctly as if it were a real personage . " And he defines eleemosynary corporations to be " such as are constituted for the perpetual distribution of the flee alms and bounty of the founder in such manner as he has directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this corporation ? Mr. Lord classes it with eleemosynary corporations . Nothing , however , appears in the charter which can be construed as constituting an eleemosynary corporation , nothing which is in consistent with pecuniary profit or with common business purposes . There is no intimation that any funds are to be used but the // funds of the corporators , and no individuals desiring corporate powers for the printing and circulating religious works for pecuniary profit would ueed any other charter than this . Moreover one of the essentials of an eleemosynary corporation is that there shall be a foundation of a permanent character , so that in the language of Judge Story , " perpetual distribution may be made of the free alms and bounty of the founder , as he has directed , " in whom and his heirs the right of visitation at common law exists . The facts in reference to the American Tract Society will hardly bring it within this definition . In 1847 , the legislature of the State of New York caused certain interrogatories to be propounded to the officers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oath , that they have no permanent vested funds ; that the principle of the society has ever been not to hoard funds for future years , but freely to dispense the blessings of the institution to the full extent of the means committed to its management . These answers are verified by the oaths of Theodore Frelinghuysen , President , Moses Allen , Treasurer , W. A. ilallock and IR . S. Cook , Secretaries , and 0 . iR . Kingsbury , Assistant Secretary and Treasurer . We hesitate then to adopt the principle enunciated by Mr. Lord that this Society is " a charitable foundation " in every sense , and that it is to be governed by the rules relating to such foundations . He himself advances a proposition inconsistent with this principle , when he says , " as to the donors they give their property to the charity ; it is an entire gift , parting with their right as proprietors . After a thing is given , every man , woman and child knows that the giver can no longer control and direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to make up this fund could be present , they could have no right to interfere with , or change the administration of this fund . " Now Judge Story says , " To all eleeinosynary corporations a visitatorial power attaches as a necessary incident ; for these corporations being composed of individuals , subject to human infirmities , are liable , as well as private persons , to deviate from the end of their institution . The law , therefore , has provided that there shall somewhere exist a power to visit , inquire into , and correct all irregularities and abuses in such cor // porations , and to compel the original purposes of the charity to be faithfully fulfilled ; and of common right , the founder and his heirs are the legal visitors . " Then , if this is an eleemosynary corporation , there is power in the donors who founded it to control and direct " this fund , " even after they have " given " it , for such power attaches as a " necessary incident . " If this power does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a corporation as Mr. Lord claims . When a private eleemosynary corporation is established , the right of visitation , at common law , is in the founder and his heirs . When trnstees are incorporated for the purposes of controlling a charity , as is done by the charters of Dartmouth College and Yale College , the right of visitation is in the trustees , so incorporated . The error of Mr. Lord is in supposing this corporation to be like the college corporations referred to . In those cases trustees are incorporated for the purpose of controlling a charity ; in this case no charity is alluded to in the charter , no trustees are incorporated by it , and no change is made in the relations of the Society and its officers , under the charter , from what they were before . We would rather say that the Society is not made a trustee by its act of incorporation , but that by the fact of being incorporated , it is as competent to receive trusts as any other person , and is subject not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " foundation " in the technical sense , but to the laws regulating trusts , which are of every day application between man and man . The American Tract Society is a charitable Society , but it will not do to base legal rights on popular language . We are told by Mr. Lord that " the members of the Society are mere trustees . " No man knows better than Mr. Lord , the distinction between a corporation and the individual members of a corporation ; the distinction so clearly drawn by Judge Story , as quoted above ; and that even if the individual members of a corporation were all trustees for the same person , this would not constitute the corporation a trustee ; and so on the other hand , if a corporation is a trustee , this would not make the individual members of the corporation trustees . // We pass now to the constitution of the Society . The corporators have a right by law to make such rules for the transaction of their business as may be necessary and proper , provided they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodies the rules adopted by the members for their government . The important Articles , in reference to the question under discussion , are the fourth , fifth , sixth , and tenth . They are as follows : ART . 4 . The SocIety shall meet annually , on Wednesday , immediately precedine the second Thursday in May , when the proceedings of the foregoing year shall be reported , and a Board consisting of a President , Vice Presidents , Secretaries , a Treasurer , two Auditors , and thirty-six Directors shall he chosen . ART . 5 . The Board of Directors shall annually elect , by ballot , a Publishing , a Distributing , and a Finance Committee , each consisting of not less than three , nor more than six members ; the members of which three Committees shall constitute an Executive Committee , to conduct the business of the Society , and shall be , ex officio , members of the Board . The Board shall have power to enact By-laws , and to appoint 1-Jonorary Vice Presidents , Directors or members . Twelve members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business . ART . 6 . To promote in the highest degree the objects of this Society , the Officers and Directors shall be elected from different denomiRations of Christians ; the Publishing Committee shall contain no two members fi-om the same ecclesiastical connection ; and no tract shall be published to which any member of that Committee shall object . ART . 10 . The President . . . . may call special meetings of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors shall have power to call special meetin*s of the Society . The fair , obvious construction of these Articles is that the Society shall at its annual meeting appoint its officers , who like all officers of every association or corporate body shall be under the control and direction of the appointing power . The idea that the appointment of an agent clothes him with absolute l ) owcr , which can not be controlled , and that it is necessary to reserve tile right to control in tile act of appointment , is a novel one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord that " the only power and function of the members is , at their annual meeting , to nominate and appoint the officers of the institution . " " For this purpose they are to meet ; they are to consult , deliberate , and if // they please , debate , as to the past conduct of the officers , who may be presented for reaction . " " They have no power reserved to control those whom they have elected . " That these propositions are erroneous is obvious from the tenth Article , which authorizes calling special meetings of the Society . Now , if all the powers and functions of the members are exhausted at the annual meeting of the Society , in the nomination and appointment of officers , why was a provision inserted for calling special meetings ? Officers can be elected only at the annual meeting , and according to Mr. Lord , this is all the members can do under their own constitution . What , on this construction , is to be done at a special meeting ? Is it merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having adopted the fourth Article , and by so doing , as is claimed , knowingly divested themselves of their power to act except at an annual meeting , make provision for calling special meetings ? The fifth Article provides " that the Executive Committee shall conduct the business of the Society . " The Society then ha8 business to be conducted . It may appoint agents to conduct its business , Is the Society without a mind as to the mode of transacting its own business ; and having a mind ou this subject , has it no right to express it ? Mr. Lord says " The object of the Society is not to declare the principles of its managers or members ; not to discuss or settle controversies ; not to declare for or against slavery ; but to enlighten its beneficiaries by the circulation of tracts . " We agree with him that " the object of the Society is not to declare the principles of its managers or members , " if a distinctiou can be drawn between the principles of the individuals composing the Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural members ; but if he means to assert that the Society must only print and circulate tracts which contain no opinions , which discuss nothing and settle nothing , he asserts that which is just as absurd as it would be for them to circulate tracts written in a language which those to whom they are to be sent* , do not understand . A religious tract , in its very idea , is the expression of an opinion upon some religious subject , and to say that those who are incorporated for the // purpose of expressing opinions in print may not discuss the propriety and expediency of publishing opinions is too absurd for serious refutation . But Mr. Lord 's argument goes further . It takes the ground that as , by the sixth Article , a discretion is allowed to the Executive Committee , that discretion can not be controlled , and the Committee , in the discharge of their functions , are compared to judges , whom the people elect , but can not direct in their judgment . The fallacy of this part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized to use his discretion to any extent , is necessarily beyond the control of his principal , and that every person who exercises his judgment is therefore a judge . This is too trifling an argument to require a reply . But there is a part of the charter , made such by reference , bearing on this point . In title third , iu chapter eighteen of the first part of the IRevised Statutes , it is provided that no corporation shall have powers , except such as are expressly granted , or necessary to carry out the enumerated powers . It is also provided that corporations may appoiut subordinate agents , but no authority is given to appoint agents who shall be above the direction of the Society , and not subordinate to it . These officers , these Committees then are subordinate to the Society , or they are appointed in derogation of the charter , which is the law of the existence of the corporation . This argument , however , is based on the idea that the sixth Article gives individual members of the Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal opinion . The proof is abundant . It has been proved beyond controversy , that this Article relates to denominational differences , aud we shall not waste time in repeating arguments which remain unanswered . Some new proofs were given , however , at the late Annual Meeting , that this is the practical construction put upon this Article by the Executive Committee themselves in other cases . It was publicly stated by a Life Director of the Society , on his own personal knowledge , that among the members of the Executive Committee , that day re-elected , there were some who use wine as a beverage , and some who open their parlors for // dancing ; and on the platform , a Vice President of the Society pnblicly insulted the Society , by the offer of his tobacco box to the same Life Director ! What do these facts teach , but that the Executive Committee themselves publish tracts whose prin cipies they do not individually approve , whose precel ) ts they do not personally regard , because they believe them to be approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find no denominational objection to them . It is only on the subject of Slavery and the Slave Trade that their consciences are sensitive . There is another course of inquiry which may throw light u DOll this subject , to wit , the uniform practice under this constitution . The resolutions adopted by the Society iu 1857 were pronounced by Mr. Lord to be a usurpation , " a great usurpation " on the rights of the officers . If there are any precedents on this point , their number and directness will have influence in deciding the question . We find by reference to the annual reports of the Sodiety , that in 1827 the Society expressed its opinion on the importance of circulating religious tracts among the Western settlements of our country , and also among the higher as well as the lower classes of society . In 1828 , the importance of the Valley of the Mississippi , of Spanish America , of Greec e , and of heathen lands , as fields of labor , was discussed . In 1829 , the Society resolved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mississippi . " In 1830 , a resolution was offered by Dr. Spring , " that it is our duty as a Society to extend our operations to the heathen , who sit in darkness , as well as to supply the destitute portions of our own country . " In 1831 , the Valley of the Mississippi was again recommended by the Society , as a promising field for effort , and the duty of the Society to extend its efforts to distant lands affirmed . In 1832 , on motion of Mr. Eastman , it was resolved , " that the Society xviii proceed immediately to the work of supplying systematically the entire destitute population of our country with tracts . " In 1833 , able writers are called on , by vote of the Society , to furnish new and appropriate tracts to alarm the conscience . In 1834 , the Society by vote responded to the call from the Southern States , and resolved // that they would endeavor with the least possible delay , besides the continued circulation of tracts , to place one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , willing to receive the same , in the States of Maryland , Virginia , North and South Carolina , Georgia , and the Territory of Florida . " The system of colportage has been repeatedly approved , its extension recommended , and its results rejoiced in . Seamen and boatmen , German infidels and rationalists , as well as Papists , have been specially pointed at , as classes requiring the labors of the Society , and the peculiar opinions entertained by these persons have been referred to , as needing to be met by the publications of the Society . We have not looked through all the Annual IReports ; enough has here been shown to make it evident that the Society has from the first considered it its right and duty to discuss fields of labor , and to recommend particular sections of the country , particular classes of citizens , and particular views to the attention and labors of its agents and officers . It is believed that not a year has passed since the formation of the Society in which some expression of opinion has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best mode of conducting the business of the Society ; and as these plans were to be carried out by the Executive Committee , it is manifest that from the first there has been advice and instruction , or whatever you please to call it , given by the Society to its officers at the Annual Meetings . Have the Society supposed , from year to year , that they were usurping any of the powers of the Executive Coimnittee ? And did Mr. Lord and the members of the Executive Committee , when they offered or seconded these resolutions , suppose that they , as members of the Society , were usurping rights which belonged to the officers ? It is too plain to be argued . The fair construction of the charter and the uniform practice of the Society agree in support of the position that the agents of the Society are not superior to the Society itself . One other objection remains . It is assumed by Mr. Lord that the persons to 1 ) e benefited by this Society are " the ignorant , the unenlightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done only by circulating tracts , and on this assumption he argues that if tracts can not be circulated , they can not , under // the Constitution , be printed , and that the practicability of circulation must be first determined . And then making the further assumption that tracts on slavery can not be circulated in certain portions of the country , and tracts on polygamy in certain other portions , he contends that they can not be printed by the Society without a breach of trust . Who , then , are " the ignorant , the iinenlightened , and the needy , " for whom tracts are to be printed and circulated ? how ignorant , unenlightened , and needy must a person be to permit the Society to give him a tract without a breach of trust ? Did the founders of the Society err when , in 1827 , they determined to circulate tracts among the higher classes ? When , in 1834 , they resolved to furnish every family in the Southern States with tracts , was it only to the ignorant and needy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all southern families among the ignorant and unenlighte*ied ? Tracts are intended to instruct , convince , and persuade those who are ignorant and unenlightened as to their duty on moral and religious subjects , however elevated their position and however well instructed in knowledge . If we may judge from the developments that have recently been made , the tracts on dancing , and the use of wine and tobacco , may advantageously be circulated among those who are professedly laboring to enlighten others on these topics . The next position taken is that the practicability of the circulation of a tract must be ascertained before it can be printed without a breach of trust . This is extending the veto power indeed ! It is not enough that tracts shall be calculated to meet the approval of different denominations of evangelical Christians , as we claim ; it is not enough that they shall , in fact , commend themselves to the approbation of the individual views of the members of the Publishing Committee , as has been claimed ; but they must be approved by everybody ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print tracts on the subject of the moral evils of slavery would be a breach of trust , because they can not be circulated at the south , assuming this as a fact *because the system of slavery exists , to some extent , at the south . We might , with the same // propriety , argue that tracts on dancing , the use of wine and tobacco , can not be printed without a breach of trust , because they can not be circulated among the Executive Committee , assuming this to be a fact because we know that these practices are , to some extent , indulged by the members of the Executive Committee . Mr. Lord argues that polygamy can not be condemned by the Society in its publications , because he assumes that such tracts could not be circulated among the Mormons ; and why not for a similar reason suppress tracts on Universal Salvation , on the Divinity of Christ , the Atonement , &amp;c. ? It is a short argument . Those who do not believe the doctrine of th' tracts will not receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need them . Indeed , we are ready to ask of what use to publish tracts on any subject , or of what use any effort to correct the moral evils and vices of sin ? The argument must go to this extent ; it must put a stop to the American Tract Society , and every other Society which seeks to convince men of error and of wickedness ; it must close the Bible , call home our missionaries , shut up our pulpits , and leave the world to its own course . Not so thought the men who planned the American Tract Society . Said Justin Edwards , at the first anniversary meeting of the Society , " those truths which God has revealed , in the aspect and connection in which he has revealed them , it is our duty to extend , not merely because we have associated for this purpose , but because Cod has commanded us to extend them to every creature . " This idea of deciding whether a tract can be circulated before it is printed is a novel one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be circulated , is preposterous . In our number for August , 1858 , we said , " If you have any doubt on this point , consult the Annual IReports of the Society , consult any faithful tract distributor in one of our large cities , and you will learn of not one or two , but of a large number of the openly vicious who have refused repeatedly to receive tracts condemning their darling sins , but who at length have been persuaded to accept , to read , to repent and to believe . " We had not examined the Annual Reports of the Society for this purpose , we appealed to what every one knows , who // knows anything of the practical operation of tract distribution , and the use of this argument betrays a lamentable ignorance on the subject . We have in our hands the twenty-fifth Annual Report of the Society , and we will make some extracts from this as a sample of what may be found in all . On page ninety-one is mentioned the case of a wife , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not enter the house again . Her husband expostulated with her , but she replied , " lie shall not come into the house again ; " but the Spirit of the Lord reached her heart , and when the colporteur returned , they gave him a hearty welcome . On page ninety eight , a colporteur among the French , in one of the most forbidding portions of Louisiana , states that a Catholic priest denonuced him and his books , and ordered the people not to read or touch them . Many caine and received books . One woman who would not disobey the priest Thy touching the books , spread her apron over her hands and thus opened and read the books . The priest , thus baffled , stated that the books published in New York were of an incendiary character . This plan sncceeded better . The colporteur left the place , and some of his friends thought it would not be safe for him to return , but he has been there twice since , and no harm was done him . One woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed one into a tub near her . Whemi he returned , the woman was glad to see him , and wanted more books . On page one hundred , a colporteur in Tennessee says , there were seven doggeries in the place , but before we left we procured a number of signatures to the temperance pledge . An old gentleman , who was furious in his opposition at our first visit , was now the first to welcome us . IBut we can not go through the narratives of a similar character , even in this one report . Would it not be well for the Society to make similar selections front their own reports , for circulation among their own members ? We hope not to be charged with impertinence or nsnrpation for making the suggestion . l3ut it is too serious a matter for trifling .. We are shocked that Christian men should argue that it is useless and wrong to proclaim the truth , because men will not listen // to it . We have felt ashamed that it seemed necessary to quote , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we remember who it was that said , " Go , and speak unto them and tell them , thus saith the Lord , whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear . " Must we argue longer to show that circulation does not mean universal circulation ? If Unitarians will not receive tracts on the Divinity of Christ , there are still many others who will gladly receive them ; if Universalists will not tolerate tracts on eternal punishment , there are others to whom they may be given ; if Mormons will not bear the precepts of the Gospel in their relation to polygamy , the Society may still be justified in printing and circulating their tract on the seventh commandment ; if even members of the Executive Coiumittee should turn their backs on the tracts upon fashionable amusements , wine drinking and the use of tobacco , there are many ignorant and unenlightened persons to whom such tracts may be a blessing ; and if the Southern slaveholders curse when tracts against slavery and the slave trade are proposed , there are gray-haired meiubers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospel , who need to be taught " the first principles of the oracles of God " on this subject , for when the members of the Society assembled in May last , one such came also among them to defend the slave trade . If anything could arouse the officers of the Society to appreciate the moral insensibility , which their withholding the truth has been a means of inducing , and to the discharge of their duty in the premises , it would seem as if the open advocacy of the slave trade , not in the distant South , but in their own presence , even by a minister of the Gospel , on the floor of the Society , would do so . And if the professors of such a religion pertinaciously refuse to receive the exhortations and admonitions of their Christian brethren , it will not be long before the opinion will prevail , that any such professions of Christianity are vain , and that objections from such a source are not worthy to be regarded .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
