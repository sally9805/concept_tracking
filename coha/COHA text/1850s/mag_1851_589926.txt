UNITED STATES MAGAZINE , AND DEMOCRATIC REVIEW . VOL . XXIX . DECEMBER , 1851 . NO . CLXII . CODE OF PROCEDURE. * THE codes of civil and criminal procedum* of the State of New-York , as reported by the commissioners , have been for some time before the public , and are now before the legislature of that state . Their labors are of the greatest value , and the question of their full adoption or rejection , is of no ordinary importance in reference to the future . Fifty years ago , he , who in his closet should have elaborated results , such as those to which with great wisdom the commissioners , after mature reflection , have arrived , might possibly have escaped with the simple reproach of being merely a visionary dreamer , but more probably would have been looked upon as a dangerous radical , wishing to turn the world upside down ; but that such schemes would so soon become redized , is what the most enthusiastic would hardly have conceived . In no state were reforms in judicial procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very necessities of the times . The abuses of the English system existed then in full vigor . Fictions were deemed necessary preliminaries to the truth . John Doe and Richard Roe reigned triumphant in the common law  --  the very embodiments of English jurisprudence ; while the Chancellor , administering what he fancifully termed equity , transferred to the virgin soil of this continent the worst evils of Rome-bred law . The Puritans of New-England simplified the common law , abandoning , to a great extent , its absurd fictions-its many technicalities , its cumbrous forms of procedure  --  but in this state the frame-work of the common law was brought over bodily . It was seen and felt to be unsuitable-expensive in its procedure , so much so , that everywhere a change was demanded , as well by the popular expressions of the masses , as by the enlightened judgment of the most learned and liberal of the Bar . The origin of the law is everywhere the same , and its gradual improvement is always through the same processes . Custom , prescription , the opinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sove- .. reign power , constitute in different proportions the , law of all countries . But in process of time , customs became numerous , provincial , variant , discordant ; the opinions of courts differ , the decision of one court con The Code of Civil Procedure of the State of New-York .

The mass of existent law is too expensive to be purchased , too great to be read even by those whose special occupation it is to aid in its administrationunknown to the mass , dimly known or dubiously conjectured by the learned , its light flickering , uncertain , like that of the will o wisp in its illuminations . Something must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and authority to the wisdom of jurisconsults , defining and settling , by the judgment of an ultimate tribunal , the quarrels of conflicting courts , and rendering known and definite their opposing decisions . Codification  --  the reduction of the existent mass of the various elements which constitute the law of a country ,  --  a legislative digest of decisions , a rQvision of statutory law accumulating by mere lapse of time , till the mass becomes unwieldy by its own increasing bulk , comes to be an inevitable necessity . The jurisconsults , the Tribonians and Appians , whose labors have given J ustinian an immortality which no act of his would have conferred , merely collected and stamped , with the authority of law , what before rested only in the opinion of jurisconsults , or in the conflicting rescripts of preceding Emperors . The Code Napoleon has done little more than to give the sanction of the state to the writings of the most eminent jurists of France . The various codifiers , ancient and modern , have hardly merited more than the moderate praise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existing law . He who should predicate the highest skill in the mechanical efforts of the early ages-who should say that they were the wisest and greatest of human art and science , would be laughed at for his foolish credulity . Humanity leaped not into perfection , like Minerva , in full armor , from the head of Jove . It is equally absurd to expect the greatest sagacity in the rude beginnings of legal institutions . No sane man would anticipate the highest efforts of legislative wisdom from the barbarous Saxon , the piratical Dane , or the warlike Norman . A law is wise or unwise , solely in its relation and adaptation to the state of the times , the social refinemerit and progress in the arts , the acquirements in science , the extent of the commerce and the magnitude of the manufactures of a nation , where it exists . The refined and scholastic subtleties of Roman jurisprudence would as illy convene the nomadic Arab , as would the Grecian galley of the days of Pericles subserve the purposes of modern commerce . Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Norman , might be most inexpedient for the great nation which has arisen from their intermixture . The wisdom of law is purely relative . The institutions of the past are only of importance in reference to their fitness for the present . Change , reform , is the inevitable law of progress . This code , bearing everywhere the marks of a well-considered and philosophic innovation , is to be regarded as one among the innumerable instances of progress . Bentham first called the attention of the public to the abuses of the English law-legion in their number , colossal in their magnitude . At first his views were met with ridicule or abuse , then a reluctant hearing was granted , but now they are in the process of gradual fulfilment . Profiting by his suggestions , the commissioners have taken the lead so eminently fitting the great state they represent , in proposing radical and much needed changes in the law , by which the labor and cxpense // of suitors will be diminished , the period of litigation shortened , and just decision , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained . To these changes ,  --  to all changes , whensoever or wheresoever proposed , there will be opposition . All reform is Radicalism in the beginning . The establishment of to-day was the innovation of yesterday . The Conservatism of the present represents the Radicalism of the past , but ignores that of the present , which yet again , in the cycle of events , is hereafter to become the Conservatism of the future . Radicalism inheres in all ideas of improvement . Arkwright and Fulton were Radicals in one direction , Bacon and Bentham in another . The triumphs of the former have immeasurably increased the comforts and changed the commerce of the world . Bacon has stamped the impress of his genius on the philosophy of succeeding ages ; and the time is fast approaching , when the proposed reforms of the latter will be as little considered as of doubtful expediency as the mechanical improvements of the former . Were there no other reasons , the uselessness of so much technical learning , of so many nice subtleties , the utter deposition of much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless when acquired , but yet has an imaginary value as the representative of labor past and useless , would furnish ground for resistance to all change on the part of a portion of the legal profession . Those who live only in and are guided by the past ,  --  whose motto is " stare decisis , " - indifferent what it may be by which they are called upon to stand , no matter how absurd and unwise the decision ,  --  who are governed by the fact of decision , irrespective of its reason , will naturally be averse to innovation . Men of the past , adherents to old forms , enemies to improvement , breakers of machinery , burners of stacks , the makers of shrines for Diana , those who are feeding upon abuses and fear their reform , will oppose ; but the men of eamest inquiry , of vigorous intellect , indifferent to what exists when not based upon or opposed to reason , will give strength and support to these initiatory steps of reform . The Roman law had its " dies fasti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quibbles " inanissima prudentia ? fraudis autem et stultitice plenissima ; " yet so numerous and subtle , that commiserating the sad condition of a doubting suitor groping in the dark after his lost rights , that it permitted him to bring two suits for the same cause of action , with a proviso that he might elect upon which to rely . The common law had its writs for every wrong , if one could only tell which was fitted for his case , but this he must determine at his peril ; its rich variety of antique and worthless lore , which it required , as its sages say , twenty years to master , and when mastered , was much on a level with the vaticinations of the augurer or the hocus pocus of the conjurer . Its forms were replete with fictions silly and absurd , which the litigant was bound to indite before he was permitted to enter the temple of justice . No lie , no justice . The pre-requisite for a chance such as the law gives , was the utterance of a falsehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his progress by snares more numerous than those which endangered poor Christian in his wearisome way to the Holy City . But diversity of forms , fictions without number , were not all . In England , and in countries deriving their jurisprudence therefrom , and in those alone , were to be found two conflicting systems of judicature , differing in the name as well as the substance of their initiatory and final processes , // in their modes of extracting evidence , in their rules of judging of its force and effect , when extracted ; and when the facts are ascertained , in the results , as evinced in judicial action consequent upoa such ascertainment . The common law was wanting in the powers most essential to a well organized judiciary . It was grossly deficient in its power of enforcement or prevention ; incompetent to compel the specific performance of a contract ; to prevent or enjoin waste ; to enforce the obligations of a trust , or to remedy the mistakes and accidents which are perpetually occurring . These powers , so necessary , equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full administration of justice . But two systems of substantive law , and two courts to administer the respective law of each , the one , upon full hearing , after solemn argument , rendering judgment for a party , which the other , after equally solemn argument , forbids him from ever using , were absurdities , which , if they had not the sanction of time , would not have been tolerated for a moment . Of systems of law thus opposite , of rules of procedure thus diverse , both may be wrong ; it is certain that but one can be right . The true principle would be the eclectic . From the various forms of procedure , from the diverse modes of judicial action , from the discordant rules of law which govern in these several seats ofjudicature , carefully select whatever in either may be necessary and expedient , and thus establish a code divested of the errors and embodying the excellencies of each system . In both these respects radical changes have been effected . Fictions , lying , wasteful lying , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie was too precious to be wasted , ) forms of actions , the specialties of pleading , courts of law and courts of equity as distinct , have been abolished . Parties no longer vibrate , like a pendulum , between the common law and equity side of a cause . The legal and the equitable cease to be distinguished , and one suit presents for judicial investigation , and one court determines the rights of parties litigant . These reforms are of no slight moment ; and had no other or greater been proposed or accomplished , the commissioners would have deserved well of the state . But however desirable the abolition of forms of action and the fusion of conflicting jurisdictions may be , it is in reference to the law of Evidence that changes the most indispensable have been made , and to these we intend more particularly to call the attention of our readers . Of the rules of evidence , as established by the common law , it may be said , without the slightest exaggeration , that if the knaves and criminals , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object of which should be to afford the greatest security to each , consistent with the existence of lawhad they held sweet counsel together , with full power to establish rules of evidence which should afford the minimum of protection to society , and the maximum of impunity to themselves , with yet a remote possibility of punishment-it is difficult to perceive how , having any rules , they could have materially improved upon the existent law . Aware that some rules must be granted to pacify the demands of society , the sagacious knave and the discreet criminal would hardly have pressed for rules more favorable to the legal impunity of crime and the successful consummation of fraud , than those which the common law , in its sympathetic wisdom , has so kindly furnished to their hands . It has closed the most obvious and accessible means of information . It has excluded those who , from interest in , or relation to , a cause , would have the best personal  --  and those who , // from connection with the party , as husband , wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge . The individual defrauded is refused a hearing ; the party defrauding is not compelled to answer . The criminal rejoices in his own exemption from the dangers of cross-examination , and in that of all those of his fellows , whom conviction may have stamped with ignominy . That judicial action requires , or should require , for its basis-proof ; that this should be sought for from all available sources ; that existing , no matter where , it should be rendered forthcoming for the purposes of justice , would seem to be propositions so self-evident as to require neither argument nor illustration . That the sources from which evidence would be sought , should vary in relative trustworthiness , was to be expectedfor witnesses in a cause , civil or criminal , can not be selected in advance . When the burglar will enter the dwelling-when the assassin will stabwhen the knave will defraud-when the dishonest will deny or evade the obligations of his contract-neither can be foreseen nor foreknown ; for if foreseen or foreknown , the entry of the burglar  --  the stab of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prevented ; the violated contract would never have been entered into . Proog there . fore , must necessarily be had from sources corresponding to the act proved , and from the parties to the act-from the parties to the crime to be investigated-the contract to be enforced-from their accomplices and associates-their friends and relatives . Primarily , without recourse to reasoning or investIgation , it must be seen that from such sources , more directly and obviously than from any other , evidence more or less reliable can always be had ; that these are natural sources from which to seek for proof . All other evidence must ordinarily be casual-fortuitous  --  the result of accident , not of forethought . Fortuitous , accidental , unexpected , it will obviously have all the general characteristics of humanity , embracing convicts and atheists , the bad and the good-all who may have had knowledge of the fact to be investigated . The party injured having foreseen no wrong , having pre-appointed no witness , must be allowed to offer whatever exists : his own testimony , for of that alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all those who may happen to have knowledge of the matter in dispute ; no matter what , in point of character or in degree of interest they may be , he himself suffering , if the testimony , from any cause , is liable to suspicion , in the diminished credence it will receive  --  or else he must be remediless , and endure in silence the wrong which has been committed . The exclusion of proof of any weight  --  the slightest - is the voluntary self-deprivation by the Court of the means of correct decision , to the extent of all proof for such cause excluded . If the testimony excluded be the only proof attainable , it is an utter denial of justice . It is like bandaging the eye to aid vision-like imposing manacles and fetters to accelerate motion . Of the lengthened series of circumstantial facts by which right is sought to be established , and crime developed , it is not to be expected that each fact in that series should be proved by the same kind of evidence , or by witnesses , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of probative force . No rule in advance can be established , by which the degree of credit to which a witness is entitled , can be pre-determined . The same law of nature , by which the strength , the complexion , the size , is seen to vary , will equally exist in reference to clearness of perception , strength // of recollection , and integrity of narration . Whether the intellect of the witness is keen , his memory good , his trustworthiness unimpeachable , can only be known after , and consequent upon examination . Common sense requires a hearing , and a hearing in each particular case , before deciding upon the greater or lesser degree of credence to which the witness may be justly entitled . Of individuals or of classes there is none of which falsehood can certainly be predicated in any particular instance . Exclusion for anticipated falsehood , is decision without and before hearing-decision adverse to the integrity of the witness . The law , in one phase of its action , when the criminal is on trial , presumes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its exclusions , the presumption is guilt , to prevent which , the witness is excluded ; - guilt , on the part of the witness , on its own . part incompetency , utter and irremediable , else there would be neither fear nor danger in receiving proof , against the truth of which the court seems to be so fully and entirely on its guard . It is obvious , that the integrity and trustworthiness of witnesses will be exposed to various and conflicting motives ; the action of which will vary , at the same time , upon different persons , and upon the same person at different times and under different conditions . How*iver difficult it may be , after the full benefit of examination and cross-examination , and after a careful comparison of the testimony of one witness with another , to award to each the precise degree of credence which his testimony may merit , it is still more difficult to decide this question justly , without such hearing and comparison . Caution , necessary in all cases , may be more particulariy required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , in such cases , the legislature may well place the judge of fact on his guard . But caution and exclusion are entirely different . Caution places the judge on his guard against sinister bias , gives him all the possible material for correct decision , but requires prudence and judgment in the use of the materials thus furnished . If the evidence excluded would be true , no possible reason can be given for its exclusion . Whether true or not , can not be foreknown . Judicial assumption can hardly claim infallibility , yet , excluding such , is its assumption . Misdecision , the excluded evidence being material , true , and unattainable , for any other source , is seen to be inevitable . If the evidence excluded would not be true , that misdecision would ensue from its reception , is by no means certain . If not true , its very falsity , made manifest from other sources , would be an article of circumstantial evidence of no ordinary force in inducing correct decision . Presumed imbecility on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the reasons for exclusion . How can the law foreknow that judges , whose capacity is unknown , will be deceived by the testimony of unknown witnesses , of whose integrity they are equally in the dark . But exclusion presupposes a judgment of which it is the consequence* a judgment without knowledge , or the means of knowledge , which determines the future perjury of all witnesses of the excluded classes and the future incompetency of all judges to justly decide on their testimony , should they be called . While it is thus clear , then , that no exclusions should be made because no judge nor legislature , centuries in advance , can foreknow or presumably conjecture what in each case shall be the importance , necessity , truth or falsehood of any unknown witness , nor the competency of the future judge of fact correctly to weigh such testimony ; nor what would be the conse // consequences from the admission of the testimony to be excluded , whether favorable or unfavorable to justice , still the common law excludes great masses of testimony , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained , from those who at all events must know , whether they will truly or not disclose that knowledge . First in the order of bad rules is that by which interest , whether of a party or of a witness extraneous to the cause , is excluded . The interest is the same , whether the witness is party or not , varying only in amount . The interest of the party may be more or less than of the witness , but the reason of the exclusion , such as it is , applies equally to each . Here is evil , and that continually . At all times needed in the whole progress of the suit and of the trial ; and when most needed , peremptorily excluded . The individuals interested , whether parties or not , would seem to be those of whom one really desirous of information would naturally inquire . The interest of a party is a guarantee for the accuracy of his original perceptions and for the strength of his recollections . He may be liable to bias of greater or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his education , his wealth , and all those various elements which enter into and form the man . But nowhere , save in the realms of the law and in the imaginings of judges , would any such wild hypothesis receive support and form the groundwork of general exclusionary rules , as that all , irrespective of social position , education , wealth , religious influences , from the highest to the lowest , from the most pure to the most abandoned , would , where the smallest pecuniary interest was involved , commit perjury ; yet . a proposition thus monstrous , is simply a statement of the opinion which the law has judicially given of all men , past , present , and to come : an opinion not the result of any present knowledge or past experience , but the prophetic judgment of the juris-prudential theorist . English jurisprudence presumes both parties without integrity , both so ready to commit perjury as to be unworthy of credit , and that the judge of fact is less competent to weigh , compare , adjudicate upon their testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively called by each . But in every disputed case both can not he right , either in the particulars or generals of the matter in contest . The party in the right , hy the very rectitude of his case , having no falsehoods to utter , is trustworthy , and as such is entitled to a hearing and to a favorable decision to obtain which , his testimony is or may be needed ; yet without thought or investigation he is excluded , and to the utter denial of justice , when his testimony is essentially necessary to furnish the needed proof . But it may be said that it can not be known which is in the right . True , but it is known , that of each litigated , case , one is in the right , wholly or so much , so as to entitle him to a favorable decision , and that his opponent is not ; and that of each party the chance is equal at least , that he is in the right , and that whether he is so or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The party in the right must always be the sufferer , for truth has an inherent strength , falsehood an inherent weakness ; and in that conflict , what reason has truth for fear ? Why exclude the right , when the inevitable result must be to favor the wrong . Of two men , one seeking right , the other wrong ,  --  one uttering the trulh to support the right , the other falsehood to favor the wrong ,  --  both are refused a hearing , for fear they will both lie , and that the judge will be deceived thereby . But from the necessity of the case , both can not lie-both can not be in the wrong as to // each fact in dispute . The witnesses called by the respective parties differ in their statements . No doubt seems ever to have been entertained , that from amid these conflicting statements the truth could not be elicited . The judge of fact competent to decide when extraneous witnesses differ , why should that competency vanish because the witness should happen to sustain a particular relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the law recognizes it as possible , that a party may utter the truth against his own interest ; that his testimony may be **31;395;TOOLONG , it may safely be assumed and acted upon as true ; but true , it would none the less be excluded ; indeed , the very truth of the witness would be the unanswerable argument for not hearing him . It would be hard to utter the truth against one 's interest , and in consequence of such utterance be compelled to do justice . It certainly would be so , and therefore the evidence is not to be heard . That it would be much harder to the party in the right to suffer injustice in consequence of being deprived of such testimony , seems not to have occurred  --  or if it occurred , does not seem to have been considered as affording the slightest reason for compelling the proof . The hardship of uttering truth , the hardship of doing justice , the reasons of the wrong-doer why it should not be done , and the court adjudge them sufficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be injured by being compelled to make reparation , or suffer the penalty of guilt , or to answer questions which might lead to his being so compelled ,  --  he is to be exempted from all adverse interrogation . It would be 80 hard to utter the truth , and in consequence thereof do justice to one whom you have wronged , that no such questioning shall be permitted . So , whether the party will lie or tell the truth , it matters not ; heis equally in either case to be excluded . It is all one to the law . When trial by battle was the law of the land , and rights of person and property , the guilt or innocence of the accused , were made to depend upon the skill and vigor with which the weapons of the combatants were wielded ; when the wisdom of the Almighty , it was expected , would supervene to the vanquishing of the oppressor and the defeat of the injured , this mode of determining guilt or innocence had its strenuous supporters , as rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of trial the law of the land and the practice of the courts , sage counsellors , experienced judges learned in the law , would be found opposing an alteration as endangering the best interests of society . The wisdom of our ancestors , the terrors of innovation , the timid forebodings of endangered conservatism , would have borne sway , and the clangor of arms , and the streaming blood and the death-wounds of the defeated combatants , would even now he seen and heard , and the results of the combat be received as proof conclusive of the right . Indeed , the same arguments then urged for the continuance of this mode of trial are what the common law judges now deem sufficient for their exclusionary rules . Beaumonsie , like our judges , haunted by fears of perjurious testimony , faithless in the integrity of witnesses , defended the judicial combat , fearing that without it every heir would he disinherited , as it would be easy to find two persons who would peijure themselves if they had no fear of being challenged ; " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom all things are open , to give the verdict , in such case , scilicet , by attributing the victory or the vanquishment to the one party or the other , as best pleaseth him , than to put it to the country , that is , the jury , // who for default of evidence may be ignorant of right . " So now it is deemed wiser to decide without evidence to the extent of the evidence excludedand it may be of all attainable proof ; than trust the jury , who might erroneously decide . Fear of peijury , alike the reason of the defender of trial by battle and trial without proof to the extent of all exclusions , proceed upon the same principle , the facility with which perjury is committed , and the utter inability of the judge of fact to detect it when committed . The judge of the olden time , fearing perjury , but trusting in God , sent the litigants to battle for right , and determined their rights " according to the victory or the vanquishment " of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears , but with less trust , relying neither on himself nor on God , deprives those who are to decide of the means of correct decision , and leaves the result , as far as relates to him , to accident . Position in a cause-interest in its result-conclusive proof of peijury to the judicial mind  --  the rule of law by which they are excluded , one upon the existence of which the preservation and continuance of society dependsthe relaxation of which would endanger the whole community-the lawyer and the non-lawyer will be astonished at the innumerable exceptions to this most sacred principle , found strewn over the whole surface of this branch of jurisprudence-exceptions , too , not one of which can for a moment be upheld , except upon grounds utterly destructive of the general rule .. But to the defender of existent institutions , the principle and its exceptional subversion are alike matters of that unreflecting laudation which , as if in sarcasm , has termed the law " the perfection of human reason . " To a non-lawyer it would seem , that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and circumstances , before all tribunals , and before the same tribunals at every stage of a trial ; but he who should look for consistency in the rules of the common law , or uniformity in their observance , will look in vain . While for such grave reasons as have been indicated , the law excludes parties , it will nevertheless readily receive them , provided only one is to be heard in a cause . It seems to have a peculiar passion for trying causes by the halves . Such a thing as hearing both parties in the same cause is unknown , unheard of in all the realms of law and of equity . Audi alteram partem is a maxim in no repute . Sometimes one party is heard , sometimes the other ; sometimes a plaintifi sometimes a defendant , heard in one part of the process , rejected in another ; heard as to one fact , refused a hearing as to the other facts . Why one is thus taken and the other left , depends upon the judge before whom the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the form of the writ , the particular fact in issue , or some other reason equally irrelevant to the general grounds of exclusion . This trial by halves may be entitled to commendation as a thought-saving process to the judicial mind . The less proof ; the less need of thought , reflection , judgment . Proof on either side , undisturbed by counter evidence , renders decision easy . The admission of one and the exclusion of the other party , is an approximation to that state . When one party only is heard , decision is an easy matter , requiring little thought . Trial by lot would unquestionably be easier ; but next to that , in the readiness at which the mind can come to a conclusion , is to exclude one and hear the other . Most cases have , or the parties litigant think they have , two sides ; the hearing of both would be no slight inconvenience  --  and so the happy thought occurred , // whenever the general rule was to be viol*ted , of hearing but one in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually given to the plaintiff , when either is to be heard . In all criminal causes , the prosecutor , in England , burthened with the costs of prosecution , here at all events having an interest sufficient to induce his action , the real party using the means and proc&amp;ss of the state with which to reach the accused upon whom to avenge his wrongs  --  the complainant with feeling-revenge to move him-sometimes liable for costs-at all times prosecuting at great loss and inconvenience , is readily received , while the defendant is not permitted to offer the slightest explanations as a witness , and under those sanctions by which the prosecutor is bound . The degraded mother , on a charge of bastardy , guilty by the very fact which alone renders her admissible , which is the reason for her admission , is a competent witness against the reputed father . The law by which more than a given rate of interest is prohibited , has been violated . In no event are both to be heard , and a judgment formed upon their conflicting statements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the usurer is willing to lose his cause , in whole or in part , as the law in different states may vary ; if not , the usurer alone is heard . A trunk and its contents have been lost , or converted to his own use by some one having it in charge , and a suit is brought by the owner to recover the value lost . It then becomes material to determine what those contents are , and their value . Were the admission of the plaintiff as a witness made by the court to depend upon whether the trunk had brass nails or tacks  --  the owner of one with brass nails received , with tacks rejectedthere are few who would not ridicule the absurdity of such a decision . None the less absurd is it , when the plaintiff is a witness or not , as he brings trover or case-as the contents of the trunk are jewels or medical instruments , or articles of wearing apparel. * Is a witness to prove the value of the articles lost , not a witness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds ? Why , truth , ( the probable want of which is the ground of exclusion , ) was more to be expected in relation to the value than the fact of loss-whether the article was one thing or another  --  or would be more likely to be uttered if the attorney should bring trover rather than case . A continuance is required on account of the absence of a material witness  --  a paper upon which depend the rights of a party is lost-the result may depend upon whether delay shall or shall not be granted -- whether a copy shall or shall not be received ; the same judge , who would consider perjury certain , if these facts were to be sworn before a jury , will , without hesitation , make them the basis of his own action , provided only they arc uttered without any of thoseb securities so essential in the extraction of proof . In equity , the preferences are altogether for defendants . Equity jurisdiction is based on fraud , trust , or accident . That the defendant has committed a fraud , violated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that at common law he is without a remedy , are the grievances of which the plaintIff complains , and these grievances constitute the special reasons why the defendant is to be heard-that " this act of the adversary " ( bringing a bill , rendered necessary by the misdoings of the defendant ) // " may be regarded as an emphatic admission , that in that instance the party is worthy of credit , and that his known integrity is a sufficient guaranty against the danger of falsehood. " * The same judge , changing the name of his process from writ to hill ; his official designation from judge to chancellor ; the parties the same , save only in the change of their position ; the amount involved the same ; the question the same , which he has once decided at law , and in which he would have been horror-stricken at hearing either party ;  --  the defendant decided by him in his common law-robes as a dangerous witness-convicted in advance , of ineradicable mendacity-fore-ordained to eternal untrustworthiness ,  --  when the suit is termed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judgment which he has rendered in accordance with the law ; the same defendant , whom , as plainti* he deemed a liar , by the fact of his position , he now finds , by the peculiar virtues of equity , clothed with righteousness , as with a garment , to he entitled to a super-ordinary and unexpected degree of credit , and invariably renders judgment in accordance with his answer , unless it should be contradicted by two witnesses , or what he may deem equivalent to two witnesses . The defendant interested , liable to bias from the stakes dependent on the issue of the contest , if contradicted by an extraneous witness devoid or interest , one would think the chancellor , by analyzing and comparing their conflicting statements , might ascertain the truth ; but no such thing does he do . He has an invariable rule for all such cases , which saves all thought - all investigation : " He will neither make a decree , nor send the cause to he tried at law : he will sim*ly dismiss the bill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cause , sometimes the interest excludes-sometimes not . Policy-necessity-words with which the lawyer plays , as the juggler with his cups and halls , suffice for admission or rejection , as if there were any policy in receiving testimony , which would he detrimental to the cause of truth ; as if there was any necessity , which would justify the hearing of what the same judge has over and over again declared would lead to deception . If policy or necessity will not admit , *a release always will  --  the witness releasing showing by the very fact of surrendering his pecuniary interest , that there is some more powerful motive than that which he has released operating upon his mind , and inducing his action . Nor is this all : the law goes out of its way to create , by rewards to informers , the very interest of which , if it arises in the natural course of business transactions , it evinces such a holy horror . But why investigate the shifting and evanescent distinctionsthe discordant and contradictory rules-so discordant and contradictory , that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadowy line . They are all found written out in the various treatises , whose main object it is to show to what extent , and why , the most obvious and natural sources of testimony are to be excluded from the consideration of the court . We have thus particularly called the attention of our readers to the proposed reforms in reference to the admission of the party and of interested witnesses , because we deem them th' most useful and important of any which they have proposed . Lord Denman 's act goes no. further * 1 Greenl . Ev. , 379. f 1 Greenl . Eir. , 298. // than the admission of extraneous witnesses , when interested . It is not very easy to perceive in what the dollar of the party in peril differs from the dollar of a witness in the same peril-nor how an alteration of the common law , by which the latter is received to testify , can be justified by any course of reasoning which will not apply equally to the former . Another ground of exclusion is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point of no small difficulty to determine precisely the crimes which render a witness thus infamous . When once this difficulty is overcome , the convict is not allowed to testify , because he is deemed " morally too corrupt to be trusted to testify : so reckless of the distinction between truth and falsehood , and insensible to the restraining force of an oath , that it is rendered extremely improbable that he will speak the truth at all . " * The crime , however atrocious , and however fully admitted , never of itself excludes . With the old Spartans , theft per se was well enough-nay , more , approved and commended ; the detection , it was , which was considered worthy of pvinishment . So with the common law , the judgment it is which excludes . The avowed and boasting thief ; the acknowledged but unconvicted perjurer , are received without let or hindrance . The accomplice , testifying under the e4ectation of pardon , or the hope of reward , equally guilty with the accused , whose conviction he is seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laden with the guilt of crime , and the hope of pardon , and the expectant perjury of interest , the law takes no exception . But even the judgment will not exclude , if the conviction has taken place in a state other than that in which the witness is examined this " insensibility to the obligations of an oath , " this recklessness " of the distinction between truth and falsehood , " this moral corruption of the witness , being " strictly territorial . " If from the conviction of a past crime , the inference is conclusive , that the individual so committing will , when called as a witness , commit perjury-why is it not equally conclusive , when the offence was com'mitted one side of a state line as the other * If ; on the other hand , the evidence of convicts from other states has been or can be received , without danger to the interests of justice , then conviction " being shown in diminution of the credit due them , " what reason can be given why the law can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testify , subject to such deductions from the weight of their testimony , as in each instance , the jury hearing their testimony , shall deem meet and proper l The absurd and evil consequences of this rule was most strikingly illustrated in the trial of Abner Rogers for the murder of Charles Lincoln , a Warden of the Massachusetts State Prison . The accused was a convict , and the only witnesses by whom the crime could be proved , were the fellow-convicts of the prisoner . That they saw the crime when committed , if committed ; that there were no motives , perceptible at least , which would be likely to induce false testimony ; that they were willing to narrate what they saw ; that without their testimony the alleged crime would go unpunished , they being the only witnesses by whom it could be proved , were reasons which would have been considered sufficient , by an unlearned layman , ignorant of legal rules , to have at once received their testimony , and , after making such deductions ras the tarnished character of the witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony in ac // cordance with the convictions of his understanding . It would n*ver have occurred to him , that to procure a chance for the conviction of one , all the convicts whose testimony might be important or necessary for conviction , should be turned loose upon society , and that this was a matter of legal necessity , so stringent , that if not done , the legal impunity of the criminal was a matter of the most entire certainty . Not so the common law . That presumed the prisoner innocent , and in this case the verdict of the jury was in accordance with this presumption . Yet five individuals , convicts , whose guilt was as satisfactorily established as guilt ever can be , justly suffering the penalties imposed by law , were pardoned , not on account of any good conduct or peculiar veracity of theirs , but simply , that therehy they might be made competent witnesses . A sixth was called , but no pardon being produced , he was rejected . A just punishment for an offence committed was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of innocence , and the escape of guilt , are both disastrous to society . The remission of a just and fitting punishment of a crime , for a cause totally unconnected with the character or conduct of the pardoned convict , is an evil great in proportion to the justice of the punishment thus causelessly remitted . For a chance at one whom the law presumes innocent , any supposable number of guilty may be relieved from the punishment which the same law has decreed they of right should suffer . But why pardon ? Is there any magic in the virtues of the " great seal ? " Does it resemble , in its moral efficacy , the royal touch in its healing virtues ? The one heals disease : does the other cleanse from sin ? Does the great seal remove " this presumed total disregard to an oath ? " Does it confer new sensibilities to its obligations ? Why , in the case referred to , were five convicts pardoned ? Did the " great seal " change the evidence which these convicts would have delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the pardon , any more deserving of confidence ? Was their testimony any more likely to be true than that of their fellowconvict , who was not among the lucky ones from whom all moral taint was removed by the supernatural virtues of a " great seal ? " if the trustworthiness of the witness is not increased , nor his testimony changed , then of what conceivable benefit is the pardon ? Does it enlarge the sagacity of the judge , or increase the discernment of the jury ? If not ; if no effects ensue from this mummery ; if the trustworthiness of the witness is not increased , nor the capacity of the judge enlarged , nor the acuteness of the jury increased , then all that has been accomplished is , that criminals , expiating their offences by suffering the appointed punishment , are turned out again to commit depredations ; justice is defrauded of her due , and nothing whatever has been gained , save by the criminal ; for the pardoned witness might just as well have been heard without the pardon as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidenced by a judgment , as by admissions ; when committed within as without the state ; when the trial is had , leaving it to the jury to place such reliance on the testimony as they may think , under all the circumstances , it is entitled to . If competent to judge of the veracity of a pardoned convict , will they be hopelessly at fault if the convict should com6 before them without any pardon ? The truth is , the pardon is a silly device to evade the consequences of a bad rule . But this it does not necessarily accomplish . The prisoner may need the testimony of a convict to establish his innocence . The pardon so necessary to technical competency , so unnecessary to testimonial // veracity , depends on the will of the executive magistrate of the state , and it can hardly be supposed , that he will pardon proven guilt for the purpose of facilitating the escape of a prisoner , though , if not done , even innocence should suffer . The rule is full of evil , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses may thus be shut out , the truth excluded , and justice be perverted . The consequences will fall , not on the party guilty  --  the convict-for to him the utterance of testimony is a matter perfectly immaterial , but on the party in the right , who is entirely without fault , and whose misfortune it is to be thus deprived of testimony which may be true and necessary to the attainment of just rights . Experience has fully shown , that no evils have resulted from the admission of the accomplice , or of pardoned convicts ; and if none in these cases , there can be none in any . The rule inflicts punishment on the innocent , who need the excluded proof ; in every aspect is wrong and absurd ; and the only wonder is , that it has so long continued . The commissioners , while they have , upon solid and unanswerable grounds , abolished exclusions resulting , heretofore , from interest and infamy , have been contented with merely modifying the common law in relation to the admission of the testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far , however , as they have modified it , by even granting conditional admission , they have , to that extent , improved it ; for such is the law on this subject , that it is difficult to conceive of any alteration which should not be an amendment . They have , in the case of the clergyman or priest , and the licensed physician or surgeon , added two instances of exclusion , qualified to be sure , heretofore unknown to the law . This is done with great doubt on their part . The modifications of the existent law as proposed , relating as they do to rules of no trifling importance , would seem to demand consideration : " There are particular relations in which it is the policy of the law to encourage confidence , and to preserve it inviolate ; therefore , a person can not be examined as a witness in the following cases : " 1 . A husband can not be examined for or against his wife , without her consent , nor a wife for or against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the marriage or afterwards , be , without the consent of the other , examined as to any communication made by one to the other during the marriage . But this exception does not apply to a civil action or proceeding by one against the other , nor to a criminal , or proceeding for a crime committed by one against the other . " 2 . An attorney can not , without the consent of his client , be examined as to any communication made by the client to him , or his advice given thereon in the course of professional employment . " 3 . A clergyman or priest can not , without the consent of the person making the confession , be examined as to any confession made to him in his professional character , in the course of discipline enjoined by the Church to which he belongs . " 4 . A licensed physician or surgeon can not , without the consent of his patient , be examined in a civil action as to any information acquired in attending the patient , which was necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1710 . " Whether even these four exclusions should all be retained , is a question , say the commissioners , not admitting o1 an easy solution . Neither Livingston nor Bentham admit the exclusion in the case of husband and wife . The only exclusions which Mr. Livingston admits , are those of a lawyer and confessor . The only one allowed by Mr. Bentham is that of a confessor . " // perceive , and perceiving , can make known their perceptions to others , may be witnesses , " is the general rule adopted by the commissioners , after careful consideration of the subject . These exceptions they allow , because " it is the policy of the law to encourage confidence , and to preserve it inviolate . " In receiving the testimony of the party and those interested , it seems to us that the commissioners have settled the question , and against the very exceptions which they seem , doubtingly , to have suggested . Receiving the testimony of the party , the reception of those connected with him , however close the connection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however strong the tie , whether domestic or professional , its pressure would never be so great in intensity as would be that of the personal interest of the party ; that is , the derivative interest of the attorney or the wife , in the affairs of the client or the husband , would never equal the original interest of such husband or client . Hence , when once the primary interest ceases to be a ground of exclusion , much more should all derivative or associated interest be received . If no fear of falsehood , no dread of perjury , no dreaded hardship , in uttering self-deserving truth , have sufficed to exclude the party , certainly they must be insufficient to exclude all lesser interests . " To encourage confidence , and preserve it inviolate . " That under certain limitations , confidence should be encouraged and preserved inviolate , may be , and undoubtedly is , true . But the compulsory utterance of testimony , in accordance with the provisions of the law , can , in no sense , be considered a violation of confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confidence will naturally arise . The very fact of the existence of the relation of husband and wife , attorney and client , confessor and penitent , and physician and patient , necessarily implies antecedent confidence . Without it , the marriage relation is never formed , the attorney is without a client , spiritual consolation is unsought , the aid of the physician is never required . Precedent confidence is implied in the inception of these relations , and their duration is based on its continuance . The preservation of confidence may be right or wrong ; that will depend on the confidence sought to be preserved , what confidence there is to be encouraged , and , being encouraged , to be preserved inviolate ; that between those in the right , between those seeking no wrong and violating no right , a confidence compatible with the great ends of justice , none other . The confidence between associates in fraud , between accomplices in crime , is not of such a nature that the interference , in its favor , of the law , is either necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The knave or the criminal reposes confidence , no matter in whom . What claim has the confidence of guilt or of fraud to legal inviolability ? Is not the protection of this sort of confidence , the encouragement of crime , the support and aid of fraud l In the right , all confidential relations , being true , will , if communicated , subserve the right ; that is , being in accordance with , and favorable to , the great ends of justice . The exclusion does not rest on doubtful truth of such communications ; it assumes their truth , and for that cause excludes . It is the wrong-doer , civil or criminal , alone , whose interests will be jeoparded by the legal disregard of such confidential relations as he may see fit to make ; and it is difficult to perceive what claims he has to the protection of his interests over those of the party in the right . // 496 Code of Procedure . The exclusions are for the benefit of the wrong-doer , and for his benefit alone . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must , the truth , for a confidential communication of falsehood , by the party in the right , is not supposable , the party so communicating them could have no objection to their introduction . No matter how confidential the communication , their judicial promulgation would never be to him a source of regret . It is only when the facts communicated are self-deserving , injurious to the communicant , being true , he being in the wrong , that the disclosure of such communications would be a source of grief . But by the previous provisions of the code , the party being a witness , either at his own instance or that of his antagonist , and subject to crossexamination , of what conceivable importance can the preser*'ation of confidence be to him , when he is himself liable to examination in reference to all facts ? Examinable himself as to confidential communications , the exclusion of the persons to whom they were made can only be of importance to him when , being in the wrong , and intending , if examined , to misstate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , contrasted with what he has previously communicated under the secrecy of confidence , and he is unwilling to have this check upon his testimony ; or , not called by his opponent , and not daring to proffer his own testimony , he wishes to conceal the truths he has communicated . In other words , like all parties , he is opposed to the reception of testimony which may be injurious , not because it is not true , but because , being true , it will tend to promote the ends of justice , what , of all things , he is solicitous to evade . By the provisions of the code , neither husband and wife , attorney , clergyman , nor physician , are necessarily excluded . Indeed , they are all received when the party whose confidential narrations are offered , is himself a witness ; for being a witness is , by the statute , determined to be consent , on his part , to the admission of this proof . Unless then a party wi*lies to be a witness , his confidential relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rejected . When , and under what circumstances , the admission of this testimony being " by consent , " will such consent be granted ? The testimony being admissible only upon the consent of the party against whom it is proffered , it is obvious that the party needing or requiring this testimony can never rely on having it when most necessary for the maintenance of his rights . Indeed , the more necessary he may deem it , the less likely is he to obtain it . Consent is in vain to be expected from the party whose interests are thereby to be disserved . It will never be given save and except when it is expected or known to be favorable to the party in whose power rests the question of admission or rejection . Here , then , may be important evidence-important to any imaginable extent ; and the question of its reception is made to depend , not upon its truth-its materiality-its necessity to protect the rights of the party offering it-not upon the will of the judge before whom the cause is being tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be adversely affected thereby . The power over testimony is thus placed in the hands of the last person upon whom such authority should be conferred . The cases where consent is withheld , will ordinarily be , where this testimony is most especially needed . Now , because a party will not consent-does not wish to hear testimouy ,  --  what reason is that , why it should not be re // ceived ? If the wishes of the criminal or wrong-doer are to be consulted , what testimony adverse to his rights is there , to the reception of which he would consent ? The testimony of the wife , in the case of the husband , either received at his instance , or compelled at that of his opponent , will either coincide with or vary from his previously received testimony , if he has been a witness . If it coincides with it to that extent , provided the judge is satisfied of the integrity of such coincidence , additional and important testimony is received to strengthen conviction , and to render more stable the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that of the other , or is opposed thereto ; here then is a most important element in the final disposition of the cause , which , if the first received testimony were false , must be considered indispensable to correct decision . The now excluded testimony true and agreeing with the previously delivered testimony , gives additional weight to what had been thus received . Whether the husband has been or not a witness , the importance of the wife , either to the husband or to his antagonist , is precisely the same as that of any other witness of equal credibility . It in no manner depends upon whether the husband has previously testified or not . Exclude this testimony , you , to just such extent , take away from the judge of fact the means of rendering a just decision . Whether this testimony or any testimony will be true or not , can not be known in advance . The means of determining its truth can not exist before it is heard . When heard , then , first , the question of its truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the category of all false testimony ; if perceived , no evil ensues . That being false , its falsehood will be perceived , is as probable as that the falsehood of any testimony will be perceived . The objection stands no stronger against this , than against all testimony , for of all it is a contingency , that it may be false ; and if such contingency is a sufficient reason for rejection , it is so for all proof unless and except when the gift of fore-knowledge is granted to the judicial mind . He therefore , only , who can foreknow , is justified in excluding , lest , without such fore-knowledge , he may exclude the truth . What courts , seeking to do justice , of all things need , is the truth ; and we think little of that domestic felicity which would be destroyed by its utterance , or depends for its continuance upon its suppression . We regret , notwithstanding the modifications the commissioners have made upon the common law , that they should , to any extent , have clothed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make to his attorney . We consider this rule as one dishonorable and degrading to the legal profession , injurious to the public , and entirely unnecessary to a client for any proper and legitimate purpose . No especial and protected legal confidence is required , in the ordinary business relations of life . The relations of partners , of principal and agent , of banker and clerk , of trustee and cestui que trust , are of the most confidential nature , may require the highest degree of mutual confidence , may involve the greatest pecuniary interest ; yet , when needed for the purposes of judicial inquiry , communications ever so confidential are required to be disclosed . The secrets of friendship , the relations of par nt to child , of brother to sister , are not permitted to be withheld . Now , // the relation of attorney and client is purely a business relation , having neither the sacredness nor the mutual confidence of friendship nor of kindred , involving to be sure great pecuniary and personal interest , and in reference to which the attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all other cases , communications never so confidential , are compulsorily required , if supposed by the party requiring them to be necessary for the protection of his rights . The reason for the protection thus thrown over professional in preference to all other business communications , is for the alleged protection of the client , for " if not protected , no man would dare consult a professional adviser with a view to his defence or to the enforceme*it of his rights : and no man could safely come into court , either to obtain redress or to defend himself . " If the client is in the right , it is obvious that the communications he will make must be true-he could not safely , he would not dare do otherwise than to state the truth . Communications of false facts would endanger him . If then in the right , and making true communications to his attorney , he can not object to what , if communicated , would aid him . The wrong-doer alone will object , for he alone could suffer by untrue conirnunications he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for the purposes of correct decision , so far as that is concerned , it is entirely immaterial from whose lips they proceed . " No man would dare consult , " &amp;c . This would depend entirely upon what was to be communicated . As for all honest claims , as for all just defences , the client would have full power to communicate , and without fear or danger . The confidence between wrong-doers and their confidential advisers would be restricted or destroyed . The knave or criminal knowing that all disclosures he might make could be compulsorily extracted from his attorney , will withhold them . He may thus lessen his chance of escape , he may thus be crippled in his attempts at eluding justice . Is that a source of fear or regret ? The criminal and the knave will have accomplices , but is it desirable that they should thus be furnished with accomplices clothed with impunity  --  the recipients of dishonest secrets , and exempt from inquiry ? Were the rule entirely abolished , the relation , whenever it existed , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As will be perceived , we entirely coincide with every change so far as made ; our only regret is that they have not adhered to one simple ruleuniform admission of all , under all circumstances whatsoever . While thus no witness should be excluded , so no testimony , however inferior in trustworthiness , if of any force , and the only attainable proof , should be rejected . The best evidence should always be required- " not the best evidence of which the case in its nature is susceptible , " but the best evidence , which exists and is attainable . The theoretically best evidence may have ceased to exist , but that affords reason why resort should not he had to evidence inferior in degree , but still the best remaining . It is what the law does in many instances , and we see neither reason against , nor dangers in the extension of the rules of law so as to embrace cases not provided for " The act , or declaration , verbal or written , of a deceased person , in respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person related by blood or marriage to such deceased person : the act or declaration of a deceased person , done or made against his interest in respect to his real property : and also in criminal actions , the act or declaration of a dying person made under a sense of impending death , respecting the cause of his death : - 1704. // This , we believe , is substantially a provision of the common law , a wise one , unquestionably . It is one which has been acted upon for years , and no practical evil is asserted or known to have arisen from it . This kind of evidence , upon well-considered grounds , has been deemed admissible in reference to marriages , births , deaths ; the most important events in any man 's history , and upon which depend his property and social position . These declarations relate to facts most important in the legal consequences depending on them . But these are not the only facts-which become the subjects of judicial inquiry ; they are as numerous as the wants al ? d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in another cause , his letters , . his recollected and reported conversations , not sworn , not cross-examined , inferior in trustworthiness , because wanting in the ordinary securities for truth ; seen to be thus inferior , and consequently liable to deduction , are in existence , have an important bearing upon the cause on trial ; and the question occurs , shall they be received ? Whatever the reasons which render this sort of evidence admissible when the inquiry is in relation to the date or fact of a marriage , the birth or death of a child , they apply with equal urgency to the admission of any other fact . Is necessity the reason ? - it exists alike in each case . Is there any magic in the fact of birth , death , or marriage , by which the declarations of a deceased person , if made in reference to them , would be more likely to be true , than if made in reference to any other controverted fact ? So the declarations of dying persons are admitted in criminal cases , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted . Yet the dying man can hardly be supposed as entirely free from feelings of bitterness or ill-will against the author of his death . The testimony is **25;428;TOOLONG to all the dangers attendant upon such proof ; with the securities of oath or **26;455;TOOLONG the dying man may utter , received-whatever he may withhold , forever shrouded in the darkness of the grave . But notwithstanding all these objections , this proof is admitted . But it may happen that the blow of an assassin caused immediate deaththe only witness to that blow , on the bed of death , with instant dissolution before him , clearly and calmly narrates the facts which establish guilt . The dying man has no feeling of animosity to any one rankling in his bosom . Here , too , is no oath-no cross-examination  --  the deficiencies in that respect the same in each case ; still the declarations of the witness without feeling are rejected , while those of the witfiess with , are received . In the case of murder , if there be falsehood and conviction , and punishment following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cause may be civil-property on any amount may depend upon receiving proof of the declarations of a dying man ; the danger of this species of testimony , whatever it be , can never be equal where property is involved , to that where life is at stake : yet this evidence , inadmissible to establish the most insignificant right of property , is received without objection , when reputation and life are in peril . If . these various violations of the rules of la*w as to hearsay , none the less yiolations because termed exceptions , are found not merely not unobjectionable , but positively necessary and desirable , even in relation to the most important facts , what reason is there why the exception should not be enlarged into the rule , and no testimony , coming in the best attainable form , be excluded ? - that the best existing evidence should always be re* // ceived , notwithstanding there might , in some time past , have been better evidence , which has long since perished . We have now particularly called attention to the portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the reforms there proposed are of the highest moment . No branch of the law can compare with this in importance . Without evidence , or with bad rules , there can be no effectual administration of the law ; without it , the judge of fact is like the Israelite deprivedof straw ; rights of person and property are unprotected , and crime is unpunished . We had intended to have called attention to other portions of this important head , to the different rules of extraction , hardly inferior in importance to those of admission , to that perjurious mass of affidavit evidence pervading the whole texture of the law , infesting a cause during its whole progress , where , provided only the ordinary securities for truth are abandoned , the court receive and act upon testimony , which , at the next step in the progress of the cause , they will not listen to for a moment . To the equity mode of extracting proog by firing off written interrogatories and cross-interrogatories to a witness , closeted in some examiner 's office ; each question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without means of elucidating what may be doubtful , or rendering certain what may be equivocal , which the commissioners have for ever terminated by allowing , in all cases , viva voce testimony ; and , to have compared these miserably inefficient modes with that adopted before a jury ; a mode which , more than anything else , protects the rights of parties , and is the true reason why the trial by jury has so strong a hold on the affections of the people . But we fear we have already exhausted the patience of our readers . As a whole , the code will commend itself to the public , as one of those great works which have conferred so much honor on the Empire state . The great . canal of Clinton developed the material interests of the state ; but important as are those material interests , there is nothing that can compare in importance with a wise and liberal code of laws , ably and impartially administered . Such a code , after great labor and research , the commissioners have prepared ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their learning , and their ability .
