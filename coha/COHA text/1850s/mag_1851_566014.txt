txt ART . VI. - DOMESTJC ARCHITECTURE . The Architecture of Country Houses ; including Designs for Cottages , Farm Houses , and Villas , with remarks on Interiors , Furniture , and the best modes of Warming and Ventilating . With three hundred and twenty Illustrations . By A. J. DOWNING , author of " Designs for Cottage Residences , " " Hints to persons about building , " &amp;c . New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1850 . Ne*v Haven : T. II . Pease . Svo. pp. 484 . IT is only within comparatively a short period of time that the term Architecture has obtained a foothold in our general American vocabulary . Formerly we used to hear of house building and church building ; now we hear of domestic and ecclesiastical architecture . What our fathers knew no other name for than meeting-houses ' we speak of in these days as church edifices ; and the old homestead ' is fast becoming supplanted by the villa ' and the country seat . ' The word buildings now refers to nothing but barns and shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of phraseology is not , however , the result of accident or caprice . It betokens a change of ideas and the uprising of new convictions in the community at large . It indicates an advance in thought and feeling from a lower to a higher stage of development . It signifies that as a people we are rising above the physical condition of infancy and crudeness , that we are growing older and acquiring with increasing age increasing cul // ture and worth . And especially is it a thing of welcome significance , when we find the term in question applied so generally as it now is to the domestic in distinction from the more public structures of a people . It shows that the many are inclined to think , as never before , that the body is more than meat , and that a human being needs something in a residence besides the facilities for eating and sleep , and a shelter from the heat and cold . It indicates that the notion is becoming more widely and practically accepted that man is not a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also intellectual and spiritual faculties , in the due education and culture of which , life really consists as much as in the satisfaction of physical wants . It gives assurance that the domestic affections , the tastes , the pleasures of society , are getting a higher place in the estimation of men ; in short that the home feeling , that anchor to all that is good and virtuous , has a deeper hold upon the hearts of the multitude . And it is because the home feeling is worth so much , because it is a tie so strong and lasting , to bind us to what is loveliest and best , that we deem it a good omen when a changing nomenclature indicates such a change in ideas and feelings as we have just alluded to . We rejoice , therefore , at the multiplying evidence afforded that our people in this country are thinking more and thinking better of their dwellings , the structures within which so much of their life is passed and upon which the character and worth of that life so much depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material things , much less to set them above or before things spiritual . Man is a spiritual being , and his spiritual wants and enjoyments are of the first and highest consequence , and if these are not recognized and provided for , it matters very little what are the wants or delights dependent upon his physical structure or the material world in which he has his being . Nevertheless , inasmuch as his spiritual nature is linked to a material structure , he is dependent upon it and upon the material universe with which it brings him into connection for the culture and development of his higher and spiritual part . T he world of ideas , thoughts and feelings , is most intimately connected with the world of matter , and the former world will take its tone and shape very much from the latter . And as this is different in the case of every individual , so each one may be said to form to himself his ideal or spiritual world from the particular physical world in which he lives . While therefore , the outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward and immaterial , man has it also in his power to determine , in a measure certainly , what this influence shall be . The time comes when the spiritual reacts upon the material and asserts its inherent superiority . The time arrives when the mind instead of lying in a state of mere mechanical reception assumes an active // and voluntary condition in which it chooses , to some extent at least , what it will receive from the material world around it . By its own creative power , too , it begins to re*nstamp its own ideas , modified and ct.iltured by reflection and experience , upon the world without . Jt lays hold of the earth and its material forms and substances , and shapes them at its will . It bridges the mighty streams ; it tunnels the mountains ; it levels the hills and lifts up the valleys ; it raises everywhere the structures which minister to its will and convenience and happiness ; and so , really creates the physical world anew . Thus , mankind come to live in a better world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now only in the lowest sense the same world that it was at the opening of the present century . It has indeed the same geological strata ; it has the same great rivers and bays and oceans ; the same Alpine peaks , the same wide deserts and the same enveloping atmosphere . But in respect to its bearing upon human life , in the large and general view , it is as if another world had come to take its place . And so , too , men have it in their power to change and are changing that smaller material world in which the domestic life of each one is led . From caves in the mountain side , and tents and huts of the rudest construction , they have come to dwell in structures better calculated to satisfy arid cultivate the advancing ideas and tastes of advancing civilization and those inspired by the influence of religion . The importance of this home world is probably felt at the present day more deeply than ever before . The more enlightened portion of mankind are recognizing too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life which is comprehended within the limits of infancy and childhood . They are discovering how much it has to do with all the after life , whether considered in its material and social relations to the present world or in its spiritual relations to the world to come . And they are seeing as they never have seen until now , how much the place of a child 's residence has to do with a child 's character . They are discovering herein the possibility of a better life even from the outset of existence than was once acknowledged or even suspected . Still , however , there is room for improvement and further progress . Few have yet fathomed the great problem of human life . Few understand it whether restricted to early or more mature age , whether in its connection with this world or a world to come . We are at best but making advances toward the full and complete truth . We are experimenting in the great laboratory of existence , and as the result of many failures and a partial success , are settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery , therefore , should be welcomed , arid every instrument of progress be laid hold of as a help to the grand ultimate attainment . // It is in this view a hopeful sign that attention has of late been turned as it has , particularly in this country , to the subject of Domestic Architecture . For some years now there have been occasional signs of rebellion against the old stereotyped ideas and habits that have so long prevailed on this subject , and already a very perceptible change is beginning to be wrought in the style and character of our domestic edifices . Our dwellings hitherto , with exceptions of course , have not been what human dwellings should be . They have not been the fittest places by any means for the birth and nurture of human beings , of beings endowed with faculties which lift them so high above the range of the animal races around them . They have been too exclusively calculated to satisfy the wants of the animal part of man 's compound nature , and have had far too little adaptation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his social and spiritual nature . They have been great eating and sleeping places , barns for human beings ; and too often indeed the difference between the places occupied by the quadrupeds and the bipeds has not been as manifest as it should have been . The home affections and the more refined feelings and tastes which belong to our nature have flourished in such cases , if at all , in spite of circumstances most adverse and repressing . And even in many dwellings where all has not borne the stamp of an animal nature , how little has there been oftentimes in the structure of the dwelling and in its furnishing and surroundings , to call forth and cultivate the better feelings and faculties of the inmates . Where have been the visible material signs of taste and refinement ? Where , the manifest indications of a proper understanding of the true aim and character of life , and wherein its real importance and happiness consist ? How much has been lavished upon the body , and how little provided for the mind and soul . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestral hearth . How little has there been to make their eyes kindle with delight as they have rested upon the paternal mansion , because in its every aspect it has borne the look of comfort which was but the proper outward expression of the real comfort , and means of comfort also , abounding within . How little has there been to make the home more attractive than the tavern . Now we are not so wild as to think but that a dwelling constructed with even the most consummate architectural skill and propriety , may be as destitute of the proper attractions and good influences which belong to a true home as the meanest hovel to be found . And yet we do not think it could long remain so . We believe it would educate its inhabitants , generation by generation , until in process of time it would be found to have begotten in them in a good degree the appropriate refinements and tastes , in short the home feelings which rightfully belong in such a place and are in keeping with // it . We claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social culture . We think a tastefully constructed house tends to call forth tasteful feelings in its inmates , and in those also who see it more casually and from a distance . Those material forms which it hears , patterned after the choicest forms which God has set forth in nature , and expressive of human wants and purposes and aspirations , we believe to be permanent instructors to man . It may be difficult to trace by exact lines or in precise and definite results their teachings , but we think no reflecting person will deny their power to this end . No man , we think , could live just the life in a well proportioned and truly beautiful dwelling that he would in a mud shanty or a rude log cabin . Certain elevating influences would steal into him unawares , and from a hundred different sources , that would lift his life above its otherwise lower level . It would be made , unconsciously perhaps , more human , more dignified and tasteful , more receptive of high and hallowed thoughts , and more open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , this power of the tasteful is seen very often in the influence which a single dwelling will exert upon almost all in its neighborhood . How often , for instance , may you trace the better features in the houses of a whole street , or village everi , to the grounds and dwellings of a single tasteful proprietor . Nor do we allude in this to the mere copying of things from a love of imitation or from a weak anibition to keep pace with others in show or gentility , but we refer to the well known fact that where there is such an exhibition of genuine taste , men will he impressed by it . It will waken new thoughts and feelings within them , and they will sooner or later be found embodying them in their own mode and outward manifestation of life . They may do it imperfectly , they may do it clumsily and grotesquely . But what they do even thus has a true basis to start from , and that which is true will exert a lasting power . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it will prove as important a means of instruction perhaps as what is better . Between the imperfectly tasteful instincts and the ambition of display and notoriety , we must of course expect many extravagances . But if some one imports a Turkish mosque with its lancet windows and minarets and domes into a New England town , the probability is that his very extravagance will operate to check the budding eccentricities of those who see it , a*idso save us many an eye sore . Ambition , the love of display , the very common unwillingness to be outdone by others , will probably build many paste-board castles for country seats . These we must expect ; these we must for a while suffer . But even these will do good . It will not be long before their inappropriateness will be seen and their lack of propriety in style felt , and then they will be used as so many beacons to warn against the repeti // tion of their errors . Meanwhile every structure which is conformed to the laws of tasteful propriety and which stands forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition to the common stock of knowledge and happiness . Every good house , therefore , every house which is what a house should be , is a public good . It is the embodiment and expression of ideas which the mass of men need to have set before them , and ideas which have a direct bearing upon human welfare . The tendencies in our depraved condition are so strong toward mere animalism of feeling and habit , that every influence which tends to lift us above such feelings and habits deserves to be welcomed , and while therefore we would not set forth architecture as a means of grace , ' in the ordinary acceptation of that term , we do nevertheless believe it to be no unimportant auxiliary to those peculiarly gracious influences which God has l ) roVided for human redemption . While knowledge may be perverted , and the most consummate cultivation which education can bestow xviii not suffice to regenerate a sinful man , still as a general truth it will hold that whateve* tends to elevate and refine , tends also to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We trust , therefore , that we shall not seem to be overestimating a matter when , as those who profess to be concerned for the highest and truest welfare of man , we advocate the claims of Architecture upon the attention of men . In this view of the matter , also , we rejoice to see architecture gaining the place of a profession . This is as it should be . There is as good reason why every man should be his own lawyer as why every man should be his own builder . It seems to many no doubt that the administration of justice between man and man is not necessarily other than a plain and simple matter , but the long experience of the world has found it to be quite otherwise , and no one whose observation fits him to judge in the case would be willing to dispense with the Bench or the Bar . So to most men it seems a very simple business to build a house . And yet few probably ever contrived even a barn without discovering by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economically and with a better regard to convenience and usefulness than as they had planned it . Much more is it true that few , who have not made the matter their special study , are qualified to design a dwelling house . You mnay go into any of our large cities for instance , where the high price of land compels men to build upon a comparatively small surface area , and where there is of necessity a general similarity of internal arrangement in the dwellings erected , and yet you will hear it as the almost unanimous declaration of those who have engaged in building , either for their own family occupation or for the purpose of renting to others , that one needs to build at least three times in // order to secure a tolerably satisfactory result . Indeed , nothing is more common , in country or city , than the expression of disappointment on the part of those who have made the experiment of building a house after their own contrivance . there are a hundred if not a thousand matters of detail to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all important to the finished result , yet every one of them contributes its part to form the perfect whole , and even a few of them , neglected or overlooked , may rob all the rest of their value and seriously mar the completed structure . These mistakes , too , in *vood and brick and stone , are not to be remedied , like a blunder in manners , by an apology . Once committed , they abide and perpetuate their discomfort and annoyance . And no man can hope to avoid making blunders of this lasting and mortifying character , who does not make buildin his study . As a matter of pecuniary economy also , it is desirable that we should have a class of men whose profession it is to design and superintend the erection of dwellings and other buildings . They are the ones of all to secure the greatest amount of conveniences within a given space , and making the whole matter of building their daily care , they are the best fitted to decide upon the character and quality of materials to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from such a class of men only that we can expect the most judicious and truly economical expenditure of money , for the purpose of accomplishing a desired result . Here and there , indeed , a person will arise with a genius capable of mastering the requisite details and applying the general principles of science and taste in the construction of buildings , without any preliminary course of study and in spite of occupations which may confine his attention for the most part to very different matters . So there sometimes comes along a Natural Bone-setter ' who is supposed at least to understand the laws of anatomy by intuition . But who on this account thinks of abolishing colleges of Surgery or of dispensing with the Medical Profession ? We are glad , therefore , that the growing taste of our people is giving employment to a class of men who make Architecture a profession , as truly such as Law or Medicine . We hope the public will so appreciate their work as to make their profession a field wide enough to employ many more than are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who enter it to go deeply into the history and philosophy of architecture , and so provide for coming generations models of domestic , as well as civil structures , which will do much for the true welfare and happiness of the multitudes whose eyes are to rest upon them , and whose tastes and habits are to be sensibly affected by them . Closely allied to the work of the architect , if it may not be considered a branch of it , is that of the writer upon the smThject , // when he has mastered the principles of the matter upon which he treats . Indeed , he has one advantage over the mere practical architect , in being able to express his opinions with more care and deliberation , and in being able to convey them , by means of the press , to many who would otherwise be deprived of access to him and be prevented from availing themselves of his know ledge . This leads us to the consideration of a volume , the title of which is at the head of this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same author , has marked an era in the bibliographic history of our country . What further remarks we have to make in regard to the general subject , we shall throw into the form of a notice of this book . Mr. Downing has here given us a work which would much more appropriately appear as a volume of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge ' than that thin quarto of Robert Dale Owen , the chief value of which appears to be in its showing what book makers can do with clean cut type and fine paper , and in giving , by means of its engravings , to those who are not likely to visit the city of Washington , some idea of a structure which has arisen there as a monument to the generous liberality of a foreigner . In the volume now before us , on the contrary , we have something of a different sort , a book not to be laid away upon the shelves of public libraries , or to be distributed according to the judgment or caprice of a publishing or executive committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Maine to Oregon , who are willing to pay a reasonable price for it . It is not either , as many perhaps would judge from its title , a book designed for the comparatively few who are about to engage in the work of building , but it is a book for the many , for all indeed , whether in city or country , who have a house to live in . It is an attempt to set forth the architectural principles , and , to no small extent , the laws of taste which are applicable to domestic life . Aside from its mere designs , which constitute by no means its chief value , its principles and suggestions are alike adapted to domestic life everywhere . The book is eminently a contribution to knowledge , ' a contribution of just such knowledge as is wanted , and the general communication of which to the minds of our wide spread population would accomplish an inestimable service . We thank the author for this , his most recent work , and accept it gratefully as another gift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public benefactor . If he had lived in old Rome and done as important a service as he has done for us , the Senate would have honored him with a vote , " that he had deserved well of the Republic . " Mr. Downing has sent forth his book bearing the very modest title , " Country Houses , " and those who have not made themselves acquainted with the volume will be likely to gather from // its name that it has to do chiefly , if not exclusively , with the abodes of our mere farmers , and is occupied with suggestions in regard to the construction of farm houses and barns , dairy-rooms and cattle-stalls . This is far from being the case . Mr. Downing is one of those who accept the saying , " God made the country and man made the town ; " and who consequently regards the open fields , in distinction from the narrow closes of the city , as the place for true living , arid where Domestic Architecture is to have the theater of her labors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when our author treats of Country Houses , he treats of all dwellings which have their location without the range of the inspectors of streets and sewers . From the humblest home of the cottager upon some scarcely known hill-side to the baronial mansion that flanks the majestic Hudson nor suffers by any want of keeping there , the book now under consideration has something appropriate to every site and to every structure pertaining to the dwelling-place of man . Nor is the author 's attention confined to the mere architecture of these various edifices . Beginning with the principles which should guide in the selection of a site , and embracing not only the general style of architecture , but the more particular arrangements both of the grounds without and the furniture within , his attention is directed to all that pertains to the material comforts of home . No one , indeed , who is conversant with the previous writings of the author would expect anything less than such a work as this from him . He has made Rural Architecture and Landscape Gardening , or the proper disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar province ; and where he leads , the many may follow without hesitation . His book is all the more valuable and trustworthy also , inasmuch as Mr. Downing is not a professional architect nor a practical builder , and so does not advertise his own wares or offer his services to the building public for hire . He simply comes forward , after much study and experience in regard to the subject of domestic life and dwelling-places , to present certain practical suggestions in regard to it . Having no theory to advance , and no particular order of architecture to defend or glorify , he comes as the general adviser of his fellow men in regard to that which intimately concerns their comfort . He begins his book with a preface assigning " Three excellent reasons why my country-men should have good houses . " rrhe first is , " Because a good house ( and by this I mean a fitting , tasteful , arid significant dwelling ) is a powerful means of civilization . " The second is , " Because the individual home has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reason , he makes the following declaration which is well worth considera // tion . " It is the solitude and frcedom of the family home in the country which constantly preserves the purity of the nation , and invigorates its intellectual powers . The battle of life , carried on in cities , gives a sharper edge to the weapon of character , but its temper is , for the most part , fixed amid those communings with nature and the family , where individuality takes its most natural and strongest development . " The third reason offered is , " Because there is a moral influence in a country home-when , among an educated , truthful and refined people , it is an echo of their character-which is more powerful than any mere oral teachings of virtue and morality . " Our author proceeds to remark farther , " That family , whose religion lies away from its threshold , will show but slender results from the best teachings , compared with another where the family hearth is made a central point of the Beautiful and the Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance between the desire and the fulfillment of life , is calmed and adjusted by the pursuit of tastes which result in making a little world of the family home , where truthfulness , beatity and order have the largest dominion . The mere sentiment of home with its thousand associations , has , like a strong anchor , saved many a man from shipwreck in the storms of life . For this reason , the condition of the family home-in this country where every man may have a home-should he raised , till it shall symbolize the best character and pursuits , and the dearest affections and enjoyments of social life . " Our readers wilt see from these liberal extracts from a preface of but moderate length , the drift and aim of the author without the necessity of further explanation on our part . Passing then at once to his subject , Mr. Downing enters upon an inquiry into " The real meaning of Architecture . " In the prosecution of this , he discusses at some length the philosophy of the art , the relation which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points which naturally arise . Want of space alone induces us to refrain from giving our readers a specimen of the author 's treatment of this part of his subject . After this general disquisition , Mr. Downing divides the various styles of houses of which he proposes to treat more specifically , into three ; Cottages , Farm-houses , and Villas . He defines a cottage to be " A dwelling of small size , intended for the occupation of a family , either wholly managing the household cares itself , or , at the most , with the assistance of one or two servants . " Very properly , therefore , he insists that the cottage shall not ape the villa , but shall be kept within its just limits , and that it shall express the simple tastes and habits , and the limited means of the class by whom it is occupied . The disposition , not uncommon in our aspiring and sanguine countrymen , to go beyond their means in the construction of their dwellings , is here as elsewhere // throughout the volume before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves tio little credit for refusing , as he constantly does , to eucourage even tasteful extravagancies . His principle is : first count the cost ; then consider your ability ; then obtain as much as possible of convenience or utility in your dwelling ; then , and not till then , procure whatsoever of beauty and embellishment is warranted by your means and will be in harmony with your tastes . Every discriminating person will admit without hesitation that this is the proper principle . No one has a right on the plea of style or taste , or on any other plea , to live beyond his means . And if our mechanics and tradesmen just beginning life , as it is termed , or any in moderate , that is , ordinary , circumstances as to pecuniary ability , will consult Mr. Doxvning and those like him , they will find that very limited pecuniary resources are sufficient to secure a dwellinb that will satisfy their necessities and minister to their comfort as no pasteboard villa or girigerb read castle ever could . We can not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work before us . But we should like to point the industrious day-laborer , who seeks with the setting sun his humble dwelling in the suburbs of some city , to the cottage plan for instance , on the 129th page of this book , and show him how , with hardly the additional expense of a dollar , a little good taste would give him , with even his slender means , a house which for convenience and simple beauty might vie with any that wealth could erect , and which would be as the bright evening star of his daily life of toil to light him to the cheering and elevating comforts of a true home . Our author very naturally has a chapter devoted to the consideration of " Materials and Modes of construction ; " in which he insists upon the stiperior value and propriety of the more solid materials in the construction of houses of whatever class . And we can not but think that the time has come when our people should adopt a more solid material fdr building purposes than they have generally used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber is actually in the way of the most necessary agricultural labor , it is to be expected that the dwellings of a people will be constructed of this material . But with us this necessity , as it may almost be called , exists no longer , and it is well worth considering whether it is not best for us to give our dwellings a look of more substantial and enduring comfort , by the use of a more substantial material in their construction . The consideration of permanence is no unimportant element in the true idea of home . A true economy also , we think , would lead to the adoption of a more solid material than wood for the walls of our dwellings . But we can not enlarge upon this point . // Following the author 's remarks upon cottages we find a chapter of " Miscellaneous Details , " which , to any one who is about to undertake the work of building , though in ever so humble a style , is worth more than the cost of the book . What Mr. Downing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwellingsthe farm-houses and the villas-it will not be important for us to consider at length after the notice we have already taken of his general scope . In his chapters on the furnishing of houses , however , he has opened a new subject to general consideration . rpreatises upon furniture and its arrangement , have not been uncommon on the other side of the Atlantic , but , so far as we know , this is the first attempt to set forth the matter in this country . It is 1 ) 0 unimportant subject , however , nor is a treatise upon it undeserving our attention . On the contrary , we are sure that a perusal of our author 's remarks would be of service to almost any housekeeper . As Mr. Downing has shown the man of slender means how he may have a tasteful cottage , architecturally considered , so here he shows him that he can furnish it properly and even attractively without any outlay of money beyond his ability . The book closes with some extended remarks upon " Warming and Ventilating ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of valuable information upon these subjects in an equal space . The question of the best mode of warming dwellings is one which has great interest to the mass of our people . We may safely say in regard to our country as a whole , that , for at least six months of the year , we are under the necessity of resorting to artificial warmth , in order to make our dwellings comfortable . Of course the question how this warmth shall be obtained is one of prime importance to every housekeeper . Nor is it to most persons , a question of less importance , considered economically , than it is in its bearing upon comfort . But this question is not simply that of obtaining the greatest amount of heat at the smallest cost . Many have seemed to consider it so , and their mistake has been a most injurious one . They have left out an element , and that a most important one , in the real question presented for solution . rrhat question , a question set before us for solution by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost the requisite warmth in consistency with the physiological laws of our being . Leaving out this latter part of the question , we have had men , making some pretensions even to a knowledge of the laws of natural philosophy , who have undertaken to warm human beings as they would bake biscuit in a tin oven at the cost of only three cents worth of charcoal ! Air tight stoves have been made , by which it is professed that two sticks of wood will be almost as serviceable as a quarter of a cord under the old arrangement of things . You have only to shut the damper after // the fuel is once ignited , and have the windows carefully caulked so as to be air-tight too , and then you may sit arid swell and toast and grow delightfully brown and all at the cost of only a few cents a day . Yes , and what is more , you may become air-tight yourself also , getting bronchitis , asthma , an unpleasant stagnation of the blood in the lungs and divers other equally agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pathies are in demand and that drug shops are multiplying . But seriously , we are beginning to find that we may warm ourselves at the expense of health though at a saving of the pocket . Yet that saving is only for the present . Better far to pay a few dollars extra for fuel now than to be obliged to pay many extra dollars by-and-by for doctors , nurses , plasters and pills . Those open fire-places and Franklin stoves of former days , with the bright shining fire and the family drawn up around it , were a source of comfort and of real social profit too , which we already have but in memory , and which our children will know hardly otherwise than as a matter of history . The open grate , however , is still left us , and the furnace is now brought within the means of almost all . These , with a proper care , provide the requisite heat without violating the laws of life ; but as for stoves , we feel little disposed to thank more than one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our aged people for an open fire-place , where they can see the glowing coals and the leaping flame , is a most amiable fondness , and we trust their sons will inherit it , and indulge it so long as any thing of our forests remains . At any rate , we hope they will abjure ovens and biscuit baking except in the kitchen . We commend Mr. Downing 's concluding chapter as an admirable treatise upon the whole subject of warming and ventilation , and hope that it will not be without profit to the public that he has written as he has . Our readers can not fail to conclude , even from our desultory and imperfect notice of the book before us , that it is a valuable addition to the stock of reading , and promises to do much for the social welfare of those who may come in contact with it . Mr. Downing has here aimed to show how much of genuine comfort can be had within the compass of a very humble dwelling as to cost and pretension , such a dwelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to command . At the same time he has tindertaken to set forth the principles of taste and truth which have their application to the most costly and elaborate structures . He has given advice suited to the circumstances and wants of almost all who are , or are likely to be , concerned with the important business of house building . And we feel bound to say that this advice is eminently sensible throughout . We are glad that such a man as Mr. Downing has been moved to take the subject of architecture in hand and bring it before the public in its practical // relations to human comfort . There is in all his writings a sirnplicity , a regard for sterling truth and honesty , a love of the beautiful in nature and an earnest desire to promote the welfare of his fellow men , which entitle him to the regard of all , and make him a valuable counsellor . The book which he has now given us , the J ) professional builders will of course possess . It is also set forth with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it a proper ornament of the parlor table , and fit it to claim a place on any book-shelf . We would suggest whether a cheaper edition would not get into the hands of a larger class of readers than the present one is likely to reach , and that class who most need and would be most benefited by its instructions . Meanwhile , we will conclude by expressing the hope that when Mr. Downing returns from his visit to Europe , enriched as he will be by the observation of its architectural beatity , he will give us a volume upon the proper structure of school houses and churches , a class of buildings in which we are more defective if possible than in our dxvellings.
