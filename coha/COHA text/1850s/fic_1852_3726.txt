THE DOLL AND HER FRIENDS ; OR Memoirs of the Lady Seraphina . BY THE AUTHOR OF " LETTERS FROM MADRAS , " " HISTORICAL CHARADES , " ETC . ETC . WITH FOUR ILLUSTRATIONS BY HABLOT K. BROWNE , ENGRAVED BY BAKER AND SMITH . BOSTON : TICKNOR , REED , AND FIELDS . MDCCCLII . PRINTED BY THURSTON , TORRY , AND EMERSON . PREFACE . My principal intention , or rather aim , in writing this little Book , was to amuse Children by a story founded on one of their favorite diversions , and to inculcate a few such minor morals as my little plot might be strong enough to carry ; chiefly the domestic happiness produced by kind tempers and consideration for others . And further , I wished to say a word in favor of that good old-fashioned plaything , the Doll , which one now sometimes hears decried by sensible people who have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CHAPTER I. I belong to a race , the sole end of whose existence is to give pleasure to others . None will deny the goodness of such an end , and I flatter myself most persons will allow that we amply fulfil it . Few of the female sex especially but will acknowledge , with either the smile or the sigh called forth by early recollections , that much of their youthful happiness was due to our presence ; and some will even go so far as to attribute to our influence many a habit of housewifery , neatness , and industry , which ornaments their riper years . But to our influence , our silent , unconscious influence alone , can such advantages be ascribed ; for neither example nor precept are in our power ; our race can not boast of intellectual endowments ; and though there are few qualities , moral or mental , that have not in their turn been imputed to us by partial friends , truth obliges me to confess that they exist rather in the minds of our admirers than in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some might even call us slaves . Unable to change our place , or move hand or foot at our own pleasure , and forced to submit to every caprice of our possessors , we can not be said to have even a will of our own . But every condition has its share of good and evil , and I have often considered my helplessness and dependence as mere trifles compared with the troubles to which poor sensitive human beings are subject . Pain , sickness , or fatigue I never knew . While a fidgetty child can not keep still for two minutes at a time , I sit contentedly for days together in the same attitude ; and I have before now seen one of those irritable young mortals cry at a scratch , while I was hearing needles drawn in and out of every part of my body , or sitting with a pin run straight through my heart , calmly congratulating myself on being free from the inconveniences of flesh and blood . Of negative merits I possess a good share . I am never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisy , nor intrusive ; and though I and my fellows can not lay claim to brilliant powers either in word or deed , we may boast of the same qualifications as our wittiest king , for certainly none of us ever ' said a foolish thing , ' if she ' never did a wise one . ' Personal beauty I might almost , without vanity , call the ' badge of all our tribe . ' Our very name is seldom mentioned without the epithet pretty ; and in my own individual case I may say that I have always been considered pleasing and elegant , though others have surpassed me in size and grandeur . But our most striking characteristic is our power of inspiring strong attachment . The love bestowed on us by our possessors is proof against time , familiarity , and misfortune : ' Age can not wither ' us , ' nor custom stale ' Our ' infinite variety . ' With no trace of our original beauty left ,  - -  dress in tatters , complexion defaced , features undistinguishable , our very limbs mutilated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not seen one of us still the delight and solace of some tender young heart ; the confidant of its fancies , and the soother of its sorrows ; preferred to all newer claimants , however high their pretensions ; the still unrivalled favorite , in spite of the laughter of the nursery and the quiet contempt of the schoolroom ? Young and gentle reader , your sympathy or your sagacity has doubtless suggested to you my name . I am , as you guess , a DOLL ; and though not a doll of any peculiar pretensions , I flatter myself that my life may not be quite without interest to the young lovers of my race , and in this hope I venture to submit my memoirs to your indulgent consideration . I am but a small doll ; not one of those splendid specimens of wax , modelled from the Princess Royal , with distinct fingers and toes , eyes that shut , and tongues that wag . No ; such I have only contemplated from a respectful distance as I lay on my stall in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toys , the wonder and admiration of every passing child . I am not even one of those less magnificent , but still dignified , leathern-skinned individuals , requiring clothes to take off and put on , and a cradle to sleep in , with sheets , blankets , and every thing complete . Neither can I found my claim to notice upon any thing odd or unusual in my appearance : I am not a negro doll , with wide mouth and woolly hair ; nor a doll with a gutta-percha face , which can be twisted into all kinds of grimaces . I am a simple English doll , about six inches high , with jointed limbs and an enamel face , a slim waist and upright figure , an amiable smile , and intelligent eye , and hair dressed in the first style of fashion . I never thought myself vain , but I own that in my youth I did pique myself upon my hair . There was but one opinion about that . I have often heard even grown-up people remark , ' How ingeniously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely it is arranged ! ' while at the same time my rising vanity was crushed by the insinuation that I had an absurd smirk or a ridiculous stare . However , the opinions of human beings of mature age never much disturbed me . The world was large enough for them and me ; and I could contentedly see them turn to their own objects of interest , while I awaited in calm security the unqualified praise of those whose praise alone was valuable to me -- their children and grand-children . I first opened my eyes to the light in the Pantheon Bazaar . How I came there I know not ; my conscious existence dates only from the moment in which a silver-paper covering was removed from my face , and the world burst upon my view . A feeling of importance was the first that arose in my mind . As the hand that held me turned me from side to side , I looked about . Dolls were before me , dolls behind , and dolls on each side . For a considerable time I could see nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by degrees , as my powers of vision strengthened , my horizon extended , and I perceived that portions of space were allotted to many other objects . I descried , at various distances , aids to amusements in endless succession ,  - -  balls , bats , battledores , boxes , bags , and baskets ; carts , cradles , and cups and saucers . I did not then know any thing of the alphabet , and I can not say that I have quite mastered it even now ; but if I were learned enough , I am sure I could go from A to Z , as initial letters of the wonders with which I soon made acquaintance . Not that I at once became aware of the uses , or even the names , of all I saw . No one took the trouble to teach me ; and it was only by dint of my own intense observation that I gained any knowledge at all . I did not at first even know that I was a doll . But I made the most of opportunities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings . Their powers of motion made a decided difference between them and the other surrounding objects , and naturally my attention was early turned towards the actions of the shopwoman on whose stall I lived . She covered me and my companions with a large cloth every night , and restored the daylight to us in the morning . We were all perfectly helpless without her , and absolutely under her control . At her will the largest top hummed , or was silent ; the whip cracked , or lay harmlessly by the side of the horse . She moved us from place to place , and exhibited or hid us at her pleasure ; but she was always so extremely careful of our health and looks , and her life seemed so entirely devoted to us and to our advantage , that I often doubted whether she was our property or we hers . Her habits varied so little from day to day , that after watching her for a reasonable time , I felt myself perfectly acquainted with her , and in a condition to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady and a little girl stopped at our stall . ' Oh , what a splendid doll , ' exclaimed the child , pointing to the waxen beauty which outshone the rest of our tribe . It was the first time I had heard the word Doll , though I was well acquainted with the illustrious individual to whom it was applied ; and it now flashed upon my mind , with pride and pleasure , that , however insignificant in comparison , I too was a doll . But I had not time to think very deeply about my name and nature just then , as I wished to listen to the conversation of the two human beings . ' May I buy her ? ' said the little girl . ' Can you afford it ? ' asked the lady in return . ' Remember your intentions for your brother . ' ' Perhaps I have money enough for both , ' answered the child . ' How much does she cost ? ' ' Seven shillings , ' said the shopwoman , taking the doll from her place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost advantage . ' I have three half-crowns , ' said the little girl . ' But if you spend seven shillings on the doll , ' answered the lady , ' you will only have sixpence left for the paint-box . ' ' What does a paint-box cost ? ' asked the child . ' We have them of all prices , ' replied the shopkeeper ; ' from sixpence to seven shillings . ' The little girl examined several with great care , and stood some time in deliberation ; at last she said , ' I do n't think Willy would like a sixpenny one . ' ' It would be of no use to him , ' answered the lady . ' He draws well enough to want better colors . If you gave it to him , he would thank you and try to seem pleased , but he would not really care for it . However , he does not know that you thought of making him a birthday present , so you are at liberty to spend your money as you like . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' asked the little girl . ' Yes ; that is exactly what he wants . ' ' Then he shall have it , ' exclaimed the good-natured little sister . ' Poor dear Willy , how many more amusements I have than he ! ' She bought the best paint-box , and received sixpence in change . ' Is there any thing else I can show you ? ' asked the shopkeeper . ' No , thank you , ' she replied ; and turning to the elder lady , she said , ' May we go home at once , Mama ? It would take me a long time to choose what I shall spend my sixpence in , and I should like to give Willy his paint-box directly . ' ' By all means , ' answered the lady ; ' we will lose no time ; and I will bring you again to spend the sixpence whenever you please . ' Without one backward glance towards the beautiful doll , the child tripped away by the side of her companion , looking the brightest and happiest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long I can not say , for dolls are unable to measure time , they can only date from any particularly striking epochs . For instance , we can say , ' Such an affair happened before I lost my leg ; ' or , ' Such an event took place before my new wig was put on ; ' but of the intricate divisions known to mortals by the names of hours , days , months , &c.,; we have no idea . However , I meditated on the kind little sister during what appeared to me a long but not tedious period , for I was gratified at gaining some insight into the qualities proper to distinguish the human race . Readiness to show kindness , and a preference of others ' interests to her own , were virtues which I easily perceived in the little girl 's conduct ; but one thing perplexed me sadly . I could not understand why a doll would not have answered her kind intentions as well as a paint-box ; why could she not have bought the doll which she admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My thoughts were still engaged with this subject , when a boy approached the stall . Boys were new characters to me , and I was glad of the opportunity to observe one . He did not bestow a look on the dolls and other toys , but asked for a box of carpenter 's tools . The shopkeeper dived into some hidden recess under the counter , and produced a clumsy-looking chest , the merits of which I could not discover ; but the boy pronounced it to be ' just the thing , ' and willingly paid down its price . I followed him with my eyes as he walked about with his great box under his arm , looking from side to side , till he caught sight of another boy rather younger than himself , advancing from an opposite corner . ' Why , Geoffrey , ' exclaimed my first friend , ' where have you been all this time ? I have been hunting every where for you . ' Geoffrey did not immediately answer , his mouth being , as I perceived , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , ' Will you have a cheesecake ? ' ' No , thank you , ' replied his friend . ' We must go home to dinner so soon , that you will scarcely have time to choose your things . Where have you been ? ' ' At the pastrycook 's stall , ' answered Geoffrey ; ' and I must go back again before I can buy any thing . I left my five shillings there to be changed . ' The boys returned together to the stall , and I saw its mistress hand a small coin to Geoffrey . ' Where is the rest ? ' said he . ' That is your change , sir , ' she replied . ' Why , you do n't mean that those two or three tarts and jellies cost four and sixpence ! ' he exclaimed , turning as red as the rosiest doll at my side . ' I think you will find it correct , sir , ' answered the shopkeeper . ' Two jellies , sixpence each , make one shilling ; two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ginger-beer , threepence , two and threepence ; one raspberry cream , sixpence , two and ninepence ; three gooseberry tarts , threepence , three shillings ; two strawberry tarts , three and twopence ; two raspberry ditto , three and fourpence ; four cheesecakes , three and eightpence ; two Bath buns , four shillings ; and one lemon ice , four and sixpence . ' ' What a bother ! ' said Geoffrey , as he pocketed the small remains of his fortune . ' I wish I could give her some of the tarts back again , for they were n't half so nice as they looked , except just the first one or two . ' ' Because you were only hungry for the first one or two , ' said the other boy . ' But it ca n't be helped now ; come and spend the sixpence better . ' ' There wo n't be any thing worth buying for sixpence , ' said Geoffrey gloomily , as he shuffled in a lazy manner towards my stall . ' I want a spade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost two shillings or half-a-crown . There were little wooden spades for sixpence ; but from those he turned with contempt , saying they were only fit for babies . Nothing at our table suited him , and he walked towards our opposite neighbour , who sold books , maps , &c.; On his asking for a dissected map , all the countries of the world were speedily offered to his choice ; but alas ! the price was again the obstacle . The cheapest map was half-a-crown ; and Geoffrey 's sixpence would buy nothing but a childish puzzle of Old Mother Hubbard . Geoffrey said it was a great shame that every thing should be either dear or stupid . ' Ca n't you lend me some money , Ned ? ' continued he . ' I ca n't , indeed , ' replied the other ; ' mine all went in this box of tools . Suppose you do n't spend the sixpence at all now , but keep it till you get some more . ' ' No , I wo n't do that ; I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from stall to stall , asking the price of every thing , as if his purse was as full as his stomach . ' How much is that sailor kite ? ' ' Two shillings , sir . '  - -  'How much is that bat ? ' ' Seven and sixpence . '  - -  'How much is that wooden box with secret drawer ? ' ' Three shillings . ' ' How provoking ! ' he exclaimed . ' I want heaps of things , and this stupid sixpence is no good at all . ' ' It is better than nothing , ' said Edward . ' It is not every day that one 's aunt sends one five shillings , to spend in the bazaar ; and in common times sixpence is not to be despised . After all , there are plenty of things it will buy . Do you want a top ? ' ' No ; I 've got four . ' ' Garden seeds ? ' ' What is the use of them , when I ca n't get a spade ? ' ' Steel pens ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' I do n't like buying those kind of things with my own money . ' ' A box ? Yesterday you wanted a box . ' ' I do n't care for boxes that wo n't lock , and I ca n't get one with a lock and key for sixpence . ' ' A knife ? ' ' Sixpenny knives have only one blade ; I want two . ' ' Sealing-wax ? wafers ? a penholder ? a paint-box ? India-rubber ? pencils ? ' ' Stupid things ! ' ' A ball ? You might have a very good ball . ' ' Not a cricket ball ; and I do n't care for any other . ' ' What a particular fellow you are ! I am sure I could always find something to spend sixpence in . String ? One is always wanting string . You may have a good ball of whipcord . ' ' These sort of places do n't sell it . ' ' Then , I say again , keep your money till you want it . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on purpose to spend it . After all , the only thing I can think of , ' continued Geoffrey , after a pause , ' is to go back to the pastrycook 's . There was one kind of tart I did not taste , and perhaps it would be nicer than the others . I 'll give you one if you like . ' ' No , thank you ; I am much obliged to you all the same ; but I wo n't help you to spend your money in that way . Do n't buy any more tarts . Come and walk about ; there are plenty more shops to look at . ' They sauntered on , but Geoffrey , by various turns , worked his way back to the pastrycook 's ; and as no persuasions could then bring him away , Edward walked off , not choosing , as he said , to encourage him . Presently I saw a tall gentleman enter the bazaar , and I wondered what he would buy . I did not then understand the difference between grown-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could not repress a hope that he would buy me . But his quick eye glanced over the tables without resting on any of the toys . ' Can I show you any thing , sir ? ' said my mistress . ' No , I am much obliged to you , ' he answered , with a pleasant smile . ' I am only in search of some young people who , I dare say , have been better customers than I. Ah , here they are , ' he continued , as the two boys of whom I had taken so much notice ran up to him from different ends of the room . ' Well , boys , ' said he , ' what have you bought ? Must we hire a wagon to carry your property home ? ' ' Not quite , ' answered Edward . ' I have bought a wagon-load of amusement , but I can carry it home well enough myself ; I have spent all my money in this box of tools . ' ' A very sensible and useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you plenty of pleasant employment . The only objection is , that they are likely to be lost or broken at school . ' ' I do not mean to take them to school , papa . I shall use them in the holidays , and leave them with Willy when I go back to school ; that was one reason why I bought them . Willy could do a good deal of carpentering on his sofa . ' Illustration : Page 25 . ' True , my boy , and a kind thought . They will be a great amusement to poor Willy , and he will take good care of them for you . ' ' Now , Geoffrey , how have you invested your capital ? I hope you have found a strong spade . It is fine weather for gardening . ' ' No , I have n't , ' stammered Geoffrey . ' Well , what have you bought ? ' ' I do n't know , ' said Geoffrey . ' Do you mean that you have not spent your money yet ? Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes more . I expected to find you ready to go home . Be brisk ; there is every thing on that stall that the heart of boy can wish , ' said the gentleman , pointing to my abode . But Geoffrey did not move . ' I do n't want any thing , ' said he at last . ' What a fortunate boy ! ' said the gentleman ; but he presently added , ' Have you lost your money ? ' ' No . ' ' Show it to me . ' Geoffrey slowly produced his sixpence , almost hidden in the palm of his hand . ' Where is the rest ? ' asked the gentleman . ' Have you spent it ? ' ' Yes . ' ' And nothing to show for it ? Nothing ? '  - -  and the gentleman looked at the boy more narrowly . ' Nothing , ' said he again , ' except a few crumbs of pie-crust on your waistcoat ? Oh , Geoffrey ! ' There was a short silence , and the boy colored a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own money . ' ' You will wish it was your own again before long , I dare say , ' said the gentleman . ' However , we must hope you will be wiser in time . Come home now to dinner . ' ' I do n't want any dinner , ' said Geoffrey . ' Probably not , but Edward and I do . We have not dined on tarts ; and I dare say Ned is as hungry as I am . ' So saying , he led the way towards the door , leaving me , as usual , pondering over what had passed . One word used by the gentleman made a great impression on me -- USEFUL . What could that mean ? Various considerations were suggested by the question . Some things , it seemed , were useful , others not ; and what puzzled me most was , that the very same things appeared to be useful to some people , and not to others . For instance , the sixpenny paint-box , which had been rejected as useless to Willy , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be the most useful toy he had . Could this be the case with every thing ? Was it possible that every thing properly applied might have its use , and that its value depended upon those who used it ? If so , why was Geoffrey blamed for spending his money in tarts ? He liked them . Perhaps he had plenty of food at home , and that uselessness consisted in a thing 's not being really wanted . I revolved the subject in my mind , and tried to discover the use of every thing I saw , but I was not always successful . The subject was perplexing ; and gradually all my thoughts became fixed on the point of most importance to myself -- namely , my own use . How changed were my ideas since the time when I imagined the world to belong to dolls ! Their whole race now seemed to be of very small importance ; and as for my individual self , I could not be sure that I had any use at all , and still less what , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter unnoticed , except by the shopwoman who covered us up at night , and re-arranged us in the morning ; and even this she did with such an indifferent air , that I could not flatter myself I was of the smallest use to her . Every necessary care was bestowed upon me in common with my companions ; but I sighed for the tender attentions that I sometimes saw lavished by children upon their dolls , and wished that my mistress would nurse and caress me in the same manner . She never seemed to think of such a thing . She once said I was dusty , and whisked a brush over my face ; but that was the only separate mark of interest I ever received from her . I had no reasonable ground of complaint , but I began to grow weary of the insipidity of my life , and to ask myself whether this could be my only destiny . Was I never to be of use to any body ? From time to time other toys were carried away . Many a giddy top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disappeared through those mysterious gates by which the busy human race entered our calm seclusion . At last even dolls had their day . The beautiful waxen princess no longer graced our dominions . She was bought by an elderly lady for a birthday present to a little grand-daughter ; and on the very same day the ' old familiar faces ' of six dolls who had long shared my counter vanished from my sight , one after another being bought and carried away . I was sorry to lose them , though while we lived together we had had our little miffs and jealousies . I had sometimes thought that the one with the red shoes was always sticking out her toes ; that she of the flaxen ringlets was ready to let every breath of wind blow them over her neighbours ' faces ; that another with long legs took up more room than her share , much to my inconvenience . But now that they were all gone , and I never could hope to see them again , I would gladly have squeezed myself into as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to make room for them once more . One thing , however , was satisfactory : dolls certainly had their use . Seven had been bought , and therefore why not an eighth ? I had been sinking almost into a state of despondency , but now my hopes revived and my spirits rose . My turn might come . And my turn did come . Every circumstance of that eventful day is deeply impressed on my memory . I was as usual employed in making remarks upon the passing crowd , and wondering what might be the use of every body I saw , when I perceived the lady and the little girl who had been almost my first acquaintances among the human race . As they approached my stall , I heard the mama say , ' Have you decided what to buy with the sixpence ? ' ' Oh yes , quite , ' answered the child ; ' I am going to buy a sixpenny doll . ' The words thrilled through me ; her eyes seemed fixed on mine , and the sixpence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she continued : ' I think , if you do n't mind the trouble , I should like to go round the bazaar first , to see which are the prettiest . ' ' By all means , ' replied the lady ; and they walked on , carrying all my hopes with them . I had often fancied myself the prettiest doll of my size in the place ; but such conceit would not support me now . I felt that there were dozens , nay scores , who more than equalled me ; and all discontented notions of my neglected merit now sunk before the dread that I had really no merit to neglect . I began also to have some idea of what was meant by time . My past life had glided away so imperceptibly , that I did not know whether it had been long or short ; but I learnt to count every moment while those two mortals were walking round the bazaar . I strained my eyes to catch sight of them again ; but when at last they re-appeared , I scarcely dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child 's hands . But no ; her hands were empty , except for the sixpence still between her finger and thumb . They came nearer -- they stopped at another stall ; I could not hear what they said , but they turned away , and once more stood opposite to me . The child remained for some moments as silent as myself , and then exclaimed , ' After all , Mama , I do n't think there are any prettier dolls than these in the whole room . ' ' What do you say to this one , Miss ? ' said our proprietor , taking up a great full-dressed Dutch doll , and laying her on the top of those of my size and class , completely hiding the poor little victims under her stiff muslin and broad ribbons . But on the child 's answering , ' No , thank you , I only want a sixpenny doll not dressed , ' the Dutch giantess was removed , and we once more asserted our humble claims . ' That seems to me a very pretty one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The child for a moment hesitated , but presently exclaimed in a joyful tone , ' Oh no , this is the beauty of all ; this little darling with the real hair and blue ribbon in it ; I will take this one , if you please . ' And before I could be sure that she meant me , I was removed from my place , wrapped up in paper , and consigned to her hands . My long-cherished wishes were fulfilled , and I was bought . At first I could scarcely believe it . Notwithstanding all my planning and looking forward to this event , now that it really happened , I could not understand it . My senses seemed gone . What had so long occupied my mind was the work of a moment ; but that moment was irrevocable , and my fate was decided . In my little mistress ' hands I passed the boundaries of the world of toys , and entered upon a new state of existence . CHAPTER II . A very different life now opened before me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My young mistress devoted every spare moment to the enjoyment of my company , and set no limits to her caresses and compliments ; while I in return regarded her with all the gratitude and affection which a doll can feel . My faculties as well as my feelings were called into fresh exercise ; for though I had no longer the wide range of observation afforded by the daily crowd of strangers in the bazaar , I had the new advantage of making intimate acquaintance with a small circle of friends . Having hitherto been so completely without any position in the world , I could not at first help feeling rather shy at the idea of taking my place as member of a family ; and it was therefore a relief to find that my lot was not cast amongst total strangers , but that I had already some slight clue to the characters of my future companions . My mistress , whose name was Rose , was sister to the Willy for whom she had bought the paint-box , and also to Edward , the purchaser of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cousin on a visit to them for the holidays ; and they had also an elder sister named Margaret ; besides their papa and mama , whom I had seen in the bazaar . The first of the family to whom I was introduced was Willy , and I soon became much interested in him . He was a pale thin boy , who spent the day on a sofa , to and from which he was carried in the morning and at night . In fine weather he went out in a wheel-chair ; but he was unable to move , without help , and was obliged to endure many privations . Though he often looked suffering and weary , he was cheerful and patient , and always seemed pleased to hear other children describe enjoyments in which he could not share . Every body was fond of Willy , and anxious to amuse and comfort him . All that happened out of doors was told to him ; all the kindest friends and pleasantest visitors came to see him ; the new books were brought to him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart for him ; and all the in-door occupations arranged as much as possible with a view to his convenience . He and his little sister Rose were the dearest friends in the world , and certain to take part in whatever interested each other . As soon as Rose brought me home from the Pantheon , she ran up stairs with me to Willy , whom I then saw for the first time , sitting on the sofa with his feet up , and a table before him , on which stood several books , and my old acquaintances the paint-box and the chest of tools . ' Look at this , Willy ; is not this pretty ? ' exclaimed Rose , laying me down on his open book . Willy looked up with a pleasant smile : ' Very pretty , ' he answered . ' I suppose she is to be the lady of the new house ; and with Ned 's tools , I hope to make some furniture worth her acceptance . ' ' Oh , thank you , Willy dear . And will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think the prettiest name you know ? ' ' Rose , ' answered Willy , laughing ; ' but I suppose that will not do . I dare say you want something very fine and out-of-the-way . ' ' As fine as can be , ' replied Rose ; ' I have been thinking of Seraphina or Wilhelmina : which do you like best ? ' ' Call it Molly , ' cried Edward , who just then entered the room ; ' Molly and Betty are the best names : no nonsense in them . ' ' Call it Stupid Donkey , ' mumbled a voice behind him ; and Geoffrey advanced , his mouth as usual full of something besides words . ' Have any nuts , Willy ? ' he asked , holding out a handful . ' No , thank you , ' answered Willy ; ' I must not eat them . ' ' I would n't be you , I know , ' said Geoffrey , cracking one between his teeth ; ' never let to eat any thing but what 's wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe you are helping Rose to play with that doll now . Put it into the fire ; that is the way to treat dolls . Stupid things . I hate ' em ! ' ' Pray do not touch it , Geoffrey , ' said Rose . ' Leave it alone , Geff , ' said Edward . ' You have your things , and Rose has hers . I do n't see the fun of dolls myself , but she does , and nobody shall interfere with her while I am here to protect her . Just remember that , will you ? ' ' The d-o-ll ! ' said Geoffrey , drawling the word , and making a face as if the pronouncing it turned him quite sick . ' Oh , the sweet doll ! Perhaps you would like to stay and play with Rose , and Willy , and the d-o-ll , instead of coming out to cricket . ' ' Nonsense , you foolish fellow , you know better , ' answered Edward . ' But I wo n't have Rose bullied ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should like to see you or me pass such an examination as Willy could if he were at school . Why , he can learn as much in a day as we do in a week . ' ' Well , he is welcome to learn as much as he likes , ' said Geoffrey ; ' and let 's you and I go and play . What stupid nuts these are ! I 've almost cracked one of my teeth with cracking them . ' The boys ran off ; and presently there came into the room the papa and mama , whom I already knew , and a young lady very like Rose , but older . I found she was Margaret , the eldest sister . They inquired whether Willy wanted any thing before they went out ; and Margaret fetched a drawing that he wished to copy , while his father and mother wheeled his sofa and table nearer the window , that he might have more light . When he was made quite comfortable , they told Rose that she might stay and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would bring her box of scraps and begin dressing me . Then I came in for my share of notice , and had every reason to be satisfied with the praises bestowed on me . The mama said that I deserved very neatly-made clothes ; the papa , that my hair would be a pattern for Margaret 's ; and Margaret said I was charming , and that she would make me a pink satin gown . They admired the name Seraphina , though the papa suggested various others which he thought might suit Rose 's taste ,  - -  Sophonisba , Cleopatra , Araminta , Dulcinea , Ethelinda , &c.; but as she remained steady to her first choice , the LADY SERAPHINA was decided to be thenceforth my name and title . And now began the real business of my life . I was no longer doomed to fret at being of no use , for the object of my existence was plain enough , namely , to give innocent recreation to my young mistress when at leisure from her more serious employments . Every day she spent some hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fly to me for relief between her lessons , and return to them with more vigor after passing a little time in my refreshing company . She often showed her tasks to me , and discussed their difficulties . I think she repeated the multiplication-table to me nearly a hundred times , while I sat on the Tutor 's Assistant waiting for the recurrence of the fatal words , ' Seven times nine . ' Day after day she could get no farther ; but as soon as she came to ' Seven times nine , ' I was turned off the book , which had to be consulted for the answer . At last , one day she came running into the room in great glee , exclaiming , ' I have done the multiplication-table . I have said it quite right , sixty-three and all . I made no mistake even in dodging . And you helped me , my darling Lady Seraphina . I never could have learned it perfect if you had not heard me say it so often . And now , look at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willy has made you an arm-chair . ' Beautiful , indeed , was the bonnet , and commodious the arm-chair ; and I wore the one and reclined in the other all the time Rose was learning the French auxiliary verbs etre and avoir . I flattered myself I was of as much use in them as in the multiplication-table ; but I do not recollect receiving any particular recompense . Indeed , after a little time , it would have been difficult to know what to give me , for I possessed every thing that a doll 's heart could wish , or her head imagine . Such a variety of elegant dresses as Rose made for me would have been the envy of all my old friends in the bazaar . I had gowns of pink satin and white satin ; blue silk and yellow silk ; colored muslins without number , and splendid white lace . Bonnets enough to furnish a milliner 's shop were mine ; but I was not so partial to them as to my gowns , because they tumbled my hair . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rose on account of perfect lessons ; but in course of time , I ceased to superintend Rose 's studies . Margaret said that I interrupted the course of history ; and the mama said that Rose was old enough to learn her lessons without bringing her play into them , and that I must be put away during school hours . Though I did not think that the fault was altogether mine , I quite acquiesced in the wisdom of this decree ; for during Rose 's last reading-lesson she had stopped so often to ask me which I liked best , Lycurgus or Solon , Pericles or Alcibiades , &c.,; that Margaret was almost out of patience . And though I made no answer , and had really no choice at all between the characters , I felt that I rather hindered business . I was therefore now left to myself for several hours in the morning ; but I found ample and pleasant employment in surveying the comforts and beauties of my habitation . For I was not forced to perform the part of an insignificant pigmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I possessed a beautiful little house proportioned to my size , pleasantly situated on a table in the furthest corner of the schoolroom , and commanding an extensive view of the whole apartment . I must describe my house at full length . It had been originally , as I heard , a mere rough packing-case ; but what of that ? The best brick house in London was once but clay in the fields ; and my packing-case was now painted outside and papered inside , and fitted up in a manner every way suitable for the occupation of a doll of distinction . My drawing-room was charming ; light and cheerful , the walls papered with white and gold , and the floor covered with a drab carpet worked with flowers of every hue . Rose worked the carpet herself under the directions of Margaret , who prevailed on her to learn worsted-work for my sake . So there , again , how useful I was ! From the ceiling hung a brilliant glass chandelier , a birthday present from Edward to Rose ; and the mantel-piece was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking-glass by Willy , and framed by his hands . I can not say that Willy ever seemed to care for me personally , but he took considerable interest in my upholstery , and much of my handsomest furniture was manufactured by him . He made my dining-room and drawing-room tables ; the frames of my chairs , which were covered with silk by Margaret ; my sofa , and my four-post bedstead ; and it was he who painted the floor-cloth in my hall , and the capital picture of the Queen and Prince Albert which hung over the dining-room chimney-piece . I had a snug bed-room , containing a bed with pink curtains , a toilette-table , with a handsome looking-glass , pincushion , and rather large brush and comb ; a washing-stand , towel-horse , chest of drawers , and wardrobe . But the last two , I must confess , were rather for show than for use . They were French-polished , and in appearance convenient as well as handsome , but in reality too small to hold my clothes . A few minor articles of dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous attire was always in larger boxes and trunks belonging to my mistress ; her work-box , for instance , and at one time her desk ; but her mama turned all my gowns out of the latter when she banished me from the lessons , and desired that , for the future , only writing materials should be kept in it . ' Every thing in its proper place , Rose , ' I heard her say . ' You have plenty of little boxes for doll 's clothes ; and your doll ought to teach you to be more tidy instead of less so . ' My dining-room was well adapted for all the purposes of hospitality , being furnished with a substantial dining-table , chairs , and a sideboard , on which there always stood two trays , one filled with decanters and wine-glasses , and the other with knives and forks . My kitchen was resplendent with saucepans , kettles , pots and pans , and plates and dishes , ranged upon the dresser , or hung from the walls . A joint of meat was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own race appeared to spend her life in basting it , for I never failed to find her thus employed when Rose was so kind as to take me into my kitchen . There was also a footman , who sat for ever in the hall ; and I was inclined to consider him rather wanting in respect , till I discovered that , owing to a broken leg , he was unable to stand . I did not quite comprehend the use of my servants , as Rose herself did all the work of my house ; but she said they were indispensable , and that if it were not for want of room , I should have a great many more . Besides all these arrangements for my comfort in-doors , I possessed a beautiful open phaeton , emblazoned with the royal arms of England , and drawn by four piebald horses with long tails , so spirited that they never left off prancing . Every day , after school-time , Rose brought this equipage to my door ; and the four horses stood with their eight front feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , attired in my last new bonnet and cloak , I sat in state in my carriage , and was drawn round and round the room by Rose , till she said I was tired . She made many attempts to persuade the lame footman to stand on the footboard behind , but she never could manage it . He was a very helpless creature ; and I am not quite certain that he even did his best , little as that might be . The first time Rose set him up behind the carriage , he tumbled head over heels into the middle of it , and stood there on his head till she picked him out again . Then he fell off behind , then on one side , and then on the other , till she was quite tired of his foolish tricks , and left him to sit quietly and stupidly in his old place in the hall . I lived in great comfort in my pleasant house , and being of a cheerful , contented temper , never felt lonely , although left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very obedient to her Mama 's orders , and even if now and then tempted to forget the regulation herself , Willy was always at hand to remind her , and help to fix her attention on her business . But when it was all over , she flew to me with redoubled pleasure . One day she said to me , ' My dear Seraphina , I am afraid you must be very dull , alone all the morning . ' I longed to assure her of the contrary ; but not having the gift of speech , I could only listen submissively while she continued : ' It is a pity that you should sit doing nothing and wasting your time ; so I have brought you some books , which you are to read while I am at my lessons ; and I shall expect you to learn just as much as I do . ' So saying , she seated me on my sofa , and placing a table with the books before me , ' Look , ' continued she , ' I have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty red and green papers . This is your English History , and this is your French Grammar ; and here is a Geography Book , and here is a History of Rome . Now read attentively , and do not let your thoughts wander ; and be very careful not to dogs-ear the leaves : that always looks like a dunce . And mind you sit upright , ' added she , looking back , as she left the room in obedience to a summons from her sister . I obeyed to the best of my power . To be sure , I did not know which was geography and which was grammar ; and English and Roman history were both alike to me . But I did as I was bid . I sat upright in the place appointed me , staring as hard as I could at the open pages ; and my worst enemy could not accuse me of dogs-earing a single leaf . When my mistress returned , she pleased me much by calling me a very good girl , and saying that if I continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve . On hearing this , Willy laughed , and said he hoped that that was a duplicate of Margaret 's last speech ; and Rose looked very happy , and answered that not only Margaret , but Mama had said the same . This was not my only duplicate of Rose 's adventures . My education appeared to be conducted precisely on the same plan as her own . Before long , she brought a little pianoforte and set it up in my drawing-room . I thought it rather hid the pretty paper , but it was a handsome piece of furniture . ' Now , Lady Seraphina , ' said Rose , ' I am obliged to practise for an hour every day , and you must do the same . See what a pretty piano I have given you . You need not mind its being meant for a housewife and pincushion ; the notes are marked , and that is all you want . Now practise your scales , and be very careful to play right notes and count your time . ' I sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry to say that my progress did not seem satisfactory . One day Rose said that she was sure I had forgotten to count ; and another day , that I hurried the easy bars and slackened the difficult ones ; then she accused me of not caring whether I played right notes or wrong , and torturing her ear by my false chords ; then I banged the notes till I broke the strings : in short , there was no end to her complaints , till at last she wound them all up by declaring that both she and I hated music , and that if Mama and Margaret would take her advice , we should both leave it off . But still I practised regularly , and so , I suppose , did Rose ; and gradually her reproaches diminished , and she grew more contented with me ; and we both persevered , till she said that really , after all , I seemed to have a good ear , and to be likely to make a very respectable player . ' But you know it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of pains and practice . Pains and practice will do any thing . ' It was fortunate for me that I had so careful a superintendent as Rose ; for unless she had kept a constant watch over me , there is no saying how many awkward habits I might unconsciously have contracted . But she cured me of poking my head forward , of standing on one leg , of tilting my chair , of meddling with things that were not my own , of leaning against the furniture while I was speaking , of putting my elbows on the table , of biting my nails , of spilling my tea , and of making crumbs on the floor . I can not say I was myself aware either of the faults or their cure ; but I think one seldom does notice one 's own faults , and therefore it is a great advantage to have kind friends who will point them out to us . I believed Rose when she told me of mine ; so I had a right to believe her when she gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulge the hope that I was becoming a pleasing , well-bred little doll . On one mortifying occasion , however , I must own that Rose 's anxiety for my always following in her steps was the cause of a serious injury to me . She remarked that I had got into a horrid way of kicking off my shoes while I was learning my poetry ; and she thought the best cure would be to make me wear sandals . I observed that she was sewing sandals to her own shoes at the time , and she consulted Willy about some means of doing the same by mine . Willy held me head downwards , and examined my feet . My shoes were painted , therefore sewing was out of the question . He advised glue . This was tried , but it came through the thin narrow ribbon of which my sandals were to be made , and looked very dirty . They were taken off ; but the operation had spoilt the delicacy of my white stockings , and Rose said it was impossible to let me go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . She asked Willy to lend her a gimlet , that she might bore holes at the sides of my feet , and glue the ribbon into them , so as not to show the glue . Willy said she was welcome to the gimlet , but that he advised her to leave it alone , for that she would only break my feet . But Rose would not be dissuaded , and began boring . It was on this occasion that I most peculiarly felt the advantage of that insensibility to pain which distinguishes my race . What mortal could have borne such an infliction without struggling and screaming ? I , on the contrary , took it all in good part , and showed no signs of feeling even at the fatal moment when my foot snapped in two , and Rose , with a face of utter dismay , held up my own toes before my eyes . ' Oh , my poor Seraphina ! ' she exclaimed , ' what shall we do ? ' ' Glue it on again , ' said Willy . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now you must make the best of it . Glue is your only friend . ' So Rose glued the halves of my foot together , lamenting over me , and blaming herself so much all the time , that it seemed rather a comfort to her when Margaret , coming into the room , agreed with her that she had been foolish and awkward . Margaret said that ribbon might have been tied over my feet from the first , without using glue or gimlet either ; and Rose called herself more stupid than ever , for not having thought of such an easy contrivance . My foot was glued , and for the purpose of standing , answered as well as ever ; and Rose sewed me up in a pair of blue silk boots , and declared that I was prettier than before ; and my misfortune was soon forgotten by every body but myself . I , however , could not but feel a misgiving that this was the first warning of my share in the invariable fate of my race . For I had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doll , like that of every thing else , has its limits . Either by sudden accidents , such as loss of limbs , or by the daily wear and tear of life , decay gradually makes its progress in us , and we fade away as surely as the most delicate of the fragile race of mortals . Though the fracture of my foot was my own first misfortune , I had had opportunities of remarking the casualties to which dolls are liable . For it is not to be supposed that our devotion to human beings precludes us from cultivating the society of our own species . Dolls will be dolls ; and they have a natural sympathy with each other , notwithstanding the companionship of the race of man . Most little girls are aware of this fact , and provide suitable society for their dolls . I myself had a large circle of silent acquaintances , to whom I was introduced by Rose 's kindness and consideration . When other little girls came to drink tea with her , they often brought their dolls to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once the pleasure of recognising an old friend from the bazaar . Then I was in my glory . There was a constant supply of provisions in my larder ; and at a moment 's notice Rose would produce an excellent dinner , all ready cooked , and dished in a beautiful little china dinner-service . Willy compared her to the genius of Aladdin 's lamp ; and though I did not know what that might mean , I quite understood the advantage of being able to set such a banquet before my friends . I could always command salmon , a pair of soles , a leg of mutton , a leg of pork , a turkey , a pair of boiled fowls , a ham , a sucking pig , a hare , a loaf of bread , a fine Cheshire cheese , several pies , and a great variety of fruit , which was always ripe and in season , winter or summer . Rose 's papa once observed that his hothouse produced none so fine ; for the currants were as large as apples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions performed the active duties of waiting at table on these occasions ; but the lame footman was generally brought out of the hall , and propped up against the sideboard , where he stood looking respectable but awkward . At these pleasant parties I saw a great range of characters , for Rose 's young visitors were various in their tastes , and their dolls used to be dressed in every known costume . Besides plenty of pretty English damsels , I was introduced now to a Turkish sultana , now to a Swiss peasant ; one day to a captain in the British army , another day to an Indian rajah . One young lady liked to make her dolls personate celebrated characters ; and when she visited us , most distinguished guests graced my table . I have had the honor of receiving the Queen and Prince Albert themselves ; the Duke of Wellington , Sir Walter Scott , and Miss Edgeworth , have all dined with me on the same day , and Robinson Crusoe came in the evening . But it was at these social meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolls to loss of limbs . I never remember giving a party at which the guests could boast of possessing all their legs and arms . Many an ingenious contrivance hid or supplied the deficiencies , and we were happy in spite of our losses ; still , such was the case : and I saw that dolls , however beloved and respected , could not last for ever . For some time after my accident I had no particular adventures . I lived in peace and plenty , and amused myself with watching the family . They were all amiable and easy to understand , except Geoffrey ; but he was a complete puzzle to me , and it was long before I could make out why he was so different from the rest . The others all seemed to like to help and please one another , but Geoffrey never seemed happy unless he was making himself disagreeable . If Willy was interested in a book , he was obliged to sit upon the second volume , or Geoffrey would be sure to run away with it . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hide his cap , and keep him a quarter of an hour hunting for it . The girls dared not leave their worsted-work within his reach for a moment ; for he would unravel the canvass , or chop up the wool , or go on with the work after a pattern of his own composing , so that they would be obliged to spend half an hour in unpicking his cobbling . Margaret remonstrated with him in private , and made excuses for him in public , and did her best to prevent his tiresome tricks from annoying Willy ; Edward tried rougher means of keeping him in order , which sometimes succeeded ; but still he could find plenty of opportunities of being a torment : people always can when such is their taste . One day Margaret was keeping Willy company , while the rest of the party were gone to the Zoological Gardens . She had brought a drawing to finish , as he liked to see her draw , and was sometimes useful in suggesting improvements . But while they were thus employed , Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that her drawing would just have time to dry before she returned . But unfortunately , during her absence , Geoffrey came home . He had grown tired of the Gardens , which he had seen very often , and rather hungry , as he generally was ; so after amusing himself by eating the cakes he had bought for the bear , he had nothing more to do , and tried to persuade his cousins to be tired also . But Edward was making himself agreeable to the monkeys , Rose was cultivating the friendship of the elephant , and their Papa and Mama were waiting to see the hippopotamus bathe ; so that Geoffrey 's proposals of leaving the Gardens were scouted , and he could only obtain leave from his uncle to go home by himself . He entered the room , as usual , with his mouth full , having spent his last penny in a piece of cocoanut as he came along the streets . While the cocoanut lasted , he was employed to his satisfaction ; but when that was finished , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried walking round the room on one leg , working heel and toe , and that succeeded very well , and did no harm till he unluckily came to the drawing-table , when he immediately brought himself to a stand on both feet . ' Hallo ! ' cried he , ' here 's a daub ! Is this your splendid performance , Will ? ' ' No , ' replied Willy , ' it is Margaret 's ; and mind you do n't touch it by accident , because it is wet . ' ' Touch it by accident ! ' exclaimed Geoffrey ; ' I am going to touch it on purpose . I wonder Margaret is not ashamed to do it so badly . I 'll improve it for her . How kind of me ! ' Poor Willy , in dismay , tried to secure the drawing , but he could not move from his sofa , and Geoffrey danced round him , holding it at arm's-length . Then Willy caught at the bell-rope , but his mischievous cousin snatched it quicker , and tied it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as loud as he could , but no one was within hearing ; and he threw himself back on his sofa , in despair , exclaiming , ' How can you be so ill-natured , when Margaret is always so kind to you ? ' ' Ill-natured ! ' answered the other ; ' I 'm doing her a favor . She admired the moonlight in the Diorama ; now I shall make just such a moon in her drawing . ' And while he spoke , a great yellow moon , like a guinea , rose in the midst of poor Margaret 's brilliant sunset . ' That 's the thing , ' said Geoffrey ; ' and now I shall put the cow jumping over it , and the little dog laughing to see such sport . Some figures always improve the foreground . ' ' Oh , you have quite spoilt it ! ' cried Willy . ' How I wish I could stop you ! I can not imagine how you can like to be so mischievous and disagreeable . Oh , if Margaret would but come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troublesome Geoffrey expected great amusement from her displeasure ; but he was disappointed . Margaret was one of those generous people who never resent an injury done to themselves . If Geoffrey had spoilt any body else 's drawing , she would have been the first to punish him ; but now she was much more vexed at Willy 's distress than at the destruction of her own work , and instead of scolding Geoffrey , she gave herself up to consoling Willy . She assured him that there was no great harm done . She said the drawing was good for very little , and that she would copy it and improve it so much that he should be quite glad of the disaster ; and she made a present of the spoilt drawing to Geoffrey , telling him she was sure he would one day be ashamed of so foolish a performance , but that meanwhile he might keep it as a specimen of his taste . He had not the manners to apologize , but he looked very silly and crest-fallen , and left the room in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone , Willy exclaimed , ' If it were not for losing Edward , I should wish the holidays were over ; Geoffrey is so disagreeable . ' ' He is very thoughtless , ' Margaret replied ; ' but we must not be too hard upon him . Let us recollect that he has no parents to teach him better , nor brothers and sisters to call forth his consideration for others . Poor Geoffrey has had neither example nor precept till now . But now Papa and Mama give him good precepts ; and if we try to set him good examples , perhaps we may help him to improve . ' ' Well , I 'll hope for the best , and do what I can , ' said Willy . ' Certainly he has some good qualities . He is as brave as a lion ; and he is good-natured about giving away his own things , though he is so mischievous with other people 's . ' ' And he is clever in his way , notwithstanding his idleness , ' added Margaret . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommonly well done , though they were provoking to us . ' ' You are the best girl in the world , ' said Willy ; ' and if you think Geoffrey will improve , I 'll think so too ; but you must own there is room for it . ' Perhaps Geoffrey did improve , but it seemed slow work , faults being more easily acquired than cured ; and for a long time I could perceive no difference in him . Indeed , as his next piece of mischief concerned myself , I thought him worse than ever . I have often wondered at the extreme dislike which boys have to dolls . I was the most inoffensive creature possible , giving myself no airs , and interfering with nobody ; yet even the gentle Willy was indifferent to me . Edward , though he protected Rose in her patronage of me , despised me thoroughly himself ; and Geoffrey never lost an opportunity of expressing his mortal hatred to me . I shrunk from Edward 's contemptuous notice , but I was not at all afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt a hair of my head ; but whenever Geoffrey came into the room , terror seized my mind . He never passed my house without making all kinds of ugly faces at me ; and I felt instinctively that nothing but the presence of the other boys restrained him from doing me any harm in his power . I had hitherto never been alone with him , but at last the fatal moment arrived . One fine afternoon , Willy went out for a drive in his wheel-chair , Edward insisting upon drawing it himself , and the two girls walking on each side . Geoffrey accompanied them , intending to walk with them part of the way , and to go on by himself when he was tired of the slow pace of the chair . All seemed safe , and I hoped to enjoy a few hours of uninterrupted leisure . I always liked having my time to myself ; and as Rose had set me no lessons , I reposed comfortably in my arm-chair by a blazing fire of black and red cloth , from the glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog sat at my side , my cat lay at my feet , and I was as happy as a doll could be . Suddenly the silence was broken by a sound as of a turkey gabbling in the hall ; presently this changed to a duck quacking on the stairs ; then a cock crew on the landing-place , and a goose hissed close to the schoolroom door . I guessed but too well what these ominous sounds portended , and my heart sunk within me as the door burst open , and my dreaded enemy banged into the room . ' Why , they are not come home yet ! ' exclaimed he ; ' so my talents have been wasted . I meant to have made them bid me not make every different noise . When they said , " Do n't hiss , " I would have crowed ; and when they said , " Do n't crow , " I would have quacked , or barked , or bellowed , or mewed , till I had gone through all the noises I know . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and looked out . ' What a stupid street it is ! ' said he . ' If my uncle had not taken away my squirt , I would squirt at the people . ' Then he yawned , and sauntered to the bookcase . ' What stupid books ! I wonder any body can write them . I wish Edward had left his tools out ; I should like to plane the top of the shelf . How stupid it is having nothing to do ! ' As he spoke , I shuddered to see him approaching my end of the room . He came nearer ; he made a full stop in front of me , and looked me in the face . ' You stupid , ugly thing , ' he exclaimed , ' do n't stare so . I hate to have a doll 's eyes goggling at me . ' Gladly would I have withdrawn my eyes , if possible . But they had been painted wide open , and what could I do ? I never was so ashamed of them in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stared on , and he grew more indignant . ' If you do n't leave off , ' he cried , ' I 'll poke out your eyes , as I did those of the ugly picture in my room . I wo n't be stared at . ' I longed for the gift of speech to represent to him , that if he would but leave off looking at me , I should give him no offence ; but alas , I was silent , and could only stare as hard as ever . ' Oh , you will , will you ? ' said he ' then I know what I 'll do : I 'll hang you . ' In vain I hoped for the return of the rest of the party . I listened anxiously for every sound , but no friendly step or voice was near , and I was completely in his power . He began rummaging his pockets , grinning and making faces at me all the time . Presently he drew forth a long piece of string , extremely dirty , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Now for it , ' he exclaimed ; ' now you shall receive the reward of all your stupidity and affectation . I do think dolls are the most affected creatures on the face of the earth . ' He laid hold of me by my head , pushing my wig on one side . Alas for my beautiful hair , it was disarranged for ever ! But that was a trifle compared with what followed . He tied one end of his muddy string round my neck , drawing it so tight that I foresaw I should be marked for life , and hung the other end to a nail in the wall . There I dangled , while he laughed and quizzed me , adding insult to injury . He twisted the string as tight as possible , and then let it whirl round and round till it was all untwisted again . I banged against the wall as I spun like a top , and wished that I could sleep like a top too . But I was wide awake to my misfortunes ; and each interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced them , by showing in painful contrast the happy home whence I had been torn . For I was hung on the wall directly opposite my own house ; and from my wretched nail I could distinguish every room in it . Between my twirls I saw my pretty drawing-room , with its comfortable arm-chair now vacant ; and my convenient kitchen , with my respectable cook peacefully basting her perpetual mutton ; I envied even my lame footman quietly seated in his chimney-corner , and felt that I had never truly valued the advantages of my home till now . Would they ever be restored to me ? Should I once again be under the protection of my kind and gentle mistress , or was I Geoffrey 's slave for ever ? Illustration : Page 72 These melancholy thoughts were interrupted by a step on the stairs . ' Hallo ! ' cried Geoffrey , ' who would have thought of their coming home just now ? ' and he was going to lift me down from my nail ; but when the door opened , the housemaid came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , Master Geoffrey , ' said she , ' what are you doing here all alone ? Some mischief , I 'll be bound . ' ' Bow , wow , wow , ' answered he , dancing and playing all sorts of antics to prevent her seeing me . ' Come , ' said she , ' those tricks wo n't go down with me . The more lively you are , the more I know you 've been after something you ought to have let alone . ' ' Hee haw , hee haw , ' said Geoffrey , twitching her gown , and braying like a donkey . ' Well , you 're speaking in your own voice at last , ' said she , laughing . ' But let go of my gown , if you please ; you are big enough to walk by yourself , and I want to set the room to rights . There 's some young ladies coming to tea with Miss Rose . ' She bustled about , dusting and putting every thing in order , and talking all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the blacks that came in at the windows , and made a place want dusting a dozen times a day , when her eye fell on my unfortunate figure , which my persecutor had just set swinging like the pendulum of a clock . I was a deplorable object . He had forced me into the most awkward attitude he could invent . My arms were turned round in their sockets , one stretched towards the ceiling , the other at full length on one side . I was forced to kick one leg out in front , and the other behind ; and my knees were bent up the wrong way . My wig had fallen off altogether from my head , and was now perched upon my toe . I was still swinging , when Sarah caught sight of me . She looked at me for a moment , and then turned round , opening her eyes at Geoffrey much wider than I had ever done . ' Why , you audacious , aggravating boy ! ' she exclaimed , making a dash at him with her duster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to finish her speech to herself . ' To think of his being so mischievous and ill-natured ! What will poor Miss Rose say ! To be sure , there is nothing boys wo n't do ; their equals for perverseness do n't walk the earth . Though I ought not to speak against them , while there 's Master William and Master Edward to contradict me . They are boys , to be sure ; but as for that Geoffrey ! ' And here she shook her head in silence , as if Geoffrey 's delinquencies were beyond the power of words to express . She then released me ; and after restoring my limbs to their proper position , and smoothing my discomposed dress , she laid me gently on my bed , and placed my wig on my pillow beside me , with many kind expressions of pity and good-will . Repose was indeed needful after so agitating an adventure ; and I was glad to be left quiet till the young people came in from their walk . I composed my ruffled spirits as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nervous at the idea of Rose 's first seeing me in such a plight , and I anxiously awaited her return . They came in at last , Rose , Willy , and Margaret ; and after establishing Willy on his sofa , Rose 's next care was to visit me . ' O Willy ! O Margaret ! ' she exclaimed , and burst into tears . ' What is the matter , my darling ? ' asked Margaret . Rose could not answer ; but Sarah was there to tell the story , and do ample justice to my wrongs . Yet I could not help observing , in the midst of all her indignation , the difference of her manner towards her present hearers and towards Geoffrey . She never seemed on familiar terms with Willy , much less with Margaret or Rose . She neither cut jokes nor used rough language to them , but treated them with the respect due to her master 's children ; though , as I well knew , she was extremely fond of them , and disliked Geoffrey , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more that day . Rose 's young friends soon arrived , and consoled both her and me by their kind sympathy and attentions . One made an elegant cap to supply the loss of my wig ; another strung a blue necklace to hide the black mark round my throat ; Rose herself put me to bed , and placed a table by my bedside covered with teacups , each , she told me , containing a different medicine ; and the young lady who had once brought Miss Edgeworth to dine with me , charged me to lie still and read ' Rosamond ' till I was quite recovered . Next morning , as I lay contentedly performing my new part of an invalid , I heard a confidential conversation between Margaret and Geoffrey , in which I was interested . They were alone together , and she was taking the opportunity to remonstrate with him on his unkind treatment of me . ' What was the harm ? ' said Geoffrey . ' A doll is nothing but wood or bran , or some stupid stuff ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered Margaret , ' we all know that . It is wasteful and mischievous to spoil a pretty toy ; but I am not speaking now so much for the sake of the doll as of Rose . Rose is not made of any stupid stuff ; she can feel . And what is more , she can feel for other people as well as herself . She would never play you such an ill-natured trick . ' ' I should not mind it if she did , ' argued Geoffrey ; ' I am not such a baby . ' ' You would not mind that particular thing , ' answered Margaret , ' because you do not care about dolls ; but you would mind her interfering with your pleasures , or injuring your property . You would think it very ill-natured , for instance , if she threw away that heap of nuts which you have hoarded like a squirrel on your shelf of the closet . ' ' Nuts are not nonsense like dolls , ' said he . ' Besides , she may have as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eat some yesterday . ' ' Yes , and half choked her by poking them into her mouth , when she told you she did not want them . She cares no more for nuts than you for dolls . You would think it no kindness if she teazed you to nurse her doll . ' ' I should think not , indeed , ' answered Geoffrey , indignant at the very idea . ' Of course not . Kindness is not shown by forcing our own pleasures down other people 's throats , but by trying to promote theirs . That is really doing as we would be done by . ' ' But doing as we would be done by is one 's duty , ' said Geoffrey . ' I fear it is a duty of which you seldom think , ' replied his cousin . ' Why , one ca n't be thinking of duty in those kind of things , ' answered he . ' Why not ? ' asked Margaret . ' Because they are such trifles ; duties are great things . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties ? ' Margaret inquired . ' Oh , such things as letting oneself be tortured , like Regulus ; or forgiving an enemy who has shot poisoned arrows at one , like Coeur de Lion . ' ' Well , ' said Margaret smiling , ' such heroic duties as those do not seem likely to fall in your way just now , perhaps they never may . Our fellow-creatures are so kind to us , that we are seldom called upon to fulfil any but small duties towards them , or what you would consider such ; for I can not allow any duty to be small , especially that of doing as we would be done by . If we do not fulfil that in trifles , we shall probably never fulfil it at all . This is a serious thought , Geoffrey . ' Geoffrey looked up ; and as he seemed inclined to listen , Margaret continued talking to him kindly but gravely , bringing many things before his mind as duties which he had hitherto considered to be matters of indifference . But Margaret would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person could give pain or pleasure , trouble or relief , annoyance or comfort to another , or by which any one 's own mind or habits could be either injured or improved . She maintained that there was a right and a wrong to every thing , and that right and wrong could never be trifles , whether in great things or small . By degrees the conversation turned upon matters far too solemn to be repeated by a mere plaything like myself ; but I thought , as I heard her , that it might be better to be a poor wooden figure which could do neither right nor wrong , than a human being who neglected his appointed duties . Geoffrey said little , but he shook hands with Margaret when she had finished speaking , and I noticed from that day forward a gradual improvement in his conduct . Bad habits are not cured in a minute , and he did not become all at once as gentle and considerate as Willy , nor as kind and helpful as Edward ; but he put himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of overtaking them in due time . He at once left off active mischief ; and if he could not avoid being occasionally troublesome , he at any rate cured himself of teazing people on purpose . And it was remarkable how many employments he found as soon as his mind was disengaged from mischief . Instead of his dawdling about all the morning calling things stupid , and saying he had nothing to do , all manner of pleasant occupations seemed to start up in his path , as if made to order for him , now that he had time to attend to them . When he relinquished the pleasure of spoiling things , he acquired the far greater pleasure of learning to make them . When Edward was no longer afraid of trusting him with his tools , it was wonderful what a carpenter he turned out . When Margaret could venture to leave drawing materials within his reach , he began to draw capitally . Good-natured Margaret gave him lessons , and said she would never wish for a better scholar . He found it was twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thought an acquisition instead of a burden ; and far more agreeable to have Rose and Willy anxious for his company than wishing to get rid of him . But the advantages were not confined to himself ; the whole house shared in them ; for his perpetual small annoyances had made every body uncomfortable , whereas now , by attention to what he used to look upon as trifles , he found he had the power of contributing his part towards the happiness of his fellow-creatures , which is no trifle . On the last day of the holidays , the young people were all assembled in the schoolroom till it was time for Edward and Geoffrey to start . While Edward was arranging various matters with Willy , I heard Geoffrey whisper to Margaret that he hoped she had forgiven him for spoiling that drawing of hers . She seemed at first really not to know what he meant ; but when she recollected it , she answered with a smile , ' Oh , my dear Geoffrey , I had forgiven and forgotten it long ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next went up to Rose and put a little parcel into her hands . On opening it , she found a box of very pretty bonbons in the shape of various vegetables . When she admired them , he seemed much pleased , and said that he had saved up his money to buy them , in hopes she might like them for her dolls ' feasts . Rose kissed and thanked him , and said she only wished he could stay and help her and her dolls to eat them . Every body took an affectionate leave of Geoffrey , and Willy said he was very sorry to lose him , and should miss him sadly . Edward and Geoffrey returned to school , and I never saw Geoffrey again ; but a constant correspondence was kept up between him and his cousins , and I often heard pleasant mention of his progress and improvement . Time passed on ; what length of time I can not say , all seasons and their change being alike to me ; but school-days and holidays succeeded one another , and our family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less time with me , and more with her books and music , till at last , though she still kept my house in order , she never actually played with me , unless younger children came to visit her , and then , indeed , I was as popular as ever . But on a little friend 's one day remarking that I had worn the same gown for a month , Rose answered that she herself had the charge of her own clothes now , and that what with keeping them in order , and doing fancy-work as presents for her friends , she found no time to work for dolls . By and by , her time for needlework was fully engaged in Geoffrey 's behalf . He was going to sea ; and Rose was making purses , slippers , portfolios , and every thing she could think of as likely to please him . Perhaps her most useful keepsake was a sailor 's housewife ; but many nice things were sent him from every one of the family . I saw a trunk full of presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first acquaintance with him , I could not but marvel over the change that had taken place , before books , drawing materials , and mathematical instruments could have been chosen as the gifts best suited to his taste . Edward used to come home from school as merry and good-humored as ever , and growing taller and stronger every holiday . Rose and Margaret were as flourishing as he ; but poor Willy grew weaker , and thinner , and paler . Fresh springs and summers brought him no revival , but as they faded , he seemed to fade with them . He read more than ever ; and his sisters were frequently occupied in reading and writing under his direction , for they were anxious to help him in his pursuits . His Papa and Mama sometimes said he studied too hard ; and they used to sit with him , and try to amuse him by conversation , when they wished to draw him from his books . Doctors visited him , and prescribed many remedies ; and his Mama gave him all the medicines herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father carried him up and down stairs , and waited upon him as tenderly as even Margaret ; but he grew no better with all their care . He was always gentle and patient , but he appeared in less good spirits than formerly . He seemed to enjoy going out in his wheel-chair more than any thing ; but one day he observed that the summer was fast coming to an end , and that then he must shut himself up in his room , for that he minded the cold more than he used . ' I wish we lived in a warmer country , ' said Rose ; ' perhaps then you might get better . ' ' I do not know about living , ' replied Willy . ' England is the best country to live in ; but I certainly should like to be out of the way of the cold for this next winter . ' ' Why do not you tell Papa so ? ' asked Rose . ' Because I know very well he would take me a journey directly , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more just then , but she took the first opportunity of telling her father what had passed ; and he said he was very glad indeed that she had let him know . From that day forward something more than usual seemed in contemplation . Papa , Mama , and Margaret were constantly consulting together , and Edward , Rose , and Willy followed their example . As for me , nobody had time to bestow a look or a thought upon me ; but I made myself happy by looking at and thinking of them . One morning two doctors together paid Willy a long visit . After they were gone , his Papa and Mama came into his room . ' Well , my boy , ' his father exclaimed in an unusually cheerful tone , ' it is quite settled now ; Madeira is the place , and I hope you like the plan . ' ' Oh , Papa , ' said Willy , ' is it really worth while ? ' ' Of course it is worth while , a hundred times over , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first ship . ' ' The doctors strongly advise it , and we have all great hopes from it , my dear Willy , ' said his mother . ' Then so have I , ' said Willy ; ' and , indeed , I like it extremely , and I am very grateful to you . The only thing I mind is , that you and my father should have to leave home and make a long sea voyage , when you do not like travelling , and Papa has so much to keep him in England . ' ' Oh , never mind me , ' said his mother ; ' I shall like nothing so well as travelling , if it does you good . ' ' And never mind me , ' said his father ; ' there is nothing of so much consequence to keep me in England , as your health to take me out of it . ' ' Besides , my dear child , ' said his mother , ' as the change of climate is so strongly recommended for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try it . ' ' So make your mind easy , my boy , ' added his father ; ' and I will go and take our passage for Madeira . ' The father left the room , and the mother remained conversing with her sick child , whose spirits were unusually excited . I scarcely knew him again . He was generally slow and quiet , and rather desponding about himself ; but he now thought he should certainly get well , and was so eager and anxious to start without delay , that his mother had some difficulty in reconciling him to the idea that no ship would sail till next month . She also took great pains to impress upon him the duty of resignation , in case the attempt should fail , after all , in restoring his health ; and she finally left him , not less hopeful , but more calm and contented with whatever might befall him . And now began the preparations for the voyage . There was no time to spare , considering all that had to be done . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not do much to help , he thought of nothing else . His common books and drawings were changed for maps and voyages ; the track to Madeira was looked up by him and Rose every day , and sometimes two or three times in the day , and every book consulted that contained the least reference to the Madeira Isles . Edward was an indefatigable packer . He was not to be one of the travellers , as his father did not choose to interrupt his school-education ; but no one was more active than he in forwarding the preparations for the voyage , and no one more sanguine about its results . ' We shall have Willy back , ' he would say , ' turned into a fine strong fellow , as good a cricketer as Geoffrey or I , and a better scholar than either of us . ' Margaret and Rose were to go ; and Rose 's young friends all came to take leave of her , and talk over the plan , and find Madeira in the map , and look at views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And a sailor-friend , who had been all over the world , used to come and describe Madeira as one of the most beautiful of all the beautiful places he had visited , and tell of its blue sea , fresh and bright , without storms ; its high mountains , neither barren nor bleak ; and its climate , so warm and soft , that Willy might sit out all day in the beautiful gardens under hedges of fragrant geraniums . And when Willy talked of enjoying the gardens while his stronger sisters were climbing the hills , there was more to be told of cradles borne upon men 's shoulders , in which Willy could be carried to the top of the highest hills as easily as his sisters on their mountain ponies . And now the packing was all finished , and the luggage sent on board , and every body was anxious to follow it ; for the ship was reported as quite comfortable , and the house was decidedly the reverse . Margaret and her father had been on board to arrange the cabins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit up a berth better than any body . He had caused all the furniture to be fastened , or , as he called it , cleated to the floor , that it might not roll about in rough weather . The books were secured in the shelves by bars , and swinging tables hung from the ceilings . Willy 's couch was in the most airy and convenient place at the stern cabin window , and there was an easy chair for him when he should be able to come out on deck . The ship was said to be in perfect order , whereas the house was in the utmost confusion and desolation : the carpets rolled up , the pictures taken down , the mirrors covered with muslin , the furniture and bookcases with canvass ; not a vestige left of former habits and occupations , except me and my little mansion . But in the midst of all the bustle , I was as calm and collected as if nothing had happened . I sat quietly in my arm-chair , staring composedly at all that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every body . Indeed , such was my placid , patient disposition , that I do not believe I should have uttered a sound or moved a muscle if the whole of London had fallen about my little ears . I did certainly sometimes wish to know what was to become of me , and at last that information was given me . The night before they sailed , Rose busied herself with Sarah in packing up my house and furniture , which were to be sent to a little girl who had long considered it her greatest treat to play with them . But Rose did not pack me up with my goods and chattels . ' My poor old Seraphina , ' said she , as she removed me from my arm-chair , ' you and I have passed many a happy day together , and I do not like to throw you away as mere rubbish ; but the new mistress of your house has already more dolls than she knows what to do with . You are no great beauty now , but I wish I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you please to give her to me , Miss Rose , ' said Sarah , ' my little niece , that your Mama is so kind as to put to school , would thank you kindly , and think her the greatest of beauties . ' ' Oh , then , take her by all means , Sarah , ' replied Rose ; ' and here is a little trunk to keep her clothes in . I remember I used to be very fond of that trunk ; so I dare say your little Susan will like it , though it is not quite new . ' ' That she will , and many thanks to you , Miss . Susan will be as delighted with it now , as you were a year or two ago . ' So they wrapped me up in paper , and Rose having given me a farewell kiss , which I would have returned if I could , Sarah put me and my trunk both into her great pocket ; and on the same day that my old friends embarked for their distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER III . And now began a third stage of my existence , and a fresh variety of life . I at first feared that I should have great difficulty in reconciling myself to the change ; and my reflections in Sarah 's dark pocket were of the most gloomy cast . I dreaded poverty and neglect . How should I , accustomed to the refinements of polished life and the pleasures of cultivated society , endure to be tossed about with no home of my own , and perhaps no one who really cared for me ? I knew that I was not in my first bloom , and it seemed unlikely that a new acquaintance should feel towards me like my old friend Rose , who had so long known my value . Perhaps I might be despised ; perhaps allowed to go ragged , perhaps even dirty ! My spirits sunk , and had I been human , I should have wept . But cheerful voices aroused me from this melancholy reverie , and I found myself restored to the pleasant light in the hands of a goodhumored-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears . For , although altered since the days of my introduction to the world in the bazaar , so that my beauty was not quite what it had been , I still retained charms enough to make me a valuable acquisition to a child who had not much choice of toys ; and my disposition and manners were as amiable and pleasing as ever . My new mistress and I soon loved each other dearly ; and in her family I learned that people might be equally happy and contented under very different outward circumstances . Nothing could well be more unlike my former home than that to which I was now introduced . Susan , my little mistress , was a child of about the same age as Rose when she first bought me ; but Susan had no money to spend in toys , and very little time to play with them , though she enjoyed them as much as Rose herself . She gave me a hearty welcome ; and though she could offer me no furnished house , with its elegancies and comforts , she assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf on which she kept her books , slate , needlework , and inkstand . And there I lived , sitting on my trunk , and observing human life from a new point of view . And though my dignity might appear lowered in the eyes of the unthinking , I felt that the respectability of my character was really in no way diminished ; for I was able to fulfil the great object of my existence as well as ever , by giving innocent pleasure , and being useful in my humble way . No other dolls now visited me ; but I was not deprived of the enjoyments of inanimate society , for I soon struck up an intimate acquaintance with an excellent Pen in the inkstand by my side , and we passed our leisure hours very pleasantly in communicating to each other our past adventures . His knowledge of life was limited , having resided in that inkstand , and performed all the writing of the family , ever since he was a quill . But his experience was wise and virtuous ; and he could bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had been the willing instrument ; and to many a hard struggle for honesty and independence , which figures of his writing had recorded . I liked to watch the good Pen at his work when the father of the family spent an hour in the evening in teaching Susan and her brothers to write ; or when the careful mother took him in hand to help her in balancing her accounts , and ascertaining that she owed no one a penny , before she ventured upon any new purchase . Then my worthy friend was in his glory ; and it was delightful to see how he enjoyed his work . He had but one fault , which was a slight tendency to splutter ; and as he was obliged to keep that under restraint while engaged in writing , he made himself amends by a little praise of himself , when relating his exploits to a sympathising friend like myself . On his return with the inkstand to the corner of my shelf , he could not resist sometimes boasting when he had not made a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how much the thinness of Susan 's upstrokes , or the thickness of her downstrokes , was owing to the clearness of his slit or the fineness of his nib . The family of which we made part lived frugally and worked hard : but they were healthy and happy . The father with his boys went out early in the morning to the daily labor by which they maintained the family . The mother remained at home , to take care of the baby and do the work of the house . She was the neatest and most careful person I ever saw , and she brought up her daughter Susan to be as notable as herself . Susan was an industrious little girl , and in her childish way worked almost as hard as her mother . She helped to sweep the house , and nurse the baby , and mend the clothes , and was as busy as a bee . But she was always tidy ; and though her clothes were often old and shabby , I never saw them dirty or ragged . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan was even superior to my old friend Rose . Rose would break her strings , or lose her buttons , or leave holes in her gloves , till reproved by her Mama for untidiness : but Susan never forgot that ' a stitch in time saves nine , ' and the stitch was never wanting . She used to go to school for some hours every day : and I should have liked to go with her , and help her in her studies , especially when I found that she was learning the multiplication-table , and I remembered how useful I had been to Rose in that very lesson ; but dolls were not allowed at school , and I was obliged to wait patiently for Susan 's company till she had finished all her business , both at school and at home . She had so little time to bestow upon me , that at first I began to fear that I should be of no use to her . The suspicion was terrible ; for the wish to be useful has been the great idea of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be my latest pleasure . I could be happy under almost any change of circumstances ; but as long as a splinter of me remains , I should never be able to reconcile myself to the degradation of thinking that I had been of no use . But I soon found I was in no danger of what I so much dreaded . In fact , I seemed likely to be even more useful to Susan than to Rose . Before I had been long in the house , she said one evening that she had an hour to spare , and that she would make me some clothes . ' Well and good , ' answered her mother ; ' only be sure to put your best work in them . If you mind your work , the doll will be of great use to you , and you can play without wasting your time . ' This was good hearing for Susan and me , and she spent most of her leisure in working for me . While she was thus employed , I came down from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Rose and her companions waited at my table . A great change took place in my wardrobe . Rose had always dressed me in gay silks and satins , without much regard to under clothing ; for , she said , as my gowns must be sewn on , what did any petticoats signify ? So she sewed me up , and I looked very smart ; and if there happened to be any unseemly cobbling , she hid it with beads or spangles . Once I remember a very long stitch baffled all her contrivances , and she said I must pretend it was a new-fashioned sort of embroidery . But Susan scorned all make-shifts . Nothing could have been more unfounded than my fears of becoming ragged or dirty . My attire was plain and suited to my station , but most scrupulously finished . She saw no reason why my clothes should not be made to take off and on , as well as if I had been a doll three feet high . So I had my plain gingham gowns with strings and buttons ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped , hemmed and stitched , like any lady 's ; and every thing was neatly marked with my initial S. But what Susan and I were most particularly proud of , was a pair of stays . They were a long time in hand , for the fitting them was a most difficult job ; but when finished , they were such curiosities of needlework , that Susan 's neat mother herself used to show off the stitching and the eyelet-holes to every friend that came to see her . Among them , Sarah the housemaid , who was sister to Susan 's father , often called in to ask after us all . She was left in charge of the house where my former friends had lived , and they sometimes sent her commissions to execute for them . Then she was sure to come and bring us news of the family , as she always called Rose and her relations . Sometimes she told us that Master William was a little better ; sometimes that she heard Miss Rose was very much grown ; she had generally something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One evening , soon after my apparel was quite completed , I was sitting on my trunk , as pleased with myself as Susan was with me , when Sarah 's head peeped in at the door . ' Good evening to you all , ' said she ; ' I thought as I went by you would like to hear that I have a letter from the family , and all 's well . I have got a pretty little job to do for Master Willy . He is to have a set of new shirts sent out directly , made of very fine thin calico , because his own are too thick . See , here is the stuff I have been buying for them . ' ' It is beautiful calico , to be sure , ' said Susan 's mother ; ' but such fine stuff as that will want very neat work . I am afraid you will hardly be able to make them yourself . ' ' Why , no , ' answered Sarah , smiling and shaking her head . ' I am sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having learned to work neatly when I was young . Take warning by me , Susan , and mind your needlework now-a-days . If I could work as neatly as your mother , my mistress would have made me lady 's maid and housekeeper by this time . But I could not learn any but rough work , more 's the pity : so I say again , take warning by me , little niece ; take pattern by your mother . ' Susan looked at me and smiled , as much as to say , ' I have taken pattern by her ; ' but she had not time to answer , for Sarah continued , addressing the mother : Illustration : Page 106 ' How I wish you could have time to do this job ! for it would bring you in a pretty penny , and I know my mistress would be pleased with your work ; but they are to be done very quickly , in time for the next ship , and I do not see that you could get through them with only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hands , ' cried Susan ; ' here are mine . ' ' Ah , but what can they do ? ' asked Sarah , ' and how can they do it ? It is not enough to have four fingers and a thumb . Hands must be handy . ' ' And so they are , ' answered Susan 's mother . ' See whether any hands could do neater work than that . ' And she pointed me out to Sarah . Sarah took me up , and turned me from side to side . Then she looked at my hems , then at my seams , then at my gathers , while I felt truly proud and happy , conscious that not a long stitch could be found in either . ' Well to be sure ! ' exclaimed she , after examining me all over ; ' do you mean that all that is really Susan 's own work ? ' ' Every stitch of it , ' replied the mother ; ' and I think better need not be put into any shirt , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' You never said a truer word , neither for Master William nor for little Susan , ' replied Sarah ; ' and I wish you joy , Susan , of being able to help your mother so nicely , for now I can leave you the job to do between you . ' She then told them what was to be the payment for the work , which was a matter I did not myself understand , though I could see that it gave them great satisfaction . The money came at a most convenient time , to help in fitting out Susan 's brother Robert for a place which had been offered to him in the country . It was an excellent place ; but there were several things , as his mother well knew , that poor Robert wanted at starting , but would not mention for fear his parents should distress themselves to obtain them for him . Both father and mother had been saving for the purpose , without saying any thing about it to Robert ; but they almost despaired of obtaining more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money came into their hands so opportunely . The father was in the secret , but Robert could scarcely believe his eyes , when one evening his mother and Susan laid on the table before him , one by one , all the useful articles he wished to possess . At first he seemed almost more vexed than pleased , for he thought of the saving and the slaving that his mother must have gone through to gain them ; but when she told him how much of them was due to his little sister 's neatness and industry , and how easy the work had been when shared between them , he was as much pleased as Susan herself . We were all very happy that evening , including even the humble friends on the shelf ; for I sat on my trunk , and related to the Pen how useful I had been in teaching Susan to work ; and the worthy Pen stood bolt upright in his inkstand , and confided to me with honest pride , that Robert had been chosen to his situation on account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose we all grew older , as I noticed from time to time various changes that seemed to proceed from that cause . The baby , for instance , though still going by the name of ' Baby , ' had become a strong able-bodied child , running alone , and very difficult to keep out of mischief . The most effectual way of keeping her quiet was to place me in her hands , when she would sit on the floor nursing me by the hour together , while her mother and sister were at work . Susan was become a tall strong girl , more notable than ever , and , like Rose before her , she gradually bestowed less attention on me ; so that I was beginning to feel myself neglected , till on a certain birthday of her little sister 's , she declared her intention of making me over altogether to the baby-sister for a birthday present . Then I once more rose into importance , and found powers which I thought declining , still undiminished . The baby gave a scream of delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Till then she had only possessed one toy in the world , an old wooden horse , in comparison with which I seemed in the full bloom of youth and beauty . This horse , which she called JACK , had lost not merely the ornaments of mane and tail , but his head , one fore and one hind leg ; so that nothing remained of the once noble quadruped but a barrel with the paint scratched off , rather insecurely perched upon a stand with wheels . But he was a faithful animal , and did his work to the last . The baby used to tie me on to his barrel , and Jack and I were drawn round and round the kitchen with as much satisfaction to our mistress , as in the days when I shone forth , in my gilt coach with its four prancing piebalds . But the baby 's treatment of me , though gratifying from its cordiality , had a roughness and want of ceremony that affected my enfeebled frame . I could not conceal from myself that the infirmities I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Nobody ever said a harsh word to me , or dropped a hint of my being less pretty than ever , and the baby called me ' Beauty , beauty , ' twenty times a day ; but still I knew very well that not only had my rosy color and fine hair disappeared , but I had lost the whole of one leg and half of the other , and the lower joints of both my arms . In fact , as my worthy friend the Pen observed , both he and I were reduced to stumps . The progress of decay caused me no regret , for I felt that I had done my work , and might now gracefully retire from public life , and resign my place to newer dolls . But though contented with my lot , I had still one anxious wish ungratified . The thought occupied my mind incessantly ; and the more I dwelt upon it , the stronger grew the hope that I might have a chance of seeing my old first friends once more . This was now my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time . Sarah brought word that Master William was better ; that they had left Madeira , and gone travelling about elsewhere . Then that the father had been in England upon business , and gone back again ; that Mr. Edward had been over to foreign parts one summer holidays to see his family , and on his return had come to give her an account of them . Sarah was always very bustling when she had any news to bring of the family , but one day she called on us in even more flurry than usual . She was quite out of breath with eagerness . ' Sit down and rest a minute before you begin to speak , ' said her quiet sister-in-law . ' There must be some great news abroad . It seems almost too much for you . ' Susan nodded , and began to unpack a great parcel she had brought with her . ' It do n't seem bad news , to judge by your face , ' said the other ; for now that Sarah had recovered breath , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think words superfluous . ' I guess , I guess , ' cried Susan . ' They are coming home . ' ' They are , indeed , ' answered Sarah at last ; ' they are coming home as fast as steam-engines can bring them : and here is work more than enough for you and mother till they come . Miss Margaret is going to be married , and you are to make the wedding-clothes . ' So saying , she finished unpacking her parcel , and produced various fine materials which required Susan 's neatest work . ' These are for you to begin with , ' said she , ' but there is more coming . ' She then read a letter from the ladies with directions about the needlework , to which Susan and her mother listened with great attention . Then Sarah jumped up , saying she must not let the grass grow under her feet , for she had plenty to do . The whole house was to be got ready ; and she would not have a thing out of its place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any money . Susan and her mother lost no time either ; their needles never seemed to stop : and I sat on the baby 's lap watching them , and enjoying the happy anticipation that my last wish would soon be accomplished . But though Susan was as industrious as a girl could be , and just now wished to work harder than ever , she was not doomed to ' all work and no play ; ' for her father took care that his children should enjoy themselves at proper times . In summer evenings , after he came home from his work , they used often to go out all together for a walk in the nearest park , when he and his wife would rest under the trees , and read over Robert 's last letter , while the children amused themselves . Very much we all enjoyed it , for even I was seldom left behind . Susan would please the baby by dressing me in my best clothes for the walk ; and the good-natured father would laugh merrily at us , and remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all very happy ; and when my thoughts travelled to other scenes and times , I sometimes wondered whether my former friends enjoyed themselves as much in their southern gardens , as this honest family in their English fields . Our needlework was finished and sent to Sarah 's care to await Margaret 's arrival , for which we were very anxious . On returning home one evening after our walk , we passed , as we often did , through the street in which I had formerly lived . Susan was leading her little sister , who , on her part , clutched me in a way very unlike the gentleness which Susan bestowed upon her . On arriving at the well-known house , we saw Sarah standing at the area-gate . We stopped to speak to her . ' When are they expected ? ' asked Susan 's mother . ' They may be here any minute , ' answered Sarah ; ' Mr. Edward has just brought the news . ' The street-door now opened , and two gentlemen came out and stood on the steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man ; but I could not mistake the open good-humored countenance of my old friend Edward . The other was older , and I recognised him as the traveller who used to describe Madeira to Willy . They did not notice us , for we stood back so as not to intrude , and their minds were evidently fully occupied with the expected meeting . We all gazed intently down the street , every voice hushed in eager interest . Even my own little mistress , usually the noisiest of her tribe , was silent as myself . It was a quiet street and a quiet time , and the roll of the distant carriages would scarcely have seemed to break the silence , had it not been for our intense watching , and hoping that the sound of every wheel would draw nearer . We waited long , and were more than once disappointed by carriages passing us and disappearing at the end of the street . Edward and his friend walked up and down , east and west , north and south , in hopes of descrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailing walk , they took up their post again on the steps . At last a travelling carriage laden with luggage turned the nearest corner , rolled towards us , and stopped at the house . The two gentlemen rushed down the steps , flung open the carriage-door , and for some moments all was hurry and agitation , and I could distinguish nothing . I much feared that I should now be obliged to go home without actually seeing my friends , for they had passed so quickly from the carriage to the house , and there had been so much confusion and excitement during those few seconds , that my transient glance scarcely allowed me to know one from another ; but in course of time Sarah came out again , and asked Susan 's father to help in unloading the carriage , desiring us to sit meanwhile in the housekeeper 's room . So we waited till the business was finished , when , to my great joy , we were summoned to the sitting-room , and I had the happiness of seeing all the family once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were altered than I. I had been half afraid that I might see one without a leg , another without an arm , according to the dilapidations which had taken place in my own frame ; but strange to say , their sensitive bodies , which felt every change of weather , shrunk from a rough touch , and bled at the scratch of a pin , had outlasted mine , though insensible to pain or sickness . There stood the father , scarcely altered ; his hair perhaps a little more gray , but his eyes as quick and bright as ever . And there was the mother , still grave and gentle , but looking less sad and careworn than in the days of Willy 's constant illness . And there was , first in interest to me , my dear mistress , Rose , as tall as Margaret , and as handsome as Edward . I could not imagine her condescending to play with me now . Margaret looked just as in former times , good and graceful ; but she stood a little apart with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper to Susan that the wedding was to take place in a fortnight . They were only waiting for Geoffrey to arrive . His ship was daily expected , and they all wished him to be present . And Willy , for whose sake the long journey had been made , how was he ? Were all their hopes realized ? Edward shook his head when Susan 's mother asked that question ; but Willy was there to answer it himself . He was standing by the window , leaning on a stick , it is true , but yet able to stand . As he walked across the room , I saw that he limped slightly , but could move about where he pleased . He still looked thin and pale , but the former expression of suffering and distress had disappeared , and his countenance was as cheerful as his manner . I could see that he was very much better , though not in robust health like Edward 's . He thanked Susan 's mother for her kind inquiries , and said that , though he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained health more than enough to satisfy himself ; that he was most thankful for his present comfort and independence ; and that if he was not quite so strong as other people , he hoped he should at any rate make a good use of the strength that was allowed him . Turning to Edward , who still looked disappointed , he continued : ' Who could have ventured to hope , Edward , three years ago , that you and I should now be going to college together ? ' And then even Edward smiled and seemed content . As we turned to leave the room , Susan and her little sister lingered for a moment behind the others , and the child held me up towards Rose . Rose started , and exclaimed , ' Is it possible ? It really is my poor old Seraphina . Who would have thought of her being still in existence ? What a good , useful doll she has been ! I really must give her a kiss once more for old friendship 's sake . ' So saying , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . And now there remains but little more for me to relate . My history and my existence are fast drawing to an end ; my last wish has been gratified by my meeting with Rose , and my first hope realized by her praise of my usefulness . She has since given the baby a new doll , and I am finally laid on the shelf , to enjoy , in company with my respected friend the Pen , a tranquil old age . When he , like myself , was released from active work , and replaced by one of Mordan 's patent steel , he kindly offered to employ his remaining leisure in writing from my dictation , and it is in compliance with his advice that I have thus ventured to record my experience . That experience has served to teach me that , as all inanimate things have some destined use , so all rational creatures have some appointed duties , and are happy and well employed while fulfilling them . With this reflection , I bid a grateful farewell to those young patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my memoirs , contentedly awaiting the time when the small remnant of my frame shall be reduced to dust , and my quiet existence sink into a still more profound repose . THE END .
