txt /z/ Such well-cultivated capacity may be known as good sense , since it avails for the induction of many jbcts in sensible experience ; or it may be termed good judgmenty since it is competent to use such facts in comprehensive practical conclusions . But this is the most that can truly be said of it in its highest degrees of perfection . To call its results , in the broadest generalizations good philosophy would be wholly to mistake the name and the thing ; since this practical experience can use facts only , and its most general judgments can attain acts only , while the distinctive work of philosophy is to go back of the facts , and attain and apply the principles which determine why the acts are so . Man has the capacity for this , which the animal has not ; an endowment differing utterly in kind and not merely in degree . Man can , therefore , philosophize and interpret fitcts , while the animal can only judge according to &cts.; By the insight of reason , which no animal can exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the act and which , wholly unmade itself controlled and guided the maker of the &ct; in all its construction . The objects of the most general judgments of the understanding are still only facts , things made ; and if they have been intelligently made and are capable of any rational explication by their maker , or by others , they must have had their unmade principle for each , present in the mind of the maker , and that guided in his making , and which he has so put into the &ct; that it has become the nature of the fact , and the law of its being and working , and whose light alone can guide to any proper philosophical account of the fact it has determined . Thus , the steam engine was // not as a fact , until its principle was already in the mind of its inventor , and this principle he did not make but found , and which having found , he went on to put into the feet he febricated as the law of its peculiar being . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when often the principle without the feet would not have been discovered , but when in any way the principle is attained , whether as the product of original genius or learned from his works , it is that by which we may give the explication why the feet was thus and not of some other nature . The feet not only must be known , the principle which was before its making must also be known , or we can have no rational philosophy about it . Now , just such application of eternal and immutable principle is demanded for the philosophical study of universal nature . Observation may give its many particular fects , and general conclusions from broad inductions may assume to have found facts of universal comprehension , yet are these highest fects necessarily , thus , unexplained facts , and as without any known principle themselves , they must be ever wholly incompetent to lead to any philosophical interpretation of the included fects which may be classified under them . One feet may thus be gained , as that which shall make all fects turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a universe still we can thus have it and its included universe only as a feet , with no possible rational philosophy of any thing . If we know the fact that nature is a universe , we have no principle by which we can at all interpret why it is so . Thus , by wide experiment and profound calculation the great feet of universal gravitation in matter has been as- /z/ sumed , and the condusion has been reached that all matter gravitates toward all other matter , directly as the quantity and inversely as the square of the distance , and we bind nature in a universe by it ; but at the most , this is only given as a ict , with no principle that has so determined it , and it can therefore only give the universe as a &ct; and afford no possible rational explication of it . If we have not the unmade principle determining the fact of gravity so to be , and with just such ratios , then have we no rational science of nature , and what we call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary making ; and no philosophy ior terpreting the making by its principle . The vast superstructure we have reared is all the work of the logical understanding , without one ray of the expounding reason to shine on it and through it . The whole frame-work has been put together , with much of human toil and din , from the outside , but no eye has found and fixed its absorbing gaze upon that inner force which , in the reality , has been silently making living stones grow together to be the Lord 's holy Temple . Till we attain this eternal principle , which as a living law the Maker of the universe has diffused all through it from centre to circumference , we may stand on the outside and measure and weigh , and overwhelm the understanding with the summations of arithmetical reckonings , but we shall know nothing of that central working which makes and holds all in one concrete cosmos of perpetual harmony and beauty . Universal nature is more than bare fact ; it is something made under the determining conditions of unmade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being and all its ongoings have been determined , has now its /z/ connterpart in nature as the perpetual law of its working , and the human reason may find at least some glimpses of it and interpret the great plan by it , and may so far know what nature is , and why it is thus , and not forever rest in the mere knowledge that it is . If , indeed , we can not extend our knowledge beyond the bare fects of experience , then must we perforce content ourselves with the mere phenomena of nature , but we may not assume that any such knowledge is a science of nature , for this can not be attained except as we reach and apply the determining principle . A rational cosmology is the only true natural philosophy . This immutable principle , which determines how the fact may be , and , if the &ct; be at all , how it must be , is given in pure thought alone , and can be no appearance in the sense . either can it be that which connects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that is effected in the substance ; nor that which connects the successive events into one series , for that must be done through the cause ; but the principle lies stiU further back , and determines the natures of substances and causes themselves , and stands as the archetype or ideal pattern after which the essential natures of things have been created . It is the consistent thought , as idea , how the fact may be , and when carried in combination through all fiicts , it becomes the consistent idea of how a universe may be . All the statics and dynamics of nature were arranged by it , and thus it was before the forces of nature and their balanced action became facts , and therefore existed as a subjective ideal in the mind of the Maker of the universe only . The principle as in being before the act and which is to determine the /z/ act has not yet been brought out into objective existence , but subsists as mental being alone . The principle , thus , is not science , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shall become fact , may be subjected to science . As a general illustration of the being and application of all immutable principles , I may adduce the subjective thought of an arch , or of a catenary curve , and may so apply these in a completed projection as to have the ideal of a standing or of a hanging bridge ; or , I may take the subjective thought of a mechanical power , and follow out the composition and resolution of forces till I have projected some ideal engine ; and I shall then have the bridge or the engine in pure thought , and which will be subjective pattern of what the bridge or the engine must be , if they become manifest in objective feet . At the most , here will be the science of the possible only . It may even be that nature will not admit of these ideals becoming facts . Perhaps my projected structure is such , that no actual materials would bear their weight in the bridge , or the pressure of such a force in the machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual thing . The theory is self-consistent , but the fact would be self-contradictory . The science can not be complete until both the principle , as self-consistent thought , has been obtained , and this principle has also found its actual counterpart , as the existing law of the combined materials . So , on the other hand , I may have seen a bridge resting on such a material arch , or suspended on such chains ; or , I may have seen a machine moving with such a mechanical power ; and then I can , by experimental measure and weight , make other constructions like to these , and thus /z/ actually pat the law of the models into the acts I have made to imitate them . But inasmnch as my work has been only an imitation , and I have recognized and applied no law in the facts which had been determined by an immutable principle , I can not be said in having the act to have any proper science of it . Thus the subjective idea alone is not complete science ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first is only the knowledge of the possible , the last is only the knowledge of the empirical ; but when the subjective idea as the principle determining the fact , and the objective law as put by the principle into the fact , are both attained as accordant counterparts of each other , we have then both an interpreting principle and an interpreted fact , and in this is complete science . The whole process in its attainment is a rational philosophy . A Rational Cosmology must conform to this criterion of all science , and only in so far forth as it is kept within the constant circumscription of such criterion can it have any claim to a rational philosophy . All that is fact - the entire cosmos , as a making after a principle - may be so subjected to philosophy by an adequate insight of reason . But the cosmos , or world of fact , must have its Maker . A universe , coming up successively or collectively out of a void of all being , would be an impossible conception . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial , and therein to think an absurdity . This Creator of the cosmos must be wholly absolved from all the conditions determining the cosmos ; he must origin nate it , and give to it its nature while he is wholly supernatural ; and thus , as the author of all &ct; and not himself /z/ a act or a making , he can not be Bubjected to any science by the finite reason . It may be demonstrated that God exists , and that he is absolute , in the sense of complete absolution from all the conditioned necessities in nature ; but there can be neither a principle as archetype after which he was made , nor a law which works in him as a constituted act and subjecting him to its nature , and thus the criterion of all science is inapplicable to the Deity as subject to philosophy . When we have demonstrated that God is , and that he is absolutely supernatural , we have all that Theology demands , and do not need to bring him within the definir tions of philosophy . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither can exclude the other , nor can the one be identified in the other . There is a dualism ; the world is not without its Maker , and the Maker is not in and of the world ; the theology rests on the proof tJiat ( Jod is , the philosophy rests in the interpreting Jiow the world is ; and all philosophy without theology is incomprehensible , and all theology without philosophy is a credulous superstition . All blending and confounding of the two will be destructive of both . If the universe be absorbed in the Deity , it is Pantheism ; if the Deity be lost in the universe , it is Pancosmism . But the unphilosophical Pantheism will be Atheism , and the atheistic Pancosmism will annihilate all philosophy in absurdity . The whole design includes the attainment of a clear conception of what is essential in a Being that must be the Maker of the imiverse ; and then , a clear conception also of the immutable principles that must determine the lawfi ! , and by which we may expound the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , capable of // originating material worlds from himself without himself being subjected to any of the conditions of matter . But we may rest in the demonstration that such a supernatural Being is , without attempting the solecism of attaining a principle that is philosophically to interpret the absolute principium and determine why he is . In reference to the theology , there may be complete satisfection attained in the use of a true rational Psychology ; but the new and severe task demanded is in reference to the philosophy . There is the necessity for the instauration of a true science of the univerBe - a rational cosmology . It will assist much in setting clearly before the mind the urgent necessity for such a work , if we rapidly look over the track of past philosophical investigation , and notice the prominent attitudes in which philosophy has stood , and the positions now occupied by distinguished schools or the representative men who speak authoritatively for them . In the earliest ages of Grecian history we find the dawn of all philosophical thinking , so far as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisted in the construction of theories , more or less crude , concerning the origin of material nature and the arrangement of the world . The various early cosmogonies , though partially and obscurely transmitted to us , are sufficient to determine what was the scope and bearing of their philosophical speculations . The germ of any intelligible theory is first found in the recognition of some of the elemental forces in nature , and assuming that their action was sufficient to account for the formation of the universe . The natures and powers of these elements were taken as already in being , and each philosopher assumed and applied them in speculation , as he /z/ deemed them to be the most fiivorable in accomiting for the varied phenomemi . The Ionic class of philosophers were among the earliest , and their philosophizing was mainly in the above method . Thales made the element of water to be the chief ingredient in the composition of material nature , and taught that the forces here acting had been the primitive agents in the construction of the imiverse . Anaximenes , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the air had given the first formative processes in the arrangements of nature ; and Anaximander had some vague conception of higher elemental powers not in any distinct form of manifestation , but existing as a chaos of rudimental being , out of which an orderly arrangement ultimately emerged . These recognized , each in his way , the presence of efficient agencies already in existence , but seem not to have arisen to any speculative conclusions concerning the origin of any of these elemental forces that they assumed as active in the formation of worlds . There was some first cause , but they did not go beyond already existing elementary forces to find it . Pythagoras is one of the most conspicuous of the early philosophers , and enough is transmitted to us to prove that his clearness and force of philosophic thought was quite beyond the age in which he flourished . He seems to have apprehended the distinct faculty of the human mind to attain to truths beyond the sensuous perceptions , and to reach necessary and immutable principles . The axioms which determine in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulae , and the harmony ot tones in music had been intuitively apprehended by him , 34 DnxoDXTcnoN. and he had hence learned to guide his philosophical specu* lations by those permanent truths that must condition and correct all the fleeting perceptions of the sense , and by which must be interpreted and explained all the seeming anomalies and contradictions in the phenomenal world . He had learned to apply principles to fects , and thus had found tihe right method for a true philosophy . The effort to clothe his systematic thought in mathematical phraseology and to represent the physical forces of nature under the forms and ratios of number , has left very much that remains to us of his philosophy , from the representations of those who followed him , quite ambiguous and obscure ; but it is still easy to gain a correct and profound meaning from many of these representations . Others , that are so enigmatical that little can be made from them , were probably clear in his own apprehension , and need now only the necessary clue to lead us through the obscurities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of the universe was not yet approached in their philosophizing , nor had there been any distinct conception of some independent author by whom a proper creation , a beginning of things , could be made . Parmenides argued that non-being was inconceivable , and that as something could not come from nothing , therefore creation , in the sense of absolute origination , was impossible . Empedocles also taught , that the elementary matter of the universe , in the hyle or primary mdimental substance , was itself uncreated and indestructible . Heraclitus taught that this elementary matter was in constant flux , and that such perpetual flow of the component elements kept nature in a continual succession of becoming and departing phenomena ; but he recognized PB0GBE8S OF PBILOSOPHIOAL mVESTIGATION. 2S nothing that could originate and orderiy control and goide these flowing movements . He held aQ things to be of &ee^; and yet not in the same way that the Ionic philosophers had applied the forces of the natural elements , but rather because fire is of so penetrating a nature , and decomposing other substances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among the Sophists , Protagoras took this constant arising and departing , as the necessary result from our mode of knowing , and in which all things must be fleeting and transient as our sensations present them . Man was made the measure of all things , and to every man , his own consciousness in his perceptions must be to him the truth . What his senses gave , that , to him , the things themselves were , and every man must follow his own measure . The old atomic philosophy , again , reduced all of nature to an original being in indivisible and indestructible atoms , and brought those atoms together in bodies , either by a idling together , or by an inner deflecting force , which turned them out of their proper course in their descent , and thus collected them in masses . There was no occasion for a creating and superintending Deity , for all things were provided in the original atoms . The whole philosophy was entirely atheistic . Anaxagoras seems first to have found and traced the indices of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptations were the evidence of design ; and he accordingly taught that there was a Mind concerned in the formation of the worlds fi-om their chaotic state . But this vooc , or intelligence , was apprehended rather as subjectively in the world itself and a kind of inworking power that 26 iNTBODxrcnoN. ordered and arranged its changes as an indwelling law , than any independent and personal agent . With him , there was no rising above nature and apprehending a supernatural and rational Creator , and Governor , but merely an attainment of the facts of design , and workings of an inward intelligence , without referring them to any thing beyond nature itself . The world was , and had its own intelligent activity within itself and thus the universe was mind as well as matter . Plato was the great master philosopher of the age . He not only recognized clearly the vov9 , or intelligence , manifested in the adaptations of nature , as they had been found and taught by Anaxagoras , but he referred this intdligent adaptation to ends , directly to a supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Pythagoras , those necessary and immutable principles , which , antecedently to all facts , regulate and determine in the production of facts , and necessitate the conditions in the ongoings of nature . He is emphatically the rational thinker of humanity , and his conception of philosophy that which must correct all subsequent erroneous methods of speculation . Only in returning to his method , can modem wanderers in new paths be turned about again into the old and safe highway . With Plato , the universe stands out as one consistent whole in itself , and this universe the product of an independent and personal Creator . The Absolute Good had , from eternity , the Ideas , or Archetypes , in himself , and he produced and fashioned the universe from himself accordingly . Xenophanes had , before this , generalized the many into the one , and made all to stand as parts of the whole , and had called this whole , God . He was in /z/ truth , the first philosophical Pantheist . But Plato 's whole was the whole of nature only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independent of itself . Sometimes , it is true , that the insoluble difficulty of accounting for evil under the absolute dominion of the Grood , leads Plato to reason as if matter was the source of all evil , and that this had an existence , as it were , independent of God , and in this way freeing God from connection with evil which , in the necessity of the case , could not be excluded . But this is not the doctrine systematically held and taught by Plato . In the TimsBus , the matured and labored philosophy of Plato is given ; and here we have one supreme Absolute Mind , producing the Universe from himself and making it one Uving whole by infusing all through it the informing Idea as the soul of the world . Gd is , and then the world is made by him , and the intelligent Idea or law is put into it , and thus nature moves on , as a living thing , to fulfil its grand design . The Platonic philosophy has its first moveTj in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotion , or progress in space , but it includes all changes . Motion in space ; growth and decrease ; arising and vanishing ; beginning and annihilation ; the inner activity of thought and all spiritual agency ; all involve the conception of movement ; change ; and necessarily imply a constant or permanent , from which all change must spring That which is mutable , and thus- perishable , has been generated from that which is unchangeable and eternal . The mutable is the subject of sensuous knowledge and comes within experience ; the constant and eternal can be cog nized only in the rational intellect . An immutable and // eternal Ood , having in himself the patterns , or perfect ideas of all things , generated the Universe from hnnself ; vitalized or ensouled it , by putting the eternal Ideas into it ; thus making nature to possess a living force and an orderly intelligent activity . The Universe is itself , thus , a tme good , as the free product of the absolute Grood ; and having efficiency , activity , orderly intelligent progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were itself a living thing , a Messed god : ' This Platonic philosophy completely avoids both Atheism and Pantheism , and is thoroughly Theistic . The pagan polytheism which it recognizes is in no sense contradictory to pure monotheism . The Absolute Spirit is ever held as supreme , independent , and eternal . He first makes soul , as better and thus older than body ; and from this soul of the universe , as originated direct from the Absolute Good , there is successively generated all other spirits , and with Plato , all spiritual being is a god . The Absolute Good is , however , with him the God of all gods . The philosophy falters in nothing that is necessary to a true personal Deity ; a God utterly supernatural , and wholly distinct from and independent of the universe which he makes and governs . The theology is conceived and preserved pure and unadulterated from any material conditioning or physical necessitating . But while his philosophy of the material Universe proceeds always in the true method of accounting for feet by principle , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus often a wide misapplication of it . Physical facts were but partially attained and confrisedly apprehended , and the age of humanity was not then sufficiently advanced to be FBOGBESS OF PHILOBOPHIOAL nESTIOATION. 29 able to read clearly the law in the fact , because of this imperfect comprehension of the &ct.; The insight of reason was , with Plato , superlatively penetrating , but the ground in which the eternal principles must reveal themselves was not plain and full before him . The great &ct; of a creation was dear , and he saw in it the certainty of a free and independent Creator ; and the great truth , that this creation must conform to the immutable Ideas , or principles of absolute reason , was clear , but all these principles could not be exactly attained , because the laws in the phenomenal acts which disclose them had not been minutely observed . Only reason can see the principle in the fact , but to reason , the apprehended &ct; is often the only ground in which the Eternal Idea will present itsel The creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it shall beforehand see all objective laws that shall xist , would be more than human . The great merit of Plato , therefore , is not the ftilness and exactness of a religious system - for in many doctrines there is the deficiency and error which was to have been anticipated in a pagan - nor the thoroughness and &ultlessness; of his system of natural science - for his ignorance of many acts made him Mter in the attainment and application of many principles - but the prompt introduction and stead &st; maintenance of the true method of all philosophizing relatively to the origin of the universe . His conception of a true rational cosmology is perfect . He has both a theology and a philosophy , and he puts and keeps both in their proper places . He never degrades the supreme Good to be the mere animus mundi nor does he exalt nature to the throne of the Deity . His " soul of the world " wholly // dispenses with the necessity of a D &u; eas mocAuia , and gives to the Universe perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is atiU the creature of God , and working orderly and rationally . Plato never contents himself with bare icts , but the fiMst is as nothing to him till he can bring it under the determination of a principle . He recognizes in the supreme Grood , an agency that can absolutely begin ; an independent personality that can originate from himself without the supposition of an already previously constituted nature cauang him to do this . His God is supernatural ; Spirit in liberty ; Absolute personality ; and the created Universe is the free rational product of this Grod ; intelligible and wholly explicable from the eternal Ideas ; a consistent cosmos ; fitct pervaded by principle . Since the age of Plato , philosophy has been little Platonic . The New Academy had nothing of his spirit . The Xew-Platonism of the Alexandrian school was , also , altogether a corruption . The blending of Orientalism made it a perversion and not a perpetuation of Platonism . The intellectual vision , by which the human soul apprehended the eternal Ideas , and came to the recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation , in which it was sought to identify the contemplating philosopher with the contemplated Deity , and give the human soul to be swallowed up in the divine . The Akistotkliax philosophy at once , after Plato , struck determinately into quite another path . The too much extended and thereby confused application of the Idea , by Plato , had made the Aristotelian philosophiang necessary . In the Idea Plato had included not only the /z/ archetypes which were eternally in the Divine Reason , and the primitive forces which are the principles or germs from which universal nature is developed , but also all general conceptions from which , by virtue of their participation therein , all the particulars of the class have their being , and these ideas in this broad sense were also held by him to be true and valid realities ; it thus became a demand of the reason that this broad assumption of real being should be critically examined . Originally , in its founder , the Aristotelian philosophy used the insight of reason , and recognized the Eternal principles necessary for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made to strike its root and find its explication only in metaphysics . The prima philosophiawBS essential to all philosophy . But the study was intently and intentionally turned to follow out nature on the phenomenal side , and not to hold philosophy perpetually under the control of eternal principles . Generalized acts were themselves put as principles , and a classification of phenomena under general acts came to be recognized as philosophy . Genera and species , put as categories under which might be classified all particulars , took the place of the eternal ideas , and instead of recognizing any being above sense , the veritable and immutable ideas of Plato were said to be only " things of sense immortalized . " At length , among his later followers , empty words , names instead of things , absorbed the whole attention ; and the purely logical understanding became the entire faculty for philosophizing , and this wholly exhausted itself in running through all the processes of syllogistic reasoning . Reason , as " the vision and the faculty divine , " distinct from the faculty connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overlooked , that it ceased to be recognized as a distinct &ct; in psychology . The law of the syllogism admitted no distribution in the conclusion which had not already been gathered in the major proposition , and the whole labor only analyzed what they had , but added nothing new . Experience attained all the &ct8; ; abstraction and generalization gave the logical notions ; and the syllogistic process analyzed and distributed in specific conclusions . A clearer knowledge of what they already had was secured , but nothing new was added , and nothing philosophically expounded in its principle . On emerging from the long and unsatis &ctory; strife of the scholastic logic , the human thought turned mainly into two distinct channels . Oabtesloosm , having some alliance with Platonism , ran out its course the earliest . This philosophy awakes in doubt , and casting around for what may resolve all doubt into clear certainty , and assuming that clearness is the test of truth , it finds an undoubted &ct; of thinking clearly in the consciousness . Here is the starting point for all philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cogito ergo sum . This is as much as saying - there is a thinking , and by thinking myself is found . Extension is also as clearly given in the consciousness as thought , and these two , thought and extension , are the essence of all being . The first is distinctive of spiritual being , and the last of material ; and these two are so wholly unlike and disparate , that no intercommimion can subsist between them . All interchange of activity between mind and matter , must be effected by the interposition of the Deity ; and hence the general doctrine of " divine assistance , " for all communication of the material with the spir- FBOGBESS OF PHILOSOPHIOAL INYESTiaATION. 33 itoaL The Deity was an d priori assnmption , from the prominence and clearness of the idea , which in itself inYolved a necessity . Extension , with its two modes of rest and motion , admitted of being broken into parts , and hence the atoms ; hence , also , the vortices induced in the nniversal breaking up , the collection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby the general arrangement of the universe . Geulincx added the perpetual interposition of the Deity , in all occasions when the spirit acted upon matter , or was affected by matter , and thus introduced the doetrine of ' Occasional Causes ; " and Malebranche reconciled the spiritual perception of material objects , by the existence of all things in the Deity ; and thus , through this divine medium , matter could be perceived by spirit , and hence his doctrine that ' ' we see all things in 6od ' ' Spinoza ultimately finished this order of thought , by bringing the duality of thought and extension into complete unity , and identified both in a higher Infinite substance . This Infinite substance is made the ground of all being ; and all the various manifestations of both thought and extension , spirit and matter , are but the varied attributes of the one Infinite substance . Leibnitz , it is true , changed the dead atoms of Des Cartes into reflecting or envisaging monads , and pre-arranged them so as to give their representations harmoniously one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fulfil the purposes of the " divine assistance " and the " occassional causes " before given ; but the Cartesian philosophy is truly consummated in Spinozism . No movement of thought can pass beyond the Infinite sub-/z/ // stance ; and all theology , and all philosophy , have the sama source , for the Infinite substance is the only God , and the philosophy of the universe is but the recognition of Grod 's manifested attributes . The Infinite substance , when sub jected to reflection , is truly only a fmbstTam for the phenomena of thought and extension , and is itself wholly dead and inert , except that it admits of these attributes to inhere in it . As a theology , it could not satisfy ; for this dead , inert , impersonal substance , was nothing that could be loved or worshipped . It solely sustained the spiritual and material worlds , but it could neither create nor govern them . As a philosophy , it could just as little satisfy ; since , although it furnished a unity for the disparate conceptionB of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity , and , though placed at the centre , could exert no efficiency and possess no inteUigent law or rational principle . The philosophic thought , dwelling upon this Infinite substance , could do nothing with it , nor make any thing out of it . It rwealed nothing , it interpreted nothing . Cartesianism began with the Platonic views of a " first mover , " and the competency to attain and apply A priori principles ; and the philosophy was carried onwards by attempting to apply the insight of reason , and follow the determinations of eternal idea . But this wa made absurd and impossible , since matter was essentially mere extension , passive , inert , and lawless ; and even all assumed spiritual divine action upon it was in violation of its fundamental doctrine - the essential incommunicability of all spirit with matter . At last , both spirit and matter were put in a substance which merely held them in identity , but could neither use nor control them , God and the universe were /z/ one ; but the pantheistic unity was utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no personality there with which piety could commune , and no principle there with which philosophy could work . The other channel of thought was the Baconian InduoTiYE Logic . This has run a much longer course , and turned in more varied directions , and yet it has mostly kept itself at a further remove from the great Platonic requisition , that aU philosophy must maintain an interpreting immutable principle at the centre . All the old scholastic syllogisms were built upon the analytical dictum , that what is true of the whole must be true of all the parts . This could lead to no extension of knowledge , for it obliged that the truth for the whole should be attained before it went to the work of distributing to the parts . The Inductive Logic exactly reverses the dictum , and builds upon the judgment , that what is true of all the parts is true of the whole . This allows scope for extending knowledge , for it encourages and obliges to the attainment of the truth for all the parts before concluding upon the truth for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not rest in barren results . All means to attain the truth of the parts wiU be desirable , and at once put in requisition . If , now , we may here rest upon the Platonic method , and from the insight of reason can affirm that nature , as itself a fact , has been made after the determinations of eternal principles , then we know that such determining principles must run their Hues all through nature , and we shall find no fact in nature that is not bound up by laws with its fellows . Instead , then , of trying to attain all the facts which go to make up 86 INTBODUCnON. the whole by a particular experiment for each , we may be safely content with an experience that reaches so &r; as fidrly to conyince that nature 's law has therein been found , and then we may cease from all further experiment , and logically conclude upon the truth for the whole . We have found nature 's law , and we know that this law must hold all the parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long labor of a universal experience . So Bacon , and long before Bacon , so Aristotle philosophized ; and hence the organon of the latter , and the nommi organon of the former . But if the Platonic doctrine is all assumption , and the reason 's insight of principle and law in nature is a delusion , then must our actual experience run through every part before we may at all conclude upon the truth for the whole . The inductive logic is open to skepticism on all sides , so soon as we deny that reason is capable to attain and put eternal principles at its foundation . Without this , we have no right to assign any laws to nature , and can only say , so &r; forth as experience has gone , so the facts are ; but we have nothing to sustain our footsteps , beyond experience . And if we should deduce a general judgment from an induction of many particulars , as if the actual experiment had extended to all , such an assumed general judgment could only include the bare act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we could only use it to classify particular facts under it , but not in any way philosophically to explain them . Thus , without the insight of reason , the inductive logic begins and prosecutes its work in credulity , and when it deduces its general fact , it can never evince its validity , and the assumption can only be of a dry , hard , insoluble /z/ fact , which can never find its principles to explain why it must have been thus and not otherwise . We may make one &ct; dependent upon another , and thus upward through an indefinite series , but we can reach to no principle that supports and expounds the whole chain . A true inductive process must both begin in the application of immutable principle for the determination of nar ture , and its most general facts must themselves be interpreted by principles which determine them , and then it becomes a safe guide and auxiliary to philosophy ; but when used by such as discard the insight of reason , and deny the power of the human mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to philosophy , but is itself utterly unphilosophicaL At the best , it can not itself be a philosophy , but only an instrument in the interest of philosophy ; but as now mostly used , in the rejection of all d priori principle , it is whoUy illogical and illegitimate . In its own proper field of attaining acts in the service of philosophy , and thus for enlarging the field of discovery , the inductive logic has done much , and become the wonder and boast of the age , which , as practically utilitarian , has been &shioned; and ahnost wholly actuated by it . Let it have its due , but let it not usurp honors which are not its due . Let it be employed to the utmost in it$ proper field , but let it not come out of its place , arrogantly to dictate in matters about which it can know nothing .

All facts are then also mere facts , with no eternally conditioning principles to determine them , and you thus exclude , what must then be , the illusory and bewildering lights of metaphysic . The theologic age , old in its venerable but mischievous superstitions , passes utterly away from the generations of humanity ; and next , the metaphysic age passes , with its lofty and profound , but empty speculations , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all philosophy have passed beneath the horizon , and the complete and final positivism of Auguste Comte culminates in the heavens . In this the full mission of the inductive logic is accomplished . She began by denying to the human mind any higher light than experience ; she carried out her varied experiments , and brought together numerous kindred facts , and deduced more general facts from these conspiring individuals ; she arranges all carefiilly according to variety and class , species and genus , and with her light shining fairly but exclusively upon these arranged facts of phenomenal nature , she finds the bold man who does not shrink from her logic , and who well knows that no modem speculative school can rebuke FS0GSE8S OF PHILOSOPHICAL INYESTiaATION. 39 him , and he cries aloud to the nations of the earth - AU theology and all philosophy beyond this is a &ble.; Positivism is the affirmative side of Hume 's skepticism , and rests firmly and impregnably on the basis of the exclusively sensational psychology . All the elements of possible human knowledge are affirmed to be given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and abstract , compare , and combine , and thus attain new analytical judgments out of them , but it can add nothing more , and attain nothing other than is given in them . What is made , what comes as event , we can know ; but the principle determining the making , and the order of the coming , we can not know ; all expectation that nature wiU go on in future , in the order of sequence as in the past , rests solely on the experience having become accustomed to it . Science can affirm nothing about it ; for that there are any principles beyond the fiicts , which have put their determining laws within the facts , is beyond all human ken not only , but all human conception . The principle must itself have been once made , and even its very maker must have had a constitutional nature that might have been directly reversed . It is philosophical to doubt , in every case that can not become a ikct for the senses . Thus Hume ; and Comte is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment testifies ; we can as positively deny all conclusiveness to any affirmation not capable of the testimony of experiment ; facts , and fiicts only , are positive . And now , these conclusions are all logically inevitable from the premises . The psychology can not be retained , and the immutable principles of theology and philosophy be admitted . If the insight of reason is not 40 iNTBODiTonoir. something other and higher than any judgments of the logical miderstanding , whether deductive or inductive , and if the human mind can not vindicate its right to the possesaon and application of these immutable principles , then Hume has the right to doubt , and Comte the right posi tively to deny , that man can have any stable theology or philosophy . An attempt to escape from this rigid exclusion of all stable theology and philosophy , is vainly made by that which calls itself The Philosophy of Common Senbb . This rests on the fact it finds , that the human mind is forced to assent to what are called " first truths , ' ' or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sujQGlcient basis for theology and philosophy . Its strong ground is , that from the constitution of the human mind it can not expel the convictions occasioned by these ' * first truths . " The skeptic and the assumed infidel are forced to the same conviction , and can never belie this coercion of common sense , and can pretend to be fi'ee from it only in their speculations . They must rest on some primitive conviction , or all affirmation of doubting would itself be absurd . Neither skepticism nor positivism could affirm themselves , except by admitting the conclusiveness of common sense . The argumentum ad hominem so pushed , may seem to silence the gainsaying skeptic , and confirm the credulous disciple , but it is wholly sophistical and delusive . Ck ) mmon sense begins in the affirmation of the same dictum with Hume 's Skepticism and Comte 's Positivism , viz. : that the human mind can never carry its knowledge beyond facts . But it seeks to escape the rigid logic of the FBOGBESS OF FHILOSOFHIOAIr DTTESTIGATION. 41 unbeliever by affirming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men must yield assent to the force of their primitive belie &."; True to its fundamental dictnm , nothing but facts ; it makes this conviction of common sense to be mere act unavoidable , but yet wholly inexplicable . The human mind is so made . The old Grecian Koivat hnouu - the common rational intelligence ; the endowment which distinguishes the man from the brute - is held to be a mere act and the affirmations of reason to be as arbitrary a makmg as the constitur tion of organic sensation , and thus there is felt no scruple in translating this term which expresses man 's highest prerogative , by the utterly inadequate expression , common sense . The sum is this - the human mind is so made , that there comes out the universal act of a necessary assent to the ' primitive beliefs . " AU is an arbitrary making ; unintelligible , insoluble t ; and nothing unmade can be reached that may give any explanation .

Ck ) mmon sense is a thing made ; and its primitive belie &; are things made ; all unmade principle is beyond knowledge or conception ; and even the Deity can come only within this common sense conception , and himself and his principles of working and governing , and the whole supernatural field of inmiortality , must fiill back within the sphere of constitutional existence , for all truth absolved from the conditions of a nature of things is wholly inconceivable . The Creator who makes worlds , and the mill // which grinds com , have alike their constitutional adaptations to their work , and our conceptions of them can differ nothing in kind , only the one has a constitutional nature more magnificent than the other ! When the supplied common sense is itself only act and its highest attainmentB are but &cts,; then surely common sense should admit that its theology and philosophy can deal with nothing beyond facts . The deficiencies of sensationalism , and their logical consequence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many respects , this is one of the most remarkable , and in some respects , the most productive direction in which the stream of human speculation has been turned . Kant saw the inevitable skeptical issues of Empiricism , and hence his Critik of Pure Heasan , to escape therefrom . His method is wholly Aristotelian , though he gathers his facts in another field , and not at all Platonic , although using some of Plato 's terms . He does not start from immutable principles , in the eternal Ideas , and determme therefrom how aU judgments in an understanding must be , but he takes our human fiiculty of judgment as already made , and by a transcendental analysis of it determines how we must know . It is a critik of pure reason , in the sense of taking the facts of human psychology antecedently to their development in phenomena , but not antecedently to their being in subjective faculty ; before they come out in our consciousness , but not before they have been constituted . The whole philosophy is d priori , or transcendental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , but only as attaining facts that exist prior to , or transcending , our conscious experience . PBOGSESS OF PHILOSOPHIOAL INYESTiaATION. 48 The Platonic reason attained and used the eternal , unmade principles , or Ideas ; the Kantian reason attams and nses the regulative forms in an already made human understanding . This truly Aristotelian method preyails in all the successors of Kant , in carrying forward the critical philosophy ; and the pure thinking is no insight of reason that gets in the facts their determining principles , but solely an analytical process that finds facts already in the human mind before they have worked themselves out on the field of consciousness . The whole labor , though transcending the point of conscious experience , is still that of the logical understanding only . Kant assumed that the organic content , given as envisaged by the sense , was real ; but that the human mind possessed its own forms , or regulative conceptions , and these gave their law to the operation of the mind in knowing this content in sensation . To us so made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherent regulative conceptions , or categories , in our human understanding . However the things may be in themselves , or however other minds may know them , our human knowledge must be after these forms already existing as facts within us . The matter of our cognitions had , thus , an objective reality , but the forms in which our understandings clothed the objects , had only subjective reality . Kant could thus answer Hume , - we connect the sequences of events in nature in the conviction of a fixed series of cause and effect , not because our experience has become accustomed to such an order , but because such is the law of connecting in judgments by the original constitution of the human mind . But this has still subjective certamty only . 44 mTEODucnoN . Owr minds mufit know through the connections of cause and effect , and the other categories given constitutionally within them ; perhaps other minds may know the same things in quite other connections . The universe , and the Maker of the universe , can be cognized only through these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content in sensation of the Deity , so we can not demonstrate his existence , but also just as little can we carry our de monstration against his existence . The proof for any supersensible existence is from the practical and not from the speciUative reason . The f &ct; that we are thus constituted , having by the Critik been transcendentally found , enables us to say a priori how &r; the human mind can know . Fichte , pursuing the transcendental critik still frirther , showed that there was no more ground for holding the organic content , or matter , for our cognitions , to be objec* tively real , than for holding the forms to be so , under which our understandings brought it . Both are subjective , and the matter and the form are alike supplied for the consciousness by the working of the intellectual sel or the ego . The sel as subject , makes itself object to itsel The mind can envisage nothing that it does not itself set before it . Transcending consciousness further than Fichte , and going deeper into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intellectual Intuition , " detected the absolute ego standing in the mid-point of indifference to either subject or object , and as a bi-polar agency , like magnetism , simultaneously working each way , and on the one side giving the object , and on the other the subject . FSOGBESS OF PHZLOSOFHIGAL mYEBTIGATION. 45 He identified both the subject and object in this central ego , which , back of consciousness , works out its two poles into consciousness , and there they appear as separately Object known , and Subject knowing . But even beyond this analysis , there was still an insoluble element lying in this absolute ego . As a source for both of Fichte 's subjective and objective egos , Schelling had placed in the mid-point of indifference another ego , and which , as the absolute ego , gave both the others to the consciousness with one undivided act . This bi-polar agency , in the absolute ego , Schelling had assumed without any examination or explanation , and with such a thought-agency assumed , he could work out the process of its development into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great precision and exactness . Hegel took this unsolved agency of Schelling , and carried the transcendental analysis to a still deeper abstraction , for the starting-point of another philosophical development . In his Phenomenology , he sets out from the common conviction that there is a dualism of both subject and object in human cognition , and thence unweaving the dialectical web in which both had been gathered , he found , as the ultimate remnant , a simple thought-progress - a movement according to the law of thinking ; a pure activity with no ground - and from this abstract thoughtprocess , with no substantial ego , Hegel begins his philosophy , and evolves the objective universe , the subjective mind , and finally the universal mind , educated to selfconsciousness , and also to the knowledge that the thoughtprocess is the only reality . The phenomenology is solely preparatory to the phi- i6 INTRODUCTION . losophy , which must begin in this pure thought-process . Instead of standing at the outside and looking on , as Schelling had done , Hegel puts himself within the thoughtmovement . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this philosophy must not at all look on , nor look forward to forecast what may come , but must absorb his attention in the movement itself and let the process bring out in its development what it may . In this method , he is made to think over again the great thought of the universe . The critical philosophy is consummated in Hegelianism . " No passage can be opened to any further speculation in this direction . The philosophic life in Germany is in suspended activity , and must so be retained until the apprehension of the incompleteness of the critical method shall induce to the setting of some new germ in quite another son . It began in the attainment of acts which transcend consciousness , and from these determined the modifications that must be given in consciousness . From Kant to Hegel it successively threw off more and more of that which had any objective reality , till it found itself at last with only a thought-movement in self-repellency ; a going out each way in counter-negations ; a being in what was known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such abstract thought-process , it assumed to determine all possible human cognition . It dealt only with facts , though transcendentaUy attained , and ignored all immutable principles . It concluded , from the facts found in us , what and how we must know , and was thus solely a critic of the human understanding , without attempting to determine any other order of knowing . We have in it a critic of /z/ human knowledge , but no science determining the validity of any form of knowing . It called itself rationalism , but is purely transcendental logic . It nowhere brings in the work of the comprehending reason , and uses solely the faculty of the connecting understanding . It is , at last , quite as empty as the scholastic logic , for it excludes all that is objectively real , and can thus never rise out of the sphere of the subjective ideal . That it should carry out and posit a valid objective , would demand that it should have the eternally real within its own subjective ; but this is the Platonic , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding void at the beginning , no possible process of logical thinking can fill it at the close . It thus commences in a specious delusion , and terminates in a stupendous dream . By surreptitiously raising the abstract and empty thought-process to a personality , and calling it the " worldspirit , " the philosophy could elaborately disclose how this world-spirit educated itself to self-consciousness , and to know the universe as its own objective manifestation . The material universe and the spiritual humanity are developments of this absolute world-spirit , and the destiny and the immortality of man is , that he see himself identical with the absolute world-spirit , and that in the endless ongoing of the thought-process the universal mind is coming out , and the absolute is perfecting in selfconsciousness , and in this is all the Humanity , and Deity , and Immortality , and Philosophy , that man can know . Surely Transcendentalism , though taking a longer road , and travelling through much more aerial regions , has hardly come out ahead of Common Sense , and done little more than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theology and Philosophy from Home 's skepticism or Comte 's positivism . Thus , ever , must the labor of the connecting understanding prove itself utterly incompetent for a valid theology or philosophy , and this as truly in the method of induction and of common sense as of the scholastic syllogism , and again as truly in a transcendental critic as in any other . It must think through a medium , and can never originate without something to come from , and something to put forth , and must thus have its Maker and Governor already made and conditioned . In the contemplation of its most profound abstractions , broad inductions , and transcendental developments , it is ever within the charmed circle of nature , and condenmed to toil under the bondage of already determined conditions , and we are forced to cry - Unleiss above himself he can Erect himself , how vain a thing is man f His progress is a cycle , and his path a tread-mill . A personal God is inconceivable within this sphere , and to this sphere there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not begin , and philosophy can not finish ; for the first can find no Deity , and the last can find no link in which there is a reason for the whole cham . We have , at last , the ofifer of EoLEcrnciSM , but it is not in a method to afford us any help . The name is here with no appropriate application . As the taking of what is deemed to be true from all other systems . Eclecticism must first have its own measure , or it can not of right take any thing from any system ; and when it has its own measure , it has /z/ already its own philosophic being and method . In other words , it already exists before any electing , and has its own law and method in order to any claim upon others . And in its author it has its well-expressed doctrine and method . Cousin 's method dispenses at once with all transcendental analysis , and attains the absolute by direct consciousness . The Jiuman mind has the nite , the conditioned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infinite , the unconditioned , the absolute , are respectively correlatives . The first can not be in consciousness without the latter , for indeed the first is nothing except in correlation with the latter . Just as the odd is nothing without the conception also of the even , so the finite , the relative , &c.,; are nothing without their conceived correlatives of the infinite , the absolute , &c.; Where one is , the other must at the same time be . In the possession of these , we have also immediately their relation in consciousness , and can thus distinguish the one from the other . Given the finite there is also at once with this given , the infinite and the relation of the two ; and in this apprehension of the infinite , the absolute , &c.,; we have the conscious knowledge of God . All this is the spontaneous operation of the primitive consciousness , and thus belongs to all men in common , and may be known as reason . But in analyzing this operation and its results , each man goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his peculiar opinion . Reason is thus common , impersonal , true ; reflection is particular , personal , fidlible . Taking the veracious reason , it spontaneously gives the absolute immediately and necessarily with every relative that comes into consciousness . Cousin takes cau-/z/ // sality only as the ground of his relative , and thus the relative canse at once gives the absolute cause , and this absolute cause is the Deity . He fiirther proceeds , by saying , that causality is nothing except in action , and therefore the absolute cause must act , and go out into effect . The universe is as necessarily from the Deity , as the Deity is necessary to the universe . And , further , while God must go out into effect , yet does he not exhaust himself in the act of manifestmg himself in objective effects ; He is , and the universe also is , and such duality , he argues , excludes Pantheism . But this reason , or spontaneous consciousness , is still ily the &culty; of a connecting judgment , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or philosophy . The delusion is easily made transparent . Because the finite and relative suggest the Infinite and Absolute , it is thereby sdd that we know the Infinite and Absolute . A Gfuggested conception becomes a cognition . But beyond tiiis is the deeper delusion , that we attain a true Deity in this conceived Infinite or Absolute . Suppose we take the finite as applied to time or space , and let this be supposed truly to give Infinite time or space ; is such Infinite the Deity ? Or again , suppose we have the relative phenomena , and these suggest , or even validly give , the Absolute substance ; is this Absolute substance the Deity ? According to the philosophy , both Infinite time or space , and Absolute substance , should be God . But causality is actually taken , only because causality may the better be taken as Creator and Ruler , than either time , space , or substance . Take then Absolute cause , and is this the Deity ? Not at alL It is only a conception of the logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly as any second cause proceeding from it . It must go out into effect ; yea , into just the effect determined in its own conditioning . It is cause caused , though arbitrarily termed absolute cause . There is here no personality ; no capacity to originate ; no seltdetermination ; nothing of the supernatural . The absolute cause is nature still , and has in it its conditioned constitution , and we could never love and worship it , nor think a universe as coming from it , except as itself a part of it . Such a method can by no possibility reach to a true theology or philosophy . The Platonic philosophy had the conception of God , as the Good , and thus as moral personality , and not at all as absolute substance or absolute cause . In this conception there was occasion given for the cognition of God as supernatural , while the restricting of the conception to substance or cause , though absurdly applying the term Absolute , necessarily confined it still within nature . God must be author of all substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of no substances or causes . His conditionings can only be from the rational claims which spring eternally from his own rational being . What it behooves him to do as due to his own glory , or supreme excellency of being , that only can determine his action , and not at all the constituted nature of a substance or of a cause . Divine revelation has widely diffused the conception of a God , absolute , personal , supernatural ; who originates the natures of all things " according to the counsel of his own will , " or , which is the same thing , according to the claims of his own rationality , without himself being subjected to any nature . He looks only to the Archetypes 52 iNTBODironoN. essentially within his own rational Spirit , for the direction of all his creative and administrative energy . And it is a marvel and a reproach , that with all this Platonic and this Christian teaching , the world 's philosophies are , to-day , all radically materialistic ; holding all being as fact , or constitutionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Atheistic or Pantheistic . Seen from a comprehensive point of vision , they invariably and inevitably lead logically out to a complete exclusion of an absolute , personal , supernatural being from human knowledge and even from human conception . The reason of universal humanity calls for , and acknowledges , an unbegun , unmade , and supernatural Beginner , Maker , and Finisher of all that has a nature ; and the Christian heart worships a Jehovah , whose sovereignty and authority lie underived and solely in the absolute behest of his own reason ; while all speculative philosophy has come to ignore and deny every conception which can not be brought within the connections of the logical understanding and subjected to the determinations of some constitutional nature . The conception of a Being who may begin from himself , and create objectively to himself without finding himself caused to do so by any previous conditioning , seems utterly to have fallen out of all philosophical intelligence . Where is the philosophy , which can logically from its method , present a God to our acceptance as a cauBa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel any shock at the absurdity and impiety of talking about the nature of God , and the rwLture of the divine will , as if the awfril prerogatives of the supernatural could be brought and bound within the conditions of the natural ? Our religious con- THEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHr POSSIBLE . 53 scioasness is clear and complete for an absolutely supernatural ; our philosophic consciousness is , dogmatically or in its own supineness , trained to the restrictions of a relatively conditioned nature of things . It is among the strongest evidences of the deep and permanent working of the immortal reason within the soul , that notwithstanding the wide-spread prevalence of a philosophy everywhere sinking the Deity to a feet , there is yet the growing power of a religion which worships him as an unmade Spirit , in spirit and in truth . How much more rapidly may the knowledge and the worship of the true God spread , when philosophy herself shall become converted to , and baptized in , a Gospel theism I What then we need for a truly rational theology is the conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for the rational soul , and not conditioned to the physical necessities of the logical understanding . Such a demand met is sufficient for theology , and a valid answer to the perfectly logical Skepticism and Positivism before stated . Such theology may then be safely laid as the starting-point for a true rational cosmology and in which may be embodied a thoroughly comprehensive and conclusive philosophy . In this way only is a valid theology or philosophy possible . In this way nature may be fairly presented as subjected to the determining conditions of immutable principle , and thus the facts of nature come to be known in their inherent laws , and having an eternal reason why thus they are , and not of some other nature . So matter itself may be expounded ; so all the laws of motion , of gravity , of fluids , of felling bodies , of magnetism and electricity , of chemical and crystalizing 54 iNTBODncrnoN. agencies , of the ensphering and revolving of sons and planetary systems , and of the superinducing of vegetable and animal life , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all nature 's facts , so as thoroughly to read all nature 's laws , will not at first , nor very soon , be attained ; but enough may be presented to give assurance that there is a rational philosophy of nature , as there is a valid theology above nature , and that we have started on the right path to find and finish it . /z/ That we may attain to a rational idea of Creation , it will be important that we first attain a rational idea of a Creator . Creation is an origination ; something made where before there was nothing ; and the universal Cosmos is inclusive of all that is so made . The Creator himself must then be without origin , and inhabiting eternity . The Cosmos is also a creation , beautiful and orderly , fashioned according to the determinations of immutable principle , and moves onward to a proposed and purposed consummation ; the Creator must therefore be its Governor and Finisher , as well as its Author . He must originate all , and guide all that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a Being is neither readily attained nor easily expressed . An absolute Author and Finisher , who encompasses all things before and after , while he himself is encompassed by nothing , is necessarily incomprehensible to a finite understanding , and can in no way be subjected to logical thought . No faculty can take cognizance of such a being but the insight of reason alone . The attainment of the idea involves all that has been /z/ termed " the Philosophy of the Infinite " - the Problem for finding the Absolute - and which by some of the most honored names has been denied to be at all accessible by the human mind . Others have deemed the problem to be of practicable solution , and have made labored attempts to accomplish it , while , under the delusion occasioned by the use of the wrong intellectual ftmctions , they have only produced specious absurdities , or run out abstractions to utter negations . A position can be attained , from whence these false methods of dealing with the problem may be seen in the necessities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty , the attainment of the idea of the Absolute may be completely successful . In a former work of Rational Psychology , a more extended examination of the subject has been made than is here needed , but inasmuch as a clear idea of an absolute Creator and Governor is conditional for all intelligent approach to a Rational Cosmology , a concise and independent mode for its attainment will be here presented . This will occupy the space given to the First Chaptefr . Having thus the clear idea of the Creator , we shall be prepared to enter upon a detailed effort to attain a comprehensive idea of the creation itself If the Creator must make and guide the universal cosmos after the determinations of inamutable principles , so that his work may be truly fact pervaded by principle , then must the great plan have already been laid in the reason , as the archetypal idea of the whole making and finishing . To no finite reason , is it to be anticipated , that this plan will ever reveal itself in all the clearness and completeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a plan certmnly is , that the human reason may not earnestly and reverently apply its powers to the attainment of its grand outlines , and in the teaching of eternal principles find , by a rational insight , what and how creation must have been , and read her great laws , not as mere arbitrary facts , but as the necessary result of a work rationally begun and wisely accomplished . This will fill , at much greater length , the /Second Chapter . When the Cosmos is attained in its plan and principle , it will be necessary to take the acts as actually given in experience , and study them with the direct design to find their law as plainly determined in the eternal principle . Facts teach nothing until they are seen in their principles ; but when the principle is applied to the act and the &ct; is read and expounded in the principle , then have we , and only then , a rational philosophy . This will be the work for the Third Chapter and which might be prolonged indefinitely . /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each of which the processes pursued and the cognitions attained are different in kind one from the other , and no supposable augmentation of degrees can bring them to become identical . An imperfect analysis , which fiiils in the psychological recognition of these three different kinds of knowing , among other imperfections and errors , will inevitably exclude from all intelligent approach to the question of the Absolute , and oblige to the denial that any such conception can be legitimately sought by a finite mind . These three distinct functions of intellectual agency are the Sense , the Understanding , and the Beason . An Absolute may be sought in them all ; the true Absolute can be conceived and attained only in one ; the nature of the case d priori determining that , to both the functions of the sense and the discursive understanding , all attempts towards the conception of an Absolute involve an absurdity , and must therefore ever rest under an utter impossibility , whUe the reason is directly competent to state and expound the whole problem . /z/ The intellectual agency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a process of conjoining the manifold into xmity , and thus constructing the indefinite within limits . This agency in the understanding works to its end only by connecting the separate and fleeting into a permanent , and by this discursive process concluding in judgments . In the reason , the intellectual agency attains its end by an immediate insight which detects the necessary principle that comprehends the universal within it , and in this compass of all that has limit and relation at once attains and iecognizes the Absolute . If we make these processes of intellectual agency cursorily to pass beneath our inspection , we may clearly determine in the cases themselves why the first two can not reach to an Absolute , and how the last can both attain and expound it . 1 . The Absolute as the Inhnite. - The mere sensation in any organ can be only a content given for a perception , but can not complete the perception in any case . An intellectual action is necessary first to distinguish the peculiar sensation and thereby attain the quality , and then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quantity may have limits under three general modifications , viz. , limit in space , and thus shape be perceived ; limit in time , and thus period be attained ; and limit in the intensity of the sensation , and thus the amount of the quality be known . No matter how distinct the quality , the quantity must also be made definite or we can not have a dear and complete perception . We may observe the colors distinctly on the page of a book , but without an accurate defining in shape we shall not know the etters. /z/ This intellectual act of defining may be made a purely subjective operation within the mind alone , and the limits of degree of intensity would then be excluded , as having relevancy only to some actual sensation , leaving only limits which determine the definite shape in pure space and the definite period in pure time . But such constructions within pure space or time can be possible only in one method . The intellectual agency must go through the contiguous points in space and conjoin them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area , or it can not define any pure shape ; and must also go through the consecutive instants in time , and thus begin and terminate a duration , or it can not define any pure period . In other words , the intellect can possess no definite forms in either space or time except as it constructs them itself by its own act . Pure space and time will not have any limits in them , but only as the intellectual agency makes them . Now the Absolute , in either space or time , must be a whole which can not be carried out any further , and is thus absolved from any fiirther modification . It is either a whole 80 8maU as not to be capable of further diminution , or a whole so large as not to admit of further augmentation . From the very necessity of the case , the conjoining agency that constructs within limits , and thus determines a completed whole , must itself describe the boundaries and carry its own lines entirely around every form that it attains . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no periods that it does not itself limit by both beginning and ending . We will then put such a conjoining agency upon its search for the Absolute in the direction for finding a whole 80 smaU that it can not be further dimin- /z/ ished . The insiglit of the reason may enable the intellect to say of a circle , for an example , that there must be a point in it which has no radii , but in which all the radii of the circle terminate ; or , that if that circle with its area revolve , there must be a point in it which does not revolve and which can thus have no upper nor lower portion of the circumference ; and in each case there must be involved the conclusion that here is that which can not be further diminished . As a supposed absolute , the intellectual agency may set itself in this direction to construct and thus to possess an absolutely least whole . In order to its attainment as a whole it must construct it within limits , and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumference , or begin without and describe its circumference around its centre within , and can never possess any completed whole , however small , without thus drawing lines about it . But no such whole can be the absolutely least , for it must have its upper and lower portions of the circumference , and be capable of revolution , and possess radii . The Absolute , to the insight of reason , in this direction , is not thus of any constructed whole as a limited , but only of a limit ; a point between upper and lower portions of a circumference , or a point neither out of nor within the radii , but the limit where they terminate . The Absolute , thus , can not be conjoined as a whole for the sense , but is necessarily to it the infinite ; that at which the conjoining agency may begin , or that at which it may finish , but that at which it can not both begin and finish . The intuitive Absolute must thus be indefinable by the only function which the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole so small that it may not become smaller , is to the /z/ sense an utterly unattainable cognition . Its smallest must be wholly constructed within limits , and ever that which is limited the limit can divide . The same is true of period as of place , and thus the attainment of a whole as absolutely the smallest is necessarily impracticable . We will again put this conjoining agency upon its search for the Absolute in the direction of attaining a whole 90 large that it can not be augmented . The comprehending reason may say of space , that there must be a whole of immensity which is not any part of itself ; and also may say of time , that there must be a whole of eternity which can not be any of its parts ; and the intellectual agency may go forth to construct this absolutely greatest whole . As before in diminution , so here in augmentation , the conjoining intellect can have no whole which it has not completely surrounded by the line that itself carries , and thus can know no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can know no whole of time without completely bounding eternity . But the greatest definite place is not yet all space , and the greatest definite period is not yet all time , and thus at the furthest augmentation there is more beyond , and however much may have been defined , yet of both immensity and eternity still we must say , that each is the iKFiNiTB ; that which it is impracticable to finish . As now , the only fields in which a conjoining intellectual agency can work are those of space and time , and as in neither can an absolutely least nor an absolutely largest be attained , it is quite manifest , from the nature of the case , that in no way to the sense can the Absolute become known . The forecasting reason postulates both the absolutely least and largest , but when the constructing sense sets out to /z/ execute the work , it ever finds itself with the infinite beyond , and never that it is at the Absolute . There is an intnnsio antinomy in the human mind ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbids it should be found ; and till an accurate analysis has discriminated and thus reconciled the different functions of knowing , the mind is really a riddle or an apparent absurdity to itself To the sense there can never be an absolute whole , either the least or the largest ; there stiU ever remains to it only the Infinite . 2 . The Absolute as the XJisrcoNDrnoNiaD. - When we have put the quality completely within limits , and thereby made it to stand out in consciousness as a definite whole , the intellectual fimction in conjoining or constructing has done aU its work , and the product is a perception , or a phenomenon taken through sense . The definite qualities are thus known , but these qualities are so known only as separate and fleeting appearances . The sense can aSrm what thus appears , but can not at all think the appearing separate qualities to be the attributes of some common subject . The sense can give definitely all the qualities which belong to the rose , but in the sense they are separate qualities only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense at all , nor any act which puts the qualities together into the subject rose is at all put forth by any intellectual agency in the sense . There must here be introduced altogether another kind of agency than that which conjoins within limits . We need for this the connecting agency of the understanding , and which is explained in the following manner : The sense can take no cognizance of a substance but only of the qwdUies , The qualities appear , the substance // does not appear . I think tliat some existing thing has impressed the organ of sense , and thereby has given a sensation which I have discriminated and defined , and in my thought , I refer this distinct and definite appearance to that thing as its subject ; and then in as many ways and through as many organs as that thing is thought to give distinct and definite phenomena , I successively conclude these phenomena to belong to it , and thus judge discursively the qualities to be predicated of one common subject ; or , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sense gave the qualities distinctly and definitely , and then quite another intellectual function intervenes , and , taking each quality discursively through the same substance as given in thought , connects them all in it by judging them all to inhere there together . The qualities are thus no longer separate , but the attributes of that one substance , and these qualities thus connected in that one substance , are known henceforth as one thing . By thus thinking in judgments we come to know that the sense phenomena have their common ground in the one substance we have thought for them , and the intellectual function , by which we have been enabled to connect these qualities into one thing by making this substance to stand under them , we term the understanding . From the nature of the case , it is thus impossible that an understanding should work in connecting qualities into things , except as the notion of substance is given to it ; the moment the thought of the substance is lost , the very medium of all possible connection of the qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in the sense often vary in the same ground , and the one thing changes its ap- /z/ pearance . The hardness and brittleness , &c.,; of the ice give place to the fluidity and Umpidness , &o.,; of the water . We think these last qualities as stiU in the same substance , and thus know both the ice and the water to be yet one thing , and yet we think that one substance to have been so modified by the presence of some other substance , that the old qualities were made to pass away , and other qualities as new events to come out from the same source . The passing away of one and the coming of another event is given in the sense ; the sequences appear ; but the modifying efficiency of the one substance upon the other does not appear . This is thought only , and the discursive process again brings the successive events into connection through these modifying combinations of substances , and'knows the modifying efficiency as cause and the modified event as efiTect , and thus judges the sequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , again , must have this notion of cause , or from the necessity of the case the only medium for connecting the sequences into a linked series would be lost . All qualities are thus judged as inhering in some substance , and all events as adhering to some cause , and thus the separate qualities of the sense and their changes are bound in connection as one comjnon nature of things , and all constitute but one world or universe . It is now manifest , that in this field of the understanding , as before in the field of the sense , the occasion is given for seeking after the Absolute , though in quite a diffisrent &rm.; Not the Absolute in reference to any limited and completed whole , whether least or largest , but the Absolute as the substance which has nothing deeper , or the cause which has nothing higher . We thus put this con- /z/ necting agency upon the search for the Absolute , in the first place , in the direction of the absolutely deepest substance . The reason may intuitively say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all substances rest , and the discursive understanding may be put upon the start actually to attain to it . These qualities have been judged to inhere in a common substance , but on what does this substance rest ? It can not be seltsupported , for from the necessity of the case a connecting understanding must have the medium through which the discursive connections are to run , and so soon as you leave the substance to itself it hangs as helplessly over a void as would a quality without a substance . The understanding must , therefore , think this substance as some modification of a deeper substance , and if it would reach the Absolute by thinking in discursive judgments , it dooms itself to an endless descent where each dropping footstep can only fiJl upon a stair that must be conditioned upon another yet beneath it . To attempt the conception of a substance originated , or of a substance annihilated , is the absurdity of connecting without a medium ; of thinking a substance that was itself unsubstantial , or of thinking away a substance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would cut off the thought from all possibility of connection , and the discursive understanding can look at this only in horror and helplessness . An absolute substance is thus manifestly unattainable , and could be conceived only as an arbitrary stopping upon some one as an ultimate , but which yet , by the very necessity of the thinking frmction that denianded this for all above , demands &r; this yet also another beneath . An absolute substance would be THE.UKCONDinoioa ) ; the substance that /z/ Stood under all others with no substance under it ; but such conception of the unconditioned could not also be a conception of the substantial . The absolute substance is necessarily to the understanding an absurdity ; a contradiction to the necessity of thought ; and can therefore never become a cognition to the discursive intellect . The true Absolute is as remote here from an unconditioned substance , as before in the sense from the infinite in space . In another direction , the discursive intellect may be put upon the search for the Absolute cause . The reason may affirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all causes , and as thus itself uncaused is an absolute cause , and the understanding sent on the way after it . But , again , from the necessity of a discursive process , the medium of connection must be maintained , and the attempt to stand on any cause arbitrarily assumed to be the ultimate in the regressus , or the first in the outgoing of the following series , is the putting yourself with one foot on a retreatipg stair while the other vainly seeks to plant itself upon vacancy . The Absolute cause is for the understanding an unconditioned cause ; a source of all causes with no condition above itself what shall come out of itself ; and is thus the absurdity of a source for all efficiency with nothing to make itself effective . The true Absolute is as diverse from an unconditioned cause here in the understanding , as itwas before in the sense from the Infinite in time . There is here as manifest an antinomy in the human intellect as before in the sense . The reason forecasts and postulates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause that has no cause above it , and yet the very ftinction of the discursive understanding forbids that such /z/ an Absolute should be cognized or even conceived . There is an insoluble paradox from the very working of the human intellect , except as in our psychological analysis we have found that the function demanding and the function forbidding are entirely distinct in kind , and that each is to be held responsible only for its own cognitions in its own processes . 3 . The Absolute as in the Undebstanding itoelp. - There is also another method of attaining to an Absolute , which takes the understanding itself , and transcending the consciousness , in which is all our ordinary experience , carries out an analysis of the understanding , as the function of judgment , to its constituent elements , and finds an Absolute in the understanding itself . This is still a use of the discursive faculty , and only turning its action upon the constitutive elements of its own being instead , as before , upon either space and time in the sense , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and instead of an absolute whole so small as not to be diminished or so large as not to be increased , or an absolute substance or absolute cause , it assumes to find an Absolute in the understanding itself . Beginning in Kant and passing through the speculations of Fichte and Schelling to Hegel , we have the following modifications of this method of finding the Absolute in the understanding itself . The human understanding is taken as the faculty for tdiinking in judgments , and is originally constituted to possess certain primitive conceptions which become the general forms for all varieties of logical judgments , and which are thus termed the categories of the pure understanding . These primitive forms , with which /z/ our human nnderstanding is constitutionally endowed , determine and limit our whole sphere of knowing , and when analytically formed they enable the transcendental philosopher to say beforehand , from the very constitution of the feculty of judging , what is the entire capacity of man for attaining cognitions . He can know in all the forms provided for him in these primitive conceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range themselves under some one of these categories . Above the general forms for concluding in judgments through logical syllogisms , there is also a constitutional provision for directing the ascent from the major premiss of one syllogism to the conclusion of another on which it has depended . The major premiss of any logical syllogism must be an assumption , except as it has been deduced in the conclusion of a pro-syllogism ; and to prompt and direct the mind along this ascending way up the ladder of 4syllogisms , there is the higher primitive conception of the Infinite , or the Unconditioned , constitutionally given to man , and which , as the subjective Idea of the Absolute , regulates this logical regressus in the same manner as if a real ultimate might at length be reached , beyond which there would be no occasion for a pro-syllogism . As the primitive conceptions for single syllogisms were termed categories of the pure understanding , so the primitive conceptions in the various processes of rising to the Infinite , the Unconditioned , and the Absolute , were termed the categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thus only different varieties of the same logical function for concluding in judgments , one regulating its process by given primitive /z/ conceptions in the simple syllogism , and the other regulating its process by a higher grade of primitive conceptions in the ascending march through indefinite pro-syllogisms . The reason is still discursive , and not at all the immediate insight of the Platonic Reason . The Absolute is here a primitive conception ; a regulative form of thought in the subjective understanding ; and thus an ideal Absolute only . Whether there be a veritable ultimate or not can never be determined by the human mind , for it can only regulate its search for it by this subjective ideal Absolute , and can never reach it . The true Absolute is wholly problematical ; it can neither be proved uol* disproved ; the ideal Absolute constitutionally given to the human mind is all that can be cognized by man . " We are so made that we think an Absolute , and thus regulate our ascent toward it ; but we can never attain to it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Absolute in the Understanding became subsequently transposed " for an Absolute Understanding itself . That agency , which works out in consciousness the ego or the self that we know , must be back of the ego or self which is known , and can not itself be brought up into the light of consciousness . The self which we come to know is the intellectual product of a deeper self which we can not make to appear . This deeper self works up into consciousness a self which is then known as subject , and also that which is distinct from self , a not-self , which is then known as object , and thus our whole experience of subject and object has a deeper source absolutely independent of all conscious experience . This underlying self which develops itself into the conscious self , and THE ABSOLITTB AS IN THE UNDEBSTANBINa. 71 alBo into the conscious not-self , . e. , into both the subjective and the objective , is also altogether the source for each personal self in its separate consciousness , and therefore out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-consciousnesses , all subjective , and all objective experiences . One absolute self is the germ that evolves itself into distinct personalities , into conscious subjective experience , and into the conscious experience of all that is objective ; and hence the whole intellectual life of humanity is but an outgrowth from an Absolute , which is back o and beyond all possibility of appearing in , consciousness , and which can be known in no way but by " an Intellectual Intuition , " which penetrates beneath the subjective consciousness and beholds it &ce; to face . This Absolute Ego is taken to be a real , acting , self-evolving being ; the identification in himself of all that comes to have existence ; and all existence is , in feet , only the stating or positing of his perpetual self-evolution . An Absolute real imderstanding thinks out into subjective and objective existence all that is known . Ultimately , this Absolute real being , thinking itself out into personality , subjective consciousness , and objective experience , becomes thoroughly dissolved into an utter ab straction , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veritable understanding , but solely a thinking process ; not any substrate agent , but merely a living movement ; and this pure thinking movement is assumed as the Absolute , and by a law of perpetual dialectics , or reciprocal counter-negations , works out the universe of unconscious matter and selfconscious mind . The Absolute thought-movement , beginning in abstract being , which as entirely abstract has no distinction , and is thus identical with naught first denies or 72 imfi IDEA OF THE ABSOLUTE . negates that it is nanght , and then by a counter-negatioti denies that nanght is being , and thus posits being as no longer abstract being , but as being excluded by naught ; and thus in this diremptive , or counter-negative movement , abstract being has come to stand ( yut with naught ovei against it , and each mutually excluding the other , and is thus the thought of existence . But the thought-movement can not rest in existence ; it goes out from existence and negates any limit , and thus thmks the Infinite , and returning to existence it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks the Finite ; and in this counternegation of the Infinite and Finite , existence has become in the thought not merely a being as standing out from nothing , but being as every way limiting itself , and is thus being jser se . Thus the living movement is traced through a perpetual series of counter-negations , each one conveying the thought further on and positing a new cognition , till the thought-process has given in its course all of nature , educated itself to self-consciousness , to universal intelligence , and at length to divine Omniscience . Thus Kant 's Absolute is a subjective regulative thought ; Schelling 's Absolute is the infinite understanding in its original germ ; and Hegel 's Absolute is an abstract thought-movement which has not yet posited any thought , but in its endless ongoing is at length to state existence , nature , personality , humanity and developed Deity , and come at length to know itself as the subject of whatever is , and the object of whatever itself knows . Of this whole transcendental method for finding an Absolute , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be unsuccessful . It uses only a discursive faculty and em- /z/ ployd only the processes of analysis and abstraction . It begins in experience , and analyzes and abstracts till it assumes to find that in which experience is conditioned . But this root and source for all experience is still a constituted being ; a something given with its own necessitated law of action imposed upon it ; and even when the abstraction has gone beyond aU substrate being , and retmned only a movement in which there is nothing moving , it still must come mider an intestine necessity , and work according to a constituted nature , and subject itself to conditions it already finds within it , and above which it can never exalt itself and from which it can never deliver itself . It transcends experience , not by going back to eternal principle which must determine all experience , but simply by going back of human consciousness and finding the constitutional elements which regulate human experience in consciousness , and thus determining what our human understanding can know , simply because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to know thus , and not otherwise . Not that which is above fact and nature , but that only which is above human consciousness is sought , that in the end it may attain a constituted principium , a created source for all that conscious experience has given . This the discursive understanding can very weU accomplish , for it is only undoing its own work and raveling out the thread that it has knit . Having put together by a connective process in judging , it may readily imweave its own web , and go back in abstraction towards nihility , until nothing be left but the mere semblance of any content in the thought , and then by terming this highest abstract element the Abso- // lute , it may readily begin with it and retrace its old process of putting things together , and in this assume that the ideal work is creation , and the empty product a universe . But from the nature of the process , if it stop short of utter annihilation , the highest abstraction must be stiU something that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no more an Absolute above and beyond nature than was the whole furniture of its thought when it began the abstraction . By analyzing and abstracting from the conditioned we are making no progress toward an unconditioned , and an endless analysis and abstraction of the understanding can never find an Absolute . We may readily cheat ourselves by calling this abstract thought-process the world-spirit , as if it possessed a valid being , and then call the empty thinking the development of this world-spirit , and delude ourselves as if we had built over in our thought that which the world-spirit had actually posited and stated in its ongoing ; and yet even this delusive creator and creation would be a thoroughly finite and conditioned conception . This assumed world-spirit can only act in one way , and go out in one process , and take one step in its perpetual counter-negations at a time , and all this with no final end to be reached , and no free purpose to be attained , and no approving inward consciousness to cheer and reward it . All is thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , and grows : up under as rigid a necessity as the tides flow or the planets roll . It seeks to transcend sustained substance and conditioned cause , but this abstract Absolute is still grounded in the substantial and bound within the causal , and utterly helpless without a something on which to stand , and a supplied efficiency from whence to draw . THE ABdOLUTB AS IN THE UNDEBSTANDma. 76 All philosophy of nature is hopeless and helpless without the full recognition of the absolutely supernatural , for all exposition of nature in either its origin or its end , must be found in that only which is above nature . But every attempt to reach the supernatural and cognize the Absolute by any work of the discursive understanding , is vain . We may employ it upon the pure sense in the conjoining of space and time , but all possible constructions here will still leave the Infinite unconstructed , and can therefore never find an Absolute . " We may employ it upon its own notions of substance and cause , but all possible attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsupplied cause , can never stop in any one substance or cause which is not conditioned already in its own being , and thus leaving the unconditioned wholly beyond its furthest march , and of course the Absolute yet unattained . Or , we may lastly set the understanding to work upon its own fonctions , and analyze itself up to the primitive elements which enter into its original constitution , and attain its most sublimated transcendental abstractions ; but we can never take that in the end which was not also given to us at the beginning , and from the very fact that it was origioally comprehended within the understanding , it must be impossible that it should ever become the compass for comprehending the understanding itself . It must ever be the included and can never become the absolutely conclusive. li then , we have not the endowment of some distinct and superior function of knowing than the discursive understanding , we are from the nature of the case shut out from all entrance upon the field where lie the problems of the Absolute . We are doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , and can neither know nor conceive any thing of the supernatural . It is certainly very much gained in the saving of severe but fruitless labor , to know that no conjoining and no connecting intellectual agency can be at all used in the philosophy of the Absolute . It is more gained , to know that we do not need any such aid , Neither Absolute time nor space , neither Absolute substance nor cause , neither a transcendental regulative Ideal Absolute , nor an Absolute thought-process , could bring us to the being we want . 4 . The Absolute as given in the Reason . - We cease , then , altogether from the use of the discursive understanding in this work of attaining the Idea of the Absolute , and attempt nothing through completed constructions in space and time , nor connected judgments in substances and ; auses , nor analyses and abstractions of the function of judgment itself . We have a position from which we see that all such labor must be fruitless , and we turn to the use of the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That we have such a faculty , distinctive in kind , and giving to us all our prerogatives of rationality , personality , and free and responsible originality , is sufficiently clear in the consciousness of its own working . In pure diagrams we see universal truths without any process of local deductions , as that any three points in space must be in one and the same plane ; and that any two sides of a triangle must together be greater than a third side . In pure physics , we see that action and reaction must be opposite and equal ; and that compound forces must give their conjimct direction to motion . In pure forms we can see spiritual sentiment , and thus have an ultimate standard THB ABeOLUTE AS IN THE BEASOK. 77 of taste in the beautiful ; and in spirit itself we can see an intrinsic excellency that demands for itself that it should be end , and not means to an end , and thus have an ultimate standard of right in the good . We wiU apply this rational insight to a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other than material forces ; and also to the distinctions in an ascending spiritual spontaneity up to the supernatural ; and in the supernatural we will detect also the point which separates the conditioned from the unconditioned , and come directly upon the Absolute and Divine . Let it be here remarked that the Absolute we seek is not excluded from all relations and conditions . That which should be utterly without relations could not be expressed , and that which should be utterly without conditions could not be explained . It is only necessary that the relations and conditions should be wholly subjective , self-directed , and self-sustained , and bringing with them no dependence upon nor amenability to any outer being . Not without self-relations and self-conditions , but wholly absolved from all dependent relationship and subjected conditioning to any other . We proceed then on our course to the complete attainment of such Idea of the Absolute . A grain of wheat may be wrapped up in the same cerements together with an Egyptian mummy . Thousands of years pass away , and not a moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living wheat nor the dead mummy . But to the insight of reason , a broad distinction is seen between these perpetuated activities . In the dead all the agency has been from without , and coming upon the subject that has been modified and changed by it ; /z/ while in the living the agency has been its own , springing up ever fresh within it , and resisting the outer agencies that would corrupt and dissolve it . The one has been the mechanical attrition of material forces , the other has been the spontaneous spring of a living energy . We seize upon this vital energizing , as reason gives it to us , and reserve it for our purpose in our ftiture progress . This living energy can only act according to conditions imposed upon it . It can not germinate ana propagate itself in new grains without the air , the earth , the sunshine , and the moisture . It is a power put into matter , and which has the capability to control and use matter , but only according to conditions imposed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still conditioned within itself and must grow out after its own controlling law , " first the blade , then the ear , afterwards the still com in the ear , " and this still corn in the ear only the " seed after its kind . " " With all the spontaneity of life , the vegetable is stiU bound in matter , and even its life is conditioned by an imposed law which it can by no means transcend ; and thus its whole being is in and of nature only . The ox that treads out and eats the grain has all this living energy , with the very remarkable addition that it can feel itself and give back sensation for sensation . Through the power of sensation it can be impelled to locomotion , direct itself in the selection of its food , and guide its experience by rules of prudence . The insight of reason finds at once in this a higher grade of spontaneous energizing , and knows that here is an approach towards self-direction . The animal can condition itself by its own sensations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which reason has gained in animal life and hold it for our purpose . Bnt this animal life and sensation is also in matter , and subjected to all the conditions of matter . Its very sentient life , which distinguishes it from the vegetable , is active only through matter and towards matter . It uses and seeks the material only , so that if we speak here at all of spiritual being , it is of " the spirit of a beast which goeth downward . " Its feelings are all determined for it in the laws imposed upon it ; and the sentient life can neither assume nor propagate other laws of energizing than those of its own kind . The animal is therefore yet wholly in nature . Man has , beside the sentient animal life , the far higher endowment of a rational existence . The peculiarities of his rational being are in the following distiQCtive elements . He can originate for himself what to him are the perfect ideal patterns or archetypes of that which is the beautiful , the true , and the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate all that experience may offer . Not what is taken from experience , but what his own genius creates for him , is his criterion for testing what he shaU approve and what disapprove . He has his own principles or standards of judgment within himsell and with which the material and sentient world has nothing to do . He has also that self-knowledge which determines the intrinsic excellency of this his rational being , and what is due to himself and worthy of himself in all his actions . He can thus feel the claims of self-respect and responsibility to his own conscience , and know the retributions of self-approbation or self-reproach according as his deeds sustain or violate the /z/ law which his own rational being imposes upon himself Here are peculiar self-relations and self-conditions , all subsisting within the rational , and having no dependence upon his animal being . The rational activity is competent to guide and determine itself alone , both without and even against the animal life . The beautiful , the true , and the right are in the reason itself and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both nature and experience by them . It can move itself not only without the promptings of sentient nature , but directly against and over them . All of nature may be on one side , and yet the rational can say , I ought and I wiU stand and act on the other side . It can make its own conscious worth and dignity its end of action , and exclude all other ends which nature may present from holding any competition with this . Here is a real spontaneity , related in its activity and its law , its going forth and the end it is to reach , only to itself . It furnishes its own end and occasion for its activity . Its references of agency are all within its own sphere , and its conditions of direction and result are all self-imposed . It is self activity self-directed . It is not from nature nor subject to nature ; it is wholly above nature . Allied to nature as it is , even as the human is the combination of the animal and the rational in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the animal , but ever asserts its prerogative over it . Take , then , this free personality ; this spontaneous agency with its law written upon and rising out of its own being ; and we have made a long advance in our way to the Idea of the Absolute . " We have found that which may absolve itself from all the domination of nature and stand /z/ forth wholly supematora . It is no product of the dis cursiYe &ctilty,; and no attainment of analysis and abstraction , but a cognition attained only by the direct insight of the reason . The eye of reason sees in the ground of the hmnan , that this selJctivity and self-law is the very prerogative and crown of its being , making it competent to role over nature , and to Hve unmortal with no help from nature . But truly an activity that goes out of its own accord , as is the rational in humanity , and thoroughly supernatural as it is , yet is it ever subject to the colliding influences of flesh and sense . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of perpetual watchfulness and struggle , and at no moment can it rest in serenity and be sure that some suppressed lust shall not suddenly spring up with inordinate clamors for gratification . It can never bd otherwise than militant even if triumphant . It is in an enemy 's country , and owes all its security to its sleepless valor . In &llen; humanity the rational has already sold itself in bondage to the animal , and basely subjected itself to nature , and thus conditioned itself under a load of necessities that it is morally helpless to throw off " The law in the members " continually wars against the law of the mind , and brings in subjection to the law of sin and death , " and.thus with all its liberty and responsibility and supernatural activity , humanity is no ground in which to look for the Absolute . Individually and collectively , the race is still so bound in the conditions of nature , either by constitutional or moral alliance , that it is utterly vain to hope that it shall ever be thoroughly absolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought to our knowledge by revelation rather than by any human ezpe-/z/ rience , who in all the prerogatives of rationality , as self-active , self-directed , and self-rewarded , are endowed like ourselves . They find an ultimate end to their activity in the securing of their own worthiness of character , and a constant stimulus and directory in their own conscious selfresponsibility . They know that they can not stand before the tribunal of another , unless they can pass the scrutinizing ordeal of their own consciences . They bring up from within higher and wider and more perfect ideals of beauty and truth , and can thus criticize and estimate whatever may come into their larger experience , much more accurately and comprehensively than can be effected by any of the human femily . They thus are higher in supernatural endowment than ourselves . Add to all this the great distinction that they are not incarnate , and have no subjection to the clogs and collisions of matter . Their reason is incorporeal ; or if there be a corporeity , it is what the inspired apostle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " and thus imposing upon the activity and the spiritual sensibility none of the chafing , fretting , tempting excitements of our carnal nature . Nor , in the case of the great mass of the unfallen , have they ever subjected themselves to the corrosion and desperation which necessarily accompany the remorse of conscious guilt . Here then is an absolution even from an alliance with matter , and also the much more important consideration that they are absolved from all the conditions , without and within , which sin imposes . Here is a spontaneity more elevated , and a law of higher import and in clearer characters written on the heart , than any that the eye of reason has yet before disclosed to us . Surely in so wide an absolution from all outer conditions /z/ we must be near the attamment of the Absolute we are seeking . We fix this conception of angeKo completeness and perfection in our mind , and ask , is not here the absolutely free , good , and holy ? But when the eye of reason looks more narrowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell , many occasions of outward restraint and conditions of imposed necessities appear that divide the angelic world by a broad line of demarcation from the Sphere of the Absolute . There are ranks and orders among them , giving rise to the distinctive appellations of archangel , thrones , dominions , powers and principalities ; there are perhaps different kinds of being indicated by the names Angels , Cherubim , Seraphim , and the Liviag Ones ; all imposing the conditions of superior and inferior , prerogative and subordination , the tie of a class and the spirit of a party ; and thus opening the door to the incoming of selfc ish spiritual passions in all the shapes of pride , envy , hate , jealousy , ambition , oppression , rebelHon , deception , Ac , and which have actually entered in all the malignity and mendacity of the fallen spirits . The highest angel is still limited in rational powers and activities , and thus necessitated to often come upon themes of speculation , and questions of practical iQterest , where he can not see what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the necessities of his finiteness he finds himself conditioned to seek light and receive commands from one that is higher than himself . He can not absolve himself from these conditions , and though he were to be true to all the light he has , he can not rise above and free himself from these necessities , but would be doomed to go on eternally in darkness , doubt , and fear , /z/ firom which nothing that he could bring out from himself could deliver him . In his very elevation , the boundless unknown yet before him would leave him as really helpless as the lowest , while the magnitude of the issues to his errors would make him more fearfully dependent than any . The highest angel must be ruled by a higher , and thus conditioned to an outer authority , or , in his finiteness and ignorance without a higher , must be doomed to the conditions of more terrible necessities , and thus in all ways must he stand &r; below the Idea of the Absolute . Now , in all self activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to matter ; essence which is not substance ; and also is there in this involved personality as opposed to mere animal identity ; a law both in precept and penalty sounding through the whole being as sel enacted and self-promulgated . The being is bound to be himself his own end , and can not get his own or another 's approbation if he permit himself to be made a means to any other 's end . In humanity is such personaLLty , but not pure . The man is not only personal , but also animal as thing in nature . The angel is pure personality , but not Absolute . He must depend on the instructions and requisitions of a higher . The authority of another may send the sound of a higher law through the soul , and then his self-law will also sound through his spiritual being , that in no way can he be worthy of his own approbation but in unquestioning obedience to this higher law . To that he is conditioned by what is due to himself . What the insight of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevated above all possible authority which can come from without his own being . The inner THE ABSOLTJTB AS IN THE BBAfiON. 85 light of reason must exclude all need of instruction , and the intrinsio excellency must exclude all higher law . The /Supreme Spirit is , thus , elevated above all outer authority , and absolved from all obligation ( fl extra . He is conditioned solely by what he knows in himself is due to himself The Supreme Spirit is therefore Absolute self-law and self-determiner . This is the Idea of the Absolute in the reason ; not at all the Infbite in space and time ; nor the unconditioned in substance and cause ; nor the purely abstract movement of thought itself ; but a Supreme Spirit self-determined . Not without relation , for then he could not be expressed ; but a pure spontaneity viewed in relation to its own Joiown intrinsic excellency . Not without conditions , for he could not then come within any explanation ; but conditioned only upon the perpetual behest of his own dignity , or , in other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such supreme self-determination is the very conception of Absolute Reason . All that belongs to nature is excluded from it . There is nothing to be constructed within limits , for it is independent of space and time ; there is nothing to be connected as of qualities in a substance , or of events in a cause , for there is nothing to which the conceptions of statics and dynamics , physical substances and causes can Jiave any relevancy . It is utterly supernatural , and nothing 4 ) f the laws and conditions of nature can possess any significancy in reference to it . Reason is not a /act ; a somewhat that has been made ; but from its own necessity of being can be conceived no otherwise than a verity which fills immensity and eternity . In it is self-knowledge , selfaction , self-direction , since it contains the archetypes or /z/ patterns of all possibilities , and the reason for taking which in the determination of such only as may be worthy of its own acceptance ; and in this perpetual eqnaUing and filling its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is unreasonable that there is no such end , and no such determined activity towards it , and certain attainment of it ; or , which is the same thing , it is absurd to suppose that the Absolute Beason should not both be and fulJU its high behests . The conception of the non-being of the Absolute Reason involves the absurdity of conceiving reason to be unreasonable . To the Absolute Reason there must be the known necessity for itself ; the conscious absurdity that it should not be . Such Absolute Reason is manifestly a Person , having in himself the knowledge of all possible , and the self-determining will to execute all his own behests . To him there can be no beginning nor end , for there can be no time when he was not ; and to him there can be no bounds , for there can be no place where he is not . He is unsustained and uncaused , for there can be no substance which he does not hold , and no cause which he does not originate . He is absolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than himself Here ' is no abstraction , but the positive affirmation of the I Ah ; he who has being and blessedness and exhaustless jRilness in himself ; even the being of whom it would be an everlasting absurdity to suppose that he was not , and was not blessed , and was not satisfied . Sense can not joerceive Him ; discursive thought can not conceive Him ; only a spiritual discernment , the direct insight of reason , can behold Him . All the attributes which our manner of conceiving apply /z/ to him participate in this characteristic of absoluteness . ESs wisdom is absolved from all dependence upon outward conditions . He has within himself the reason-view of all things possible to be put in objective being , in the plans or ideal archetypes to which they must conform , and his regard to that which is worthy of his own acceptance determines what of all that is possible shall also be actual He is absolute liberty , for the one rule of that which is everlastingly worthy of himself and securing his own dignity or glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might tyrannize and enslave . He is absolutely blessed , for in his constant holiness and steadfast purpose , fixed upon his own glory , there is no collision or disturbance , but the perpetual serenity of an unruffled flow of righteousness . He is absolute sovereign , for while the ultimate end of his own dignity is ever before him and eternally directing all his agency , he as supreme has rightful authority and headship over all the beings that exist beside him , and may rightfully conmiand in the ends of his glory that they should serve him with unquestioning and constant devotion . He is , in fine , and as the most comprehensive form of expression , thb absolute Good ; good in himself as supremely excellent without any reference to a further end , and good as the source and supplier of all the good that any other beings possess and enjoy . He can be put to no use as a means to get something beyond himself ; but as the end of all ends , all other things fulfil their measure in conspiring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The highest seraph and the humblest saint honor themselves only in their devotion to his honor . This conceotion of Deity as the Absolute Good , holds /z/ itself completely above and beyond all conceptions that apply to nature , and are formed in the connections of the discnrsive understanding . Nature has its conceived powers , which in combination make up all the statics and dynamics of physical science ; but within the Deity there can be conceived no action of physical forces , pushing , pulling , balancing , preponderating one with another . No combinations of substances can be here conceived , working their changes and making their qualities to pass away as one displaces another , which is the constant march of nature 's causes and events ; but the absolute Jehovah is in essence as in purpose , " without variableness or the shadow of turning . " From nature , as giving a permanent position , we determine all bearings and distances , and thus judge all places to belong to the one space ; and from the ongoing of nature we determine all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the one time . But in our conception of the absolute God we have no pennanent points from whence to begin any measures of space , and no fixed instants from whence to begin any computations of time . In the Idea of the Absolute we can fix no " here " and no " there , " no " above " nor " below , " no " outside " nor " inside , " no " shape " nor " distance . " Just as little from this Idea can we determine a " now " or " then , " a " before " or " after . " Space and time are wholly irrelative ; substance and cause have here no significancy . All these apply to nature , and the Absolute is utterly supernatural He maintains his being without resting on any substance ; he puts forth his agency without waiting on any cause . As thus independent of nature , he can be conceived as /z/ the Creator and Guide of nature . He has the conditions within himself for an activity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current of its flowing events to a channel that shall reach and consummate his pleasure . The moving spring to create , and to create thus and not otherwise , is in no constitutional want , no appetite he finds craving within him , but solely the conscious behest of what is due to himself and most worthy of his own accepting . It is love , in the acceptation of a pure pleasure in the right , and not the impulse to be happy ; a regard to well-being and not merely to good-feeling . His activity may thus originate , after the eternal archetypes which absolute reason supplies , a material universe wisely and exactly adapted to his design . Reason determines that the physical should minister to the sentient , and that the sentient should subserve the spiritual , and thus it may be anticipated that the creative work will arrange itself in ministering subserviences through the varied orders of material , vegetable , animal , and spiritual being , bringing out what was potentially within him , and guiding on to consmnmated issues , till the fuU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an Idea of the Absolute we have the conception of a God who is at once Creator and Governor ; Author , Guide , and Finisher of a Cosmos , or glorious universe , whose only reason and end is that it is worthy of his own acceptance and approbation . /z/ 1 . Mattes is Foecb ; DiSTmaniSHABLs : as Antagonist AND DiEBMPnvE. - Spirit must be senior to matter . la the already attained Idea of an Absolute spirit , we have that which is essential in all spirit . That a spirit may be Absolute , he must have all the conditions and resources of independent action and direction within his own bemg , and thus stand wholly absolved from all limitation in any thing out of himself ; but that a being should be spirit , absolute or dependent , he must have spontaneous activity or sel motion ; an energizing which is initiative within his own beings and not a superinduced impulse from another . That such Spirit may be rational and free , he must find his own ideals in himself and be competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origination . He must have his ultimate ideas of the beautiful , the true , and the good , and be able to criticize and judge of all beauty , truth , and goodness , by his own independent standard . Spiritual activity is always simple , without counteraction or reaction ; there is no mechanical impulse , resistance , nor friction ; no composition nor resolution . KATfEB AS SUBSTANTIAL EXISTENOE. 91 But what is Matter ? The first answer comes from the sense . The conception as gained in experience , the earliest , the easiest , and thus the common conception of matter , is that of some dead , dry , hard substance , given in mass of a larger or smaller volume . It is found divisible into parts , and we readily conceive that the largest bodies may be made up of small particles , and in our analysis of these particles we bring them into atoms which will not admit that we should further subdivide them . We thus begin with that into which we have analyzed our experience , and conceive of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various conjunctions of the atoms all bodies are formed . In all cases , whether as atoms or in the mass , matter is for the sense a lifeless , powerless , mo tibnless substance ; utterly inert , except as something is done to it , and in itself only existing to occupy and cumber the place it fills . When matter is subjected to a nicer scrutiny in experiment , the conception is more extended , but not at all corrected . It is observed that matter in bodies is perpetually altering its qualities , and though often by slow gradations , yet in all cases , matter is moving from present modes of existence and transmuting itself to other forms . Liquids are congealed or pass off into vapor ; fermentation carries its changes through the successive saccharine , vinous , and acetous stages ; the atoms crumble and the hardest bodies become disintegrated , and these again are made the elements of new compounds ; living agencies are assimilating and building up new bodies , and then the life goes out and the body again dissolves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitudes , indeed the qualities of /z/ every sense , glide from one into another , and nothing abides permanently . All things flow . We sometimes speak as if one portion of matter moved or changed other portions , and that thus matter was conceived as itself active in producing its changes ; but a partial reflection again qualifies the language , and we speak of powers and forces given to matter , and that the imparted force and not the dead matter does all the work and makes all the changes . The highest conceptions of the sense will therefore be , that matter itself is not cause except as a causal efficiency is given to it ; that the forces and powers of nature are superinduced upon matter , and are something other than the matter ; matter is mere inertia and all changes are wrought in it and not by it . But when such a conception is subjected to the insight of reason it is found utterly empty , and that nothing can be made of it but a mere negation . To attempt applying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive and inert existence do ? At rest it can not move , and moving it can not rest , without a force supplied to it . It can neither change nor resist change , neither combine nor dissolve , neither sustain nor press , except as power is given to it to do aU the work . Put it where we may it is utterly a caput-mortuunij neither acting nor reacting ; the force given to it does all things for it , while the dead-head itself is incapable of any use , or of becoming a means to any end . How can it be known f If any sense receive an impression and thereby a sensation , out of which the intellectual action brings a distinct and definite perception , that impression and sensation must have been induced , not at all by the dead matter , but by some efficiency put into matter , and it qwq We must , therefore , wholly renounce such a conception of matter , for indeed upon rational examination it will be found to be an impossible conception , a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep this force which we have supposed to be supplied to matter , and which we have found in such case must work all the mutations that occur in matter , carefully subjected to a rational insight , and determine whether indeed this force that does all that is done is not matter itself . Simple activity is spiritual ac* tivity , and has nothing in it that can awaken the thought of force ; and it is only as it meetis some opposing action and encounters an tagonist that we come to have the notion of force . In all push and pull there is counteraction , complex action , action and reaction , while simple spiritual agency can never be made a conception of physical existence . It can not be thought as taking and holding any fixed position ; it can not become a permanent and have a " where " that it might be conceived to pull from , nor a " there " that it might be conceived to push to . It could not be detenied to any time nor to any place , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor where it might end . When , however , the conception is that of simple action in counteraction , an activity that works from opposite ides upon itself we have in it at once /z/ the true notion of force . From the difficulty of clearly apprehending counteraction or antagonism in a single activity , as always acting in opposite directions upon or against itself and which must be the true conception , for the notion is that of one source for the antagonism , it will be more readily taken and equally available in result , if we here , and generally through the work , conceive of two simple activities meeting each other and reciprocally holding back , or resting against , each other , and thus of the two making a third thing at the limit of meeting which is unlike to either . In neither of the two activities can there be the notion offeree , but at the point of antagonism force is generated and one new thing comes from the synthesis of the two activities . To distinguish this from other forces hereafter found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken , and there is more than the idea of being which the simple activities each have ; there is being standing outj an existence ; being in re , reality a thing . Let , then , an indefinite number of such positions contiguous to each other be conceived as so taken and occupied , and a space will thereby be filled and holden ; an aggregate force will maintain itself in a place ; and a ground is given on which other things may rest . A substantial reality here exists . This antagonism may be conceived to be of any degree of intensity , and the substantial ground will hold its place wit the same amount of persistency , and stand there permanent , impenetrable , and real . Nothing else may come into its place until it has itself been displaced . It is not inertia but a vis inertioe ; a force resting against itself , and thus holding itself in place . It rests because it has intrinsically an equilibrating resistance . /z/ But this conception of antagonism alone , though fully adequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give such forms and modes of matter as a universe needs for the rational ends designed in it . There will need to be varied substance ; combinations and resolutions ; perpetual changes and processes through successive stages ; and thus our very primitive idea of matter must comprehend more than the idea of pure antagonist force , even that which may dissolve and become a combination with pure antagonism . We conceive then of an activity going out in exactly the reverse process of our antagonism , even a beginning in the same limit of the meeting simple activities and working on each side away from the limit ; a throwing of simple activities in opposite directions from the limit of contact . Not a counteracting and resisting , but a divellent and disparting activity ; not an antagonistic , but hereafter known as distinctively a diremptive movement . Such an activity could not be conceived as space-filling of itself . Wherever the limit in which there might be conceived the contact of two simple activities should be , the diremptive movement would be away from that limit on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . The diremptive movement alone would be a disparting and going away of the activities from each other , and leaving a void . But if this diremptive movement be conceived as at the very limit and point of contact of the antagonism , the antagonist activity working toward itself in the limit , and the diremptive activity working from itself out of the limit , then must the diremptive movement on each side encounter the antagonist movement , and the simple diremptive activity going out on one side from the limit will meet the sim- /z/ pie antagonist activity on the same side coming in to the limit , and these two simples of the opposite kinds of forces must make a new connteraction among themselves . And equally so with the going out and the coming in of the opposite kinds of forces in their simple activities on the other side of the limit , the one must encounter the other and engender a new counteraction among themselves on this other side . The result thus must be that while the diremptive activity disparts and loosens the antagonism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binds in the divellency , and thus the diremption can neither go off wholly on either side and leave the limit void , nor the antagonism come up &om; each side and make the limit fidl , but both antagonism and diremption meet in the limit and make a third thing , which may be called indifferently an antagonist force loosed , or a diremptive force fixed . The pure forces in their contact in the simple limit may be known as units under the term of molecules or molecular forces ; the working to the limit constituting an antagonist molecular force , and the working away from the limit constituting a diremptive molecular force . The combination of these forces , in their joint interaction making a new compound as a third thing unlike to either alone , may be known as also a unit , constituting a material atonij and which may further on be known as a chemical atom or molecule . Our conception of matter must therefore be of this combination of distinguishable forces , though we shall find it convenient for the more clear apprehension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each distinctly and separately . 2 . Cbeation. - In the manner here used creation has /z/ the meaning of origination ; the putting forth of something where before there was nothing , and this something thus set forth a new thing which had not previously an existence . It does not involve the impossible thought of e2dstence coming out of a void of all being . The axiom , " out of nothing , nothing comes , " is to be taken as universally conclusive . There can be no creation without a Creator ; and as the creation we now seek to apprehend is that of the beginning of existence , or outer being , the Creator must himself be conceived as the uncreated ; he who ever iSy and yet who never exists . His being is never objective ; expressed in form ; standing out in definite proportions ; but purely spiritual , and known only in that supernatural light to which no mortal can approach . This ever invisible Creator puts forth a material creation in objective palpable manifestation , which only in his putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rational Idea of such creation ? The intention here is simply to attain the conception of originated existence , leaving the detail of the completed genesis of the universe to many subsequent separate paragraphs . With the distinct conception of force as the essence of all material being clearly in mind , we seek now to apprehend how , where force is not , it may begin to be . Force can not come from utter emptiness . Nor is it now to be apprehended as produced from some antecedent force , and thus a propagation or production from some force already created . Forces may change their modes of manifestation indefinitely , and this will be but the progressive development or successive births and growths in nature itself ; but we now want the conception of nature 's origin . The great /z/ difficulty to a clear apprehension is removed by keeping a steady discrimination between the ftmctions and cognitions in the discnrsive understanding and those in the comprehensive reason . To the understanding nothing can be conceived as literally beginning to be . That which is must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and aU new things are only some changes in the modes of old things . The whole function of the understanding is to connect in judgments , and the subject must already be given in which to connect the new predicate . The predicate must be thought as already belonging to the subject . If there is a new quality , it can not be viewed as then a thing newly originated , but a change in some substance that had before existed ; and if there is a new event , it can not be thought as then having its origin , but only as coming out from some old cause in a new mode of existence . The water following the ice as dissolved is not new , nor the vapor as following the water , but the new predicate is ever from some old subject . For any thing absolutely to begin to be , in the discursive judgments of the amderstanding , would be the absurdity of attempting to connect with no medium ; of thinking in judgments with no subject for the predicate . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of something that before was ; a change of some old existence into a new mode of manifestation . Nature thus , from first to last , goes onward the same , with no originations nor annihilations , but only a perpetual passing of the same substances into new modifications . But when we keep the reason-idea of spiritual agency , as spontaneous activity self-directed , we shall have an utterly new kind of cause , viz. : a cause originating or caus- /z/ ing to be &om; itself and not a cause conditioned or caused to cause from something back of itself . It is activity in Kberty , which can make a beginning from conditions within its own being . We have in this conception no impossibilities , nor absurdities of the last-first in affirming that we may intelligently apprehend how an utterly new thing can absolutely begin existence . With all rational spirits there is such capacity of initial causality , and thus of all free and responsible beings , we affirm that their personal acts are their own origination , and can no more be transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man and angel can , in this sense , truly create . Their good or bad deeds are of their own origination . Whatever another agent may do in throwing his own conditions upon them , he does not originate their acts within them . But man can not originate new forces , and thus man can not create matter . He is himself incarnate ; utterly merged in matter ; and can thus put out no act that shall immediately meet another act in counteraction , but his every act of energizing must first encounter the forces in which he is incorporated . His activity meets forces , and moves matter already created , but his activity can not , with nothing between , meet itself in counteraction , and take a new position , and thus begin a new space-filling operation . Tea , if we were to conceive of angels as pure spirits , activities without corporeity , and thus competent to make one act counteract and hold another in position , yet these counter activities could only be within their own subjective spheres , and condition their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition other agencies which could not bring themselves within their subjective /z/ spheres . Thus , neither man nor angel can be conceived as competent to create force that shall be objective , real , substantial , and impenetrable to another agency . But with the conception of a Supreme Absolute Spirit , all these difficulties are excluded . He can begin action , he can put action in counteragency with no forces intervening , and whatever positions he may thus take and hold by permanent forces , though subjective to himself , or within his own sphere of agency , they may be objective to all other being , for all being will be alike subjective to Hitti in whom all live and move and have their being . Take then the Idea of the Absolute , already attained , and within the pure spiritual agency of his being there is no force ; no antagonism or counteragency . Simple spiritual activity ta*kes no positions , fills no space , puts within itself no limits from whence we can begin to determine places and periods . Spaces and times are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place and moving in successions , so nothing of impenetrable substances and series of physical causes can be thought as lying and working on in the Godhead . But in the knowledge he has of his own supreme excellency of being , there is an end in his own dignity and glory ever before him . He knows what is due to himself and nothing can intervene that he should not be true to himself . " He remaineth faithful , he can not deny himself , " He sees that it behooves him , as a right consciously due to himseli to manifest himself in creation . Under such ethical behest , and not at all before the impulse of any constitutional craving , God arises to the work of creation , and becomes a beginner and Author of an existence which before was not . CKEATJONj AS OBIGnTATION Q KATTEB. 101 Solely from the reason , and not from any want as if he too had a nature , God puts his simple activity in counter agency . He makes act meet and hold act , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ; a something standing out for objective manifestation , and holding itself in position as a reality distinct from his own subjective simplicity . This force fixes itself in position ; holds itself at rest ; and so far from being inert , its very existence h avis inertice or a force actively holding itself stilL Combined with this antagonist activity , in the same limit of counteraction , is the diremptive activity that works conversely to the antagonism , and which though hereafter to be considered distinctly , may now for the present be apprehended as in unity , and the antagonism and diremption to be the one agency of the Absolute Spirit in one md the same limit of their action ; the antagonism working each way into the limit and the diremption working each way out from the limit , and both making hi their interaction a compound material substance , which has the disparting of the antagonism in the diremption between the counterworking activities , and the fixing of the diremption by the antagonism on each side of the divellent activities . There is thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diremption works each way out from the limit , and thus counterworks with an antagonism coming up each way in the limit , and thereby two antagonisms and one diremptive force equilibrate each other and fill and hold the space they have taken . Any considerable extent of space so filled , a cubic inch , or a cubic mile , is a creation of matter palpable to the senses , impenetrable and substantial The force in every position /z/ becomes a force reciprocally acting through the whole place filled , and is at once subject to its own inherent laws and bound on its course of necessitated successive development . It is a nature , having already in it a conditioned and predetermined series of growths which must come out in their own order . The simplicity of the spiritual works on still undisturbed within the Deity , for no conditions of the material reach back of the point of counter-agency . In matter is force , or the physical , and all its necessitated efficiencies work downward in their destined sequences , but above matter all is still spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the end of its own dignity or glory . The physical can not push itself back and hinder , tire , or in any way interrupt the activities of the spiritual ; and the spiritual can not bring itself down , and reveal its agency amid the statics of the substantial or the dynamics of the causal , and thus appear on the same theatre with the physical phenomena , but the natural and the supernatural spheres are forever separated in the limit where simple agencies in counteraction become a new thing that holds its place , and works its way , as a physical force necessitating its products . The creation of the material is from God ; its genesis is in him ; its perpetuation and sustentation is from the continual going out oi his simple activity ; but this niaterial is not God , nor at all competent to rise from its imposed conditions into the place of the Absolute . The Logos , or divine working word , is in the world ; is the life and light of the world ; and yet he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the world is not he but his creature . /z/ 3 . The Determination op Space and Time . - There are many kinds of space and of time , and one may appertain to one person and another to another person , and that which has pertinency to one may be wholly impertinent and irrelevant to the other , and if left to their own sensible experience , or the deductions of the logical miderstanding , neither one could determine his own spaces and times to belong to one space and one time , nor that the spaces and times of both belonged to one common space and one common time . These very significant propositions are usually wholly overlooked , and most persons make no question of any distinctions in kind , in spaces and times , and thus apprehend nothing of the difficulty or the importance of the determination of spaces and times . A few obvious but disregarded l acts presented carefully to the insight of reap son will very fiilly convince us that our experience , or our logical judgments , have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination can only be made by fixed forces , in position , and their perpetual changes in succession . There may be a morbid affection or . some unnatural distortion given to the eye , which shall induce &ntastic; colored spots even when the eye is closed . With such phantasms , a space is also given in which they appear , but so soon as the colored spots vanish , the space in which they were goes out with them . If on another day other such phenomena occur , a space again is given in which they have their different places . Now neither the experience nor the judgment can determine that these spaces are the same , or that they belong to one and the same whole of all space . They came with their colored spots and went with /z/ them , and each space is in the experience as distinct from the other as the spots in one are distinct from those in the other . Two persons may have such phenomena , but the spots and the spaces are for each person his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same that the other has , than that his spots are the same . There are here many different spaces . So when I construct any pure diagram , as a triangle or a circle , that pure figure has a space in which it is given , and when the figure drops from the inner consciousness , the space in which it was is lost also . I may successively make and lose many such constructions , but I shall always have and lose their spaces with them . Two persons , or any number of persons , may be constructing their pure figures , and they will all have their spaces with their dia* grams , but neither the one can determine all his spaces to belong to one whole space , nor the whole number of persons determine that all their spaces belong to one space in common . Much less could any determine that the spaces in the affected organ , as before , and those in the inner consciousness , as now , belonged to one space . Thus , again , of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected image ; but if the mirror reflect no image , it will give no space . The spaces come and go with the reflections . A cloud passes over the face of the lake which had mirrored the heavens and the objects on its borders , and the space and the images go together , and when the cloud has gone the images and their space again come . No experience nor discursive understanding can make the different mirrored-spaces stand together in one space , nor all spaces into one whole of all space . /z/ Just SO also of time . I may be absorbed in mental reflection and take no note of outer successions , and I shall be conscious that a time has been passing in that my inward thoughts and reflections have been succeeding each other . I may again arouse myself to a consciousness of outer objective successions or may have an interval of sleep , and afterwards another experience of reflection or musing meditation may occur , with its consciousness that a time is passing though I take no notice of any outward ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor logical judgment can affirm that they belong to one time . Two persons may so meditate in separate absorption of all outer consciousness , and each wiU have his own musmgtime because each wiU have his own inward successions , but neither nor both together can put their distinct times into one time . Or , again , one may dream , and after an interval of deep sleep or waking consciousness may dream again , and with each dream there will be its own dreaming-time , but no experience or discursive thought can put the different dreaming-times into one time . Two or more persons may so dream , and each have his own time in his dream , but no one nor aU together can connect their separate dreamingtimes into one common time for all . How much less shall any one make all musing-times and dreaming-times to connect in one common time . The times are given in reference to the successions which pass in the inward consciousness , and if there are alternations of conscious movement with suspensions of all movement in unconsciousness , the interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ // nor can any connections of the logical judgment bridge over the chasms . Evn so with all objective spaces and times ; the experience and the logical thought can never make them to be in one space and one time . I look upon some broad landscape and determine all its distinct objects relatively to each other , and make the whole to belong together in one place , as a space which contains them . But if I am removed in my sleep to another position , and I awake again and look upon another landscape , I can again make all its objects to belong to one place as a space containing them ; but I can neither by experience nor judgment put these two spaces together into one space , and say which direction the one is from the other , nor determine that the two belong indeed to the one whole of all space , for neither my experience , nor my logical understanding , as an induction from all that experience gives , can determine that there is any one whole of all space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscapes with their different objects determined in their relative positions in one place as a space containing each landscape , but neither one nor all these persons could , from their experience or their logical thinking , determine that the spaces which held all their landscapes , respectively , belonged to one space , nor even that there was any one space which contained all spaces . And so also I experience a series of successive changes in surrounding objects , as the passing of different shadows and changes of color over the landscape , and I can determine them in their relative periods in the one time of duration for . them aU . And if I am in unconsciousness stopped from all experience , and again watch the changes of a SFACOfl AJSCD TIMB DETESMINED. 107 landscape in some other conscious experience , I can put all the occurrences again into their relative periods during the one time of their successions , but if this last also be cut off from all succession in unconsciousness , I can not say , either from my experience or my logical thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , or which is before and which after the other . The chasms of unconsciousness sunder the continuance of successions , and when the experience has been cut off from both completely , they stand each in their own time , and nothing is given to permit the connecting of the two times into one and determining their order of occurrence . And if two or more persons had their conscious objective successions , they would each have their times , and their determined relative occurrences in their times respectively , but neither one nor all could put their respective times into one , nor show any relative order of occurrence in reference to them . Each man 's spaces and times are only his own spaces and times , and where they have been disjoined in his experience , his discursive thought can never put them together , and much less can any one man put all the spaces and times of all men into one space and one time . So it must ever be , when all men are left only to experience or the deductions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can never bring their own distinct spaces and times into one space and time , nor ever possess one common space and one common time between them . Experience gives them many different spaces and times , and no judgment from experience could put the different spaces into one space nor the different times into one time . Each man 's places and periods would be for him just as he /z/ oonstmoted them , and he could determine nothing for another . But the insight of the reason fbds at once , that if there be one substantial existing object that holds its permanent position for the same man through all his subjective states of consciousness , this will enable him to determine all places &om; this one place ; and if this one substantial object be common to all men , it will enable all men to determine fi ) r themselves one common space . The one man , and all men , can construct bearings and distances from one and the same position , and thus each man and all men may determine one and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its phenomena successively , it will enable each man and all men to come to the same successions , and determine one time for each man 's times and all men 's times . It is from this necessary principle of space and time-determinations that in Rational Psychology we demonstrate the existence of a real substantial universe against all Sensationalism and Idealism . All men have the determination of one common space and one common time , but this could not possibly be , except upon their communion with the same substantial nature both in its permanence and orderly successions . We thus know that when as yet nature had not been put out in objective manifestation , nature 's place and time could have no determinate significancy . If the present nature of things be annihilated , the determinate places and periods of nature would vanish with nature itself , and if there were minds to have inward experiences , they might construct inward figures and have subjective spaces , and limit successive movements and have subjective periods ; /z/ but each mind only for itself and could never put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time , nor bring all men 's spaces to one common space , nor all men 's times to one common time . And should another nature of things be created , it would come up in its own determinate space and time , and no understanding could connect it in the same one space and one time of the nature which had been annihilated . All minds must be able to go to one and the same substantial nature of things for the determination of their spaces and times , or they can never determine that they have one common space and one common time . When , therefore , we conceive of an Absolute Creator , setting his simple activity in counteragency and taking a position , and in balanced antagonism holding that position permanently , we have in it all that is conditional for space and time determination . In the simple spiritual agency we can determine nothing of space or time , for there is no fixed point firom whence to determine direction and distance , and no fixed instant from whence to determine successions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a determinate place taken , and in the developed progress of its working according to its inherent conditions there is a determinate succession , and each man may deternvine here his own places by the one space , and his own times by the one time , and all mien may here determine one space and one time in common for them . While each man 's subjective spaces and times are still his own , and no other mind can come in communion with them , the one substantial space-filling and time-enduring force is common to all ifbr the same space and time determination . /z/ 4 . Mattes must impeess itselp upon the Senses . - If matter were conceived as wholly inert , it would be utterly inexplicable how it should affect any sense , and its qualities become perceived through any organ . Whatever was done must be by some imparted force , and that would give the whole impression , while the dead matter would be entirely superfluous . As it could affect nothing so the senses could perceive nothing of it . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling certain places in space , we may readily apprehend how the senses must be impressed by it , and the sensations induced be brought up into the light of consciousness . The sense can never go back of the sensation and determine any thing of the substantial being which gives the sensation , for the sensation in the organ is the only content or material out of which the perception is made . The substance affects the organ , and the intellect distinguishes and defines this affection in the organ , and this only appears , or becomes a phenomenon . We can never perceive the substance , and only the peculiar manner in which the substance has affected the organ , and hence the sense can only give us the qualities of things and not the things in themselves . But the insight of reason penetrates the act of perception itself , and comprehends the sense in its complete function , thoroughly . The organ must in some way be affected from without itself and this affection induces the sensation within itself and as this has its own peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that must be distinguished by the intellectual agency and the peculiar quality determined , and this determined quality must , MATTER AS SENSIBLY FESOEPTIBLE . Ill by a still farther intellectual action , be wholly defined and the quantity of the quality fully perceived , whether in space , time , or amount . The qualities perceived are but the modes in which the substantial reality impresses itself upon , and thus manifests itself in the sense . And with this conception of a space-filling force , it is quite competent for the understanding to trace its necessary connections in any organ , and thus attain the clear idea of the functions of the sense through all its kinds and varieties of perception . The inherent energy in matter itself is sufficient to impress itself upon the senses , and make its qualities to be perceived . We will go through the senses in the order that the impressions will be most readily apprehended . Th Tyuch , - The essential being of matter is force , or counteragency , and it is the nature of this , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes . The organ of touch , here anticipated as already existing , is the finger or some fleshy part of the body , and is thus itself like all matter , a composition of space-filling forces which hold themselves permanent in their place , and moreover the finger possesses a vital and sentient activity which penetrates every part , and capacitates it for communion with the intellectual agency which must distinguish and define its content . The organ , therefore , has its own place , and its conditioned nature to retain its position , and its medium of communication with the intellectual and conscious spirit . When this organ , then , is made to meet any matter , either by invading the place of another portion , or by being invaded itself by another , there must supervene in the contact a reciprocal pressure , and which maybe more nicely /z/ regulated by the voluntary action of the living muscles , and by this impression an affection or proper sensation is given to the vitalized material organ . The matter touched may be made solid by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also have its sur &ce; of any variety of shape and outline , and which must determine the accordant impression upon the organ ; and when this is distinguished and defined by the intellectual action , the perception of the quality , as hardness , roughness , weight , &o^; will be perfected . This impenetrable space-filling force may impress the sense of touch with any conceivable degree of resistance , and must thus give to itself in the perception the like degree of intensity as quality . The impression is , in this sense , made only by actual contact , and thus no condition is given whereby to determine distance from the organ ; but relative distances , as extension in space and outline of figure , may readily be determined by a continuous application of the organ of touch to the resisting matter . So far as there is a continuous progressive contact , either by the organ moving over the matter or the matter moving on the organ , the occasion for determining extension , shape , and size is given , and the sense can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickness , and complete shape which the matter may possess . In all the above cases a conscious measure of muitoular pressure has been necessary to the perception , but a much lighter contact with the opposing matter in a slight Motion upon it , will give phenomena that are considered rather as sensations awakened in ourselves than as qualities possessed by the matter , and it is only in such a degree of intensity /z/ that the matter occasioning it forces itself upon our attention , that we can refer the phenomenon as quality to the matter itself . Thus with the feeling of irritation , titulation , and gentle warmth or coolness , when slight , we say we feel the sensations ; but when more intense , and the thought of the matter occasioning it obtrudes itself , we say the body feels rough , harsh , hot or cold , and we apply the sensation at once as qualities of the matter . It is herein manifest that nothing further is necessary to conceive , as the inherent essence and constitution of matter , than a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible qualities which the touch can perceive must be very intelligently occasioned by it . UTie Taste . - All matter in a mass , larger or smaller , is a compound of the elemental forces each in its own position , and thus each point offeree may be taken to be a molecule of matter . These must also be more or less intense or must have varied directions and combinations given to their antagonism , and thus the molecules of matter must be of great variety . The atomic existence and varied composition may give occasion to all the varied forms of matter in what is known of earths , metals , salts , alkalis , acids , &c.; The tongue , also , as the organ of taste , with the surrounding parts of the mouth , is here anticipated as having its composition of corpuscles , and the whole vivified and sentient with that living activity which has assimilated and incorporated them . This organ , from its own construction , is hereby fitted to take on the peculiar sensations given when the sapid matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taste have this peculiarity in distinction from the touch , that there must be not merely /z/ // contact , but a dissolving of the compound body , and the bringing of the separate molecules upon the organ in their own particular degree and variety of pungency . These different particles give occasion to different sensations , and when these are intellectually distinguished and defined there wiU be all the conditions for complete perception . JTie SmeU , - The living assimilating process builds up also an organ , for attaining the different odors by which the material world is qualified , in the nose . Penetrated as it is with sentient life , it becomes competent to receive the impressions which the effluvia from surrounding bodies may make upon it . The essential elements of matter in the primitive forces which compose it may be more or less intensely held in position , and more or less firmly adherent , and thus some portions of matter may be permanently adhesive and must therefore be inodorous ; other matter may be volatile and admit that the various mechanical agencies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particles and thus effectually surround itself with an effluvia from its own substance . The tension of the particles , and the energy and direction with which they must be thrown upon the organ will determine the impressions made , and thus from either the conditions in the effluvia itself or those of its transmission to the organ , there must be sensations of all varieties , giving occasion for distinctly and definitely perceiving all kinds of odors . The aroma may so stimulate and excite as to awaken the most regaling fragrance , or an effluvia may be present that shall give the most foetid and offensive smells . The organ is not in this sense necessarily brought in /z/ contact with the body of matter itself as in touch and taste , but only in contact with some of the particles sent off from the body , and thus there can be no opportunity given for constructing shape and outline by the smell , and only the capacity for vaguely estimating distance and direction from the degrees of intensity with which these particles may strike upon and impress the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the perceptions that can be gained through the sense of smell . /Sound. - With a sentient organ like the ear , there is a capability to receive impressions from material nature of an entirely different kind than those in touch , taste , or smell . The organ itself is expected to stand wholly and often quite distantly separated from the sonorous body , and no part of the material substance is itself to flow off and meet the organ . A medium must be supplied in the elastic space-filling force which constitutes the air , and which surrounds both the organ and the sonorous body , and fills the whole space between them . An ear in vctcuo must be without sound . The sonorous point is at the ear , but the condition given for the sound may be at a point very far removed from the ear , and the impulse from the body which puts the elastic medium in undulation must make the communication from the body to the organ , and thus aU the conditions for the appropriate impression and sensation are supplied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body stricken , and the rarer or denser medium through which the communication is made , must all modify the sensation and determine the variety of the sound . It must thus be louder or weaker , and modified through // manifold tones which have a higher or lower pitch . The impulse at the starting point in the sonorous body must perpetuate itself through all the media , and the impression must be determined by all the peculiarities given in the whole process . In this way an occasion is manifest for all possible sounds through the matter made of compounded space-filling forces . And not merely the direct impulses , but the rebounding and reflected waves from some intervening sonorous body , wiU occasion all that is to determine the perception of the echoes which may accompany some original sounds . All the laws of acoustics are intelligently read in the nature of these space-filling forces . Vision . - With the complicated and nicely adapted organism of the eye given in conception , it may be a clear insight of the reason that matter , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision . Like the ear , the eye also is adapted to receive impressions , not directly from contact with the object , but through the medium of that which may lie between the organ and the object . This intervening medium may be a direct transmission from the object , or some force that shall put in oscillation an elastic fluid lying between the organ and object . What this force is , will hereafter be determined , but it is sufficient here to have the conception of a space , about an organ of vision and an object , filled up with contiguous antagonisms , and which may be put in motion and made to aflect the organ as the movement shall be modified by the object . The medium must in this way give its impression to the organ from the object , and this impression , whether by linear or oscillatory impulse , must be perpetuated to the retina , and through the optio /z/ nerve to the sensorimn , and this must give all the conditions that any conceived matter may present for distinct and definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to make bodies Imninons , will give a more complete and adequate insight into the necessary determinations of vision , but enough is given in the idea of a space-filling force , to apprehend that this , and not any dead matter , must be the medium of perception by sight . The force which must move such inert matter would be all that could impress the organ , and when we have the force given in idea , the dead matter may be altogether dispensed with as wholly useless and irrelevant . Thus it is that the whole origination and endless modifications of our phenomenal experience , which is communicated through our organs of sense , have their sufficient conditions in the one idea of a space-filling force , which may vary itself in intensity , rapidity , and direction of agency , indefinitely . This substantial matter must make its impressions upon the organs according to its conditioning nature and their organic constitution , and must thus reveal itself through them in determinate modes . The forces constitute the substantial existence , the modes of Organic impression and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statics and Dynamics . - The sense-conception of matter can by no possibility admit of any thing static or dynamic in nature . The supposed matter is wholly dead ; mere inertia ; and can possess nothing by which it may be conceived as holding itself in place whereby it may sustain any thing , nor as moving from its place whereby it might // push or pull any thing . If it upheld any thing , as a static , it must itself be sustidned by some cib extra force , and if it repelled any thing as a dynamic , it must itself be pressed by a force not its own . The forces introduced , to determine the dead matter , would do all the work without the superfluous introduction of such an inert extension . But our thought-conception of a space-filling force as the true substantial matter involves the full conception of both statics and dynamics . Counteraction in equilibrium must stand self-fixed . It is a force holding itself in its place . It is competent to sustain a pressure equal to the energy of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruding body shall carry with it the energy of a more intense antagonism . Thus with all masses of matter . In any form or magnitude , there is necessarily a poiat towards which all the outlying points tend , and on the force in which all the forces in the whole mass are sustained . When that point is at rest all the other points are held at rest by it , and when its vis inertice is overcome , all the forces in the other points of the mass will also yield their vis inertioe . A static force is that antagonism which holds itself at rest in its balanced counteraction . A dynamic force goes to the overcoming of a static . It may draw or expel , but it goes to the removing another force at rest , or to the retarding or accelerating another force in motion . Should the dynamic not be sufficient to overcome the static , still , in so &r; as its intensity of antagonism goes toward this , it is thus fiu* dynamic though the static does not yield to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter as a space-fiUing force . The counteraction in any point is static when in equilibrium MA.TTEB AS 8TA.TI0AL AlO ) DYNAMIOAL. 119 but when the agency in one direction is more energetic than that in the other , though there is still counteraction , yet must the weaker yield to the more energetic and the whole counter-agency perpetually displace itself in the direction of the working of the more strenuous agency . Such perpetually moving space-filling force may impinge upon another force and impel , or may be attached to another force and draw , and thus in any direction , the antagonist force in motion is a dynamic , either of impulsion or tension . A dynamic either drives or draws . It is also obvious that a static is nothing in nature without a dynamic , for were there no push nor pull there could be no holding of place by an equal antagonism ; and so also that there can be no dynamic in nature that has not also its static , for no push nor pull could be without a standpoint . In nature , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there no way of attaining to the supernatural , both the perpetuation of rest and the beginning of motion would be absurdities ; for you must first have your motion in the very act of holding at rest , and you must first have your rest as the hold-point or springboard of your moving some other body . The only way out of such an antinomy , between nature in the understanding and nature in the sense , is the apprehensioD of a supernatural in the reason . An absolute spirit has the spring to an originating act in himself in that he is ethical law in his spiritual excellency to govern himselfi He may originate action , directly from the claims as known to be due from himself to himself . He has an ethical stand-point and spring-board , and can thus put forth his spiritual act in counteraction and make a beginning . Spiritual activity /z/ put in counter-agenoy makes s , physiccU stand-point ; takes a position and holds it ; and in that a static force already is , from which all physical mechanics may go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the mind be filled only with the sense-conception of matter as mere inertia then can there be no apprehension of any principles of motion , and all its laws must be arbitrarily imposed . The very laws are mere facts , and for aught we can know , they might have been any other way as well as the present . TVlth such a conception of matter , it was a toilsome and tedious process to find how in &ct; matter had been made to move , and then generalize the acts as far as possible and call them laws of motion . Dead matter can not move any way , nor energize at all , and thus no thinking about matter , no insight of it , can get any motion , much less any laws of motion , out of it . The mind can only learn by experience how matter does move , and then generalize these facts and say they are laws of motion . In the true substantial matter , as space-filling force , the eternal principles of motion are already given , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as experimentally attamed , and we may successively see , that the immutable principles of space-filling forces will necessarily determine every law of motion to be as it has been found that it is . It is thus truly a principle in matter , and not merely a law arbitrarily constituted . The first Principle of motion is , tJiat it must he rectiImeal and uniform . - This is a necessary determination of the reason in its insight into the grounds of force from whence all locomotion must be generated . When two /z/ giinple agencies counterwork , the result must be a resting against each other in static equilibrium , if the countervailing activities are of equal energies . If one activity be of greater energy , it will be counteracted by the other to the amount of its energy , but the excess of energy in the former having nothing to balance it will forbid that it should be holden in any one point ; and yet , as the weaker activity continues its antagonism to the amount of its energy , there is a perpetual space-filling force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of space . The result must be a constant force which can not abide in any one position , and is thus the idea of the generation of motion . A space-filling force , which can not continue in any one point of space , is a spacefilling force successively occupying different spaces , and is thus matter moving . Let these activities continue their respective energies in counterworking unchanged , and the force which balances the weaker energy will make its essential matter to be a permanent existence , but the excess of energy will make this permanent matter to be perpetually changing its place . The motion must be incessant . But this motion is generated only in the excess of the greater energy , and that is perpetually in its one line of antagonism to the weaker activity , and must , therefore , determine the motion to be in its own invariable direction . The motion must be rectilineal . And this excess of energy in the greater over the less is invariable in degree , which must secure the passing from point to point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion must be uniform . This will be true not merely of one point of space-filling force , but must hold invariably true of any aggregate amount of space-filling forces in a body . If all the points /z/ of force be invariable in their comparative energies , the one principle must include alL And they must all move incessantly , rectilineally , and uniformly . And this principle must equally determine the transmission of motion by impulse . If any amount of spacefilling forces occupy their places at rest in their balanced action , and other forces moving come in contact in the line of their balanced antagonisms , the moving forces just bring their excess of energies in their direction of motion to the forces at rest , and add this excess to the activities working in the forces at rest in the same direction , and thus make them to have the same disparity of energy and in the same line of working , and thus the forces at rest must take on the same incessant motion , and in the same right-lined direction and uniform progression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces moving , by reason of greater velocity , the excess of energy on the one side of the antagonism in the swifter body will add its greater degree to the excess in the slower body that is less than its own , and this must quicken its motion ; but henceforth that quickened motion must be incessant , right-lined , and uniform . The constant excess in its own direction must ever determine to a rectilineal and uniform motion . The second Principle of Motion will find its expression in the following formula - that motion which any svperin ' duced force would give must be compounded with the m4tion which the forces already have . This will apply universally , and introduce a new principle beyond that which determined the motion in the former case . The principle in the first case was , that the more energetio activity must move the unbalanced force directly and PBINOiPLBS OF MOTION . 123 imiformly in its own line . There is now to be a combination of forces , and there most therefore be a principle modifying both the old uniformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonisms is given , and the old uniformity can not continue ; also an activity transverse to the old antagonism is contemplated , and there can not be the rectilineal movement before the greater energy . Both the degrees and the directions of the forces must be compounded . We take any matter moving under the control of the first principle of uniformity , in the line of the excess of the antagonist activity , and now superinduce a new force . It may be applied in the following directions and degrees precisely in the line of the old antagonisms . It may be in the direction of the weaker energy of the moving forces , and yet not sufficient to balance the excess of energy in the stronger ; and it is then clear in the insight of reason , that it must retard the movement by just the degree of energy added to the resistance of this weaker side of the antagonism . If sufficient to just equal and balance the excess , it must wholly suspend all motion . If sufficient to give to the weaker side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes sides and the old motion is not merely suspended but must be directly retrograde . If the superinduction be on the side of the more energetic activity there must be an acceleration to just the degree in which the old excess of energy has been augmented . In all the above cases , it is manifest that the old motion is to be compounded with the new motion given , inasmuch as these compound motions are the resultants necessarily of the combining of the old and new forces , and thereby modify- // ing the excess of energy which generates the motion , though there can in these cases be no change of direction . But the superinduced force may also be applied trans- versely to the old antagonism . In such case , there can be no balancing of the antagonism , nor direct reversal of the excess ; no merely increasing of the weaker nor the stronger activities , and thus no compounding of the forces and their movements can have any thing to do with the merely uniform rate of movement , but wiU necessarily modify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit of the old excess of energy to go any way up or down its old line of working . This old excess of energy will continue in its old direction , and the superinduced force will come and continue in some transverse direction , and the first principle of motion can have no unhindered application . The movement can not be in the line of the old more energetic antagonism , for the superinduced force now thwarts this by cutting across its line ; and no more can the movement be in the line of the new force , because the old excess of energy continues to work in its former direction , and must thwart the superinduced force . This new force may come in any direction on either side of the line of the old antagonisms , but in any way , it must be in the same place with the old activities , and meet them in their common point of counteraction . That superinduced force is thus a third activity , meeting the antagonist activities in their point of contact , and interfering in the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by the compounding of all these activities . The excess of the antagonist energy , and thus the motion , was before on one side and in one direction of the antag- /z/ onism , and the new force tends to move in its own direetion , and they can now only neutralize and balance themselves in some common point between them . That common point will give its excess of energy as a imit , and move the force or molecule of matter accordingly , and the perpetuation of the activities must perpetuate the points in which they balance each other , and the motion must be through these points successively from one to another , and thus the line of motion must be through the points in which the compound agencies balance each other . The rate of movement , and the direction which the excess of energy on one side of the antagonism has engendered , being given , and then the rate of movement , and direction which must be engendered in the excess oi energy on one side of the force to be superinduced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective ratios and directions , and that must be both the direction and velocity of the newly-acquired movement . Geometrically , it is manifest , this compounding of the excess of energies in the two forces must give its line between their directions , and dividing the angle their lines of direction may make . If of equal excess of energy , and moving at right angles to each other , their compound must be a bisection of the right angle between them ; and if of equal excess of energy but moving in direct antagonism , their composition must be in a line perpendicular to their common line of antagonism . If of unequal excess of energies their composition must give the line dividing their angle in the inverse ratio of the excess of energy , viz. , the greater excess to have proportionally the less space , and the less /z/ excess to have proportionally the greater space , on their respective sides of the divided angle between them . This principle of compounding the motions of two forces , which are generated by their respective excess of energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any number of superinduced forces , and any variety in their excess of energies . In each case , the old motion must be given , and the resulting motion from the composition of the first superinduced force must be found , and this will then become the given motion . This must then be compounded with the motion the second superinduced force would secure as its resultant ; and this is then a given motion to be compounded with a third superinduction ; and thus onward to any number . The resulting motion must ever be the compound of that which either force applied in succession would give , together with that which had before been given in the original , or any aggregate of superinduced forces . The first principle determines the motion from the perpetuity and constant direction of the excess of energy which generates it ; and the second principle determines the motion from the compounding of the aggregate excess of energies in all the forces that conspire to generate it . The law is necessarily given in the eternal principle read by the insight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the formula , that the rate of motion wiU he as th force moving exceeds the force moved . This is perhaps more technically given by saying the velocity will be as the dynamical exceeds the statical force . The static force is the intensity of energy with which the antagonism holds itself in position ; and the dynamic force is the intensity of energy in /z/ one side of the antagonism , by which that antagonism is carried out of its position . In the static , both activities equally energize and resist each other , and the degree of the energies which rest against each other is the measure of the force . In the dynamic , both activities energize and resist , and thus constitute a force ; but one activity is of superior energy and thus perpetually displaces this force , and the degree of this excess of energy is the dynamic force . These may be of greater intensity in each point of a small body , so as to equal a less intensity in the many points in a large body ; and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the density of matter that resists motion , and that it is not either the volume or the density of matter , but the excess of energy on one side , that overcomes rest . In the first principle we had uniformity and direction of motion ; in the second we had variation from original uniformity and direction ; and here in the third , we seek the degree of motion , or the velocity . Resistance to motion is as the density ; and resistance to rest , or capacity to generate motion , is as the excess of energy on one side of the antagonism , and this excess of energy must be most in the densest bodies moved ; it is thus mainly with the density of matter that we need here to be conversant , and to find in this the ground for the determining principle of the motion we seek . The intensity of antagonism in any point of force is its measure to resist motion . If this intensity be small , a small measure of excess in the energy of one activity over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , a greater excess of energy on one side of the activi- // ties must be necessary to generate motion . If then one point of force is to move another point offeree , the former must have one of two prerogatives ; either a greater intensity , and then when just moved its impulse will overcome the intensity of the latter and displace it , or , a strong excess of energy in one side of its activities that , may move to a violent impulse , and then , though of less intensity , the strenuous movement of the former may displace the latter . In either case , the principle is at once seen which determines this third case of motion . The force moved is as its static intensity ; the force moving is as its static intensity combined with its excess of energy on one side , and however this be made up so as to exceed the force of the former , or force moved , whether by more static intensity or more excess of energy in one activity , when thus exceeding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or velocity , must be proportioned to this excess of dynamic over the static force . The least degree beyond equilibration of intensity must move ; and the augmentation of preponderance must so much more move , and thus as nothing but this excess generates motion and all the excess generates its own measure of motion , the degree of motion , or velocity , must be as the moving exceeds the moved intensity offeree . And this is manifestly applicable to all cases . K one body , or aggregate of forces , is to move another , the points of static antagonism are aU to be overcome ; and the points of static antagonism , in the body that is the mover , all give their intensity and their excess of energy on one side of the static antagonism , that they may conspire to the moving ; and thus the aggregate forces are each as PSINOIPLES OF Monoi. 129 one force , and the whole body moving may be called the force moving , and the whole body moved may be called the force moved , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trae idea of static and dynamic forces contains the principle which necessarily determines this third case of motion . In this third principle of motion there is involved the conception of momentaim which on account of its wide application in physical science , it is important should be made clear and exact . In the body moving , its power of impulse or capacity to act on other bodies is an aggregate of force from two sources . It has received the excess of intensity over its own in the body moving it , and this now becomes one part of its force to strike and move another body . This is measured by its own velocity , for it is this excess that has made the whole movement , and we may thus represent the force acquired by the velocity imparted . But its measure of intensity that it originally had , and which had neutralized just an equal amount of intensity in the body which impinged upon it , has not at all been amiihilated . It neutralized its own measure in the other body to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the moved body , but itself remained in , and goes along with , and indeed is the very essence o the moved body , and this original intensity it now has also , wherewith to strike and move other bodies . This original intensity of antagonism is its qiuintity of matter . The aggregate offeree in the excess imparted from the moving body , and which is represented by the acquired velocity together with its own original intensity of antagonism , and which is its quantity of matter , now constitute /z/ the capability the body possesses to generate motion in gome third body ; and this whole aggregate of motion-generating force is what we comprehend under the term momentum , . It is commonly said to be compounded of the velocity and quantity of matter , but it should not thereby be understood that mere motion has itself any moving force , or capacity to generate motion , but only that the motion is the index of the moving force which generated it , and which has been transferred to it from the force moving it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter balances the greater , or more generally in all cases of equilibrium , refers at once to the conception of momentum . The less force balances the greater , because the motion of the less would be the more rapid in the inverse ratio of its comparative weight . The momenta of the greater and smaller weight are equal , and though there is now rest , yet is there what is termed virtual motion , for the forces are so arranged that if moved , the excess of velocity in one must compensate for the excess in intensity of the other . All static forces have this virtucU motion , viz. , a tendency to move while reciprocally balanced . These same principles for the above cases of motion , and the conception of momenta and virtual velocities determine all the acts in the pressure of fluids in Hydrostatics , Pneumatics , &c.,; as also in the revolutions of planetary bodies , and may in the sequel be seen to condition and thereby to give law to all the natural operations of magnet'is electricity , and indeed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . The one simple con* /z/ ception of a space-filling force , as an antagonism of simple spiritual activities , is the source in which the reason , without experiment or discursive conclusions in judgment , by its own insight may read the necessary conditions and immutable laws of nature . Force itself is a fact ; a thing made ; and in its making the very essence of the material world is created ; but the immutable and necessary principles which must determine aU its working were not made ; they lay uncreated and eternal in the bosom of the Absolute Reason , and were the grand archetypes which guided his creative hand in first setting the circuit of the heavens on the fece of the primaeval abyss . 7 . Ckbation a Natubb. - Nature , natura d nascor , ) is a birth , an outspringing , a growth ; and includes the conception of an existence that has a beginning , and which from the beginning continually grows out , or develops itself , by a successive series of changes which manifest themselves in new phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ births from itself . All these outgrowths were originaUy in the created existence , and virtually or potentially had their being in the first moment of creation , and necessarily develop themselves in their order as the created existence works on before the inner force of which it is constituted . It is applied properly to every created individual thing , inasmuch as each separate thing has its own peculiarly constituted forces which make it to be what it is , and give to it its own essential identity , and which secure that it must develop itself after the conditions of its original constitution . Hence we say of any particular thing , that it grows , or works , or moves in any way , according to its own nature . And as each constituted or /z/ created thing has its nature , so all creation is , in the same way , spoken of as having a nature . The universal ongoing of cause and effect is but the successive birth and growth of that which was already constituted and necessitated in the first creation , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The word has no proper application to that which is not continually passing through an ordered series of births , according to the conditions imposed upon it at its creation . That which was not created , or constituted of such conditioned forces , has not a nature , but must be wholly supernatural . Of all created existence we may say in general , it is Nature . The propriety and truth of this is seen by the eye of reason , in the Idea so fer attained of what creation is . An antagonism of simple activities , which takes and holds position and fills space , and thus constitutes that force which is the essence of matter , combined with a diremptive force that may work in it , has already within itself a nature , and by its creation it already exists under conditions and laws which determine both that it must , and how it must , produce itself onward in perpetual outgrowths , until its whole inner energy is exhausted . The principles of motion and momenta are principles older than matter , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is made , and thus give to it a nature which wholly conditions it , and which enstamp upon it its whole history , to the penetrating eye of reason , before that nature has gone a step onward in the march of cause and event . Nothing can come out that was not originally put in , and what was originally put in must come out in the very order of the constituted conditions . In nature , non datur caaus i , e , y /z/ events without cause ; non datur fatum , i. e. , events without a conditioned cause ; non datur inertia L e. , a cessation of working ; non datur saltus i. 6. , a leaping over some link in the series ; and non datur vacuum i. e. , a chasm or void within her sphere , where there is utter emptiness . This does not exclude the repeated interpositions of the Creator . New creations put into nature from a source above nature , and new modifications of the old by the absolute Maker of nature , have within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any number and distance of intervals between the working , and when finished may receive any number and variety of miraculous interventions from its author , according to hiF good pleasure . But nature herself can orighiate nothings and only bring out that with which she teemed on the very morning of her creation . If the Creator originate new existences in nature , as Absolute Reason he will have reasons for it , and will superinduce the new upon the old in conformity of natures between the new and old , so that the last day 's work shall still make one harmonious nature in combination with the works of aU other days of creation ; and the whole completed work shall as truly fill out and equal the eternal archetype , as if it had sprung up at once and instantaneously under his creating hand . Thus all within and successively coming out below the point where force , as matter , fills space and grows on in time will be nature ; a perpetual springing out from the old stock of new modes of existence ; but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is within and below , and will remain forever the supernatural ; the unborn , changeless , and absolutely independent I Am . All within /z/ Bature we may term the phj/sioalf and all above nature the spiritual . 8 . The Material Creation a Sphere . - If a force be Bteadily applied to a heavy body , it will at first be still motionless , bat a continued strain at length pats the whole in motion . K I crowd against a boat floating by the whar I mast perpetuate the pressure for some considerable time before the boat will move . Each point in the body to be moved is a static force , holding itself in its position by its own antagonism , and the force applied must pass from the point of immediate pressure successively through every point to the fnost remote , and it is only when the last is reached and overcome that the whole mass can be ejected from its place . The force has been constantly going in to the mass , but it has been apparently dormant , or truly latent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body has been overcome , and then the mass nioves off together . If I press two rigid metallic rods together at their ends , the force does not continue merely at the point of contact , but propagates itself through every point of both rods to my hands at the opposite ends , and then , though every point in the rods has been pervaded by the applied force , yet do not these points move from their positions ; because the middle position at the point of contact in the rods has been equally pressed in the direction of the rods , and the balanced counteraction has kept that point a static in the direction of the force ; and also the rigidity of the rods at their points of contact has been greater than the lateral pressure in the compounding of the energies at the middle point , and thus the middle point could not divide itself every way and permit the positions in the lines of the rods to range /z/ tjiemselves every way about the middle point as a centre . In other words , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the adhesion of the metal has not been overcome so as to permit the second law of motion to send off positions in any compounded direction . But if I should procure a complete fusion of the metal in the two rods at the point of contact , and thus dissolve the rigidity , the pressure in the direction of the rods would permit that each should be turned back upon itself by the other , and also , in the compounding of the energies , that each should send off positions every way on each side of the middle point , and the result of the pressure of my hands , in crowding the rods together at their ends , would be an accumulation of the metal from both in a rude globe of molten matter about the point of contact . A careM application of the principles of motion , or rather the same insight into the principles of force which determine the laws of motion , will detect the very lines in which the molecules of melted matter must move off from the centre , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus beforehand determine that a globe , and not any other form , must necessarily impress itself upon the matter that shall accumulate about any point of simple countergency . For it is to be careftilly noted , that not the force which is the component essence of the matter itself in the metallic rods is to be here regarded , but the newly applied force which generates the motion that arranges the particles of matter into a globe . Were there nothing but the forces acting in the matter , whether the rods were rigid or molten , every point would be and remain a static , and the whole mass would be at rest in its // original position . The newly applied force is a distinct thing from the force as the matter to which it is applied , and if this were as palpable to the sense as the matter it moves , we should at once notice the force as the mover , and not the metallic forces as the moved . The metaUic matter , as palpable to sense , is used by the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working only in the matter , is impalpable to sense , and thus the palpable matter is really only the index of what the impalpable force is doing ; the latter registers itself and thereby manifests itself in the former , and it is really only the latter that we regard and wish to follow in its work , for this is truly the sphere-forming agency . This may be more folly illustrated , and the insight of the reason assisted more clearly to apprehend it by taking two analogous cases , in one of which the matter is apparent to the sense , and in the other the matter does not become apparent . A stone drops into the lake , and as it sinks from the sur &ce; it displaces its bulk of water and then passes from that position to a lower , displacing again an equal bulk , and thus successively till it rests upon the bottom . The separating and coming together of the water suddenly through the vacuum left by the descending stone makes a new counteraction , and is truly the introduction of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lake . Now this new force registers itself at once in the placid surface of the lake , and we follow its agency in the circling waves that go off from the point of the stone 's descent , and in this undulating disturbance we have the visible index of what this newly introduced force is doing . It manifests itself to sense in the effects it /z/ produces upon the material forces already existing , and we rest upon the index as appearance , and do not attempt ordinarily to trace by the eye of reason the invisible force which has been really the efficient agent in this circular undulation . But we will now follow the stone in its descent , and as it sank below the sur &43e,; there was a like displacement of the water and a coming rush together again through this perpetuated vacuum , and thus truly another central waving expansion impressing itself upon the water beneath the surface , and so on in continual succession to the bottom of the lake . The whole water from the surfiice to the bottom has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of the stone 's descent , but no index of the action of the force below the surface has been given . We see the waves on the surfece , but the waves below do not appear . We no longer rest upon the senses , but if we attempt to read the action going on below the surfece , we are obliged at once to resort to some new process for apprehendiug it . The man least capable of insight , and most dependent upon sense in his activity , will doubtless construct in imagination such circling waves in the water down to the bottom , and apprehend the action of the new force only in the indices which his imagination supplies . It will thus be , as is his apprehension on the sur &ce,; solely in the indices of what the applied force is doing , and not in any rational insight that follows the efficiency itself in its working ; the only difference being this , that on the sur &ce; he sees it , and below the sure he imagines it . But the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent to use the insight of his reason in apprehending the efficient force itself , wiU not care to call in any aid from his &ncy; in /z/ oonstmcting imaginary circular waves that he may follow to the bottom , but he will apprehend that newly induced force itself and follow it directly out in the waving cirdea it must make in its own action ; seeing immediately in itself what it must do , and not in any constructions of the fimcy the indices only of what he imagines it has done . And that mind can follow the naked force in its action upon the sur &ce; as well as below it . Independent of what his eye perceives in the produced waves , his reason directiy knows the forces and their laws which are there working , and in the forces knows what the circling waves must be , and not merely in the perceived waves judges what the forces have been . So would it be again , if we put the force at work in the unseen air about us . The percussion of solid bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their similar circular , or , as entirely surrounded , their spherical waves in the atmosphere , and the empirical observer because he can not see the waves and yet can not guide his movement without some constructed indices , makes these waves in his &ncy,; and thus follows the ibrces where he imagines they have gone , while the mind accustomed to use and rely upon his rational intuitions , dispenses altogether with any con structions of the fancy , and makes the force itself in its own laws pioneer the way to the conditioned appearances which he knows must come from its working . This following out of the action of force in its own laws is what we now need , and if reference be made to empirical appearances as the registers and indices of the efficient realities , it is only thereby to assist the less independent thinkers , guided awhile by the indices , ultimately ICATERIAL OSEATIOir A SPHERE . 139 to mature the use of their rational apprehension , so that they too may dispense with the sense-perception and guide themselves solely by the clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know , not by any inference from one appearing to what according to former experience was the probable &ct; that preceded it , and thus , at the best , only creep up from one feet to another on the ground of an assumed uniformity in experience , but by an immediate insight into things themselves , we know what those things must be and do , and how the facts must stand from the eternal principles which condition them . Taking then the independent action of force , as the conception of two countervailing spiritual activities , and following out the action directly according to the necessary laws of motion , we come to the knowledge that matter must accumulate itself about the point of counteragency in the form of a sphere , and must take on all the properties of a solid globe , which has the whole space filled from the centre to the circumference with the successive forces , in their contiguous positions , sent off from the central action of the original simple antagonism . Whether we lean upon the indices in the supposed metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or take , as an independent object for the reason , the simple agency of a spiritual counteraction , in a force that builds itself up about a position that itself has first fixed itself in , the true condition and law of motion and combination will be the same in both , and the real force which does the forming work will be the same distinct efficiency to be followed in each case . Whether it be pure original force , which takes and fills space and accumulates material existence about its /z/ point of counteraction , or whether it be some new force introduced into matter , and moving this already existing matter into new forms , the action and motion and formal combinations in each most be precisely the same , and the practised eye of reason can apprehend and follow the pure original force as readily as that which registers itself in already existing forces . At the point of counteraction each agency must turn its opposite back upon itself , so that there is not merely a counter-working at one point where the agencies meet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very action of the antagonism , the antagonists have made each the other to react upon itself , and press back upon its own line of action , so that not only now is there counteraction where one simple activity meets the other , but each way in the line of action , each activity has been made to react upon itself and there is counter-agency each way out of and beyond the point of contact , and thus already has there been an accumulation ; a growth , a new-birth of forces from the original point of counter-working . And now , were there but the simple law of action and reaction as opposite and equal , the accumulations of force must be in the right line of the original activities , and each one accumulate , by its retorsion from the energy of the other , new antagonisms in itself successively as from point to point it was made to turn back upon itself . Matter would thus necessarily be generated in right lines . But the second law of motion comes in immediately upon the original counter-working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each simple activity , and thus a force fixing upon a new position out of the original point of contact , there /z/ comes at once an extended static each way in this hne , and thus an excess of resistance over that of a lateral movement from the point of contact . The reagency therefore can not move directly back in each in the line of the original antagonism , but must be compounded of the forces acting , and thus moving out every way from the point of original contact , and as it were , lifting itself up every way from this point as a centre ; and thus the force accumulates , not only back in the line of the original agencies through their mutual reaction , but also , from the compounding of the movement of such accumulation of resistance in that direction , every way laterally from the point of counteraction . While then the simple reacting force would go out in right lines directly back each way from the point of contact , the compounded forces will rise , as it were in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original line of action . But again , so soon as the accumulation should thus begin in this ring at right angles to the original direction , the antagonisms of which the ring is itself composed must turn the component simple activities each back upon itself through all the points of force in the ring , just as at first the one central antagonism turned its simple activities back upon themselves . This pushing each its fellow-activity back upon itself in every point of force composing the transverse ring , must accumulate two other rings of forces , one on each side of the first or equatorial ring , and which will be , in fact , the turning of the whole ring on each side from itself , and making it to flow in newly engendered streams of forces on both sides backward toward the polar points . The continued activity of the central antagonism , /z/ kept by the polar points from going back any fiirtber in a right line as an axis , must perpetuate this flowing back on each side of the equator , in new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polar points , and a proper globe is thus formed by a spherical layer all about the central point . This primitive globe is now self-balanced in all its points ; but as the central action goes on , it must again push each way in the axis and generate two other polar points beyond , thereby elongating the axis , and in this elongation there comes as before a static rest in the axial direction , and the central working must rise agin in a new transverse ring , and repeat a new flow of forces in thdbr rings from the equator each way to the poles , and augment the globe by another ensphering layer , when all again is balanced , and a new elongation of the axis takes place to repeat the same equatorial rising and flowing back to the poles , and so on indefinitely till the reactions in the accumulating forces of the globe balance the energy of the central working , and the globe ceases to grow . An infinite energy at the centre may generate new layers infinitely . The Almighty may make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he ceases to augment the central action against the ensphered reactions , the globe will have attained its determined magnitude . The eternal principles of motion determine the universe of matter to a spherical form , not merely , as Plato assumes , because this is the most reasonable as being the most perfect figure , but the most reasonable inasmuch as the insight of reason determines the space-filling force to sudi result . It is also manifest that this sphere so formed wiU be a /z/ concrete unity , and not a mass of separate and disjoined particles merely aggregated in juxtaposition . The central antagonism turns each simple agency back upon itself by a contmuous movement , and as this becomes an extended static , it generates the new compounded lateral movement , that rises as it were in an equatorial ring about the middle point of counteraction transverse of the direction in the simple activities , and then flows back on each side of the equatorial ring to the poles , and balances the whole agbost the polar points , to begin and go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . There is not , thus , a single position within Hie sphere , except the centre , that has been taken separately and independently ; but each position has been taken and held by the new force generated and sent to it in a continuous action from the one preceding , and thus every point of force is held where it is , not merely by its own antagonism but by the conjoint action of every other point of force in the sphere . The movement to each , in the eye of the reason , has been through its preceding conditions , and yet as these conditions could admit of no appreciable interval between them , the whole uprising is to the sense simultaneous . The central point of counteragency is thus at once made a ball , whose radii are the centre and one point or position out of it on every side of it , and the continual working at the centre , continually generates new balls within the old , expanding the old as the new are generated within them , and all the layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a continuous connection with the new , and the whole globe is held in one as it were by a perpetuated agency that runs through and connects every position , Ko portion of the material // force is isolate from the rest , but the whole ball is a concrete from the centre through its entire sphere . It thus follows , that no portion of matter in the forces accumulated in this globe , can be reverted back into the simple agencies from which these forces were generated , and thus become again not force but simple spiritual activity and which would be the same as the annihilation of matter , except by a collapse at the centre . While the cen tral antagonism is constant , all the force that has been generated and sent out from it wiU press back upon it but can not escape through it . By no way can the created matter be lost except through a dissolution of the central force , and the instant that this central antagonism should cease and the simple agencies counterworking there should separate , the outlying forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they must all dissolve , and literally , ' * Like the baseless fabric of a yision , Leave not a wreck behind . " All matter , moreover , must thus continually remain not only 80 long as the central force holds , but it must remain as it went out from the centre . Except as some modifying action follow out after it from the centre , the force that has already gone off in accumulation about the centre will continue unchanged . The way to superinduce new forces into the material universe , and shape to different results those already acting , will be by new or modified forces at the centre . The whole globe is controlled through the central agency . What has gone ofl so fer as we have yet followed out the creative action , has been only an accumu- /z/ lation of space-filling forces , and the whole globe is constituted of manifold antagonisms , each and all occupying their own positions , and held in them by the one activity that pervades them all . While thus a concrete , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static . Any action that changes the equilibrium in one point finds no counteraction , in the even balance of the whole , till it has gone through and equalized itself in the change of the whole . An introduction of any new force , or augmented action , at the centre , must make itself felt through all the globe . 9 . The Principlb op Gravity . - It is the crowning glory of Induction , that it prompted to the search and guided to the attainment of the law of gravity . The name of Newton is made immortal from this sublime discovery . It will detract nothing from the true honor of the Inductive philosophy , nor from the undying fiime of Newton , to put in the precise light of truth what is the exact amount of physical science secured in that discovery . Its hypothesis was that there was a tendency in all matter to approach to all other matter in certain ratios . This hypothesis was suggested to the fertile mind of Newton by a single occurrence , and when tried by extended observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurrences , that there was no hesitation in assuming it as a universal fact . Very extended and profound researches into appropriate &cts,; especially the complicated facts of the variations in the moon 's revolutions , at length confirmed the conclusion , that the ratio of this gravitating tendency in matter was directly as the quantity of the matter , and inversely as the square of the distance . This &ct; of the gravitating tendency of matter , and the further /z/ acts of its ratios , put into a general formula , enables the natural philosopher to classify an immense amount of particular acts under this simple category , and ever after to know their place and recognize their relations in the grand system of facts which he brings together . This is the extent of its use , the taking of this as a broader &ct; which may embrace a vast number of particular acts within it , and enable to say , because this is act therefore these other particular acts are as they have been found to be . It is thus called the Law of Gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found , but only because such a general fact haying been found , the subordinate facts can all be referred to it . It does not reveal why the fects embraced in this formula are , nor that they might not have been other and opposite ; but simply having by a broad induction so far found them thus to be , and then assuming that through all experience they will be found so to be , there is hence the warrant for concluding that these particular fects are embraced in the universal one . It can only suppose matter , as originally inert , to have such a tendency arbitrarily imposed upon it , and not at all that there are principles older than the facts , and which eternally and inunutably condition the facts , and are thus infallible reasons for the facts . Of this tendency in matter to approach other matter , no eiqplanation can be given . It may sometimes be said that it seeks to approach , as if the explanation would be given that there was some sentient life in matter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movement of matter expounded by the susceptibilities of mind . Just as it was early said in explanation of the THE PSIKGIPLE OF GRAVrTT. 147 rising water in the pump , that nature ahliorred a vacuum . This attraction as now named , is as wholly vacant of all reason as was the suction as then called . When the fact of gravity had been discovered , then this power of suction came readily within it ; the weight or gravitating force of the atmosphere pressing upon the water out of the pump , forced it up into the vacuum made within the pump , and we put away all our conceptions of " the powers of suction " and " abhorrence of a vacuum , " and by an insight of reason follow the force which does the whole work , and smile at the unreasoning simplicity of an earlier philosophy . But what has been gained , except simply removing the mystery and our ignorance one step ftirther back ? Why the atmosphere seeks the earth is just as truly without a reason , as why nature abhors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gross a solecism , when the necessary law of forces is apprehended , as had the old word suction . Matter no more draws matter , than the pump Slacked water . The pump removed the air from a space , and an outside force pressed water into it ; and so the central force sends off matter through a given sphere , and the same force which sends off all molecules thereby presses back each one . And as an estimate of the force of atmospheric pressure enabled the philosopher to determine the power of the pump , even so does the estimate of the central force enable the philosopher to determine the power of gravity . The difference in the two cases is , however , very wide and important . The philosophy of the pump was grounded in a higher yac ojAj and that fact left wholly inexplicable . The pump was explained only by a reference to a higher // fBLCt which could not be explained ; and by leaving the higher inexplicable , the whole was truly an impenetrable mystery . But if we expound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some higher &ct; which is itself left in darkness , but by applying an unmade and eternal principle to it , which must necessarily so condition all facts of material existence , then have we a radical and ultimate exposition , and have traced all the mystery in the nature of matter up to the light of the supernatural reason , and can say gravity is thus , because the immutable principle in the absolute reason determined it must be thus and not otherwise . Gravity is then no longer a mere fact a thing made , and which might have been any otherwise made ; but a &ct; with an eternal and immutable law in it ; a &ct; embodying an uncreated and necessary principle of the reason , and . in following which principle in the making , the absolute Creator manifested his immutable wisdom and truth . To this eternally necessary and immutable law of gravity , we now turn the insight of the reason , that we may clearly apprehend the unmade principle which conditions and determines it to be thus and no otherwise . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own simple antagonistic agencies , except the central point . Here the originating , simple activities begin , and hold each other in balanced energy , and turn each other back upon themselves , thus making a tendency to accumulate force in two positions on the line of direction each side and out of the centre , and which tendency , as we have above seen , creates further the tendency to accumulate in an equatorial ring , and turn back each way this ring till its accumulations make an ensphering layer on each side to /z/ the poles . As these new hemispheres of layers on each side of the equator are formed , they balance the whole equatOQal antagonism in the aggregate in the polar points , and thus it must be that the edges , so to speak , of the hemispherical layers in the equator push back on each side in meridional lines against the poles . The whole globe is a unit , and yet the two simple activities so push each other back upon themselves , that one hemisphere is generated from the retorsions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . As the generation of the globe proceeds , each layer , and each meridional line in the layer , must turn itself back from the energy of its antagonist , in new hemispherical layers , and thus the globe grows on the inside in every layer perpetually as well as by an outside layer ; or , in other words , the whole globe augments itself by the antagonism of its two hemispheres , as the first central point does by the antagonism of its simple activities . We may then carry on the intuitive process , and take any position out of the centre and contiguous to the centre , and it will be a point in a layer of points ensphering the centre , and it with every other point of that ensphering layer is pushed out and held in position by the antagonist force working at the centre . At the same time , also , that the central antagonism is pushing out and holding in position all the points in this contiguous ensphering layer , each one of these points is reacting and pushing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these points just equilibrates the force of the central antagonism . No one force out of the centre balances the centre , but the aggregate of all the forces in the contiguous outlying layer . /z/ So also , take any contiguous point out of this first ensphering layer from the centre , and it will be one of many points in another layer ensphering the first , and all the points of this second ensphering layer will react upon the inner layer , as the points in it react and balance themselves upon the centre , and thus the aggregate of force in the second layer equilibrates the aggregate of force in the first layer , and this equilibrates the antagonism at the centre , and thus on through all the concentric layers that may have been pushed out in completing the whole globe . The central point expels the outlying points on all sides , but each point in the contiguous layer of points about the centre , while in the same way acting outwards on all sides , must on the side towards the centre act upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can act upon the layer exterior to it , and in concert with all the fellows of its layer push out this layer beyond . Out of the centre , therefore , each point in every layer acts on one side towards the centre and balances itself upon it , or upon it and the points intervening , and on the other side acts on the contiguous point of the exterior layer , and pushes that from the centre . The quantity of force in every molecule , and the direction of its working through the universal globe , how large soever it may be , is thus determined in the necessary conditions of the working of that central antagonism which generates the universal sphere . So much only we need now to note , that every molecule of force works outward from its own inner antagonism , and by the working of all , every molecule of the universe out of the centre is pushed fi-om the centre , and also is repelled back toward the centre , and the aggregate of all the forces THE PEmOIPLE OF GBAVHT. 151 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing inward , and thus every molecule comes to rest in a static equilibrium . It is a necessary determination that a globe so generated , should have in every molecular force a centriftigal and a centripetal tendency just balancing each other , and thus holding the molecule at rest . The first is properly expulsion as it is a primitive driving firom the . centre , and the latter is properly repulsion in its return back toward the centre . An utter misconception , as if at first there was somehow a suction drawing to the centre , and then a rejection of the same from the centre , has appropriated the term attraction for what is truly the reagency , and repulsion for what is truly the first outgoing agency . But any attempted change of terms would now be hopeless , and we shall therefore use attraction for the centripetal and repulsion for the centrifugal tendency , yet philosophically noting perpetually , as in the Copemican system it is not the sun that rises and sets , so here it is not the coming to the centre that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real a tergo pushing . We will then carry the insight of reason directly on through this idea , that we may determine the ratios of these forces . The central point of force pushes out all points and just equilibrates their aggregate reactions , and is thus truly the measure of force in the whole sphere . Every other point also pushes out in like manner in every direction from itseL and if left to its own action would ensphere the contiguous outlying points of force about itself , but no point of force except the centre can push out and equilibrate all the other // points of force in the sphere , since , on one side , all points offeree push back upon the centre and balance themselves and all pushing back on them in the centre . As is the energy of the central antagonism , such is its degree of force and , which is the same thing , its quantity of matter ; and in proportion to its energy will be the magnitude of the sphere generated , and thereby the degrees of force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matter in each point of force through the whole sphere . The amount of centrifogal force in the whole sphere is , therefore , directly as the quantity of matter , and the amount of repulsion in the central molecule will also be as its quantity of matter ; and as each point out of the centre must be pressed out and press back proportioned to the layers within and beyond it , so all molecules of the sphere must also have their repulsions directly as is to each one its quantity of matter . In all respects , the force of repulsion must be directly as tJke quantity of matter . The molecule at the centre repels all the outlying molecules on all sides from the centre , with a force directly proportioned to the amount of matter in the sphere , and in the case of a sphere standing alone in the void , as must the universal sphere , the amount of matter in the sphere mu ( t be as its volume , or , which is the same ratio , as the cube of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished in its repulsion in proportion to the number of layers that are between it and the centre , i , 6. , in proportion to the cube of the radius of its own sphere , and thus each ensphered layer of molecules repels inversely as the cube of the radius of its own sphere ; and as each molecule in the layer may be understood as the terminus THE PBINCIPLB OF ORAYITr. 158 of a radius to the ensphered layer in which it is , so any molecule in a spherical layer , and thus any molecule in the whole globe , repels inversely as the cube of its distance from the centre . We have , therefore , the necessary law for repulsion - directly as quantity of matter and inversely as the cube of the distance . The force of attraction does not , like the force of repulsion , act from the centre outwards on all sides , but is the reacting force against repulsion from every point in the sphere and coming back in a direct line to the centre . The aggregate of attraction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out from the centre , for they equilibrate each other in the static position of every molecule . The repulsion is , however , from the point on all sides , but the attraction is from the point on one side only and working directly towards the centre . We may , then , take all the points in any plane passing through the centre , and we shall have the aggregate attraction of that plane in right lines to the centre . This will give the aggregate attraction to be as the area , or , as the same thing , to be as the square of the radius . But any concentric circle in this area is diminished in attraction in proportion to the number of concentric circles that may be made between it and the centre , i. e. , in proportion to the square of the radius of itself , and therefore each possible circle in this area is attracted inversely as the square of its radius ; and as each molecule in the circumference of the concentric circle may be understood as the terminus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any concentric circle of the area , and therefore any molecule in the whole area , is attracted to the centre inversely as the square of its distance from the /z/ centre . But this diminishing attraction from the centre vanishes wholly away in the circumference , and thus the attraction , between any two points separately and respectively in the same radius , is inversely as the square of the distance between them . This must be the law of attraction for all points in the radii of the same sphere , for they may all be taken in their relative planes and thereby subjected to the same principle . And this applies not merely to the points in the same globe , but relatively to all globes ; for all globes must have their repulsive and attractive forces balanced , and the intensity of these antagonisms constitutes their quantity of matter . As is the pressure at the centre such must be the magnitude of the ensphered forces , and thus such the length of radii , and the distance to which the force goes out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all globes , therefore , the attractive force must be directly as the qicantity of matter and inversely as the square of the distance . But this is true , again , not only of all globes in respect to each one 's own portions of matter among themselves , but of all globes relatively to each other . Each globe must liave its own density and thns its own distance for its force of gravity to act , and when any two globes come within each other 's range of attraction so that the peripheries of their spheres cut each other , the point of contact is at once a point of antagonism , and their acting central forces must so work this commencing antagonism as to push each one back upon itself and begin an ensphering anew , with the central point at the first point of contact , and the forces of each globe must be successively turned back in a hemi- THE FSmOIPLE OF FALLINa BODIES . 155 sphere within itself and both together must form a new globe around this central point , and like " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common point will become the common centre of attraction for each globe , and if the matter be fluid the two will make one globe , and if rigid , that point will still hold the two globes in unity and become their common centre of attraction , and must act under the above eternal principle . Any masses of matter , less or more , must stand to each other as such two globes when they have their gravitating forces brought in contact , and their common centre of gravity must work after this eternal principle . 10 . The Principle op Falling Bodies . - The principle of gravity being attained , we may consider the force of attraction , though made up of the compounding of all the reactions in the globe , as if it were in the case of each molecule a separate and distinct force . Each molecule tends to the centre as if it had one simple activity of greater energy working toward the centre , and one activity of less energy working from the centre , and as if the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force against the greater energy , by all the forces in the line between it and the centre . Take , therefore , any molecule of force in any part of the universal globe , except the central one , away from its position , and view it as if standing alone , and it could not be a static ; it could not hold its own place ; it would be impossible that it should lie stilL One side has the greater energy , and the molecule of force must move before that energy , since it can not rest against the weaker energy in static position , /z/ until it can find some competent assistance to the weaker energy , and thus balance itself at rest . This idea of a force of unequal antagonism determines the generation of motion , in the advance of the greater energy through successive points . In this is , also , by the first principle of motion , the determination of it as uniform and rectilineal . This uniformity of velocity is on the condition that the excess of energy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gravity , by which any aggregate of forces tend to the centre , though working in a right line can not continue of uniform energy . There must be a constant accumulation , inasmuch as there is a constant transfer of new force with a perpetual retention of what has already been received . A full conception of the force of gravity gives occasion for determining this increment of motive-energy , and attaining the law by which the velocity of any body falling unhindered towards the centre must be regulated . We may assume any point of force , or which will be the same thing , a body with its aggregate points of force , and if the forces in the points of the radius between this body and the great centre be supposed to be weakened in intensity , or those in the body augmented , that body must move through the line of the radius towards the centre , and which is but saying that it must fall . This necessity for falling is seen in the excess of energy which every pomt in the sphere has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is working towards the centre . When the intervening pressure from the centre , which assisted and thus made equal to the other that activity which was nearest the centre , has been taken away , this /z/ excess of energy most prevail and generate a movement in a right line before it . The one activity is not of sufficient energy that the other should rest itself against it , and both in their common point of antagonism must &J1; together . But such ML can not be uniform , as in the steady force which determines the first law of motion . There , the excess of energy , or moving force remains constant , and just avails to move at its own rate of velocity without accumulation . Here , it moves and adds itself perpetually . The excess of energy which generated the movement remains , and when at the next position nearer the centre , there is also the excess of energy that would have generated an original motion at that point , and thus the one degree of excess is retained and an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in this necesidty of perpetual increment is determined the law by which it must fall . Take then any body , and let it possess its degree of excess of energy on the side opposite the centre , and it must gravitate toward the centre . It must thus pass through its one measure of space , or height , which we will call H , in one moment . In passing through H , it has gained the excess of energy , or gravity , that was in the force occupying that space , and must therefore have now an excess of energy , or gravity , from the full through H , that would make it &I1; the next moment through 2 H. And the original excess of energy , or gravity , with which it started is still retained , and will make it pass through one measure , or H , for this next moment as it did the first , so that the body for the second moment must pass through 3 H. At the end of the second moment , there are the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained , and the last one is doubled in the gain of its gravity , and the original excess - with which it started at first is also stiU there , so that the body most fall the next moment through 5 H. These five degrees and the last one doubled , and the old excess with which the body began to fall still constantly acting , must make the fidl to be for the fourth moment through 1 H. These seven , and the last doubled , and the old excess , must again make the fifth moment to have a fall of 9 H. Thus onwards perpetually with each successive moment . The succeeding moment must have all the gravity of the preceding passing over in to it , and the last degree gained in the preceding moment must be doubled from the excess of energy gained and retained , and the old primitive excess is perpetually going along , so that each succeeding moment must continually gain two measures of space , or 2 H , above the preceding moment . This must be perpetual , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of gravity itself , that must make an increment of two measures of descent , or as the same thing , two degrees of velocity , in each successive moment . The first moment will have one degree of velocity , the second moment three , the third moment five , the fourth seven , and thus on in arithmetical progression perpetually with an increment of two degrees to the moment . There must thus be at the beginning of each successive moment , an excess of energy , that would carry the body through double the measures of height fiJlen in aU the moments for the next succeeding equal number of moments . Thus at the end of the second moment the body has fallen through 4 H , and for the next two moments /z/ would fall through 8 H , and at the end of the third moment it has fallen through 9 H , and in three more moments would &11; through 18 H , and at the end of the fourth moment it has fallen through 16 H , and in four moments more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will secure that , at each moment , the whole measures of space fallen , or the degrees of velocity attained , must be directly as the squares of the times , and which , in the opposite direction from the centre , must also be demanded by the law of gravity to be inversely as the square of the measure of space , or distance , or in this case the velocity . Thus the first moment has fallen 1 H , which is the square of itself ; the second moment 4 H , or the square of two ; the third moment 9 H , or the square of three ; the fourth moment 16 H , or the square of four ; and so onwards indefinitely . Thus the sum of the laws of fidling bodies as determined by the principle of gravity is - that each moment must increase by two degrees of velocity - that at the end of each moment , a velocity is attained that must fall through double the space in the next equal number of moments - and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . The same principle , modified by the cutting off and neutralizing a part of the accumulating force , is found in the descent of bodies down an inclined plane and thus determines the law for the increment of momentum , and the counteracting force necessary to raise or balance weights upon an inclined plane . A body placed upon an inclined plane is acted upon by the same force for generating motion , as in the above case of a body falling freely . The excess of the antagonism tends to motion in the per- /z/ pencular direction towards the centre of gravity . But the interposition of the plane , more or less obliquely , cuts off and neutralizes this force in its direct action , and proportioned to the angle of inclination dissolyes and diverts a portion of the force in the direction of the plane . K it had moved freely from the start in the perpendicular direc tion , it would have been wholly within the former category of Mling bodies , but now a proportion of the moving force is neutralized by the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remnant in the turned direction is in action to give and gain an increment of momentum . The perpendiddar descent would begin with the whole energy of the excess of static force , and observe the laws of increment of momentum in its progress ; the descent in the inclined plane begins with the remnant that is not neutralized by the interposition of the plane , and observes the same law of increment of momentum in filing down the plane . The plane is the hypothenuse of a right angled triangle , of which one of the sides containing the right angle is the perpendicular , and the other containing side is the base of the plane . The times and proportions of increment of momentum are , thus , as the proportion of the perpendicular to the hypothenuse . The descent must be through the whole plane to gain the increment of relative momentum , which the body falling freely gains in descending through the perpendicular . It thus follows that a proportionally smaller body , falling freely , may be made to balance a larger body &lling; down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller shall act through a line in the plane in opposition to the descending force , and left to fall freely down the /z/ perpendicular , must equilibrate when equal momenta are gained in equal times . The disparity in the quantity of matter of the bodies balancing , will be as the difference in the rate of movement ; the less velocity on the plane being the index of the lesser increment of momentum in the same space , and the greater velocity down the perpendicular being the index of the greater increment of momentum in the same time . Here is no gain of force , but the economy of substituting a less force for a greater period of working ; but this economy is , however , of great moment , and may be used to an indefinite extent . The universe of matter may readily be conceived as thus balanced by a grain . The principle of the inclined plane is in the wedge , which may be made to incline on one or on both sides , and in the screw , as a spiraUy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers find their full explication in the conception of momentum as attained solely through the insight of the reason in the law of filling bodies , connected with the conceptions of momentum and virtual velocities . Applying the same representative of the increment of velocity for the increment of force which generates this velocity , in whd.t is termed mrtical velocity , we may in the like manner attain the principle of the lever , as a mechanical power , in all the ways of its application . If we conceive the diameter of a circle to be an inflexible rod resting upon its centre , and that masses of matter of equal quantity are affixed to the two extremities , it is plain that they must balance each other , inasmuch as their momenta , i , e. , their quantities of matter and virtual velocities , are equal . But if we shorten one semi-diameter , or slide the rod on the /z/ centre to make its two ends unequally distant from it , the virtual velocity in the longer , it is at once clear , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must be a corresponding augmentation of the quantity of matter on the shorter , or diminution on the longer arm of the rod . This supposed rod is the lever , and it is evident that the same principle is involved here as in the inclined plane , with a different phase only in its presentation . The inclined plane brought the greater weight to the same height by a longer way and thus gave opportunity for the accumulation of the excess of force in the smaller weight ; and the lever brings the greater weight to the same height through a longer joenoe ? , and this gives also opportuiiity for the accumulation of the excess of force , and thus an in crease of virtual velpcity to the smaller weight . The principle of the lever is in the wheel and axle , and also in the puUey , and these together may be indefinitely compounded in cogs and bands and tackle-blocks , and all together may be combined with the varieties of the inclined plane , and thus give endless conveniences , but in no case any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The PEiNrciPLE op Magnetism. - The central force from which the universal globe of . matter is generated , it has been seen , necessarily induces a tendency to motion in two opposite directions equally balancing each other , viz. , propulsion from the centre and a reaction in each point of force which presses back in every way towards the centre . A careful insight into the working of this central force will also detect another virtual movement in its necessary prinaples , and which , when fully apprehended , will be recog- /z/ nized as filling out a full idea of the force of magnetism . A globe , so formed , must be a magnet . If two balls of melted metal were brought in contact , and gently pressed so as gradually to flatten each up to their centres , a peculiar process would necessarily be passed through in this changing of forms . When just brought in contact , and touching at but one point in their circumferences , the antagonism would be as that of two simple agencies . One ball would not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn back the opposite ball into its own body . As the pressure went on , each ball would have a retorsion of itself within , of just the same size and shape as that which had been displaced from the flattened segment , and when the centres should meet there would be a ball within of the size of the original balls , of which one hemisphere would be from the retorted portion of one of the original balls , and the other hemisphere from the portion turned back in the other . If the original balls had been of two different metals of equal densities , or of two different colors , one hemisphere of the new ball would be of one metal , or color , and the other hemisphere of the other . To make this the more manifest , where we may follow the forces in their sensible indices , we drop again a stone into a lake . As the circle of undulations expands , at a little distance from the centre we will conceive an obstacle interposing itself as a rock standing ; upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as it touches this obstacle , is the index of the simple agency in one direction , as now acting in a right line from the point where the stone descended , and . the resisting rock may represent the other simple agency at the point of /z/ counteraction . When the forces thus meet , the action and reaction being opposite and equal , the tendency at first would be to turn the force in a direct line back upon itself towards the point from whence it came where the stone fell , and give its index in a refluent wave in this right line . But as the re-agency goes back it gathers additional resistance in the attempted refluent wave , and which would perpetually increase in each moment of the regressus . It thus at once supervenes that the action and reaction can not be opposite and equal , in a point removed back from the rock towards the place of the &llen; stone , but the resistance to go back must be greater away from the rock than at the rock . The law for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the result is , not a refluent action in a direct line , but an action spreading each way from the rock on the side of the counter-agency , over the surface of the lake . The first stroke of the outgoing wave in the circumference of the circle upon the rock makes its refluent wave , and the next stroke also its refluent , expanding as it flows back with just the force in the aggregate that had brought the circle up , and thus the result is , a return of just so much of the circle as would unimpeded have gone on by the rock now within itself on the hither side of the rock , and this action may be perpetuated until the refluent has equalled and exhausted all the up-coming waves . What has gone back is that which would have gone on , and it has now registered itself in the matter on one side of the rock instead of the matter that lies on the other side , and thus the real thing , as force , has moved and fixed itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of another circle coming up in antagonism , and they could THE PBmCIPLE OF MAGNETISM. 165 have been made directly to meet and coraiterwork without slipping past in the matter that brought them together , there would , as in the melted metal above , have been the formation of two inner semi-circles , or if the action had been sufficiently deep in the lake , two inner half-spheres , and each having only the force in its own hemisphere that had been pushed back by the force that has gone into the other . Thus two circles , or spheres , make a third , with one-half within and of the one , and the other half within and of the other . And here , it is to be noted , precisely the same thing must occur in the generation of forces into a sphere about the point of two countervailing single activities . One turns the other back upon itself , and the accumulating resistance in a right line necessitates a compounded movement and fixing of positions every way in a sphere about the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generated in the forces on one side , made by the return upon itself of one simple activity , and the other half by a return upon itself of the other simple activity . And here it is practicable to the eye of the reason to follow these moving activities , and see just how they must result in fixing the matter which they generate , or in leaving their register as an independent accumulation of forces , in any preceding matter that might be given , as a medium for indicating their currents . If we take the case of two circles in a lake , there might be conceived two floating rods lying as a tangent to each circle , and in the same straight line with each other on the peripheries of the same sides from the centre . As we view these circles and the rods pointing towards each other , we might say of /z/ the one on the right hand that its point was the boreal , and of the one on the left hand that its point was the austral , in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own circles as about to touch each other . If we now conceive these expanding circles to meet , and make each the waves of the other to be refluent within itself , we shall have a new circle made up of two semicircles from each , and within each , about this point of contact . If we should conceive of the augmentation of this new inner circle , by the approach of the original circles together , until their centres should meet in this point of their first contact , and which has become the centre of the new inner circle , then the floating rods would be brought together at the circumference where the half of the original circles now meet and cut each other , and the boreal point in one , and the austral point in the other , would each be retorted and turn each the opposite way in the refluent semi-circles of the new circle formed within and from the original two circles . At just the point in the diameter where the two semi-circles now make one circle , the two rods would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an austral point , and lying as a tangent to the circle at right angles to the diameter . Thus with a circle on the surface of a lake ; and the same result would occur in the sphere , which might be formed by two refluent spheres down within the lake . And this analogy is also perfect in reference to the space-filling matter , which first enspheres itself about an original point of counteraction . The hefnir spheres rauat have a hi-polar force at the equator . This index rod , which now may lie on any part of the equator , or , as the same thing , at right angles to any THE FSmCIPLE OF uAommsii. 167 equatorial diameter , will lie parallel to the axis of the sphere , and may be made to point indifferently either way , inasmuch as it is really the identification of the two original rods , and may be either a boreal or an austral point towards the same pole . The force , which registers itself in this index , is a retorsion on each side of the equatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring is the mutual and neutralizing limit between the reactions , which must be indifferent to either . But as there is a departure from this mutual limit either way , the refluent force must take it on its own side , and control it by its own movement . How it must determine its direction is plain by careftd inspection . At the equator , the forces are on each side at right angles to the diameter and parallel to the axis of the globe , while at the poles , the forces are in a point reactionary to the central antagonism , and thus up and down within the axis . The directions of the force on the side of the equator is in a parallel line with the axis , and the direction of the force at the pole is towards the centre in the line of the axis . The direction of all the forces on the side of the equator are thus to meet in the common polar point , and become turned in that point to a line in the axis towards the centre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work from the equator , and the conjoint force in the polar point which works towards the centre . This compounded movement , it is plain , will be ti perpetual turning of the index from a tangent to the circumference at the equator , to a direction that must go athwart the circumference , and thus a perpetually increasing dip must be secured , making it at right angles to the /z/ axis at the distance of 45 , and in the direction of the axis , towards the centre when over the pole . This will be the same with the austral dip on the boreal side of the globe , and with the boreal dip on the austral side . The forces of the sphere necessarily determine for it a magnetic polar direction and dip on each side of the equator . We may also look immediately into the operation of the sphere-formmg process as given in section 8th , and we shall attain a similar , and even more comprehensive result . The central antagonism turns each its opposite simple activity back upon itself , and thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the activities from pushing further back in a straight line , and thus the equatorial ring is at once elevated ; and then the perpetuation of the central energizing pushes the simple activities in each point of the equatorial ring each way , in meridional lines , quite up to the poles , and all such meridional lines in their contiguity make a spherical layer of molecular forces over each hemisphere , and in this continuation of working , the globe grows to its determined size . We will take these points of molecular forces in the equatorial ring , and subject their determined progress to a careful insight . Each point of force in the equatorial ring is an antagonism of two simple activities counter-working each other in a direction parallel to the axis , and thus the whole equatorial plane is made up of antagonist forces , all working in their directions of counter-agency parallel with the central antagonism , for the aggregate of points in the whole equatorial plane are but the edges of the concentric layers as they meet in their equators . The points nearest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equatorial edge of the smaller , and those farther from the centre will be in the equatorial edges of the larger spherical layers . I then , we take any point in the equatorial plane , it wiU be a point of force in the equatorial edge of some spherical layer , and will balance itself back upon the polar point in the direction of the meridional line , and by the equilibration of forces that lie in and all through that line . We take , then , any such point , and consider it as a molecule of matter that has its polar direction in the line of its two counter working simple activities , and which must be parallel with the antagonism of the central point , and with the axis of the universal sphere . The central point works back upon the polar point in an exact line of action and reaction through all the intervening points , and thus each molecule is in the same polar direction as 11 the others in the axis on its side of the centre , and aU on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules on the other side of the centre . But , while the central point thus works exactly back in molecules of the same polar directions , no point out of the centre can work back upon the pole in molecules of the same exact polar directions . The point out of the centre , and in the equatorial plane , begins with a molecule that has its polar direction parallel with the centre , but the polar point against which it balances has its polar direction towards the centre and in the line of the axis ; this beginning equatorial point must thus have the direction turned gradually and completely about , in the molecules of the meridional line , by the time the action has reached the polar point and balanced all the molecules in the meridional line upon it . The equatorial molecule will // have its polar direction parallel with the axis ; the polar molecule will have its polar direction in the axis towards the centre ; and thus all molecules in the meridional line between the equatorial and the polar molecules must have their polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next from the equatorial must converge from a parallel to a slight inclination of polar direction towards the axis , and the next to that a little more , till midway , or at the 46th degree , the polar direction of the molecule must be at right angles with the axis , and so onward turning about to the pole , where the molecule resting on the polar point must have a polar direction turned completely round and working towards the centre in the line of the axis . This principle of polar direction in the meridional molecules must necessarily determine the magnetic dip , and this must begin from a parallel with the axis in the equatorial plane throughout , and terminate through the meridional line by a direction to the centre in the axis at the pole , having in that distance completely retrograded its former direction . The opposite poles must have their magnetic dip the converse of each other through all the molecules of their respective hemispheres . Bring , then , two magnets together , and force their spheres of polar action to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each would have their molecular action and dip opposite to each other , and each towards its own centre , and they must repel each other ; while the opposite poles so interfering would have the molecular action and dip conformed to each other , and they must therefore attract one the other . The molecular action and THE PRINCIPLE OF ELECTEIOnT. 171 dip is neutralized in the equator , and thus mutual attraction and repulsion must there be neutralized , and the respective attractions and repulsions must augment to their maximum in the interfering poles . Thus the equatorial and polar counteractions determine the necessary laws of magnetism , as the central action and reaction determine the necessary laws of gravity . 12 . The Principle op Electricity . - The balanced action , between the equatorial plane and the poles , which holds every molecule in its place of static rest through every meridional line of every spherical layer , is the great principle of magnetism ; the interruption of this continued static rest in any portion of the superficial matter , and the consequent tension in the interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great principle of electricity . This pressure from the equator to the pole , and in the stability of the polar point a reciprocal pressure back from the pole upon the equator , we have now to conceive may be interrupted in particular places by various agencies . These several interrupting agencies will be hereafter examined in their determining principles , such as light and heat and chemical decomposition , and to which may be added mechanical friction , the principle of which has been already apprehended ; but these causes and their occasions of working in the interruption of the magnetic force need not here be regarded . We need only anticipate , that causes and occasions will occur to break up this continuity of equal reciprocal agency between the equatorial plane and the polar points , and that thus the molecules will in some places be turned in their polar directions away from their proper lines in the magnetic meridians , and in this /z/ anticipation we shall find all that is necessary for clearly attaming the grand principles which must determine all the laws in the experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ongoing of the forces of nature , must be supposed to be brought into combination , that will admit of their respective component molecules being more or less easily turned from their proper magnetic polar direction , as would be their natural position in the magnetic meridian , and when thus deranged , some of these substances will be very slow and stubborn in permitting their molecules to come again into their proper magnetic arrangement . Let such deranged substances occupy any place in the sphere between the equator and one of the poles , and they must at once interrupt the reciprocal action between the equator and the pole and sunder the magnetic me ridional continuity . There will then necessarily at once ensue a tension in the equatorial force to overcome and remove this interruption , and to rest itself again , in the continued line of magnetic reciprocity , upon the resisting static force that comes up towards it from the pole . Such struggle and tension to overcome this interruption is the awakened and active force of electricity . It is really the magnetic force struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as static polar rest differs from the tension that struggles to remove an interruption that it may again be at rest . Now such tension must manifestly have its two conspiring directions ; the equatorial force will go out positively and actively to find its reciprocal static point and rest itself against it , and this static polar point , unsustabied by its positive antagonism on its equatorial side , can only nega- THE PEINOIPLB OF ELECTBIOnY. 173 lively struggle for such sustaimng reciprocity , by maintaining itself against the central antagonism that would go beyond it in fixing a new polar point , and force this central activity to go up in the equator and come down in the meridional line to the pole , and there meet and support itself in counteraction . There must , therefore , be two forces ; one positively struggling to move forward , the other negatively struggling not to move back . We shall therefore have two kinds of electricity , properly the positive and the negative ; and no interruption to the polar force can anywhere occur , but it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deranged substance , interrupting the magnetic continuity , has its molecular polarity all the wrong way , and each molecule turned so that the end of its axis which should be towards the pole is now toward the equator , and thus this whole interrupting substance is turned with its positive towards the positive tension that struggles against it , and its negative towards the polar negative that holds itself not to go back , and therefore , the positive tension must push or repel opposing positive tension , and negative tension must stand against opposite negative tension ; and , on the other hand , the positive must constantly push into the negative that is before it , and the negative constantly receive the positive that comes up to it ; and thus the fact in experience must ever be that opposite electricities will attract and similar electricities repel each other . This is similar in expression but not in principle to the attraction and repulsion of magnetism . In magnetism the whole magnet is a unit , and the equator or middle point neutral , and the polar forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the /z/ equatorial plane , and thus here the principle is , that similar dips and forces must throw out , and opposite dips and forces must crowd in each other ; but in electricity the whole has no tmity , for this has been broken up and the entire force of electricity is to recover it , and the opposite electricities work in the same directions , one positively and the other negatively , to join and restore the unity . There is no centre to the electric tension ; all is in one direction , and hence any division of an electric can not make the parts to be now complete wholes , as in a divided magnet , but must still be each one only another fragment of the whole . It is also further manifest , if any substance may be made to penetrate this deranged molecular substance that interrupts the magnetic continuity , and such penetrating substance have all its molecules lcile and ready to come to their proper polarity , that this penetrating substance , uniting the positive and negative electricities through the interrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in its continuous polarity bring the positive on one side to rest itself against , and equilibrate with , the negative on the other side . Such &cile; continuation of the common polarity would be a properly conducting substance , and all such substances that when deranged in molecular polarity readily recovered themselves , and arranged their molecules by a slight tension urging thereto according to the magnetic meridian , would properly be known as electrical conductors . The absence of conductors might leave the electric tension to be permanently resisted , or this tension to so accumulate that it should burst violently through the interrupting obstacle , and restore the /z/ equilibrium in a destructive explosion , while the intervention of the conductor might restore the balance by a gradual and silent passage . 13 . The Principle op Heat . - We have traced the necessary working of the antagonist force according to its own intrinsic nature and constitution , and have found from it the principles respectively of Motion , Sphericity , Gravity , Falling bodies . Magnetism , and Electricity . But the antagonist force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and with it , and its generated results keep equal pace with those of the antagonist working through the universal sphere . The diremptive working does not hinder the antagonist activity in the securing of the above principles , but many other results are demanded in a completed nature of things , and which no mere antagonist forces could supply , and which can only be secured in the working of the diremptive force according to its nature and constitution . We now , therefore , x the insight of the reason directly on the diremptive force working at the centre , and find what must come of it . In it we shall first find the principle of Heat . While the antagonist force generates a sphere by a perpetual accumulation of concentric spherical layers , the diremptive force will work itself in between all these concentric layers and dispart them by its own peculiar energy . The diremptive activity is in unity with the antagonist activity from the first , and both work on coetaneously , and while the antagonism secures the results we have already traced both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the diremptive activity secure any manifested results separate from its combination with the // working antagonism . Its action is perpetually away from itself in every limit that might be taken , and this perpetual going off in simple activities , on each side of any limit in which it might be set to work , could only issue in continual self-dissipation , and emptying itself from the limit with no capability of accumulations at the limit . But in working within and against the simple activities of the antagonist force , it at once attains consistency and persistency in space . Its outgoings meet the antagonist incomings , and thereby generate new counteractions , in which there are other determining principles as immutable as any we have yet attained in the ensphering and space-filling antagonisms . The primitive central antagonism is conceived as two simple activities meeting and counter-working in a common limit , and we now conceive the diremption to be a beginning in that common limit and sending out two simple opposite activities from it . The two mutually and necessarily determine the direction of each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diremption within it to spread each way in divellency ; and the diremption being first , would wake the antagonism on each side of it to push together in counter-agency ; and both being in unity of agency , would counterwork each other ; and thus in any method of possible communion , the antagonist and diremptive forces must work upon and against each other . From the very nature of the agency in such combination , we may see , moreover , that the result must be a perpetual palpitation , or systole and diastole play between them of a very peculiar and specific kind . Keeping in mind the order of the sphere-forming process , so minutely and carefully followed out in the antagonist working , we will now as care /z/ fully trace this process of diremptive working through the whole sphere , and which must necessarily be in the converse order of movement and result , inasmuch as the diremption can not work and manifest itself at all save in an antithesis to the antagonism . We fix on the limit in the central antagonist force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit we now find also a diremption . The antagonisms pushed each back upon themselves , and made two polar points of force in a line on opposite sides of the limit in which the simple activities had met , and these points , being thus taken and held by the newly engendered forces in them , forbade the antagonisms now to go further back on opposite sides in a line , and by the second principle of motion necessitated a rising out on all sides in an equatorial plane or ring , midway between the polar points and transverse to the axis . Even so , in converse effect , must this diremptive action traverse the same course . In meeting the simple activities of the antagonism and pushing back upon them , it does the same work on each that each one was doing on the other , adding this energy of the diremptive working to the former pushing of the antagonisms , as it disparts itself each way while standing between them . This disparting of the diremptive action m the very limit of the meeting antagonisms lengthens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the static resistance of the polar poiuts equilibrates the diremptive action , and so loosens or disparts the antagonism at its central limit that the diremption must now turn , as the antagonism did , to a direction transverse to its first action . This necessitates a pushing out against the equatorial ring of the first antagonist layer from the central /z/ point , and a passing betTreen that layer and the centnd point , and separating the antagonist layer from the centnd point by interposing a diremptive layer . This diremptiye action then again pushes out the antagonist polar points , both by the central working and the working in the layer without the centre , and this loosens the first antagonist layer in its equatorial ring and passes again transversely through , and against the next layer in its equator . As then , the equatorial antagonisms must flow down on each side in the meridional lines , and at length rest from all ways upon the polar points , and thus complete their circuit and equilibrate the movement of the antagonism , even so must the centraLl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and down oh each side between the outer and inner tneridians in the concen* trie antagonist spherical layers , and occupy the disparted Bpace between the kyers in each hemisphere from the equator to the poles . As then , again , the equilibrated movement of the antagonism through the equatorial ring down against the poles has fitopped all further passage of the generating force in that direction , and the central workmg must push the antagonisms out each way again in new polar points , to be resisted by them and turned again through the equatorial plane in new meridional lines , mak ing new concentric spherical layers in each hemisphere ; just so must the diremptive force run over again its drcuit , and elongate the polar line , and loosen the equatorial antagonisms ; and pass through and expand the space between this concentric layers at the equator , and then pass down in each hemisphere disparting the layers to the poles* Thus , while the sphere is engendered and augmented by the per- /z/ petual working of the antagonist force , it is also continnally disparted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let it also be carefully noted , that as the diremptiYe action elongates the axis by pressing back the polar points and filling in the centre by its own force , it makes the sphere to take on a prolate form ; and that as it passes through the disparted antagonisms at the equator , and presses out against the spherical layer beyond , it pushes oat the equatorial region and thus makes the sphere to take on an oblate form ; and that therefore a perpetual pulsation through every spherical layer must be kept up with every diremptive palpitation of the centre . When the whole sphere is formed , and all its concentric layers filled in with the diremptive forces , if then the diremptive action keep on at the centre , the space between the layers being a plenum , the throb at the centre is felt all through to the circumference instantaneously , except so fiir as the yielding and elastic spring of the diremptive substance may furnish occasion for a propagated and thus a successive motion . As the diremptive movement passes in the equatorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemisphere that meet in this plane , the oscillation of the layer must make its vibration of every molecule in the layer , and thus successively of every moleciile in the sphere , Now , this diremptive force is heat in its essential being , and the principle of its working must determine all its phenomenal fiicts and their laws . In its combination with the antagonist forces it becomes hql and goes to the composition of the new substance in a static state , and of course /z/ induces no vibrations , and imparts no sensible heat , except as in chemical dissolution it becomes liberated . Its necessity of working in every part of its being is by a disparting and divellent action , on occasion of any force within or against which it may exert its diremptive energy , and thus must eapand every substance into which it enters in its free state . It may be made to permeate any substance so as only to fill in and occupy all the interstices between and around the molecules , without at all parting or separating the molecules themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be latent heat . It may escape from one substance through the intervening medium , and in its passage through a fluid medium it must follow its order of movement as already given in a vibratory process , and as passing out in vibrations all ways from a thermal source it will give radiated heat . While the same substance is radiating its heat , it may also be receiving the radiations from other substances , and such reception of radiated heat will give absorbed heat . Some of the radiations meeting a substance that absorbs with difficulty , must paas off from it and give reflected heat . The principles determining reflection , refraction , diffraction and polarization are all here included , and may all be exposed in experimental &cts,; showing that the laws in the facts were all necessitated in an immutable principle . If the diremptive action not only presses between and about the molecules so as to expand the substance , but goes so far as to loosen and thoroughly isolate the molecules that they may freely pass by and over each other , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separating the molecules from each other and forcing the particles asunder at some distance , /z/ will make thermal evaporation/ and a greater intensity of heat that breaks up the substantial combination of the molecules themselves , and violently sunders the constitutional forces of the materials , will be combustion . In the universal sphere , the diremptive and antagonist activities will equilibrate , when the working at the centre is just balanced by the reactions from the outlying spherical layers , and the diremptive and antagonist forces run each their own circuit without invading and breaking up one the other . In this state of antagonist and diremptive equilibration we shall have the material universe in that state that may be known as the primitive ether , 14 . Chemical Pbinciples. - It is not possible that antagonist forces can come into any combinations and thus form chemical compounds by themselves alone . The only manner of their working is by ensphering themselves about a central point , and the entire globe of such forces must be of single and homogeneous molecules throughout . But with the conjoint working of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working , there is full occasion given for chemical combinations , and indeed a necessity that such should ultimately be effected . When the diremptive action has diffused its disparting forces between all the layers of the universal sphere , and there is an equUibration of both the antagonist and diremptiye forces in their reactions upon the centre , and thus the universal sphere has completed its full destined size , there may still be a continued generation of both these forces at the centre , and instead of augmenting the size of the sphere they will only serve to fiU in and increase its density . When the exact balance is gained , the spherical layers // of the antagonist forces are not only disparted rom each other by the infusion of the heat-force in its layers between them , but there is the loosening also of the mcdecules in the layers of the antagonist forces by the permeating heatforce , so that they just maintain their magnetic polar directions in their meridional lines , and are at the same time just ready to dispart and pass over and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass is just loosened , molecule from molecule , and may be called a fluid , only the molecules are all yet quiescent and not flowing . li then , the antagonist and diremptive agencies keep on in exact equilibration of their generating activities , there must be a perpetual going out of new forces of both kinds into the universal sphere , but as the antagonist action is just dissolved by the diremptive action , there can be no crowding back of the polar points and extending of the axis by a retorsion of the smtagonist simple activities upon themselves , and as there can be secured no extended static in this direction , so there can be no pushing out of the transverse equatorial ring and the successive enlargement of the sphere ; and for the same reason there can be no prolate and dilate movement in the going out of the diremptive accumulations , and thus no filling in successively of the heat-force any further between the spherical layers . The consistency of the layers is all dissolved , and thus extension and vibration must wholly cease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows out from the central point into the sphere , and can thus only thicken and make denser the primitive ether without extending its volume . The mass only becomes a thicker fluid , without yet any flow . But without at all following here the determinations osEmoAjj PBiijroiPLBS. 183 of such acoumulation and thickeiiuig of the primitiYe ether , which will find its more fit opportunity hereafter , it is sufficiently manifest that in such movement and acoumu* lation of forces , there must come new and varied combina tions . The antagonist and diremptive activities meet each other , and interwork and dissolve and counterwork each other in many new varieties of action , and we have opened at once all the necessities for chemical affinities , chemical equivalents , and chemical combinations and decompositions . If one molecule of the antagonist forces be exactly balanced by the working of a diremptive force in the very limit of its simple activities , we have a new chemical atom ; entirely a new substance ; and competent to stand out alone in complete static individuality . So , if two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , or a number of antagonist forces around a central diremption , or a varied number of limited diremptive activities by an equilibrating number , intensity , and direction of antagonisms ; in all such cases there comes the necessity for all chemical laws . The forces and single activities can not equilibrate and hold each other in static rest without inducing the whole doctrine of chemical equivalents , and only such forces can run to each other 's counteracting help and support as stand in the line of reciprocal activities , and which must introduce the whole doctrine of chemical affinities . Simple chemical substances will not be single antagonist forces , but such combinations of the antagonist and diremptive activities , in their most simple working , as no application of other combinations can imloose and decompose . /z/ The combiniDg forces must come together in specific proportions , and continue in combination until neutralizing or countervailing forces again destroy their cohesion . The combination can not be a substance that shall give the qualities of either ingredient , for the combined forces lose all their former mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annihilates the old modes of activity in the new . As the combination wholly suspended and for the time indeed destroyed the elemental forces in their old mode of action , so an analysis of this substance must destroy the force that constituted it , and give occasion again for the elementary activities to work after their former manner . The perpetuated working at the centre must induce an elementary chaos of prepared forces , that on occasion must come together in chemical combinations . 15 . Ceystalltne Principles . - The free working of the antagonist activities can only form globes which have their single axis ; and the chemical compositions that may press their molecules together in a new force , thereby making a new substance , and which may harden it to a body in a rigid state , can only have the one axis which the equipoise of gravity must give to it through its centre . The forces in mere chemical affinities can make combinations only in bipolar and uniaxial bodies , and which poles and axis must be determined by the aggregate of gravitating force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the converse activities of the antagonist and diremptive forces , it is plain that there must be occasions for their mutual action and reaction in directly tranverse /z/ directions . The diremptive force may stand between and balance two antagonist forces that press together , and this in a transverse direction at right-angles , or at any obliqne angle , and such composition of forces must make a nucleus , that in process shall build up around it a cube or a riiombohedron ; and if the balancing diremptive force gradually and regularly diminish as the combination goes on , it will necessitate the cutting off of the solid angles of the before-mentioned geometrical solids , and make them to become right angled or rhomboidal octahedrons . Thus may any variety of regular geometrical solids be built up by accordant forces in composition , that shall work towards each other in such directions and degrees as to balance themselves in the axes of such solids . The whole principle of crystallogeny is in this combination of heat with polar matter , or the bringing together of these converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and multiaxial combinations . The whole geometrical solid is determined in its &ces; and edges and solid angles by the axes and polarity which the working forces secure , and the degrees of energy respectively exerted . And inasmuch as the working forces must also determine the superposition of the fecial layers , so the same crystal must always have its permanent determined planes of cleavage , and the specific polish of the faces . The gravitating force has the principle which determines the fluid rain to fall in spherical drops , and the crystalline principle determines the feUing snow to arrange itself in star-shaped needles , and the haU has these congealed in diverse polyhedrons. // 16 . The Peinciplb of Wobld-foehahons. - The attained conception of the universal sphere in its generated and accumulating ethereal matter , and the perpetual woAing of the central antagonist and diremptive- actiyities constantly making new chemical compositions , and thus also new substances in nature , and moving the primitive matter into new forces , must give the occasion for much further tracing the immutable principles to necessary determinations , and without forecasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the clear insight shall disclose . The circuits of the two primal forces , as they inter work on and with each other , need to be kept distinctly in the apprehension . The antagonist agency goes back in the line of the axis to the poles , and holds itself in static equilibration there until the equatorial ring is elevated transverse to the axis , and until the forces in this ring have crowded their simple activities back on each side upon themselves up to the poles , and balanced the whole movement . Another crowding back of the polar points and lengthening of the axis then occurs , to hold itself again in static rest until the same process is repeated in another equatorial ring , and another hemispherical layer on each side to the poles . Thus perpetually with the circuit of the antagonist force . The diremptive activity , starting from the same limit in the central force , takes the same circuit by a directly converse movement . Going out each way from the central limit , the diremptive activities encounter these antagonist agencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosen the central tension , and in this the occasion is given for the . diremptive action to turn its divellency transverse to its first direction , and thereby /z/ press ont and fill in the interval between the first antagonist spherical layer and the central molecule . The diremptiye agency thus balanced , must thence again push back upon the next outer polar points in the axis , to be thence turned again transverse to its firmer direction , and loosi and fill in between the first and second spherical antagonist layer , and thus on alternately prolate and oblate until every spherical layer is loosened by the interposing diremp* tive force . This diremptive action ultimately disparts the layers and also the molecules in the layers , and dissolves the whole mass into a fluid or molten state . The two agencies thus balance each other , and the diremption is held still while the antagonism is just parted , and the fluid ether rests quiet . The principles of these working forces determine clear , though varied and extended results . The polar points are perpetually static , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on each side through the meridional lines to meet in these static poles and rest against them . Each concentric layer is thus balanced in its polar point , and thus each hemisphere throughout is balanced by the aggregate polar points which form its axis , and the two hemispheres stand in antagonism to each other in the equatorial plane , just as the simple activities stand in antagonism at the central point . The diremptive movement , or permeation of heat , is thus ever through the equatorial plane and back each way between the concentric layers , and never through the polar points and out fi-om thence between the concentric layers towards the equator . When the heat is perpetually forced from // the centre , as there generated , into the equatorial plane , the hemispherical antagonism tends to hold it in this plane and necessitates its accumulation in the equatorial region . It presses its way between the layers only by overcoming this polar hemispherical resistance . The perpetual generation and effusion must at length isolate every antagonist molecule , and thus truly fuse the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in and near to the equatorial plane . With this pressure of the two hemispheres together in the equatorial plane , from the perpetual working of the central antagonism , and the exact balancing of the molecules in fluid rest by the loosening of the interposed and everywhere permeating heat-force , we have a startingpoint for the insight to attain to further determinations . The perpetual pressure of new generated forces , both antagonist and diremptive , into the balanced fluid ether , and which from the loosened and dissolved state of the antagonist forces in the spherical layers , can not now augment the volume of the universal sphere , must gradually condense and thicken the homogeneous ethereal fluid , and make it to be a chaotic mass of blended and confused interworking forces that , by occasion given , shall come together in chemical combination , and constitute various distinct substances . The even working of the two central forces , while thickening the mass to greater consistency , keeps it still fluid and molten , and ready to flow on any excess of pressure . This excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too dense to permit the ready penetration of the central working forces . A commingled stream of such forces , precluded from free permeation in /z/ the thickened chaotic matter , must drive it into currents and force the resisting portions before it into unequal accumulations . The invading currents , meeting with the resistance of the matter in advance , must tend perpetually to spiral and gyrating movements , turning athwart their own courses and revolving across their general lines of movement . Such whirling movement must repeatedly break up the matter that it carries into divers successive separations , and at intervals make wheeling portions of matter that turn themselves about upon their own aades , and work themselves into spherical forms . These will be of different volume and velocity of movement , according to the forming impulses which have constituted them , but at length the myriads of revolving spheres will have worked up and exhausted the chaotic material , and leave the intervening spaces to be again filled by the purified primitive ether , and the wheeling bodies and their reactions will balance the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commingled antagonist and diremptive forces from behind , and the hemispherical pressure at the sides , have overcome the forces of gravity and magnetism , and wrought the chemical chaos into these wheeling spheres , but while overworking they have not at all destroyed the forces of gravity and magnetism . These forces have been constant though overborne , and have held the universal sphere steadist in its own form and proportions . Each new spherical mass has also taken to itself a new centre , and every molecule of the mass is pressed out from the centre according to the principle of repulsion , and pressed back also to the centre according to the principle of attraction , and the de- // terminations of gravity and magnetism are in ail these new qherical bodies as in the great universal sphere . Each has the gravity of its own molecules towards its own centre , and each gravitates towards the others according to the ratios of the quantity of matter and inversely as the squares of their distances , and all feel and obey the determining principles of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it according to the forces in the primitive xmiversal ether in which they have thdir position . Each new spherical body is also a magnet with its own bi-polar directions , dip , and attraction and repulsion , and yet these must conform to the magnetic forces of the universal sphere , according as the particular new spherical body is in the austral or boreal hemisphere of the universe . The confused and chaotic mass of chemically combining matter is thus , from the working of its own forces , taking m definite forms and assuming fixed positions , and whfle made to be individual wholes in their own constitution , they are yet but the component portions of the xmiversal whole which is now coming in to the order of a systematic arrangement . The original antagonist and diremptive activities can not work on together , without the necessity of iriducing such a chaos of chemical combinations , and the necessity also of there ultimately coming out from it this growing order of a systematic whole in its determined and regulated members . All the spherical masses are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified in their places from some peculiarities of forces and affim* ties , which may give some characteristic chemical differ-* ences in the matter of the different spheres , yet must all be substantially of the same material elements and bodily con PSmOIFLE OF WOBLD-FOBMATIONS. 191 stitntion . There is more than analogy - in appearance and origin from the same Creator , even an existence in the same primal forces , and a determined nature in the same eternal principles . We follow these determining principles still onward , and shall find yet more extended results of cosmical order and harmony . Single Worlds . - When any rotating mass shall be of so great consistency , or of such slow motion , that the revolving force at the circmnference is less than the force of gravity , or adhesion , then can no part be separated from the mass in its revolutions , but the forces of gravity and revolution will work on together , and the surrounding fluid matter will be taken up and incorporated into the body , and the wheeling viass must ultimately settle itself into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gravitating and revolving forces shall determine . It must henceforth All its own place , and rotate alone on its own axle , and take that position in the great sphere which is determined in its specific gravity . Its own forces of magnetism and electricity must be inherent , and it must attract and be attracted according to the universal law of gravity* Double TFbrcfe. - Should any rotating mass break and separate into two portions of no great inequality , the smaller must revolve outside of and around the larger , as having been in the revolution of the whole thrown off at parting beyond the larger , and while the larger portion must perpetually turn on its own centre , the two must thus be reciprocally yoked together and henceforth remain double . When such double worlds shall be viewed from other worlds in the direction of the plane of their orbits , they /z/ must appear to approach and recede alternately from each other ; and if viewed perpendicularly to their orbital plane , they must be seen to keep the same distance from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed in any of the intermediate directions , they must be seen to pass from side to side alternately , and always in such conjunction as appropriately to be known as double stars . Such connections in a common centre of revolution must depend upon conditions that can not be anticipated as of common occurrence , and yet amid millions of forming worlds , the aggregate of double stars in their determining conditions may weU be very considerable . These double worlds must , like the single suns , gravitate together towards the great centre , according to their quantity of matter , and must thus find , and then permanently keep , their proper places in the universal sphere , and stand forever balanced in the position determined by the compounding of the central and all outlying attractions . Systems of Worlds , - As these spherical bodies rotate on their axes , there must be not only the hemispherical pressure , but the force of rotation , perpetually tending to flatten the spheres at their poles and elevate them at their equators . K any of them have too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rapidity of rotation as to overmatch the force of gravity , then can not the superficial and equatorial portion maintain its connection with the mass , but must commence its discession at the place of the excess of the tangential force . This disceding portion will be followed by so much of the fluid equatorial circumference as shall at the time bring the rotating and gravitating forces in equilibration , when the sphere will continue /z/ its rotations , and the detached portion must follow out its separate determinations . If the tangential impulse has added but little to the momentum which the now detached portion had when in connection with the spherical body , then must the parted mass move nearly in the old circular track that it had when in the equatorial surface of the body it has left . But if it has a large excess of revolving over the gravitating force , and yet not sufficient to carry it beyond the attracting force of the sphere , the impulse must , proportioned to this excess , carry the detached portion out beyond its old track in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetually wider and wider from it , up to a certain point . The tangential force is constant , and as the detached portion moves off , the gravitating force is perpetually diminishing in the ratio of the square of the distance , it must therefore discede from its old path , till it comes to its culminating point in the opposite end of a line drawn through the centre of the sphere from the point where it disceded from the sphere . From this point , the gravitating force begins to augment and bring the course gradually nearer to its old track , till in the point from whence it disceded its orbit will have been completed , and it must henceforth continue to move through these superior and inferior apsides , in an elliptical orbit around its old parent sphere , and be known as a distinct " planet . The eccentricity of the planet 's orbit must be directly as the excess of the tangential impulse at the time of dis- cession , for this excess must equilibrate itself in alternate departures and approaches with reference to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its inclination oi /z/ // orbit to the plane of the old path must be determined by any forces drawing it aside , or changing the plane of the sphere 's revolution after the planet 's discession . This planetary mass thrown from the wheeling sphere , and henceforth to revolve in an elliptical orbit of greater or less eccentricity about the centre of the old sphere as one of its foci , is at the time of its discession in an utterly amorphous condition , both of outward shape and inward constitution and arrangement . It is only so much chemically chaotic matter put in motion in a promiscuous aggregation . But the principle in the determining forces at work , must bring order out of confusion . As altogether separated from the parent sphere , it must have now its own centre of gravity , and every molecule of the fused matter must come under the conditions of the central forces , and tend at once to an arrangement equably about the centre in a globular form . This globular arrangement from the inner central force is also greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expulsion from the spherical body , and its subsequent action upon the planetary mass , tends strongly to its spherical arrangement and rotation . When the tangential force that expelled it has been in considerable excess , it has necessarily given a proportionally strong impulse to the ejected planetary matter , and this impulse must be the most energetic upon the superior portion of this matter , and tending to drive this forward and over the inferior portion , at the same time the breaking up of the adhesion on leaving the mass , and the perpetuated attraction act most energetically upon the inferior portion , and both tend to restrain and slacken its motion . The combination of these forces necessitates that PKDSrOIPMJ OF WOBLD-FORMATIOlSrS. 195 the upper portion shall run around and spirally enwrap the lower portion . An axis to the planet must thus be generated directly after its separation , and the planet immediately begin to rotate upon it . The direction of its rotation must be determined by these generating forces , and which secure that it must be in the same line in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The superior portion must be pushed over , and the inferior portion held back , and the plane of rotation must be determined by such combination . All parts of the planetary mass being of equal consistency , and at first equally distant from its own centre , would give conditions determining that the axis of rotation must be at right angles to the orbit , and the planet 's equator in the plane of the orbit , and thus the rotation in the same plane with the revolution . But any modification of these conditions will vary the determined result . The general tendency must doubtless be to such direction of rotation , but a greater density or a larger volume on one side of the planetary mass must modify its rotation , and come in combination with the other forces to determine where the axis shall be generated , and how one portion shall roll over another . In extreme cases of imequal balance in the planetary matter , the axis will necessarily have an extreme degree of inclinsr tion to the orbit . The rotation must ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except from outward interfering forces , but the conditions determining the rotation may give very varied degrees of axial inclination . The position of the axis and the rate of rotation , being determined by the conditions which first form the planet /z/ to a globe , they must henceforth continue the same . Other causes may vary the velocity of revolution in different portions of the orbit , and other forces may come in to ohange the plane of the orbit itself but the direction and velocity of rotation are settled in the planet 's first formation . The tangential force and the power of attraction in the primal sphere , may vary relatively at different times in the revolution , but the compounded forces of rotation did their work at once , and that impulse is to be henceforth constant in the ejected planet . When , now , we take the planet as a body rotating on its axis , we can see that , in its fluid state , similar conditions may give similar determinations to it , as were those in the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet rotates with a rapidity determined by the first compounded impulse , and this may be in very varied degrees among different planets . When the excess of force is on the side of the attraction , the tangential fierce of rotation will make no separations , and the planet will revolve in its orbit aJone without any attendant . But when the excess of force is on the side of the tangential impulse , a separation of a portion of the circumference of the planet must ensue , and this portion must form itself into a globe , and revolve about the planet as a satellite , according to the determining principles before given for the planet itself . The rotation of the planet on its axis will not give the amount of tangential force that the old spherical mass did in throwing off the planet ; it is therefore hardly to be anticipated , that when a satellite is formed , it should be made to rotate about an axis generated within .

Thi must give a peculiarity of phase to the satellite in reference to the planet . In the rotation of the planet about its own axis , it abolished the virtual motion that tended to keep its revolution as it had been in unbroken connection with the radii from the great centre , and balanced itself by its rotary motion , in the plane passing through its centre perpendicular to its axis . Its axis , in each part of its orbit ) thus kept itself parallel to the positions it had occupied in every other part , and every revolution turned each portion of the planet 's surface , in succession , once towards the great body within its orbit . But the satellite , which does not rotate , has the virtual motion which the fixed radii had communicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which is now as if the radii were combined in the one radius from the centre of the planet through the centre of the satellite . The satellite , thus , can not hold itself in any plane pasdng through its centre perpendicular to some diameter that might be made an axis , but must move on in its orbit , as its parts in their places in the equatorial circumference of the planet had done before their expulsion , when they were fixed in their radii toward the centre . The satellite now separated from it may revolve fiister or slower than it , but this satellite must keep on in its revolution with the velocity it had /z/ to a globe , they must henceforth continue the same . Other causes may vary the velocity of revolution in different portions of the orbit , and other forces may come in to ohange the plane of the orbit itself but the direction and velocity of rotation are settled in the planet 's first formation . The tangential force and the power of attraction in the primal sphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the compounded forces of rotation did their work at once , and that impulse is to be henceforth constant in the ejected planet . When , now , we take the planet as a body rotating on its axis , we can see that , in its fluid state , similar conditions may give similar determinations to it , as were those in the case of the wheeling sphere from whence the planet was separated . This planet rotates with a rapidity determined by the first compounded impulse , and this may be in very varied degrees among different planets . When the excess of force is on the side of the attraction , the tangential fierce of rotation will make no separations , and the planet will revolve in its orbit alone without any attendant . But when the excess of force is on the side of the tangential impulse , a separation of a portion of the circumference of the planet must ensue , and this portion must form itself into a globe , and revolve about the planet as a satellite , according to the determining principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet on its axis will not give the amount of tangential force that the old spherical mass did in throwing off the planet ; it is therefore hardly to be anticipated , that when a satellite is formed , it should be made to rotate about an axis generated within .

This must give a peculiarity of phase to the satellite in reference to the planet .

But the satellite , which does not rotate , has the virtual motion which the fixed radii had communicated from the centre of the planet to the equatorial circumference , and which is now as if the radii were combined in the one radius from the centre of the planet through the centre of the satellite . The satellite , thus , can not hold itself in any plane passing through its centre perpendicular to some diameter that nught be made an axis , but must move on in its orbit , as its parts in their places in the equatorial circumference of the planet had done before their expulsion , when they were fixed in their radii toward the centre . The satellite now separated from it may revolve faster or slower than it , but this satellite must keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its results under its conditions as before considered* Doubtless its quantity of matter in volume and density , wHl greatly differ from the former ; and also , that there will be a considerable difference in velocity of revolution , eccentricity and inclination of plane in the orbit , rapidity and period of rotation on its axis , and inclination of axis to the orbit , and also a difference in having no satellite or a varied number of them from the former planet . But all these will be determined for it in the conditions that come with it , and these conditions are all given in the determining principles of the great primal forces working under the control of the Absolute Reason at the centre . Thus on , in succession , till the remaining portion of the sphere may be of a density and velocity of revolution , in the exhausted and used-up fused material that was in its gathering reach , that shall permit itself to condense and concentrate in a globe at the centre , and revolve in its own place according to its given conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Creator . Each planet and each satellite has settled its own laws of working in its formation , and in them there is a register of the forces and movements of the whole in the places and times of their formation , and the whole is now a unit in its reciprocal interactions , and held also in unity to the great primitive globe which fixes its place for it within itself . Thus with all single and double and compound worlds ; the great amount of fused and prepared material , about the middle regions of the universal globe of matter , may be made to exhaust itself in any number and variety of world-formations , by a directing agency at the centre of all operation , and all these to take their respective places . /z/ and revolve therein with unbroken order . When the newly compounded matter shall have been thus all pressed into separate worlds and systems , and the superabundant heat-forces shall be absorbed in such creations , the great globe of universal primitive matter will stand forth , clear in its appropriate forces as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pure ether , which has a power of gravity to regulate , but not a consistency and resistance to hinder or derange , their exact revolutions and rotations . The original antagonism at the centre has never been relaxed , and now holds the primal matter , and all the chemically combined matter of the moving worlds , in that energetic force and action which keeps up for them perpetual and palpable existence , shape , and movement . And the conversely acting diremptive-force keeps also its central outgoings constant , and the incessant heat-generation permeates the entire area of the universal sphere . These original agencies now perpetually energize , not that they may constitute new materials , and augment the existing creation , but that they may sustain , equilibrate , and supply the universe in all its parts and uses as already wisely constituted . The past history of world-formations may be read exactly in their present movements and localities . The central sun once joined in continuous matter itself through all the intervening worlds , to the outermost planet . These worlds now condensed in solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion of the whole had then at the equatorial circumference , the velocity of this furthest planet in its orbit . In successive stages it has thrown off its superficial strata , which have roUed and hardened into // worlds , now moving in their orbits at the same rates of revolution in which the primal sphere was then turning on its axle . Yea , all the universe of suns and systems were once in that chaotic mass together , which was by the primitive heat dissolved , and mingled , and chemically reconstituted out of the modified ethereal matter . They have been separately wrought in their forms , and pressed to their present dimensions , by the strong impulses of the diremptive forces , and the antagonisms which have come together in each hemisphere at the equator . We have only to follow back the record which their facts will bear upon them , and we may read their historical epochs just in the same order of existence , as the eternal principles in the reason would have prophesied their development . The Absolute Creator , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own insight , has seen the end that in knowing himself he has known was the most worthy of him , and for his own excellency 's sake he adopted it , and for his glory also he has taken that out of all possibles which the principles demanded , that in the highest wisdom he might consummate it . The facts have all been after their unchanging principles ; and the benevolence and righteousness of the end has not been by any arbitrary constituting of principles , but by an orderly constituting of facts , and bringing into existence a material creation with a nature that unmade and eternal principles determined for it . The glory of the Maker is , that the making has eternal reasons for it . 17 . Principles of Planetary Motion . - The principle determining the formation of world-systems includes within it that also for planetary motion , and we may here follow /z/ out such determination , and attain the three celebrated Kepler 's Laws , not as mere facts found and which have no higher explication , but which must so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Planets m/ust revolve in elliptical orbits . The rota tion of the primitive spheres , before the conjoint forces from the centre through the equatorial plane and between the two hemispherical pressures , must secure a translation of the superficial portion , more or less according to degree of adhesion and force of revolution , from the polar regions towards the equatorj and thus elevate by so much the equatorial portion of the sphere . While the rate of revolution gives a tangential force less than the gravitating or adhesive force at the equatorial surface , the whole mass must cohere and all rotate about one axis . But when the tangential force at the equator exceeds the gravitating force , there must come a disruption of a portion from the equatorial surface . This may include a thicker or thinner rim of the same consistency of substance , from the conditions of the hemispherical pressure or an interference of of its excess over cohesion , avail to project it beyond the circular track it had been describing in the equatorial circumference . By the force of its ejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of projectile above that of adhesive force may be to any given amount , but inasmuch as with the greatest degree of projectile impulse , the gravitating force toward the centre of the sphere must still act , so the ejected mass must be affected by it , and can not pass off in a /z/ completely tangential straight line , and must take the course of a curve somewhere within the tangent . If the excess of projectile force be to so great a degree , that when a point taken as a centre within the induced curve shall have lines drawn from this centre to the curve , and then reflected from the curve at the same angle to a tangent at that point , on the other side , which the incident line had with the tangent on this side , and these reflected lines shall also meet a line drawn perpendicularly to the axis of the curve at an angle greater than a right angle , then will that curve be thereby evinced to be a hyperhdUi and the planetary portion can not revolve in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the perpendicular to the axis at an angle equal to a right angle , then will that curve be thereby evinced to be a parzbol ( and the planetary mass still can not make a complete revolution . But if these reflected lines meet the perpendicular to the axis at an angle less than a right angle , then must they converge and meet somewhere in another point that shall be another focus to the curve , and thus make the curve to have as it were two centres , which will thereby evince that the curve is an ellipse and thus , as returning again into itself , the path will be a complete orbit , and the planet will perpetually revolve in it . Should the reflected lines come back in the incident lines to the same centre , this would thereby evince the curve to be an arc of a circle and such must of course be the orbit of the moving body in it . But the impossibility that the projected mass should take the curve that is the arc of a circle is manifest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projectile force /z/ was less than , or only equal to , the attractive force , it could not be ejected from the main sphere , and would in the equatorial surfece of that sphere describe an exact circle ; and that the excess of projectile force , which must eject it , must also to the same degree send it out of and beyond the circle it had been hitherto describing . It must therefore extend its curve beyond a circle if it become a separate planetary body , and it must not extend the curve to the hyperbola or parabola if it revolve at all in a complete orbit . It must therefore take on an elliptical orbit of greater or less eccentricity . This determined elliptical orbit , and the principle which must determine also the given eccentricity , may be followed in the order of its process . At the point of discession the planet must possess and retain with it a given constant measure of centrifogal force , which , as an excess above the gravitating or centripetal force , has detached it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equatorial circumference . The centripetal force gradually diminishes as this constant centrifugal force carries the planet outwards from the circle it had in the old circumference , and the planet must thus discede continually from the old centre until it has completed one-half of its revolution . But the centrifugal force is not sufficient to carry it by and beyond this culminating point , which would demand that it become a parabola or an hyperbola , and thus the centripetal force avails to bring it down from this point in the semi-revolution , and thence this centripetal force gradually augments through the other half of the revolution to the return in the old point of discession . The inferior apsis must be at the point of discession , and the superior apsis at // the opposite point of half a revolution , and the excess of the major over the minor axis must be proportional to the excess of the tangential or projectile impulse . It must be some form of the ellipse , for it must be outside of the old equatorial circle , and it must be inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into itself . ( 2 . ) JSach planet must describe equal sectors in equal times in its own orbit . When the primal sphere from whence the planet was separated rotated with the matter of the planet still adhering to the equatorial sur &ce,; each point in every radius in the equatorial plane out of the centre moved in a perfect circle , and each radius from the centre to any point within it , equally distant in all , described equal areas in equal times in the equal velocity of rotation . Since the planet has been thrown off , the projectile force that expelled it has gone with it and remained constant in it , and if the planet had continued to move in its old circular track , the velocity would still have been uniform , and thus its radius or line drawn from its own centre to the centre of revolution would still have described equal sectors in equal times . But according to the first principle of planetary motion , the excess of tangential over the gravitating force has necessarily given to its course an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rate of movement must be . variable through all portions of its revolution . This excess of tangential force must , however , exactly balance itself against the gravitating force in the resulting eccentricity of the orbit , and the whole periodic time of revolution must be the same as that of its last rotation in the circumference of the sphere before its ejection . That rotation was in a PJEtmOIPLBS OF PLANETAKY MOTION . 207 complete circle , and the radii all described equal sectors in equal times . The radius which the planet now carries with it , or the line from its occupied focus to its own centre , called the radius vector continually lengthens itself in the passage from the inferior to the superior apsis , in the exact proportion inversely as the velocity diminishes ; and then again contracts itself in- the passage from the superior to the inferior apsis , in its opposite semi-revolution , in the exact proportion inversely as the velocity increases . What is gained in the extent of the radius vector is exactly compensated in the retardation of the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lost in the contraction of the radius vector is also exactly compensated in the acceleration of the movement , and the whole periodic time of revolution is the same in the planetary ellipse as it was in the equatorial circle , and thus the circumference of the elliptical orbit is of the same extent as was that of the rotatifig equatorial circle . But the same extent of radius and arc of the circle have the same proportion to the whole area of the circle , that the like extent of radius vector and arc of the ellipse have to the whole area of the ellipse , and as these are described in equal times in both , and that of the circle is equal sectors in equal times , so that also of the ellipse must be equal sectors in equal times . ( 3 . ) The squares of the times of revolution must be as the cubes of the mean distances . If we . take a perfectly circular orbit , we may say that a given amount of force will secure that the planet shaU have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore in one minim of motion and one moment of time , one radius will have changed its place , by the revolution , for the place which its next /z/ contiguous radius had occupied in the plane of the orbit . But that the same force should carry the planet through its entire orbit , must demand that the same radius take the place successively of all the radii in so many minims of motion and moments of time . And now , as the whole area of the orbital plane is as the square of the radius , so the force is as the square of the minims of motion , and also as the square of the moments of time . A less or greater force , in carrying the planet through the same orbit , must have its proportionally less or greater moments of time , and a less or greater orbit with the same force must have its proportionally less or greater moments of time , and all differences of orbit with differences of force must have their proportional differences of moments of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orbit being given must determine the square of the time of revolution . Now the orbit may be constituted the same on three different conditions , viz. , as the revolution of a line about one of its ends , or the revolution of a circular plane of the same semi-diameter as the length of the line , or the revolution of a solid globe of the same diameter as the circular plane . But while in all these cases the orbits would be the same , in each case the forces must greatly differ one from another . When the planet is thrown from the end of the revolving line , it will move in the same orbit in the same time if the force is as the sum of all the points in the line , or , which is the same thing , as the length of the line . In this case the principle must be , that the squares of the times of revolution must be as the distances . K the planet be thrown off from the circumference of a rotating circular plane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLAlSrETARY MOTION . 209 orbit in the same time when the force is as the length of every line from the centre to the circmnference , or , as the same thing , the square of the distance . The principle in this case must therefore be , that the squares of the times of revolution must be aB the squares of the distances . But when a planet has been expelled from the equatorial surface of a sphere , although revolving in the same time within the same orbit , yet must its force have been far greater . Every radius of the sphere has thrown off its own portion , and here the principle must be as the cube of the distance , and we shall have the determined formula that the squares of the periodic times will be as the cubes of the distance . The determining forces of the universe in the central antagonist and diremptive working , exclude both the former principles , and give the latter as the third principle of planetary motion . Thus would it be in all cases of circular orbits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disceded from the primal sphere , and taken on its orbit of a more or less eccentric ellipse . In all cases , the corresponding of centrifrigal and centripetal forces must balance the distance from the centre with the rate of motion , and thus always for the entire revolution we must say of the mean distance in the ellipse what is true of the equal radii of the circle , that the squares of the times of revolution are as the cubes of the mean distances . It is worthy of remark , that planetary formations on either of the three conditions of an expulsion from a line , a circular plane , or a solid sphere , would each determine the same results in the first two principles of planetary motion , and give necessarily elliptical orbits , and equal /z/ sectors in equal times , but only planets thrown from the equatorial surice of a globe can make the squares of the periodic times as the cubes of the mean distances . 18 . Pbingiple of Light and of LuHENiFERoirs Bodies . - Should we conceive that light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminous source , we might have in this that which should impress the organ of vision , but we should have only the substance moved in radiation , and know nothing of . the radiating force . Or , should we conceive that this subtle substance was put in rapid and progresdve vibration , we should again have that which might make an impression upon the organ , but we should have only the matter vibrating , but not the force which put and keeps it in motion . We need to attarn the insight of some force that goes through the midst of the molecules in the primitive ether , and sets them in vibration and registers itself in their movement , before we can know what light is in its essential principle , or determine any of the necessary laws of its phenomena . The diremptive force is the essential principle of light as well as heat . This diremptive activity going out each way in the midst of antagonist forces , necessarily separates and isolates these molecular forces , and in permeating the enhered mass , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oblate form to every successive spherical layer , and thereby make every molecule in the layers successively to vibrate as they stand out in their direction and distance : om the centre , and thus the vibrations must be a radiation from the centre . Such diremptive vibrations we have ilrrnrlj noiiiiMnii as the principle of heat , and when the vibrati i /z/ given degree of intensity , breadth , and frequency , they will be essentially mere heat ; but this heat intensified to a certain higher degree of sharp and rapid vibration , becomes light . Heat and light are from , the one diremptive activity , and are thus one in their essence and general principle , but they differ in tension , breadth , and velocity , and in this difference of degree , " will be found all differences of determined phenomenal laws . We have now the conception of the multiplied worlds and systems , and these as floating , under the control of gravity , in the great ocean of the primitive ether which forms the grand universal sphere . This primitive ether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rendered fluid by the interfusion of the diremptive force between them . The formation of the worlds and systems has collected and conglomerated the chemical elements , and the whole chaotic matter has been thus used up and condensed in separate masses , and the purified ether stands in its own ensphered relation to its one grand centre , and Alls up all the interplanetary and interstellary spaces , and stretches itself out to the limits of the universe . The great central antagonist and diremptive activities hold on their steady and equal converse pressures , and thus this sea of the ethereal universe is perpetually tranquil and still . All the diremptive force in it is heat , held in static equilibration by its even surroundings of the antagonist molecular forces , and is thus wholly latent heat . There is much heat in chemical coilibination in the simple and compound substances of matter , and this heat is also fixed in the matter of the worlds which it helps to constitute , and thus the great amount of diremptive /z/ energy is held at rest in its reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the heat , which is tree and uncombined in the molten masses of the material worlds , is in a condition to radiate , and so &r; to make the primitive ether to vibrate . But in the midst of this general calm of the tmiverse since the progressive settling of the worlds into their forms and places , we now turn the rational insight specially to the new modifications of the antagonist forces in these separate worlds and systems , and we shall attain to some further immutable and eternal principles most interesting , and determining to very broad phenomenal results . So soon as the great chaotic mass of fused chemical materials for world-formations in the universal equatorial region , had been first thickened and then broken up by the crowding in of the augmenting central forces , and the various streams had been rounded into spiral circuits by the advance resistances , and these divided and condensed into separate wheeling spheres , then these separate spheres all had each its own centre , and every molecule in them at once had a polarity that was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the particular sphere was determined by the centre of the great universal sphere . This particular polarity and gravity for each molecule to its new centre , has been again modified by the expulsion of each new planet and satellite , and which have each had all their molecules turned in polarity and gravity to conform to their own new centres ; and yet all the particular globes of the same system have kept the one and same common centre for their general polarity and griavity . And especially , while the worlds of the system /z/ have had their one common centre , the ethereal molectdeti through all the spaces of that system have been turned and kept in their determined polarity and gravity by that centre . The primitive ether within the system has been ensphered about the eentre of the system , and we may regard it as a particular ethereal sphere separate altogether from the globes of chemically combined matter that float within it . Take , then , the ethereal sphere of any particular system , and which extends out from the centre , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of attraction reaches , and every molecular force of the antagonist activities is pressed out and presses back , just in proportion to its quantity of force or matter , and inversely to the square of its distance from the centre . Now when the central sun shall have thrown off all its planets , and settled itself in a sphere at the centre , its surface must take and sustain all this ethereal gravitation . . The diremptive force , which mingles in.it and so permeates it as to surround and isolate every antagonist molecular force , is " wholly imponderable ; its action is away from the centre , and is held from expansion to infinity only by the antagonist activities which meet and retain it ; the antagonisms only press back upon the centre , and thus the antagonist molecules only are ponderable , and all these through the sphere do press upon the sun 's surface . In this sphere of the ethereal fluid surrounding the central sun , we must regard only the antagonist forces as pressing back upon the body of the sun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve and make the whole to be fluid ether , if only the general S14 THE ETBBITAL PBINOIFLES OV THB ITlimrSBSB. pressure to the uniyersal centre were regarded , yet now with this new centre of the world-system and the pressure of the antagonist forces back upon it , the ether can not remain a wholly dissolved and everyway movable flnid . Tlie polar points , and equatorial rings , and spherical layers of the antagonist forces , all again stiffen into consistency and rigidity , by the gravity pressing back upon the central sun , and the heat-force . through all the ethereal sphere of the system is confined between the spherical layers , and thns an action must at once commence at the centre , or on the sun 's surface , that will send the diremptive forces in their alternate processes of prolate and dilate movement through the sphere , and on beyond till equalized by the outer resistance , and then the radiations can propagate themselves no further . The new direction of gravity to the centre of the system must at once make a new radiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether upon the sun 's surface , and the friction of the sim 's rotation in collision with it , must accumulate a large amount of the diremptive force about it , and which will at once be a perpetual source for outgoing streams of vibrating energy . Such diremptive generation and accumulation must be constant , and as the pressure is greatly intensified , so the vibrations are proportionally quickened and sharpened , and the heat becomes light , and the sun has its luminous atmosphere , and is the great centre of heat and Kght , as well as of gravity to its system . Its light and beat are as determinate principles as its gravity , yea , they are eternally determined in its gravity . Such a centre to a system can not be in the universal ether , but it will kindle /z/ its heat and light about it , and diffuse it abroad in perpetual vibrating radiations . This gravitating pressure at the centre is constant ; and the supply from the great ethereal universal sphere is exhaustless ; as the radiations go off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the great central pressure that makes and keeps that ocean fuU must work the diremptive forces back to the solar centre , through all the layers of the sphere that its gravity has formed about it , as the radiations go out and exhaust that which is in this centre ; and thus the solar light is perpetually replenished , and its radiations in successive vibratory movements continual , and the circuit of heat and light unbroken . The forces of gravity and the tangential repulsions must determine the rate of revolution , and thus the point at which the central body shall cease to throw off new planets , and must thus also determine the volume of the central sun , and this will regulate its amount of light . Before the last planets shall have been separated , and while the system-making sphere is yet of very considerable size , the forces of gravity in the ethereal fluid wiU begin to press upon its sur &ce; in sufficient intensity to wake and actuate the latent heat , and conmience the faint accumulations of a luminous atmosphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central body diminishes and the forces of gravity upon its surface augment , and thus light will have been generated , and day and night have been given to the planets already thrown o% before the sun as the permanent centre shall have been constituted . The morning twilight of creation must begin in the first kindling of light vtpoii /z/ the surface of the diminishing system-sphere , and beoome the perfect day when this system-sphere has become the central sun , and its full light reflected upon the planetary bodies shall make it and them to be ' lights in the firmament of heaven , to divide the day from the night , and to be for signs and for seasons and for days and years . " Were the central sun to diminish less than this due proportion determined by gravity and heat-force , both light and heat would become deficient . Every central sun must be such a luminiferous body , and while a sun to its own system , it must also be a star shining in its own light to all the other suns and worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planets will not be centres of gravity , giving intensity to the antagonist forces in awakening the latent heat sufficiently to make them self-luminous , though it may so be that some of the larger shall have their light increased by this self-production beyond the amount of reflection . The whole sphere of the system , and indeed the universal sphere of the primitive ether , is fiUed with static or latent heat , and thus the central radiation has not to pass in locomotion all through the interior and out to the circumference in its vibrations to propagate light ; the pulsar tion at the centre finds a plenum before it , and thus each throb moves the whole , and only the compressibility and elastic spring is to be estimated in the transmission of motion . The rapidity of light will be uniform and in almost inconceivable degrees . As radiating from a centre and thus diminishing its tifiion in the ratio of gravity , it must give its degree of intensity inversely to the extent of the subtending angular THE PBDSrOIPLB OF LIGHT . 217 line , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and size will diminish alike by distance , each being inversely to the square of the distance . A small body of proportionally intense light may appear equal in brightness , at the same distance , with a large body and less light . The principle of radiation in the vibrating movement from a centre being attained , it will at once determine what must be the phenomena . If the transmitted vibrations meet a substance that stops and absorbs them , such interposing substance must be opaque . If they readily pass through the substance , it must be transparent ; and if passing scantily and with difficulty , it must be merely translucent . If they strike some substance and are deflected in their course , they must thereby determine all the phenomena in reflection ; and in passing from a rarer into a denser medium , there must be refraction ; and if passing by the opaque edge of ian interposing body , there must be diffro/ction . If the substance transmit the opposite vibrations unequally , there must be double refraction ; and if a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be analyzed and spread its unequal vibrations through an elongated spectrum . Also , if a direct ray be reflected or refracted at a particular angle , and then be turned on its axis , it will have made one side of the vibrations to disappear , in turning the edges of their plane within the line of vision , and only the vibrations in the transverse plane can be apparent , and thus the radiation must be polarized ; and if one line of vibrations cross another , there must be alternate combination and neutralization , and thus the phenomena of interference . The principle being attained , the laws in the facts are a necessity . /z/ 19 . The Principles of Geological Forbcations. - AII worlds are constituted from some combinations of the two elemental forces , and while the circmnstances may somewhat modify the chemical compomiding , and vary in different worlds their material substances to a certain extent , yet must each world be essentially like the others , and the combination and collocation of its substances be peculiar only in the peculiar conditions to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general principles of this world-formation , and some of the peculiarities which certam of the worlds from their circumstances must possess , and we can in this have the principles of what may be termed a universal geology . The universe must have its particular systems , and the system must have its particular sun , planets , and satellites . All must have the same determinate principles of planetary revolution . The planets may condense in the cooling and conglomerating process unequally , but in the original throwing off , the outer planets must have been the rarer and the inner planets the denser , and such must continue to be their general state in their perpetual orbital positions . The central suns , from their perpetual atmosphere of heat and light , must condense the least from cooling . The particular world as a planet , will have the action of gravity concentrating all its matter by direct radial lines to the centre , and added thereto a tangential force in its rotation about its axis . This general action of gravity wiU bring the denser matter to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it , and thus secure that the matter in the first fluid formation will be ranged according to the universal law of a density in the inverse THB PBINOIPLES OF OEOLOGIOAL FOBMATIOlirS. 219 ratio to the square of the distance from the centre . Bat a rotary force will so modify this , that in addition to the direct concentration of gravity there will be the whirling moyement , wrapping layer over layer in concentric folds . The globe will thns form in concentric strata of perpetually increasing density to the centre , and with a tendency , when the mass may harden , to a cleavage in the direction between the strata , and to lines and fractures in the direction of gravity across the strata . The cooling process is the escaping of the superabundant and uncombined diremptive forces , which go off from the very nature and constitution of their existence , leaving the chemical combinations in the body to their unhindered strength of affinities , and thus the substance of the planetary world must become at length a solid globe of less or greater volume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crust above the frised matter becomes thicker , the outer strata press their weight upon the lower , and therefore from both the necessity of the heaviest being the lowest in a fluid state , and the outer pressing the inner in a solid state , the lower strata in position must be the densest and hardest , and the most compact crystals and sub-crystalline rocks will have their places nearest to the internal Are . The first geological formations must be plutonic , the crystallized and partially crystallized will underlie the composite , and the inner heat will at length be so confined and softened , that an atmosphere shall form , and the combination of water commence , and ultimately the wemerian geological process must begin . Disintegration and abrasion , and diluvial currents , will make their transpositions of substance , and // sedimentary deposita will make their various strata and vegetable and animal life begin , and their fossil remains become imbedded in the forming and successively overlying portions . The sea and air will alternate over the same places , and each make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface , and leave it to be read by future philosophical observers . The force of the inner fires , especially in any commingling with the expansible fluids and gases , must induce wide disruptions and upheavals , and the tilting and twisting of the superincumbent strata , and thus the sur &ce; of the planet must become broken into ridges and fissures , chasms and opening caves beneath the solid overlying portions ; and in the greater labors of the subterranean forces , mountains and valleys must be formed , and broad fields of the horizontal strata will be upturned , and give their outcropping edges to reveal the orders of nature 's ongoings for long geological cycles . These inner fires must often have their orifices opiing upwards to the surface , and the volcanic action from these open craters will give the index of the disturbances beneath ; and when obstructions to the volcanic vent occurs , or new explosions take place under the solid crust , there must come in connection all the violent tremblings and conmiotion of the earthquake . Continents will be lifted or depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sure necessarily take on all the modifications given to it by the movements of the ftised mass on which this superficial crust reposes. 20 . Thb Pkinciplb op CoiorrABT Bodies . - When the fluid and variously compounded matter , in its chaotic /z/ state , has been very generally taken up and wrought into revolving suns and systems by the pressure of the central forces , there must still be a residuum which has worked itself off from , or which has never been taken up by the wheeling worlds in their forming state , and which must be subject to the determination of these forces which are still working in the midst of it . Its combination chemically with the heat-force has given to it a different composition from the primitive ether , and a greater density and consistency , which forbid that it should blend and mingle with this ethereal matter now surrounding the ensphered worlds ; it must thus concentrate itself into many detached spherical bodies , and which must be of much greater rarity than the suns and planetary systems . These varied nebulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , yet in constant though diminished activity , and must also feel the attractions of any world to which they make an approach . As the universal ether thus clears itself by these nebulous condensations , an indefinite number of such rare bodies , larger and smaller , must be floating between the worlds . While thus flitting amid the open spaces , it must not unfrequently occur that some of these rare bodies will come within the attractions of some of the dense systems . The way for an entrance is open from any quarter , and the rate of velocity may be as various as the compound impulses which urge them on , but so soon as they come within the gravitating influence of any system , they must be sub ject to laws that we can frilly estimate , and we may very ftiUy apprehend the results that must be determined for them . As they come within any system , they must move /z/ towards , and ultimately fall into , or pass around , the central body of the system . In thus passing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following forms in the track which it makes ; either a hyperbola , a parabola , or an ellipse , the last of which may have so little eooentricity as to approach the form of a circle . When the compounded impulse and attraction shall give the hyperbolic path , the body must pass and recede from the central sun in a diverging course from that by which it entered , and as it leaves the system on an oppo site side from its entrance , its track must be perpetually divergent , and the action of its present forces can never lead , it back again within the same system . Should the compound agency determine a parabolic course , the entering body must also pass about the centre , and approach towards a parallel direction with the path it entered , and keep on its outward way in a perpetually receding journey . Many may so pass through and leave a particular system and though ever afterwards modified in direction and velocity by it , yet never again visit it . But when such a body shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the attractions it receives , /shall shape its track about the sun to an ellipse , it is then caught by the system , and must henceforth abide within it , unless some subsequent acceleration or retardation should induce its movement to one of the former curves . It may be anticipated that more will pass through a given system than will be caught and retained by it , but that many floating nebulae must so be arrested by particular planetary systems , the known conditions are too favorable foy sadh a result to permit that the acts should be doubted* /z/ Such as enter more nearly in the plane that conforms with the general planetary orbits , will meet the most in terfering forces , and be most likely to be kept within the system , and any particular system will have the greater probability that the larger number of such bodies which it takes into its company will be in orbits that are in the general plane of its planetary bodies . The conditions admit , however , that such bodies may become incorporated with the system from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct or retrograde compared with the revolving planets . The impulse that brings the body in must determine in composition with the attractions that the body finds , what eccentricity shall be given to the orbit , but the occasions are open for such orbits as shall be nearly conformed to the planets , or such as shall in extreme eccentricity bring their perihelion distance close upon the margin of the sun . Some may have their orbits fer within the system ; some only just within the orbits of the outer planets ; and some may stretch their orbits &r; beyond any circling world the system knows . All such bodies , occasional or constant , are properly comets. 21 . The Principle of Stellas Distribution . - A careful msight wiU determine from the working of the central forces how the stars must arrange themselves , and what the shapes and localities of the stellar fields , b &; truly as how the planets must be arranged in their respective systems , and what shapes the planets and their orbits must assume . The principle is of broader application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as thoroughly intelligible and readily explicable as the principles hich determine the bodies and their revolutions in the partioiilar planetary // system . We only need the corresponding care and patience in the investigation . When the two central forces work in unison , the antagonisms form and maintain in constant tension the spherical layers that enclose the centre , and which have their mutual counteracting pressure in their equators , and the diremptions pass out in the equatorial plane and down between these spherical layers to the poles , and keep the layers separate by this heat-force between them . If the diremptiye action become an exact balance to the antagonist action , these spherical layers become not only separated by the heat-force between them , but the heat-force permeates the layers themselves and just dissolves the molecular forces that constitute them , and thus the whole internal structure of the universal sphere becomes separable in all its molecules on every side , and is thoroughly a fluid . In this fluid but still quiescent because equally balanced state , the antagonist spherical layers and the diremptive separating forces between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the equatorial plane , and the universal sphere becomes a composite of two homogeneous hiemispheres , that antagonize altogether with each other in the equatorial plane , just as the semi-diameters from the poles antagonize with each other in the centre . A diremptive action , therefore , now going on at the centre and pushing out its divellent heatforces into the universal sphere , would not go through the alternate processes of polar prolation and oblation , as before this universal dissolution and fluidity of the molecular forces . The spherical layers being dissolved they could not each hold the diremption , first in the static polar point and turning it thereby to a transverse THE PSmOIPLE OF STELLAS DISTBIBTJTION. 225 action in the equatorial plane , and then turning the diremp tive force down between the next contiguous layers to fix another static polar point exterior to the first , and so on through all the layers successively , making a perpetual radiating vibration ; but the diremptive action , instead of taking this alternate leaping process from layer to layer , will now be able to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the compounding of the forces acting shall determine the direction of the movement . And precisely the direction which such diremptive movement must take is the one now to be determined and followed by the insight , for this going out of the perpetually generated central forces , both antagonist and diremptive in conjunction , into the fiuid molecules of the sphere , and thereby more densely filling up the ethereal matter , is the very process by which the chemically chaotic matter as elementary for the planetary systems with their central suns is to be constituted . The determining where in the universal sphere this chemical material is to be formed , must also be the determining where the systems and their suns must be that shall be formed out of it . We start , therefore , in this further investigation , with the universal matter in a perfectly fiuid and quiescent state , and with the perpetual generation of the antagonist and diremptive forces still going on at the centre , and their conjoined stream forcing itself out and penneating all through the ethereal fiuid , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , to determine where this thickening and augmentmg world-material must arrange itself , and become pressed into revolving suns and systems . The two hemispheres now antagonize and hold each other /z/ m a state of rest , by their balanced counteragency in their line of contact in the equatorial plane , and their whole fluid content is homogeneous . How then must the augmentations of the conjoined antagonist and diremptive forces at the centre , distribute and arrange themJselves ? The hemispherical pressure is generated in the reactions of the central antagonism , and in the aggregate must be as the cubes of the axes of the hemispheres . The greatest pressure , at any point in the equatorial plane , must be at the centre , where the hemispherical axes meet and counterwork each other ; and any point in the equatorial plane out of the centre must have its pressure inversely as the cube of its distance from the centre . So , also , the conjoined forces generated at the centre , and which are to go out against the hemispherical pressure and permeate the ethereal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the centre , and any points in the equatorial plane will also have the conjoined forces in them inversely as the cubes of their distances from the centre . The conjoined generated forces at the centre , so soon as they rise to any excess above the hemispherical pressure , must ftiove out into the ethereal fluid matter of the sphere according to the determinations of the compounding of these forces , viz. , the conjunct central antagonist and diremptive forces crowding out and the hemispherical pressure pushing in , and these will be equal at the centre , and of equal ratios at the same distances from the centre . We have only to follow such determinations , and the distribution of the world-material must be given . But this composition of the hemispherical pressure and the crowding out of the central conjoint forces is so compli- THE PSmOIPLE OF STELLAS BISTBIBITTION. /z/ cated , that we here first find the expediency of referring to a diagram , and will call to our aid the representations in the accompanying figure . Let M F W D be the bisection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the line of the equatorial plane is then M W. The hemispherical pressure is thus from the poles D and F and towards the centre C , and holding itself statically at rest in the whole line of the hemispherical junction at the equatorial plane M W. The greatest pressure is at C , and from the direction each way in the hemispherical axes D C and F C. Any point out of the centre will be one point in the circumference of a sphere of points about the centre , and thus have a pressure , compared with the pressure at the centre , inversely as the cube of its distance from the centre . On the other hand , the conjoint antagonist and diremptive forces , generated at C , crowd outward in the opposite // direction against the hemispherical pressure D C and F C , and when at all in excess must move out from the centre C. The greatest force of this outcrowding movement is in the source C , and any point out of the centre must have its outcrowding force , as compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its distance from the centre , since it must be a point in the surface of a sphere of points which have been crowded out from the centre . Take then the conjoint forces in their perpetual generation at the centre , and so soon as they rise to any excess of energy above the hemispherical pressure , there must be a movement out of the centre , the tendency of which will be in the direction of the equatorial plane M W all about the centre , and perpendicular to the hemispherical pressure at the centre . But as soon as there is an arising out of the centre , the hemispherical pressure diminishes on both the sides D and F , and there must be a parting of the conjoint forces on each side of the equatorial plane , and a compounding of one part with the hemispherical pressure on one side D , and a compounding of the other part with the hemispherical pressure on the other side F , and this composition of forces of equal ratios , inversely as the cubes of their distances from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensphering , by two spherical strata one on each side of the centre , of the compressed ethereal matter into two globes whose diameters shall be the two hemispherical axes D C and F C , Within these globes of the compressed ethereal fluid , the conjoint antagonist and diremptive forces can not crowd themselves , but must move and form their stratum , of the new elemental chaotic matter they now make , in these two enclosing hollow spheres D H C and F THE PSmCIPLB OF STELLAR DISTRIBTJTIOlir. 229 I C. The onward generation of these conjoint central forces must then make its movement out from the centre C , into the equatorial plane M W above the two spherical strata D H C and F I C , and ensphere them by a superimposed stratum upon each of them ; and thence onward again by other superimposed strata on each side , till there shall come , in the growing strata , an equilibration to the central generating energy , and the formations of further strata will then cease . The supel*incumbent strata can not be complete spheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till they come to the universal ' circumference , where they must be the periphery of the two hemispheres . For , take any point out of the centre in the equatorial plane , as E , and at that point both the hemispherical pressure and the outcrowding conjoint central forces have alike diminished , and are inversely as the cubes of their distance from the centre , and therefore the spherical strata E D E and E F E must be less each than a complete sphere , by the spherical arcs in each whose cords must respectively be double the distance E C , that is E E. And the same may be shown for any other points beyond E , as B and A , and thus on to the circumference M ; where the spherical strata on each side at B must be of a larger sphere than those at E , but a less portion of a complete sphere by the difference of an arc of a sphere whose cord is double the distance B C ; and on each side at A a still larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc of a longer cord that is double the distance A C ; and then at M the spherical stratum becomes the extent of the universal sphere , but less a complete sphere by the arc of a hemisphere , or an /z/ arc whose cord is double the distance M C. The whole thickening of the fluid ether and formation of the chemically chaotic world-material must be out of and beyond the two central globes of compressed ether D H C and F I C , and with the incumbent strata successively of enlarging spheres , but diminishing portions of the spheres till the hemispherical periphery is reached . When this matter has been made too dense for the conjoint central forces to penetrate it , then must the stream of these forces drive it into whirling spheres , and these spheres into suns and revolving systems , and the general planes of the orbits of the systems must be at right-angles to the tangents of these spherical strata , in which the impulse of the system-forming forces must move . The place for all stars and systems must therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or globes of pure compressed ether , D H C and F I C , and within the circuit of the universal sphere M F W D. The stellar strata must be the thickest near the centre , and diminish as they recede towards the universal surface ; and the greatest number of systems and their central suns must be in the neighborhood of the equatorial plane , and the stars pretty rapidly diminish in numbers as they stand back from the equatorial plane towards the /universal polar regions . Inasmuch also , as the outcrowding currents will not work the chaotic matter . into suns and systems , until they have driven it some distance back from the equatorial plane , so there must be a vacancy of stars on each side of the equatorial plane , diverging from the centre as the matter grows thinner , and represented in the figure by the waxing lines that fede away toward the confines of the imiverse. /z/ When the interstellary spaces are agam cleared from all but the primitive ether , the central forces , though not accumulating , will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floating stars into varied island groups , and their distance and positions must give to a spectator from any one , all the varied phenomena of stellar clusters , and unresolved nebulse , and changing position without revolving motion . /z/ XJp to this point we have followed the generating and arranging forces working in and from the centre , and stupendous as have been the results in the determinations of universal nature , they have still been merely mechanical and the same operations perpetuated endlessly can never lift themselves above the sphere of matter , nor produce any thing beyond material and mechanical changes in nature . How the universal cosmos may be originated , and how it must then be orderly and harmoniously xu : - ranged by the determinations of its central forces , and the wonderM beauty that comes out in the consummated structure , may all be apprehended in the rational process which we have so carefully and extensively pursued . Still the whole , vast and complicated yet orderly as it is , can be nothing but a magnificent machine ; its whole substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy is the preponderance of dynamic forces . We have the forces iii which matter is , and the pidnciples of their working determining what matter does , but all is mechanically pushed or puUed into its shape and proportions . /z/ This mechanism will work on in the worlds , and when the superficial strata have cooled and hardened to a permanent crust that admits collected gases to combine and . form themselves into vapors and mist , and these condensing in water , which , as superincumbent upon the solid earth , gathers itself into ocean beds , and then both land and water become enveloped by an atmosphere through which everywhere the radiations of light are reflected and diflused , there then comes an occasion for a higher order of existence than any chemical combinations or crystalline concretions can reach . The eternal archetypes of organic being are in the Absolute Reason as a distinct kind of existence , where the one activity is everywhere within itself both means and end , and making the whole to minister to each part as truly as each part ministers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consistency and satisfaction of reason itself , be somehow embodied in objective manifestation and actual realization . It behooves the Absolute Siirit for reason 's sake , or which is just the same meaning in other words , for the sake of his own glory , that he superinduce upon the forces now working in nature a higher force , that may take these mechanical forces into its service , and use them without destroying them for its own organific purposes . They can make exact combinations in all chemical substances , and build up layer by layer about a nucleus the geometrical solids of all crystalline bodies , but in all these cases the work goes on solely by accumulation of parts . The least portion of an earth , or metal , or crystal , is a unit as perfect in itself as the aggregation of the largest bodies , and no possible working of such forces in accumulation , can make the whole to be /z/ an organism , where no part is a nnit without the whole and the unity of the whole depends upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have originated from the empty void at first , as that now this new and higher form of existence in an organic being should come out of a nature which exists only in mechanical forces . From nothing , nothing comes ; out of material mechanism living organism can never arise . Organic existence should be , for reason sees that mechanical forces are incomplete without a superinduction of living forces ; the Absolute Spirit can not approve to himself his own work , nor rest satisfied in the glory of his own being , by stopping in his creating and governing agency with the material ; he must put the vital also within the material , and so overrule and use mechanical forces , that while they continue to be still matter , that matter shall no longer be an extrinsic combination , but an intrinsic living assimilation and incorporation . This new creating work is not now needed at the great centre of the universe . All that is material and mechanical gathers itself for its sustentation and direction immediately back within the great central working sources , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's substances and causes , it now needs that the Creator put his hand upon nature , and work his originar tions in the midst of the material elements that lie prepared upon the surface . That new creation must be such as shall vitalize and organize these material elements , and the task now is to gain so distinct an idea of this vital force , that while it shall fully discriminate itself from all antagonist and diremptive activities , it shall also be a sufficient /z/ ground for the insiglit of reason to see how the great principles of life and organization are determined necessarily and universally from it . As the antagonist force was more plainly read by the reason than the diremptive , so it may be anticipated that the organic forces will be more hidden than the mechanical - the principles of life will have a deeper mystery than those of gravity and magnetism , or even of heat and light , and must be longer studied before they can mature into a completed philosophy . 22 . Life an Assimilative Foece , - The Antagonist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterworks upon itself at every point , and thus doubles back each way upon itself on each side out of the point of antagonism . The diremptive activity is no force in itself beyond the mere point of diremption ; it outworks from itself in every point , and thus discedes and disparts from itself on each side out of the point of the divellent action . Were it to work in a void , it could never fill it , but must perpetually be leaping each way from the points occupied . Diremptive forces , working in and among antagonist forces , become truly determinable forces , for they are held and work in determinate spaces by the antagonisms they are perpetually encountering . There may thus be perpetual solution and combination , resolution and recombination , through all time , and to as great a variety as the arithmetical permutation of given quantities in the directions and degrees of energy shall permit . But the activity we now seek in idea must be one that can use these for its own ends , and while it makes them work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them which it uses , so as to make them to become the common members of the one /z/ complete organism . In a word , we must have an agency that can take the material agents to itself , and assimilate them to each other in itself , and so state or posit them in continuation that while it shall be their builder , they shall become its body , and both together constitute an existence that has unity and identity throughout . It must draw that which is without itself into itself , and incorporate it with itself , and thus truly it will organize itself in living matter . That which takes to itself or draws in from without , must originate a movement to which the without may be a condition or an occasion , but for which it can not be a cause . There must be indrawing before there can be exhausting ; the spontaneity of the organific agency must thus be on the inside . The living force must first act , or the mechanical forces can never become assimilated and incorporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but can never else be made to interpenetrate each other . We take then a simple spiritual activity , of which we can predicate in itself neither extension nor duration , for it has no where in order that we might determine place , and no w ? ien in order that we might determine period ; but we put it into the midst of nature 's space-filling and timeduring forces , and let it register its action in them , and we can determine for it both a space and a time . Itself spiritual , and perpetually in itself maintaining its own simplicity of agency , and thus wholly incognizable by any sense , its working upon the material forces that impress themselves upon the senses , gives its results in matter to become phenomenal , and thus the modifications which the living force makes of matter , may be readily subject to /z/ human experience . To the reason 's eye , we must therefore subject this spiritual life-force , that we may therein determine the principles of its modification of matter , and the conditions under which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This simple spiritual activity can in itself fix upon no place , nor hold itself in any position , and it may thus be said to have a want , and must necessarily act for its supply , and thus seek some of the material forces - against which it may work and balance and sustain itself . Though all unconscious of its wants and of the adaptations in noaterial forces for its supply and relief , yet will the activity go out spontaneously to its appropriate material forces as if it had already a sentient guide and directory . Some of the material forces in nature will be fit for its use , and will readily combine with it , and thus fix it in position by counter-working with it and truly becoming assimilated in it . In thus combining with the life-force , the material force will part with some of its own activities , and become thereby new substance in its assimilation and combination with the living spiritual activity ; and leaving also the activities in the forces used , which become liberated in the vital combination , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will thereby change also the substances in material nature . There wiU thus be truly a vital chemistry , both in the new living combinations , and in the changed combinations in matter from the unused activities liberated in the vital action , and recombining with the material forces about them . It is , however , only with the combinations immediately made with the vital activity , that we now need to have any dealing . The /z/ spiritual activity combines with such material activities as it finds fitted to its want , and thus fixes itself to them and in them , and they become a new substance by being thus taken up in the life-force . Matter and spirit are in this truly blended , and the life-force is no longer merely spiritual activity , and the matter is no longer mere gross mechanism , but this third thing as a mere substance is indifferently , either life embodied or matter vitalized . This vitalizing and thus assimilating and corporealizing process necessarily makes new voids in the old material forces . The life-force has taken in and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has used , and thereby a vacuum at once supervenes between the living corpuscle and the mechanical molecule , and the forces of nature must at once press up and bring new matter to th &; living action , which is also used in new living combinations and thus the living body continually feeds upon these new materials and grows by their successive assimilations and incorporations . As an activity combining with the material forces and taking them up into itself , the vital action may be termed an assimilative force / and as thus making a void for external nature to pass through up to the working activity , it may be known as an indrawing or an inhaustive force and either may hereafter be applied as the particular application may determine to be the most appropriate . The assimilating is truly the work of the life-force , and is first ; the void thus made becomes the occasion for the indrawing , and which is truly nothing but the inpressing of nature , and thus the life-force uses nature in two ways , both for its own want in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in making the material mole- /z/ cnles to press themselves through the voids made by former assunilations up to the spiritual activity , and thereby supply new material for further assimHation and growth . And inasmuch as the life-force works spontaneously for its own wants , so in this must it be an agent working toward ends , and determined in its activity by just the wants and therefore the ends inherent in it . And this must make it a formative force , having a niaiLa formatimis or form-making principle in the spiritual activity itself The Ibrm in the rain-drop , and in the crystal , is in all the many drops of the shower and in all the many portions of the crystal , but the form in the living body is one already in the life-force , and works itself out and registers itself in the fiving body . All living forms are thus determined in the specific life-force , and the whole body must be built up as a self-realizing product of the spirit . General resemblances may enable to classify living bodies into their kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genus . These classifications rest on extrinsic and contingent relationships , but where the distinction is that of type in the primitive vital force , and which is brought out in manifestation in the progenitor , and is individually carried down through all the descendants , the classification is then of specific differences and not of general resemblances , and is first into different species , these species into different races , and these into different varieties . When the specific life-force is once embodied in its organized material assimilations , it must keep on ever working in the same body , growing as it extends itself in new combinations , and when these augmented combinations have extended so far as to equalize the assimilative force , /z/ and balance the new assimilations only against the old absorptions and exclusions , the body has then come to its adult and mature stature , and while ceasing its growth it will perpetuate its form and proportions . When the balance turns against the life-force , and from diseaso or age the assimilations can not repair the lesions , the body must decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used the material forces , so in all cases of partial or total disembodiment , the material forces again take on their old imhindered working , and what was living body becomes again dead mechanical matter , and &lls; into the conditioned successions and changes of its old mechanical forces , and we have death and dissolution . But as the death and dissolution of the individual occurs , provision must be made for the generation of successors and thereby the perpetuation of the species . From the ancestral stock there must be the setting off an instalment of the life force in a new germ , and which may begin its own process of assimilation and growth , and instead of stating or positing itself in its parental body , may separate itself wholly from that , and biiild up to maturity its own independent body , and thus the species propagate its successive generations . In order to such generation , the principle of sex is necessary . The life-force in the one sex must go over into some prepared receptacle of congenial nourishment from the other sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offspring . Nor is it consistent with the demands of reason that the original types of organic being should be marred and confounded by a promiscuous generation , and the necessities of nature will also second this demand of reason , for the receptacle afforded by one /z/ gender in a species can not contain the appropriate nonridi ment for the living force imparted by the other gender in a different species , and hence opposite sexes in different species should not and can not procreate , or if they do for once , the hybrid progeny must be barren . The indiyidnals must have their separate gender , the species lives on in the generations of both its own sexes . Life must thus work on in cycles , and each species perpetuate itself in the perpetual propagation of new individuals . The propagated life-force , though beginning a new assimilation and incorporation of its own , will be still slowly exhausting the original energy , and thus at last the species must die out in the deterioration of its members , and new species must be put again into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical combinations in the world of matter around them . 23 . The Principle op Vegetable Life . - The life-force is in itself a spiritual activity which works according to wants , and therefore in reference to ends , and is first an assimilative force by virtue of its combining other forces in it , and then consequently an indrawing or inhaustive force by occasion of the vacuum which the vital combination secures between the living corpuscle and the material molecules about it , and the forcing in of these material molecules upon the point of vital action by their own inherent antagonist working , and thus affording a perpetual supply to the life-force for perpetual assimilations . Such combination of the life-force with the material forces thus brought into concretion becomes a germ , and has in it and with it all the elements and rudiments of the future mature organism . The life-force can make no possible manifesta-
