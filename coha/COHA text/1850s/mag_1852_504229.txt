people for their invaders . The army , imbibing the politic sentiments of their general , refrained from all acts of lawless violence , and amazed the enslaved populace by their justice , mercy , and generosity . The people were immediately liberated from the most grinding and intolerable despotism ; just and equal laws were established ; and Arab and Copt , soon began , lost in wonder , to speak the praises of Napoleon . He was a strange conqueror for the East ; liberating and blessing , not enslaving and robbing the vanquished . Their women were respected , their property was uninjured , their persons protected from violence , and their interests in every way promoted . A brighter day never dawned upon Egypt than the day in which Napoleon placed nis foot upon her soil . The accomplishment of his plans . so far as human vision can discern , would have been one of the greatest of possible blessings to the East . Again Napoleon issued one of those glowing proclamations which are as characteristic of his genius as were the battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be told , by our enemies , that I am come to destroy your religion . Believe them not . Tell them that I am come to restore your rights , punish your usurpers , and revise the true worship of Mohammed . Tell them that I venerate , more than do the Mamelukes , God , his prophet , and the Koran . Tell them that all men are equal in the sight of God ; that wisdom , talents , and virtue alone constitute the difference between them . And what are the virtues which distinguish the Mamelukes , that entitle them to appropriate all the enjoyments of life to themselves If Egypt is their farm , let THE DISEMBARKATION. // them show their lease , from God , by which they hold it . Is there a fine estate it belongs to the Mamelukes . Is there a beautiful slave , a fine horse , a good house all belong to the Mainelakes . But God is just and merciful , and He hath ordained that the empire of the Mamelukes shall come to an end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall prosper in their fortune and their rank . Happy they who shall be neutral ; they will have time to become acquainted with us , and will range themselves upon our side . But woe , threefold woe to those who shall arm for the Mamelukes and fight against us . For them there will be no hope ; they shall perish . " " You witlings of Paris , " wrote one of the officers of the army , " will laugh outright , at the Mohammedan proclamation of Napoleon . He , however , is proof against all your raillery , and the proclamation itself has produced the most surprising effect . The Arabs , natural enemies of the Mameltikes , sent us back , as soon as they had read it , thirty of our people , whom they had made prisoners , with an offer of their services against the Mamelukes . " It was an interesting peculiarity in the character of Napoleon that he respected all religions as necessities of the human mind . He never allowed himself to speak in contemptuous terms even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him only as exhibited by the papal church . He professed the most profound admiration of the doctrines and the moral precepts of the gospel , and often expressed the wish that he could be a devout believer . But he could not receive , as from God , all that Popes , Cardinals , Bishops , and Priests claimed as divine . In the spiritual power of the Pope he recognized an agent of tremendous efficiency . As such he sincerely respected it , treated it with deference , and sought its alliance . He endeavored to gain control over every influence which could sway the human heart . So of the Mohammedans ; he regarded their religion as an element of majestic power , and wished to avail himself o*it . While the philosophers and generals around nun regarded all forms of religion with contempt , he , influenced by a far higher philosophy , regarded all with veneration . Since the revolution there had been no sort of worship in France . The idea even of a God had been almost entirely obliterated from the public mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as depraved instincts . At the command of their beloved chieftain , they were as ready to embrace a religion as to storm a battery . Napoleon was accused of hypocrisy for pursuing this course in Egypt . " I never , " said he , subsequently , " followed any of the tenets of the Mohammedan religion . I never prayed in the mosques . I never abstained from wine , or was circumcised . I said merely that we were friends of the Mussulmans , and that I respected their prophet ; which was true . ii respect him now . " Napoleon remained in Alexandria but six days . During this time he devoted himself with a zea. and energy which elicited universal admiration , to the organization of equitable laws , the regulations of police , and the development of the resources of the country . The very hour of their establishment in the city , artisans , and artists , and engineers all were busy , and the life and enterprise of the West , were infused into the sepulchral streets of Alexandria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fortifications , erecting mills , estabhaling manufactories , founding schools , exploring antiquities , and the government of the country was placed in the hands of the prominent inhabitants , who were interested to promote the wise and humane policy of Napoleon . Since that day half a century of degradation , ignorance , poverty , oppression , and wretchedness has passed over Egypt . Had Napoleon succeeded in his designs , it is probable that Egypt would now have been a civilized and a prosperous laud , enriched by the commerce of the East and the West ; with villas of elegance and refinement embellishing the meadows and headlands of the Nile , and steamers , freighted with the luxuries of all lands , plowing her majestic waves . The shores of the Red Sea , now so silent and lonely , would have echoed with the hum of happy industry , and fleets would have been launched from her forests , and thriving towns and opulent cities would have sprung up , where the roving Bedouin now meets but desolation and gloom . It is true that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been disappointed . But it is certain that while Napoleon remained in Egypt the whole country received an impulse unknown for centuries before ; and human wisdom can not devise a better plan than he proposed , for arousing the enterprise , and stimulating the industry , and developing the resources of the land . About thirty of the French troops fell in the attack upon Alexandria . Napoleon , with his prompt conceptions of the sublime , caused them to be buried at the foot of Pompey 's Pillar , and had their names engraven upon that monument whose renown has grown venerable through countless ages . The whole army assisted at the imposing ceremony of their interment . Enthusiasm spread through the ranks . The French soldiers , bewildered by the meteor glare of glory , and deeming their departed comrades now immortalized , envied their fate . Never did conqueror better understand than Napoleon what springs to touch , to rouse the latent energies of human nature . Leaving three thousand men in Alexandria , under the command of General Kleber , who had been wounded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his army , to cross the desert to Cairo . The fleet was not in a place of safety , and Napoleon gave emphatic orders to Admiral Brueys to remove the ships , immediately after landing the army , from the bay of Aboukir , where it was anchored , into the harbor of Alex . andria ; or , if the large ships could not enter that port , to proceed , without any delay , to the island // of Corfu . The neglect , on the part of the Admiral , promptly to execute these orders , upon which Napoleon had placed great stress , led to a disaster which proved fatal to the expedition . Napoleon dispatched a large flotilla , laden with provisions , artillery , ammunition , and baggage , to sail along the shore of the Mediterranean to the western branch of the Nile , called the Rosetta mouth , and ascend the river to a point where the army , having marched across the desert , would meet it . The flotilla and the army would then keep company , ascending the Nile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a desert of sixty miles to cross . It was dreary and inhospitable in the extreme . A blazing sun glared fiercely down upon the glowing sands . Not a tree or a blade of grass cheered the eye . Not a rivulet trickled across their hot and sandy path . A few wells of brackish water were scattered along the trackless course pursued by the caravans , but even these the Arabs had filled up or poisoned . Early on the morning of the 6th of July the army commenced its march over the apparently boundless plain of shifting sands . No living creature met the eye but a few Arab horsemen , who occasionally appeared and disappeared at the horizon , and who , concealing themselves behind the sand hills , immediately murdered any stragglers who wandered from the ranks , or from sickness or exhaustion loitered behind . Four days of inconceivable suffering were occupied in . *rossing the desert . The soldiers , accustomed to the luxuriance , beauty , and abundance of the valleys of Italy , were plunged into the most abject depression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lannes and Murat , in paroxysms of despair , dashed their hats upon the sand , and trampled them under foot . Many fell and perished on the long and dreary route . But the dense columns toiled on , hour after hour , weary , and hungry , and faint , and thirsty , the hot sun blazing down upon their unsheltered heads , and the yielding sands burning their blistered feet . At the commencement of the enterprise Napoleon had promised , to each of his soldiers , seven acres of land . As they looked around upon this dreary and boundless ocean of sand , they spoke jocularly of his moderation in promising them but seven acres , " The young rogue , * ' said they , " might have safely offered us as much as we chose to take . We certainly should not have abused his good-nature . " Nothing can show more strikingly the singular control which Napoleon had obtained over his army , than the fact that under these circumstances , no one murmured against him . He toiled along on foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most humble soldiers . Like them he threw himself upon the sands at night , with the sand for his pillow , and , secreting no luxuries for himself , he ate the coarse beans which afforded the only food for the army . He was ever the last to fold his cloak around him for the night , and the first to spring from the ground in the morning . The soldiers bitterly cursed the government who had sent them to that land of barrenness and desolation . Seeing the men of science stopping to examine the antiquities . they accused them of being the authors of the expedition , and revenged themselves with // witticisms . But no one uttered a word against Napoleon . His presence overawed all . He seemed to be insensible to hunger , thirst , or fatigue . It was observed that while all others were drenched with perspiration , not a drop of ' moisture oozed from his brow . Through all the hours of this dreary march , not a word or a gesture escaped him , which indicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of discontented officers , and said to them , in tones of firmness which at once brought them to their senses , " You are holding mutinous language ! beware ! It is not your being six feet high which will save you from being shot in a couple of hours . " In the midst of the desert , when gloom and despondency had taken possession of all hearts , unbounded joy was excited by the appearance of a lake of crystal water , but a few miles before them , with villages and palm trees beautifully reflected in its clear and glassy depths . The parched and panting troops rushed eagerly on , to plunge into the delicious waves . Hour after hour passed , and they approached no nearer the elysium before them . Dreadful was their disappointment when they found that it was all an illusion , and that they were pursuing the mirage of the dry and dusty desert . At one time Napoleon , with one or two of his officers , wandered a little distance trom the main body of his army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , watched his movements , but for some unknown reason , when he was entirely in their power , did not harm him . Napoleon soon perceived his peril , and escaped unmolested . Upon his return to the troops , peacefully smiling , he said , " It is not written on high , that I am to perish by the hands of the Arabs . " As the army drew near the Nile the Marmeluke horsemen increased in numbers , and in the frequency and the recklessness of their attacks . Their appearance and the impetuosity of their onset was most imposing . Each one was mounton a fleet Arabian steed , and was armed with pistol , sabre , carbine , and blunderbuss . The carbine was a short gun which threw a small bullet with great precision . The blunderbuss was also a short gun , with a large bore , capable of holding a number of balls , and of doing execution without exact aim . These fierce warriors accustomed to the saddle almost from infancy , presented an array indescribably brilliant , as , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banners , and gold-spangled robes , in meteoric splendor , with the swiftness of the wind , they burst from behind the sand hills . Charging like the rush of a tornado , they rent the air with their hideous yells , and discharged their carbines , while in full career , and halted , wheeled , and retreated with a precision and celerity which amazed even the most accomplished horsemen of the army of Italy . The extended sandy plains were exactly adapted to the maneuvres of these flying herds . The least motion , or the slightest breath of wind , raised a cloud of dust , blinding , choking , and smothering the French , but apparently presenting no annoyance either to the Arab rider or to his horse . If a weary straggler loitered a few steps behind the toiling column , or if any soldiers ventured to leave the ranks in pursuit of the Mamelukes in their bold attacks , certain and instant death was encountered . A wild troop , enveloped in clouds of dust , like spirits from another world , dashed upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and disappeared in the desert , almost before a musket could be leveled at them . After five days of inconceivable suffering the long-wished-for Nile was seen , glittering through the sand hills of the desert , and bordered by a fringe of the richest luxuriance . The scene burst upon the view of the panting soldiers like a vision of enchantment . Shouts of joy burst from the ranks . All discipline and order were instantly forgotten . The whole army of thirty thousand men , with horses and camels rushed forward , a tumultuous throng , and plunged , in the delirium of excitement , into the waves . They luxuriated , with indescribable delight , in the cool and refreshing stream . They rolled over and over in the water , shouting and frolicking in wild joy . Reckless of consequences , they drank and drank again , as if they never could be satiated with the delicious beverage . In the midst of this scene of turbulent and almost frenzied exultation , a cloud of dust was seen in the distance , the trampling of hoofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mameluke horsemen , on fleet Arabian chargers , came sweeping down upon them , like the rush of the wind , their sabres flashing in the sunlight , and rending the air with their hideous yells . The drums beat the alarm ; the trumpets sounded , and the veteran soldiers , drilled to the most perfect mechanical precision , instantly formed in squares , with the artillery at the angles , to meet the foe . In a moment the assault , like a tornado , fell upon them . But it was a tornado striking a rock . Not a line wavered . A palisade of bristling bayonets met the breasts of the horses , and they recoiled from the shock . A volcanic burst of fire , from artillery and musketry , rolled hundreds of steeds and riders together in the dust . The survivors , wheeling their unchecked chargers , disappeared with the same meteoric rapidity with which they had appror*ched . The flotilla now appeared in sight , having arrived at the destined spot at the precise hour designated by Napoleon . This was not accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and extent of information , which had enabled Napoleon perfectly to understand the difficulties of the two routes , and to give his orders in such a way , that they could be , and would be obeyed . It was remarked by Napoleon 's generals , that during a week 's residence in Egypt , he acquired apparently as perfect an acquaintance with the country as if it had been his native land . The whole moral aspect of the army was now changed , with the change in the aspect of the country . The versatile troops forgot their sufferings , and , rejoicing in abundance , danced and sang , beneath the refreshing shade of sycamore . // and palm trees . The fields were waving with luxuriant harvests . Pigeons were abundant . The most delicious watermelons were brought to the camp in inexhaustible profusion . But the villages were poor and squalid , and the houses mere hovels of mud . The execrations in which the soldiers had indulged in the desert , now gave place to jokes and glee . For seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admiring the fertility of the country , and despising the poverty and degradation of the inhabitants . They declared that there was no such place as Cairo , but that the " Little Corporal , " had suffered himself to be transported like a good boy , to that miserable land , in search of a city even more unsubstantial than the mirage of the desert . On the march Napoleon stopped at the house of an Arab sheik . The interior presented a revolting scene of squalidness and misery . The proprietor was however reported to be rich . Napoleon treated the old man with great kindness and asked , through an interpreter , why he lived in such utter destitution of all the comforts of life , assuring him that an unreservcd answer should expose him to no inconvenience . He replied , " some years ago I repaired and furnished my dwelling . Information of this was carried to Cairo , and having been thus proved to be wealthy , a large sum of money was demanded from me by the Mamelukes , and the bastinado was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which bear witness to what I endured . From that time I have reduced myself to the barest necessaries , and no longer seek to repair any thing . " The poor old man was lamed for life , in consequence of the mutilation which his feet received from the terrible infliction . Such was the tyranny of the Mamelukes . The Egy'ptians , in abject slavery to their proud oppressors , were compelled to surrender their wives , their children , and even their own persons to the absolute will of the despots who ruled them . Numerous bands of Mameluke horsemen , the most formidable body of cavalry in the world , were continually hovering about the army , watching for points of exposure , and it was necessary to be continually prepared for an attack . Nothing could have been more effective than the disposition which Napoleon made of his troops to meet this novel mode of warfare . He formed his army into five squares . The sides of each square were composed of ranks six men deep . T.he artillery were placea at the angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the points of attack . The generals , the scientific corps , and the baggage were in the centre . These squares were moving masses . When on the march all faced in one direction , the two sides marching in flank . When charged they immediately halted and fronted on every side ; the outermost rank kneeling that those behind might shoot over their heads  --  the whole body thus presenting a living fortress of bristling bayonets . When they were to carry a position the three front ranks were to detach themselves VOL . IY-No. 20. -M from the square and to form a column of attack . The other three ranks were to remain in the rear , still forming the square , ready to rally the column . These flaming citadels of fire set at defiance all the power of the Arab horsemen . The attacks of the enemy soon became a subject of merriment to the soldiers . The scientific men , or savans , as they were called , had been supplied with asses to transport their persons and philosophical apparatus . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the order was given , with military precision , " form square , sevens and asses in the centre . " This order was echoed , from rank to rank , with peals of laughter . The soldiers amused themselves with calling the asseb demi-savans . Though the soldiers thus enjoyed their jokes , thay cherished the highest respect for many of these savans , who in scenes of battle had manifested the utmost intrepidity . After a march of seven days , during which t. ime they had many bloody skirmishes with the enemy , the army approached Cairo . Mourad Bey had there assembled the greater part of his Mamelukes , nearly ten thousand in number , for a decisive battle . These proud and powerful horsemen were supported by twenty - four thousand foot soldiers , strongly intrenched . Cairo is on the eastern banks of the Nile Napoleon was marching along the western shore . On the morning of the 21st of July , Napoleon , conscious that he was near the city , set his army in motion before the break of day . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers beheld the lofty minarets of the city upon their left , gilded by its rays , and upon the right , upon the borders of the desert , the gigantic pyramids rising like mountains upon an apparently boundless plain . The whole army instinctively halted and gazed awe-stricken upon those monuments of antiquity . The face of Napoleon beamed with enthusiasm . " Soldiers ! " he exclaimed , as he rode along the ranks ; " from those summits forty centuries contemplate your actions . " The ardor of the soldiers was aroused to the highest pitch . Animated by the clangor of martial bands , and the gleam of flaunting banners , they advanced with impetuous steps to meet their foes . The whole plain before them , at the base of the pyramids was filled with armed men . The glittering weapons of ten thousand horsemen , in the utmost splendor of barbaric chivalry , brilliant with plumes and arms of burnished steel and gold , presented an array inconceivably imposing . Undismayed the French troops , marshaled in five invincible squares , press ed on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those intrenchments , behind which twenty-four thousand men were stationed with powerful artillery and musketry to sweep his ranks , and a formidable body of term thousand horsemen , on fleet and powerful Arabian steeds , awaiting the onset , and ready to seize upon the slightest indications of confusion to plunge , with the fury which fatalism can inspire , upon his bleeding and mangled squares . It must have been with Napoleon a moment of intense anxiety . But as he sat upon his horse. , in the // centre of one of the squares , and carefully examined , with his telescope , the disposition of the enemy , no one could discern the slightest trace of uneasiness . His gaze was long and intense . The keenness of his scrutiny detected that the guns of the enemy were not mounted upon carriages , and that they could not therefore he turned from the direction in which they were placed . No other officer , though many of them had equally good glasses , made this important discovery . He immediately , by a lateral movement , guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his squares might he out of the range of the guns , and that he might attack the enemy in flank . The moment Mourad Bey perceived this evolution , he divined its object , and with great military sagacity resolved instantly to charge . " You shall now see us , " said the proud Bey , " cut up those dogs , like gourds . " It was , indeed , a fearful spectacle . Ten thousand horsemen , magnificently dressed , with the fleetest steeds in the world , urging their horses with bloody spurs . to the most imoetuous and furious onset , rending the heavens with their cries , and causing the very earth to tremble beneath the thunder of iron feet , came down upon the adamantine host . Nothing was ever seen in war more furious than this charge . Ten thousand horsemen is an enormous mass . Those longest inured to danger felt that it was an awful moment . It seemed impossible to resist such a living avalanche . The most profound silence reigned through the ranks , interrupted only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused to the utmost tension , every order was executed with most marvelous rapidity and precision . The soldiers held their breath , and with bristling bayonets stood , shoulder to shoulder , to receive the shock BATTLE OF THE PYRAMIDS . // NAPOLEON BONAPARTE . The moment the Mamelukes arrived within gunshot , the artillery , at the angles , plowed their ranks , and platoons of musketry , volley after volley , in a perfectly uninterrupted flow , swept into their faces a pitiless tempest of destruction . Horses and riders , struck by the balls , rolled over each other , by hundreds , in the sand , and were trampled and crushed by the iron hoofs of the thousands of frantic steeds , envdoped in dust and smoke , composing the vast and impetuous column . But the squares stood as firm as the pyramids at whose base they fought . Not one was broken ; not one wavered . The daring Mamelukes , in the frenzy of their rage and disappointment , threw away their lives with the utmost recklessness . They wheeled their horses round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might kick their way into those terrible fortresses of living men . Rendered furious by their inability to break the ranks , they hurled their pistols and carbines at the heads of the French , The wounded crawled along the ground , and with their scimitars , cut at the legs of their indomitable . foes . They displayed superhuman bravery , the only virtue which the Mamelukes possessed . But an incessant and merciless fire from Napoleon 's well-trained battalions continually thinned their ranks , and at last the Mamelukes , in the wildest disorder , broke , and fled . The infantry , in the intrenched camp , witnessing the utter discomfiture of the mounted troops , whom they had considered invincible , and seeing such incessant and volcanic sheets of flame bursting from the impenetrable squares , caught the panic , and joined the flight . Napoleon now , in his turn , charged with the utmost impetuosity . A scene of indescribable confusion and horror ensued . The extended l ) lain was crowded with fugitives-foot*nen and horsemen , bewildered with terror , seeking escape from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavored to escape by swimming to the opposite shore . But a shower of bullets , like hail stones , fell upon them , and the waves of the Nile were crimsoned with their blood . Others sought the desert , a wild and rabble rout . The victors , with their accustomed celerity pursued , pitilessly pouring into the dense masses of their flying foes the most terrible discharges of artillery and musketry . The rout was complete  --  the carnage awful . The sun had hardly reached the meridian , before the whole embattled host had disappeared , and the plain as far as the eye could extend , was strewn with the dying and the dead . The camp , with all its Oriental wealth , fell into the hands of the victors ; and the soldiers enriched themselves with its profusion of splendid shawls , magnificent weapons , Arabian horses , and purses filled with gold . The Mamelukes were accustomed to lavish great wealth in the decorations of their persons , and to carry with them large sums of money . The gold and the trappings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve hundred to two thousand dollars . Besides those who were slain upon the field , more than a thousar 'd of these formidable horsemen were drowned in the Nile . For many days the soldiers employed themselves in fishing up the rich booty , and the French camp was filled with all abundance . This most sanguinary battle cost the French scarcely one hundred men in killed and wounded . More than ten thousand of the enemy perished . Napoleon gazed with admiration upon the bravery which these proud horsemen displayed . " Could I have united the Mameluke horse to the French infantry , " said he , " I should have reckoned myself master of the world . " After the battle , Napoleon , now the undisputed conqueror of Egypt , quartered himself for the night in the country palace of Mourad Bey . The apartments of this voluptuous abode were embellishe4 with all the appurtenances of Oriental lux. ury . The officers were struck with surprise in viewing the multitude of cushions and divans covered with the finest damasks and silks , and ornamented with golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgence of these haughty despots . Much of the night was passed in exploring this singular mansion . The garden was extensive and magnificent in the extreme . Innumerable vines were laden with the richest grapes . The vintage was soon gathered by the thousands of soldiers who filled the alleys and loitered in the arbors . Pots of preserves , of confectionery , and of sweetmeats of every kind , were quickly devoured by an army of mouths . The thousands of little elegancies which Europe , Asia , and Africa had contributed to minister to the voluptuous splendors of the regal mansion , were speedily transferred to the knapsacks of the soldiers . The " Battle of the Pyramids , " as Napoleon characteristically designated it , sent a thrill of terror , far and wide , into the interior of Asia and Africa . These proud , merciless , licentious oppressors were execrated by the timid Egyptians , but they were deemed invincible . In an hour they had vanished , like the mist , before the genim ' of Napoleon . The caravans which came to Cairo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the embellishments of Oriental exaggeration , most glowing accounts of the destruction of these terrible squadrons , which had so long tyrannized over Egypt , and the fame of whose military prowess had caused the most distant tribes to tremble . The name of Napoleon became suddenly as renowned in Asia and in Africa as it had previously become in Europe . But twentyone days had elapsed since he placed his foot upon the sands at Alexandria , and now he was sovereign of Egypt . The Egyptians also welcomed him as a friend and a liberator . The sheets of flame , which incessantly burst from the French ranks , so deeply impressed their imaginations , that they gave to Napoleon the Oriental appellation of Sultan Kebir , or King of Fire . The wives of the Mamelukes had all remained in Cairo . Napoleon treated them with the utmost considetm*tion . He sent Eugene to the wife 1Th // of Mourad Bey , to assure her of his protection . He preserved all her property for her , and granted her several requests which she made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to mitigate the inevitable sufferings of war . The lady was so grateful for these attentions that she entertained Eugene with all possible honors , and presented him , upon his departure , with a valuable diamond ring . Cairo contained three hundred thousand inhabitants . Its population was brutal and ferocious in the extreme . The capital was in a state of terrible agitation , for the path of Oriental conquerors is ever marked with brutality , flames , and blood . Napoleon immediately dispatched a detachment of his army into the city to restore tranquillity , and to protect persons and property from the fury of the populace . The next day but one , with great pomp and splendor , at the head of his victorious army , he entered Cairo , and took possession of the palace of Mourad Bey . With the most extraordinary intelligence and activity he immediately consecrated all his energies to promote the highest interest of the country he had conquered . Nothing escaped his observation . He directed his attention to the mosques , the harems , the condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture , the arts , and sciences-to every thing which could influence the elevation and prosperity of the country . He visited the most influential of the Arab inhabitants , assured them of his friendship , of his respect for their religion , of his determination to protect their rights , and of his earnest desire to restore to Egypt its pristine glory . He disclaimed all sovereignty over Egypt , but organized a government to be administered by the people themselves . He succeeded perfectly in winning their confidence and admiration . He immediately established a congress , composed of the most distinguished citizens of Cairo , for the creation of laws and the administration of justice , and established similar assemblies in all the provinces , which were to send deputies to the general congress at Cairo . He organized the celebrated Institute of Egypt , to diffuse among the people the light and the sciences of Europe . Some of the members were employed in making an accurate description and a perfect map of Egypt ; others were to study the productions of the country , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to explore the ruins , thus to shed new light upon history ; others were to study the social condition of the inhabitants , and proper plans for the promotion of their welfare , by the means of manufactures , canals , roads , mills , works upon the Nile , and improvements in agriculture . Among the various questions proposed to the Institute by Napoleon , the following may be mentioned as illustrative of his enlarged designs : Ascertain the best construction for wind and water mills ; find a substitute for the hop , which does not grow in Egypt , for the making of beer ; select sites adapted to the eultivation of the vine ; seek the best means of procuring water for the citadel of Cairo ; select spots for wells in different parts of the desert* inquire into the means of clarifying and cooling the waters of the Nile ; devise some useful application of the rubbish with which the city of Cairo , and all the ancient towns of Egypt , are encumbered ; find materials for the manufacture of gunpowder . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windmills , wheelbarrows , or even handsaws , until they were introduced by Napoleon . Engineers , draughtsmen , and men of science immediately dispersed themselves throughout all the provinces of Egypt . Flour , as fine as could be obtained in Paris , was ground in mills at Alexandria , Rosetta , Damietta , and Cairo . By the erection of public ovens , bread became abundant . Hospitals were established , with a bed for each patient . Saltpetre and gunpowder-mills were erected . A foundry was constructed with reverberating furnaces . Large shops were built for locksmiths , armorers , joiners , cartwrights , carpenters , and rope-makers . Silver goblets and services of plate were manufactured . A French and Arabic printing-press was set at work . Inconceivable activity was infused into every branch of industry . The genius of Napoleon , never weary , inspired all and guided all . It was indeed a bright day which , after centuries of inaction and gloom , had thus suddenly dawned upon Egypt . The route was surveyed , and the expense estimated , of two ship-canals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nile at Cairo ; the other uniting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean across the Isthmus of Suez . Five millions of dollars and two years ol labor would have executed both of these magnificent enterprises , and would have caused a new era to have dawned upon three continents . It is impossible not to deplore those events which have thus consigned anew these fertile regions to beg gary and to barbarism . The accomplishment of these majestic plans might have transferred to the Nile and the Euphrates those energies now so transplendent upon the banks of the Mississippi and the Ohio . " It is incredible , " says Talleyrand , " how much Napoleon was able to achieve . He could effect more than any man , yes , more than any four men whom I have ever known . His genius was inconceivable . Nothing could exceed his energy , his imagination , his spirit , his capacity for work , his ease of accomplishment . He was clearly the most extraordinary man that I ever saw , and I believe the most extraordinary man that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All the energies of Napoleon 's soul were engrossed by these enterprises of grandeur and utility . Dissipation could present no aspect to allure him . " I have no passion , " said he , " for women or gaming . I am entirely a political being . " The Arabs were lost in astonishment that a conqueror , who wielded the thunderbolt , could be so disinterested and merciful . Such generosity and self-denial was never before heard of in the East They could in no way account for it . Theii females were protected from insult ; theii // persons and property were saved . Thirty thousand Europeans were toiling for the comfort and improvement of the Egyptians . They called Napoleon the worthy son of the prophet , the favorite of Allah . They even introduced his praises into their Litany , and chanted in the mosques , " Who is he that hath saved the favorite of Victory from the dangers of the sea , and from the rage of his enemies Who is he that hath led the brave men of the West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is Allah ! the great Allah ! The Mamelukes put their trust in horses ; they draw forth their infantry in battle array . But the favorite of Victory hath destroyed the footmen and the horsemen of the Mamelukes . As the vapors which rise in the morning are scattered by the rays of the sun , so hath the army of the Mamelukes been scattered by the brave men of the West . For the brave men of the West are as the apple of the eye to the great Allah . " Napoleon , to ingratiate himself with the people , and to become better acquainted with their character , attended their religious worship , and all their national festivals . Though he left the administration of justice in the hands of the sheiks , he enjoined and enforced scrupulous impartiality in their decisions . The robbers of the desert , who for centuries had devastated the frontiers with impunity , he repulsed with a vigorous hand , and under his energetic sway life and property became as safe in Egypt as in England or in France . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and might be seen in the houses , socially smoking their pipes with the inhabitants , assisting them in their domestic labors , and playing with their children . One day Napoleon , in his palace , was giving audience to a numerous assemblage of sheiks and other distinguished men . Information was brought to him that some robbers from the desert had slain a poor friendless peasant . and carried off his flocks . " Take three hundred horsemen and two hundred camels , " said Napoleon , immediately , to an officer of his staff , " and pursue these robbers until they are captured , and the outrage is avenged . " " Was the poor wretch your cousin , " exclaimed one of the sheiks. contemptuously , " that you are in such a rage at his death * " " He was more , " Napoleon replied , sublimely , " he was one whose safety Providence had intrusted to my care . " " Wonderful ! " rejoined the sheik , " you speak like one inspired of the Almighty . " More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napoleon . But the Egyptians with filial love , watched over him , gave him timely notice of the design , and effectually aided him in defeating it . In the midst of this extraordinary prosperity , a reverse , sudden , terrible , and irreparable , befell the French army . Admiral Brueys , devotedly attached to Napoleon , and anxious to ascertain that he had obtained a foothold in the country before leaving him to his fate , delayed withdrawing his fleet , as Napoleon had expressly encined , from the Bay of Aboukir , to place it in a position of safety . The second day after entering Cairo , Napoleon received dispatches from Admiral Brueys by which he learned that the squadron was in the bay of Aboukir , exposed to the attacks of the enemy . He was amazed at the intelligence , and immediately dispatched a messenger , to proceed with the utmost haste , and inform the admiral of his great disapprobation , and to warn him to take the fleet , without an hour 's delay , either into the harbor of Alexandria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Corfu . The messenger was assassinated on the way by a party of Arabs He could not , however , have reached Aboukir before the destruction of the fleet . In the mean time , Lord Nelson learned that the French had landed at Egypt . He immediately turned in that direction to seek their squadron . At six o'clock in the evening of the first of August , but ten days after the battle of the Pyramids , the British fleet majestically entered the bay of Aboukir , and closed upon their victime . The French squadron consisting of thirteen ships of the line and four frigates , was anchored in a semi-circle , in a line corresponding with the curve of the shore . The plan of attack , adopted by Nelson , possessed the simplicity and originality of genius , and from the first moment victory was almost certain . As soon as Nelson perceived the situation of the French fleet , he resolved to double with his whole force on half of that of his enemy , pursuing the same system of tactics by sea which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered his fleet to take its station half on the outer , and half on the inner side of one end of the French line . Thus each French ship was placed between the fire of two of those of the English . The remainder of the French fleet being at anchor to the windward could not easily advance to the relief of their doomed friends . Admiral Brueys supposed that he was anchored so near the shore that the English could not pass inside of his line . But Nelson promptly decided that where there was room for the enemy to swing , there must be room for his ships to float . " If we succeed what will the world say , " exclaimed one of Nelson 's captains , with transport , as he was made acquainted with the plan of attack . " There is no if in the case , " Nelson replied , " that we shall succeed is certain . Who may live to tell the story is a very different question . " The French fought with the energies of despair . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . The Bay of Aboukir resembled one wide flaming volcano , enveloped in the densest folds of sulphureous smoke . The ocean never witnessed a conflict more sanguinary and dreadful . About eleven o'clock the Orient took fire . The smoke , from the enormous burning mass , ascended like an immense black balloon , when suddenly the flames , flashing through them , illumined the whole horizon with awful brilliance . At length its magazine , containing hundreds of barrels of gunpowder , blew up , with an explosion so tremendous as to shake // every ship to its centre . So awfully did this explosion rise above the incessant roar of the battle , that simultaneotisly on both sides , the firing ceased , and a silence , as of the grave , ensued . But immediately the murderous conflict was resumed . Death and destruction , in the midst of the congenial gloom of night , held high carnival in the bay . Thousands of Arabs lined the shore , gazing with astonishment and terror upon the awful spectacle . For fifteen hours that dreadful conflict continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until high noon of the ensuing day , when the firing gradually ceased , for the French fleet was destroyed . Four ships mnly escaped , and sailed for Malta . The English ships were too much shattered to attempt to pursue the fugitives . Admiral Brueys was wounded early in the action . He would not leave the quarter-deck . " An admiral , " said he , " should die giving orders . " A cannon ball struck him , and but the fragments of his body couid be found . Nelson was also severely wounded on the head . When carried to the cockpit , drenched in blood , he nobly refused , though in imminent danger of bleeding to death , to have his wounds dressed , till the wounded seamen , who were brought in before him , were attended to . " I will take my turn with my brave fellows , " said he . Fully believing that his wound was mortal , he called for the chaplain , and requested him to deliver his dying remembrance to Lady Nelson . When the surgeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was found that the wound was only superficial . All of the transports and small craft which had conveyed Napoleon 's army to Egypt , were in the harbor of Alexandria , safe from attack , as Nelson had no frigates with which to cross the bar . For leagues the shore was strewn with fragments of the wreck , and with the mangled bodies of the dead . The bay was also filled with floating corpses , notwithstanding the utmost efforts to sink them . The majestic armament which but four weeks before had sailed from Toulon , was thus utterly overthrown . The loss of the English was but about one thousand . Of the French five thousand perished , and three thousand were made prisoners . As soon as the conquest was completed , Nelson made signal for the crew , in every ship , to be assembled for prayers . The stillness of the Sabbath instantly pervaded the whole squadron , while thanksgivings were offered to God for the signal victory . So strange is the heart of man . England was desolating the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to renounce republicanism and establish a monarchy . And in the bloody hour when the Bay of Aboukir was covered with the thousanJ* , of the mutilated dead , whom her strong arm had destroyed , she , with unquestioned sincerity , offered to God the tribute of thanksgiving and praise . And from the churches and the firesides of England , tens of thousands of pious hearts breathed the fervent prayer of gratx*ude w ' God for the great victory of Aboukir . Such was the famous Battle of the Nile , as it has since been called . It was a signal conquest . It was a magnificent triumph of British arms . But a victory apparently more fatal to the great interests of humanity was perhaps never gained . It was the death-blow to reviving Egypt . It extinguished in midnight gloom the light of civilization and science , which had just been enkindled on those dreary shores . Merciless oppression again tightened its iron grasp upon Asia and Africa , and already , as the consequence , has another half century of crime , cruelty and outrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all his hopes were blasted . The blow was utterly irreparable . He was cut off from Europe . He could receive no supplies . He could not return . Egypt was his prison . Yet he received the news of this terrible disaster , with the most imperturbable equanimity . Not a word or a gesture escaped him , which indicated the slightest discouragement . With unabated zeal he pursued his plans , and soon succeeded in causing the soldiers to forget the disaster . He wrote to Kleber , " We must die in this country or get out of it as great as the ancients . This will oblige us to do greater things than we intended . We must hold ourselves in readiness . We will at least bequeath to Egypt an heritage of greatness . " " Yes Kleber replied , " we must do great things . I am preparing my faculties . " The exultation among the crowned heads in Europe in view of this great monarchical victory was unbounded . England immediately created Nelson Baron of the Nile , and conferred a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to his two immediate successors . The Grand Signior , the Emperor of Russia , the King of Sardinia , the King of Naples , and the East India Company made him magnificent presents . Despotism upon the Continent , which had received such heavy blows from Napoleon , began to rejoice and to revive . The newly emancipated people , struggling into the life of liberty , were disheartened . Exultant England formed new combinations of banded kings , to replace the Bourbons on their throne , and to crush the spirit of popular liberty and equality , which had obtained such a foothold in France . All monarchical Europe rejoiced . All republican Europe mourned . The day of Aboukir was indeed a disastrous day to France . Napoleon with his intimate friends did not conceal his conviction of the magnitude of the calamity . He appeared occasionally , for a moment , lost in painful reverie , and was heard two or three times to exclaim , in indescribable tones of emotion , " Unfortunate Brueys , what have you done . " But hardly an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entirely recovered his accustomed fortitude , and presence of mind , and he soon succeeded in allaying the despair of the soldiers . He saw , at a glance , all the consequences of this ? rreparable loss . And it speaks well for his heart that in the midst of a disappointment ec // terrible , he could have forgotten his own grief in writing a letter of condolence to the widow of his friend . A heartless man could never have penned so touching an epistle as the following addressed to Madame Brueys , the widow of the man who had been unintentionally the cause of apparently the greatest calamity which could have befallen him . " Your husband has been killed by a cannon ball , while combating on his quarter deck . He died without suffering  --  the death the most easy and the most envied by the brave . I feel warmly for your grief . The moment which separates us from the object which we love is terrible ; we feel isolated on the earth ; we almost experience the convulsions of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its connection with the earth is preserved only through the medium of a painful dream , which disturbs every thing . We feel , in such a situation , that there is nothing which yet binds us to life ; that it were far better to die . But when , after such just and unavoidable throes , we press our children to our hearts , tears and more tender sentiments arise , and life becomes bearable for their sakes . Yes , Madame ! they will open the fountains of your heart . You will watch their childhood , educate their youth . You will speak to them of their father , of your present grief , and of the loss which they and the Republic have sustained in his death . After having resumed the interests in life by the chord of maternal love , you will perhaps feel some consolation from the friendship and warm interest which I shall ever take in the widow of my friend . " The French soldiers with the versatility of disposition which has ever characterized the lighthearted nation , finding all possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their accustomed gayety , and with zeal engaged in all the plans of Napoleon , for the improvement of the coun.ry , which it now appeared that , for many years , must be their home .
