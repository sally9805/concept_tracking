THE THEORY OF THE SOCIAL COMPACT . A SKETCH OF ITS HISTORY . THE political capacity of the English people is due in large measure to their great ingenuity in inventing political theories , and their obstinate skepticism in refusing to believe in them . Perhaps no better illustration of these qualities can be found than in the history of that extraordinary theory which , under the name of the " social compact , " influenced deeply the political life of Europe and America for two centuries . And it is not the least singular fact about a doctrine which proved so destructive to the existing order of things in Europe that it should have originated with a clergyman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him for the purpose of defending the Established Church against the attacks of its enemies . The truth is , that during the reign of Elizabeth , and for a good while afterwards , the Church of England occupied a very difficult position ; for it was assailed on one side by the Catholics , who claimed the authority of a divinely inspired church , and on the other by the Puritans , who referred their system of organization to the express teaching of the Bible . Under these circumstances , the " judicious Hooker , " as he was afterwards called , instead of meeting his opponents on their own ground by claiming a divine origin for the English ecclesiastical system , parried their attacks by denying that any religious body is under direct divine guidance in all matters , and asserting that laws for the government of the church may be made by men , and that if according to reason and not repugnant to Scripture they are authorized by God . Hooker begins his Ecclesiastical Polity ' with a discussion of laws in general . He treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , and Published in 1594. // shows how force might then be resisted by force , and no one had a right to constitute himself a judge in his own case . To escape from this state of things " there was no way but only by growing unto composition and agreement amongst themselves , by ordaining some kind of government public , and by yielding themselves subject thereto . " A father , he says , has by nature a supreme power within his own family , but rulers " not having the natural superiority of fathers , their power must needs be either usurped , and then unlawful ; or , if lawful , then either granted or consented unto by them over whom they exercise the same , or else given extraordinarily from God , unto whom all the world is subject . " Disregarding this second alternative , Hooker bases government upon the consent of the governed . Not that these need give a special assent to each separate law , for it is enough if they agree , once for all , that their rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to be commanded we do consent , " he says , " when that society , whereof we are part , hath at any time before consented , without revoking the same after the like universal agreement . Wherefore as any man 's deed past is good as long as himself continueth ; so the act of a public society of men done five hundred years sithence standeth as theirs who presently are of the same societies , because corporations are immortal ; we were then alive in our predecessors , and they in their successors do live still . Laws therefore human , of what kind soever , are available by consent . " Such was the origin of the theory of the social compact ; for although the idea that the authority of the ruler is conferred upon him by the people was not new , I am not aware that any one before Hooker deduced the lawfulness of laws from the voluntary association of individuals to form a civil society . It would not be safe , however , to make too positive in regard to Hooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means impossible that the theory may have been originated by several persons independently during the last part of the sixteenth and the early part of the seventeenth centuries . The course of thought had for many years been such as to prepare men 's minds to produce and accept a theory of this kind ; and , indeed , the doctrine that the power of the king is derived from the consent of his people had recently become very prominent , and had developed until it assumed a form only a little less complete than that of the theory enunciated by Hooker . The desire to get rid of an obnoxious monarch always acted as a strong spur to drive men to opinions which made his tenure of power dependent upon the will of his subjects . The English and Scotch Protestants smarting under the persecutions of the two Marys , the Catholic league in France furious with Henry III. , and in their train the Jesuits , all insisted on the right of deposing a king , and often went so far as to justify his assassination . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines , for many of the Catholics maintained that a king must be deposed by the Pope before he could be murdered by a subject , while the Protestants had no such weapon at their command . The theory once started soon became popular , and before long it was put into practice ; and in fact the first social compact known to history was made on the 11th of November , 1620 , in the cabin of the Mayflower . It was clearly no desire to uphold the polity of the Church of England which induced the Pilgrim Fathers thus to emerge from a state of barbarism ; nor does this document appear to have been the result of any democratic doctrines , but rather , as Bradford tells us , of threats of insubordination on the part of certain persons on board , whom no one had power to control , because the patent issued in favor of the Pilgrims covered only a part of the territory then // called Virginia , and did not extend to New England . ' The colonists found themselves much in the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obliged to invent a new one to cover the emergency . The agreement was probably signed by all the men of the party , and it reads as follows - " In ye name of God , Amen . We whose names are underwriten , the loyall subjects of our dread soveraigne Lord , King James , by ye grace of God , of Great Britaine , Franc , &amp; Ireland king , defender of ye faith , &amp;c. , haveing undertaken , for ye glorie of God , and advancemente of ye Christian faith , and honour of our king &amp; countrie , a voyage to plant ye first colonie in ye Northerne parts of Virginnia , doe by these presents solemnly &amp; mutualy , in ye presence of God , and one of another , covenant &amp; combine our selves togeather into a civill body politick , for our better ordering &amp; preservation &amp; furtherance of ye ends aforesaid ; and , by vertue hearof to enacte , constitute , and frame such just &amp; equall lawes , ordinances , acts , constitutions , &amp; offices , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; convenient for ye generall good of ye colonie , unto which we promise all due submission and obedience .

" The theory of the social compact was not exhausted by this first experiment , but was taken up by Hugo Grotius in his work , De Jure Belli et Pacis , which appeared in 1625 . He declares that " the mother of Natural Law is human Nature itself , and the mother of Civil Law is that very obligation which arises from Consent , which deriving its Force from the Law of Nature , Nature may be Bradford 's History of Plymouth Plantation . The 2 . Booke. called , as it were , the Great Grandmother of this Law also . " Grotius , while inclining to absolute monarchy , says that the questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is limited and divided , and whether there exists a right to resist and make war upon the sovereign , depend upon the intention of the parties to the contract . But although he founds his political system on the social compact , he dwells upon the theory but little , and it occupies only a very small part of his book . The same thing is true of Milton , who , in his essay entitled The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates , ' traces the outlines of the principles afterwards so fully developed by Locke . In 1651 the social compact received a new and unexpected turn from the powerful intelligence of Hobbes , the skeptic . This remarkable man wrote during the Commonwealth , and the aversion inspired by some of his religious views was increased to horror by his political theories ; for he was an admirer of absolute monarchy , and , strange to say , he made use of the social compact to support his doctrine of the unlimited power of the king . Hobbes appears to have been the first person who really understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly that moral duties do not in themselves impose legal obligations , or confer legal rights . He lays down a series of laws of nature , which he derives from the desire for self-preservation and from the principle that each man ought to be willing in his own interest to strive for peace , and for that end to lay aside part of his natural freedom , and be content with so much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself . " Thus he starts from a purely self-regarding basis , and yet he brings his precepts up to the standard of the golden rule . The laws of nature , // he says , are binding only on the conscience of the individual , and he distinguishes them carefully from laws , properly so called , which are " the word of him that by right hath command over others ; " a doctrine more elaborately expounded by Austin in his masterly work on jurisprudence . From one of his laws of nature Hobbes draws a conclusion which is sufficiently odd to deserve special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge between man and man , it is a precept of the law of nature that he judge equally between them . " And from this , " he continues , " followeth another law , that such things as can not be divided be enjoyed in common , ' " or if they can neither be divided nor enjoyed in common , that the entire right be determined by lot . The lot may be arbitrary or natural , and among natural lots he classes primogeniture . Such an explanation of the law of primogeniture is almost as ingenious as the one given in Jolanthe , where the inheritance is likened to a Derby Cup , a sort of racing-prize won by the first-born . Treating first of the state of nature where " men live without a common power to keep them all in awe , ** " ilobbes clearly proves that every creature Lives in a state of war by nature , " - a war in which there is no law , and consequently no injustice ; in which each man , being bound only by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything for that end , and in which , therefore , each man has a right to everything . It is to get themselves " out from that miserable condition of warre , " he tells us , that men who naturally love liberty are willing to put a restraint upon themselves and live in commonwealths . Now a man may renounce or transfer any portion of his rights , and when he has done so he is bound not to hinder those to whom he has granted a right from enjoying the benefits of it . Any such hindrance , indeed , would be an injustice . In this way Hobbes founds all right and justice on the transfer of rights , and on that mutual transfer of rights which he calls contract . Having thus laid his foundations by a careful course of reasoning , he declares that a commonwealth is " made by covenant of every man with every man , in such manner , as if every man should say to every man , I authorize and give up my right of governing myself , to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this condition , that thou give up thy right to him , and authorize all his actions in like manner . This done , the multitude so united in one person is called a Commonwealth , ' in Latin civitas . This is the generation of that great leviathan , ' or rather , to speak more reverently , of that mortal god , ' to which we owe , under the immortal God , ' our peace and defence . " Such a description of the institution of a commonwealth by a common contract to invest the sovereign with what may be called a universal power of attorney seems innocent enough , but Hobbes ingeniously draws from it some very startling conclusions . In the first place , the contract can not be set aside without the consent of every one of the contracting parties ; and certain rights having been transferred to the sovereign , they can not be withdrawn from him without his own consent . In the second place , the power conferred upon the sovereign can not be limited by any condition or covenant in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a party to such a covenant , since there is no community until the contract instituting the sovereign has been made ; and if the sovereign make any such covenant with individuals it is of no avail , because every breach of the covenant is the act of each of those individuals done by the sovereign as their agent . From the same principle it follows that the sovereign can not wrong his subjects or be punished by them , for each of his acts is the act of his subjects themselves . In short , the sovereign must in all cases be absolute , // and his rights are incapable of limitation . Hobbes , like all writers of his time , divides governments into monarchies , aristocracies , and democracies ; and while it does not strictly follow from his premises , he denies the possibility of a mixed form . It is perhaps unnecessary to add that he regards the government of England as an absolute monarchy . Now although the apologists of absolute monarchy were not wanting in those days , the doctrines of Hobbes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social compact became thereafter almost the exclusive property of the writers of a more democratic school . No doubt the personal unpopularity of Hobbes contributed in no small degree to this result , for his religious views , exaggerated as they were by public report , rendered his name so detested as to throw discredit on his political theories . This was true to such an extent that in 1683 the University of Oxford , in an attempt to uphold Charles II . in his struggle for absolute power , specially condemned certain of the political doctrines of Hobbes , together with those of Milton , Baxter , and other writers of republican tendencies . But the chief reason that the doctrine of divine right became the weapon of the monarchy , and the theory of the social compact was monopolized by the more democratic school , is to be found in the nature of that theory itself , and of the times in which it prevailed . In the first place , those who claimed a divine origin for the established order of things might readily be believed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of popular government , which had been almost unknown since the foundation of Christianity , was under special divine protection . If , in the second place , the origin and legality of government was to be traced to the consent of the people , it was hardly credible that the people would have so tied their own hands as to be unable to remedy abuses in the system they had instituted ; and it was but natural that the people should interpret the original contract according to their present needs . Moreover , it is evident that a theory which magnified the importance of the people in the institution of the state , and depressed that of the king , was certain to be popular with the multitude , and to be received with little favor at court . One of the most celebrated writers of the popular school was the unfortunate Algernon Sydney , to whose pen Massachusetts owes her motto . Sydney was accused of connection with the Rye House Plot , and at his trial the manuscript of his Discourses on Government was produced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cause of his death . These Discourses were composed as nn answer to the Patriarcha , an extremely monarchical book , written by Sir Robert Filmer ; but although they found all government upon consent , the social compact is very far from being a prominent feature in them . The theory , or at least that part of it which affirms that there is a contract between the king and his people , came in very conveniently at the time of the English Revolution ; not , indeed , as a motive for depriving James II . of his throne , but rather as a plausible justification for an act which the nation had determined to commit . The social coinpact helped to save the country at that time from a very great embarrassment ; for the people were not yet worked up to the point of deposing the king , and if it had not been for this theory , and for James 's disinterestedness in taking himself out of the way at the right time , it is not clear how the English would ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Convention was able to come to the following resolution : " That king James the Second , having endeavored to subvert the Constitution // of the Kingdom , by breaking the original Contract between king and people , and , by the advice of Jesuits , and other wicked persons , having violated the fundamental Laws , and having withdrawn himself out of this Kingdom , has abdicated the Government , and that the throne is thereby become vacant . " It was only about two years after James II . had lost his crown in this complicated way that John Locke , the philosopher , published his Treatises on Government , which , like Sydney 's Discourses , were written as an answer to Filmer 's book , again brought into prominence by the utterances of the Jacobite divines . These Treatises are deeply imbued with the spirit of the common law , and may be said to have been the standard of Whig principles for a hundred years . Locke begins with the proposition - the only one common to all the writers on the social compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal , but , unlike Hobbes , he is of opinion that the law of nature has a binding force before the institution of civil societies . He declares no one ought to injure another in his health , liberty , or possessions ; and inasmuch as in a state of nature no one has any superiority or jurisdiction over any one else , the execution of the law of nature is put into every man 's hands , so that every one has a right to punish the transgressors of that law . In addition to this right , which belongs to every one , a person injured has a special right to exact reparation from the offender . The right of property in the state of nature Locke derives from the appropriation of such things as before lay in common by bestowing labor upon them , and as examples of this he mentions the gathering of apples from the trees , the killing of deer in the chase , and the tilling and planting of land . According to Locke , therefore , the law of nature invests a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it can be no intention of acquiring legal rights that drives men into political societies , but the desire of protecting and securing those already in existence , and of avoiding that state of war which , although not a necessary condition of the state of nature , is a condition likely to arise from the absence of a common judge . A political society is formed , he says , when a number of men agree to give up to that society their individual right of punishing offenders , and of exacting by their own force redress for injuries ; and in so doing they consent that the majority ( unless there is a stipulation for a larger proportion ) shall have power to make and execute laws necessary to accomplish the purposes for which the society is formed , and shall have authority to call upon each man to employ his force to carry out the judgments of the society . In the course of his argument Locke takes occasion to make a very clever hit at the doctrines of the Stuarts , for he declares that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil society consists in the fact that in the latter there is a known authority , to which every man may appeal , and adds that any one who is not subjected to such an authority is not in a state of civil society . He then draws the conclusion that an absolute prince is in a state of nature with regard to his subjects . By becoming absolute , therefore , a prince forfeits all lawful authority over his subjects , and ceases to be a prince at all . The course of a monarch who aspires to be absolute resembles , in Locke 's opinion , one of those gaines of chance , in which the player progresses until a throw of the dice brings him upon a number marked with a ditch or other device , when he is cast entirely out of the game , and must begin again at the very beginning . Locke goes on to discuss the position of the descendants of the original members of the society , and in this matter he is more logical than the other writers upon the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individuals who // compose it , he boldly proclaims that no man can bind his children beyond the period of their infancy , and that as each child comes of age he is free to sever his connection with the society , or to declare himself irrevocably a member of it . Even without such a declaration , a person who takes possession of property within the commonwealth , or who resides within its limits , consents to become a member of the society so long as the enjoyment or residence continues ; but he may at any time dispose of his property , leave the commonwealth , and attach himself to another community . The body politic once constituted , the majority have power to institute the form of government ; and this may be a democracy , an oligarchy , or a monarchy , according to the disposition of the power of making laws . When once established the legislature can not be deprived of its power by the people , unless it acts contrary to its trust , or until it has reached the limits set for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive power into other hands , it may resume that power at its pleasure , and punish for maladministration of the laws . The subject , however , which interests us the most is to be found in the chapter where he treats " Of the Extent of the Legislative Power ; " for , in Locke 's opinion , the authority of the legislature is not absolute , but limited by the object for which men entered into the society . He declares that the legislature can not be " arbitrary over the lives and fortunes of the people , " and that it " can not assume to itself a power to rule by extemporary arbitrary decrees , but is bound to dispense justice and to decide the rights of the subject by promulgated standing laws , and known authorized judges ; " because it was precisely a desire to avoid the inconveniences of having no fixed laws and no certain judge that induced men to enter into society . On the same ground he holds that the supreme power can not take from any man any part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property " is " the end of government and that for which men enter into society . " Locke proceeds to consider the effect of the acts of the executive and of the legislature done in excess of their authority , and in a chapter devoted to the subject of tyranny lays down the general proposition that " whoever in authority exceeds the power given him by the law , and makes use of the force he has under his command to compass that upon the subject which the law allows not , ceases in that to be a magistrate , and acting without authority may be opposed , as any other man who by force invades the right of another . " In his concluding chapter on the Dissolution of Government , he carries the same idea still further , and finds two internal causes of dissolution . The first of these is presented when the legislature is altered : which happens when any single person sets up his own will in place of the laws , hinders the meeting of the legislature , or changes the mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and all other cases where the government is dissolved , the people are at liberty to provide for themselves a new one . The other cause of dissolution occurs when the legislators or the prince act contrary to their trust ; and the ? ormer act " against the trust reposed in them when they endeavor to invade the property of the subject , and to make themselves , or any part of the community , masters or arbitrary disposers of the lives , liberties , or fortunes of the people . " " Whenever the legislators endeavor to take away and destroy the property of the people , or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power , they put themselves into a state of war with the people , who are thereupon absolved from any farther obedience , and are left to the common refuge which // God hath provided for all men against force and violence . " In reading this essay of Locke we can not fail to be struck with the resemblance between spine of his deductions and the doctrines of our own jurists ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were intended to be a commentary on the principles of American Constitutional Law . For , in fact , the idea that a statute which conflicts with the constitution is not law and has no effect was not altogether an invention of Chief Justice Marshall as has often been supposed , but is a very natural development of certain principles of the English common law . In the seventeenth century England went through a period of intense political excitement which culminated in the expulsion of James II. , and during this time political thought was very philosophical , and busied itself with inquiries about the nature and origin of government . But when the excitement subsided in the reigns of William and of Anne , and was extinguished under the House of Hanover , it was but natural that political thought should adapt itself to circumstances , and , putting off the speculative , assume a positive form . It is for this reason that the theory of the social compact rapidly lost its prominence in England , and in the reigns of the Georges entirely disappeared from view . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteenth century saw political thought enter on a course of active speculation , and consequently the social compact reappeared with all its force and in the old form , although , cha * The differences between Rousseau 's teaching and the course of things in the French Revolution are more apparent than real . His one restriction , for example , on the power of the people is to be found in his doctrine that no law cau be made which is not of general application ; but this , of course , could not be applied in any country where the reverence for law is not very much greater than it was in France . and it was especially valueless in a meleon-like , it had changed its color to suit its new surroundings . Montesquieu , the most profound of the political thinkers of his day , makes , it is true , no use of the theory ; a fact which illustrates his strong common sense . His shrewdness , indeed , is nowhere better shown than in his remarks upon Hobbes 's notion that the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that man in a wild condition , instead of living in a state of war , lived in a state of abject terror , and that on seeing a stranger his first impulse , far from being a passion to fight , was probably an uncontrollable desire to run away . Rousseau , on the other hand , reveled in the theory of the social compact . In it he thought he had discovered the key to liberty , and the lamp that was to dispel all ignorance and oppression from the world . He developed it in a style so attractive , and with a spirit so much in sympathy with the feelings that were beginning to spread over Europe , that his book by its popularity has eclipsed all other works upon the subject , and he is commonly supposed to have been the author of the theory . Rousseau 's Contrat Social was first published in 1762 ; and in the same manner that Locke 's Treatises are saturated with the principles of the common law , so the Contrat Social mirrors the doctrines of the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long accustomed to a concentrated and despotic government , could not suddenly acquire the habits of personal independence and liberty which give character to the Anglo-Saxon system of government . After clearing away the wreck country where so much legislation was in reality accomplished by the decrees of the magistrates . His theory that nothing can be enacted except directly by an assembly of the whole people may , perhaps , have contributed to the contempt with which the mob of Paris treated the national legislature , but was clearly inapplicable to a land of anything like the size of France . 188'T. 75P ( // of feudalism , which had become a mere obstruction in the path of progress , and introducing equality of rights , the French Revolution was destined to leave political power as concentrated and despotic as before ; only substituting in the place of the king of France some assembly , directory , emperor , or at the very best some chance popular majority , each one of which , however wise and just lie might be , and however much actuated by a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrarily . Assuming , like every other writer on the social compact , that all men are by nature free , and that civil society is an artificial contrivance , which requires for its legality the consent of every member , Rousseau inquires how a man can assent to such an arrangement without injuring himself or neglecting his own interests , and he proposes the following problem : " To find a form of association which shall defend and protect with the whole power of the community the person and property of each member , and by which each person , uniting with all , nevertheless obeys only himself , and remains as free as he was before . " This problem he solves by supposing a complete transfer of each member , with all Isis rights , to the society ; because , he says , as each man gives himself entirely to the whole society , he gives himself to no individual , and the condition of all being the same , no one has any interest to render it burdensome for any one else . In another place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each one of us puts himself and all his powers under the direction of the general will ( volont6 ge'n6rale ) , and we receive again each member as an indivisible part of the whole . The idea of this general or common will is the distinctive part of Rousseau 's theory and the key to his whole system . Rousseau next treats of the sovereign , which is simply this same society as a whole considered in relation to its mem bers ; and in his opinion , it is contrary to the nature of the body politic that the sovereign should be able to impose upon himself a law which he can not break , for it would be simply a case of an individual binding himself by a contract made only with himself . No fundamental law of any kind , therefore , can be binding upon the body of the people ; not even the social compact itself . Moreover , there can be no need of any guarantee against the sovereign power , because , being composed of all the members of the community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to injure them as a whole , nor can it injure particular individuals . The sovereign , indeed , from the mere fact that he exists , is always what he should be . These last two propositions , although at first sight somewhat surprising , are deduced from the very nature of sovereignty itself , which is in fact nothing else than the aforesaid general will ; for it is only to the general will that the members of the society agree to submit themselves . The general will , however , does not mean simply the common will of the members of the society , but is used in a more restricted sense , and denotes the common will of those members only when that will is applied to an abstract or general question affecting the whole community . When the common will is applied to an object of this sort , it is an act of sovereignty , and is called a law ; but a determination upon any particular or personal matter can not be an act of the general will , or an exercise of sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all what we term special or private laws ; at most they are decrees or acts of the magistrature . The question naturally presents itself , What is this general will , and who has power to declare it ? To this Rousseau replies that it is the will of the members of the community , and that no one else has power to declare it ; nor can it be delegated , because , although // a man may say that his will is the same as that of another man at any particular moment , or on any specific question , yet he can not say that his will in the future , and on any questions that may hereafter arise , will always be the same as that of another person . The power of making laws , therefore , can be delegated neither to a prince nor to a house of representatives , but , while laws may be prepared and discussed by them , they can be enacted only by all the members of the community , duly assembled for the purpose ; and for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their liberty , in reality are not free . Now it is all very well to talk of the general will , as if laws were voted unanimously , but every one knows that this is not the case ; and to keep up his fiction that each person obeys only himself , and at the same time to give to the majority the power of making laws , Rousseau develops a most ingenious idea . He says that each man desires the fulfillment of the general will , and that , when a law is submitted to the people , the question put to each man is not strictly whether he approves of the law or not , but whether it is in accordance with the general will which he wishes to carry out . Each man gives his advice thereon , and if a man is in the minority it simply proves that he was mistaken about the general will ; so that if by chance his opinion had prevailed , he would have done what he did not want to do . A very comforting doctrine , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to the enactment of laws , it is evident that there must exist subordinate authorities in the state , charged with the duty of executing the laws , carrying on foreign relations , etc. ; and , as these duties do not partake of the nature of sovereignty , Rousseau entirely rejects the doctrine of the separation of executive , legislative , and judicial powers as advanced by Montesquieu . He divides governments into monarchies , aristocracies , democracies , and mixed forms , according to the composition of these subordinate authorities . They are all instituted by laws , but the selection of the persons to fill the various offices , being a particular and personal matter , is not an act of sovereignty , and must be accomplished by election , by lot , or by some other method established by law . The powers and rights of these authorities can not rest upon contract , because the sovereignty can not be alienated or limited , and the magistrates and even the form of government may be changed at any time by an exercise of the general will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes further , and says that every assembly of the people ought to be opened with these two questions Is it the pleasure of the sovereign to continue the present form of government ? Is it the pleasure of the people to leave in office the present incumbents ? One can hardly imagine a greater encouragement to revolutions , or a more effective manner of bringing all citizens to the polls . Rousseau sees merits and faults in each form of government , and wisely concludes that the best one is not the same in every country , but varies with the climate , the extent of the territory , and the habits of the people . The apostle of liberty makes a most surprising application of his views on absolute sovereignty , at the end of his book , when discussing the religious question . He thinks that there ought to be a state religion , which every one must accept on pain of banishment . There can , it is true , be no further persecution on this ground , except that if any person , after having declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not believe in it , he ought to be punished with death , for he has committed the gravest of crimes he has lied before the law . He enumerates the positive dogmas which this religion should contain , among which is to be found the // sacredness of the social compact ; and he adds a single negative one , and that is a condemnation of intolerance . Whoever , therefore , says that there is no salvation outside of the church ought to be driven from the state . In this way , Rousseau would prevent religious intolerance by making persecution a state monopoly . Such must have been the motive of the governing board of a certain college in America , which was for many years accused of filling its vacancies exclusively with persons of one denomination ; not with any sectarian purpose , but merely for fear that if a person of a different faith were admitted he would try to fill the board with members of his own church . I do not assert that the charge was true , but it was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutions in which the revolutionary period in France was so prolific , there is no reference to the social compact ; and it is even more strange that these documents treat of the matter of private rights rather from an English than a French point of view . A superficial observer , indeed , who should compare the constitution of the 3d of September , 1791 , with the constitution of Massachusetts might well doubt which was the French and which the American production . The Frenchman solemnly condemns arbitrary punishment ; proclaims the sacredness of private property , insisting that it can never be taken except in case of public necessity , and then only upon due compensation ; declares that the legislature has no authority to pass a law violating any of the rights guaranteed by the constitution ; and yet it is not long before he passes votes to execute the king and to confiscate the property of the 6migre 's . The fact is that Rousseau sympathized with the political sentiments of France far more than the Abb* Sieyes and his fellow constitutional architects , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rousseau than by the statesmanship of Mirabeau . The great theory was not so neglected by the constitution-makers on this side of the ocean ; for as we have seen the first social compact known to history made by the Pilgrim Fathers in the cabin of the Mayflower , so we see the most elaborate , if not the last , made in part by the descendants of these same men , and entitled the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts . Evidently this relapsing into a state of barbarism and recovering one 's self by means of a social compact was a favorite pastime with the New Englanders . The second and third clauses of the preamble of this constitution run thus : " The body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals : it is a social compact , by which the whole people covenants with each citizen , and each citizen with the whole people , that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good . It is the duty of the people , therefore , in framing a constitution of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as for an impartial interpretation and a faithful execution of them ; that every man may at all times find his security in them . " We , therefore , the people of Massachusetts , acknowledging with grateful hearts the goodness of the great Legislator of the universe , in affording us , in the course of His providence , an opportunity deliberately and peaceably , without fraud , violence or surprise , of entering into an original , explicit , and solemn compact with each other ; and of forming a new constitution of civil government , for ourselves and posterity ; and devotedly imploring His direction in so interesting a design , do agree upon , ordain , and establish , the following Declaration of Bights and Frame of Government as the CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS . " Then follows the Declaration of Rights , // in which it is impossible not to see the influence of Rousseau curiously combined with the principles of the common law , of Magna Charta , and of the Bill of Rights ; for the truth is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found their theoretical expression in Locke 's Treatises on Government , they were very much carried away by the writings of the French philosophers . From Montesquieu they borrowed the doctrine of the separation of powers , which has become so thoroughly a part of the American political system , and in fact they accepted theories as the basis of their politic practice to a far greater extent than any other body of AngloSaxons has ever done before or since . This is evident even in the very wording of the Declaration of Rights which we are considering ; for when an assembly wishes to declare the existence of a right which is not dependent upon its own action , it naturally uses the present tense , thus , " Every man has a right . " But if , on the other hand , the assembly wishes to create a right , it uses what I may call the future imperative , and says , " Every man shall have a right . " The first of these forms is appropriate in making a statement , while the second is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark that the French legislators usually employ the former expression , but the Anglo-Saxon , both in statutes and constitutions , make use almost invariably of the latter . The Massachusetts Declaration of Rights , however , proclaims these rights in the present tense , with an occasional relapse into the future , especially when treating of matters of detail . The constitution of Massachusetts was not the last nor the most extraordinary application of the social compact in this country , for the fever of theory at 1 Goshen vs . Stonington , 4 Conn . Rep. 209 at 225. * See Doctor and Stndent , c. vi . p. 154 . Day vs . Savadge , Hobait , 85 , at 87 . Calvin 's one time attacked even the bench , and grave judges were heard to say that a statute was invalid if repugnant to the principles of justice and civil liberty . Even Judge Story was carried away by this idea , and at times used very loose language on the subject ; but no one , perhaps , ever went further than Chief Justice Hosmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 " With those judges who assert the omnipotence of the legislature , in all cases where the Constitution has not interposed an explicit restraint , I can not agree .

" At first sight this appears to be merely a ridiculous attempt to engraft a new doctrine upon the common law , but however absurd the attempt may have been , it was in reality a logical deduction from the teachings of John Locke , and was not so unprecedented as one might suppose ; for it was long doubtful in England whether the judges had not authority to disregard , as void , an act of Parliament , if they considered it against natural equity or common right and reason , because , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are leges legum .

This principle is protected in America by the various constitutions , and it has long been settled that the courts have power to disregard a statute only when it conflicts with some provision in the constitution . Hosmer 's theory has been entirely exploded , and the spectre of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bench . I have so far made no reference to the German writers , not because they do not discuss the social compact , for after the middle of the seventeenth century almost all the German publicists devoutly believed in it . In fact , they entirely adopted and Germanized it , or , as some malicious critic might say , in the words of Sheridan , they treated it as gypsies do stolen children , disfigured it to make it pass for their own . There are , however , two reasons why I have not mentioned the German writers before . The first is the lack of space in this sketch to touch upon any one but Kant , the most famous of them all , and his writings are later than those we have so far considered . A second reason is the existence of certain peculiarities of thought characteristic of the Germans , which are not to be found among the more prominent writers of other races , and which may be in some measure explained by the political condition of the German people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a tendency to confuse morality and law . This may be said to be a universal failing with the German publicists , and it is this , more than anything else , that makes their writings so difficult to read , and so unsatisfactory when read . Another peculiarity , which , although not so general , is nevertheless very common with the Germans , is the attempt to combine in the same political system certain inviolable natural rights of individual citizens with an unlimited authority on the part of the sovereign . Hobbes and Rousseau , while differing so much in their views , agree in attributing absolute authority to the sovereign power in the state , and declare that the rights of the subject are created by and are dependent upon its will . Locke , on the other hand , starts with certain natural legal rights possessed by the citizens as individuals , limits the authority of the sovereign power accordingly , and maintains that any attempt on its part to violate these rights is itself unlawful . But the Germans , in trying to reconcile the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens , only puzzle themselves afresh with the old conundrum , What would happen if an irresistible force should meet an immovable obstacle ? I have said that these peculiarities of thought can be to some extent explained by the political condition of the German race . The people had been so long unaccustomed to taking any part in the discussion of public affairs , and were so unused to transacting judicial business on juries , etc. , that , with a type of mind naturally metaphysical , they very easily fell into an excessively abstract and theoretical , as distinguished from a positive and practical , way of looking at political problems . It is but natural that the German philosopher should not clearly separate the study of law as it is from the study of law as it should be , and this is but a step from the confusion of law and morality . It is but natural , also , that he should not appreciate the bearing of public policy on legal questions , and should strive to found his legal system on a priori reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' we should find a characteristic yearning in the German mind for an internal juristic necessity for law . The introduction of the Roman law probably contributed in some degree to these results ; for it is to be observed that this i Holmes on the Common Law , page 207. // law did not come to the Germans as it did to the Romans , in the form of a slow growth , but was received as a complete system , and was accepted not on account of the veneration which is derived from long habit and association , but because the German jurists believed in the inherent justice of its principles . For a person who confuses the positive law with law as it should be , it is natural to confuse the rights which the subject ought to have with those rights which he actually possesses , and we are not much surprised to find such a person asserting at one moment that the subject has certain inviolable natural rights , and at another that the authority of the sovereign is unlimited . Moreover , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a highly developed sense of individuality , and yet during the period of which we are speaking they lived under autocratic governments . We see in their writings , therefore , an almost pathetic longing for personal independence coupled with an unconquerable respect for the established authorities . Kant was , perhaps , the most German of the Germans , and in his writings the qualities to which I have referred are to be found very fully developed . He published his first political treatise in 1793 , at the age of sixty-nine , as one of a series of essays upon the proverb , " That may be all very well in theory , but it will not work in practice . " The humor of discussing the social compact under such a title was unfortunately lost upon the author , who attempted to show that although such a compact could not be looked upon as an actual fact , yet as a theory it was the basis of certain political principles which ought to be acted upon in practice . The only other treatise of much importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Theory of Law , published in 1796 , and deeply influenced by the writings of Rousseau . Kant begins his first treatise with the remark that the contract by means of which a commonwealth is formed differs from all other contracts of association in this : that while the latter are made for various purposes , the former is the only one which is its own object . The object of the social compact , therefore , is not the promoting of the happiness of the contracting parties , but merely the institution of a commonwealth ; that is , the creation of a condition of things in which the members are possessed of legal rights , and he defines right in his own lucid way , as the limitation of the freedom of each man on the condition that it is consistent with the freedom of every other man , as far as this is possible according to universal laws . The foundations upon which alone a commonwealth can be erected in accordance with the pure rational principles of human rights are the liberty , equality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall explain later , but the others require immediate attention . The purpose for which a commonwealth is instituted being merely the creation of the rights of its members , and not the direct promotion of their happiness , no man can be compelled to be happy in any particular manner , but each man has a right to pursue his own happiness in the way he thinks best , so long as he does not interfere with the right of eveiy other man to do likewise in accordance with the universal law . This is that liberty to which every member of the community is entitled as a man . Any attempt , therefore , on the part of the government to treat its subjects as children , and provide for their happiness , is the worst possible despotism . The equality of the members of the community follows naturally , as a corollary from their liberty , and may be expressed by saying that each man has the same rights against every other man , the sovereign only excepted , that every other man has against him . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in property , and even in rank ; for it is not necessary that the actual rights of every man should be the same , but only that there should be no legal barrier to prevent any man from acquiring the property and rights , or rising to the position enjoyed by another member of the community . Kant declares , therefore , that rank and privilege can not be hereditary , but must be open to every person who , by his talent , diligence , and good fortune , is capable of attaining to them . Now one would naturally suppose , after such a discussion , that Kant regarded the right to liberty and equality as in reality a right , and that in his opinion an act of the sovereign which violated this right would be unlawful , and might be resisted by the subject . But the fact is that so far we have been considering only the immovable , without taking account of the irresistible , and in this case it is the latter which carries the day . For although Kant appears to base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the premise that it is only to himself that a man can do no wrong , declares that no one can have power to legislate for a community except by virtue of a fundamental law resting on the universal will of the people , and that even the right of the majority to bind the minority can derive its force only from an original contract agreed to by every one , yet he regards the social compact not as the actual foundation of law , but merely as a theory , giving rise to certain principles to which laws ought to conform . He goes so far , indeed , as to condemn the notion that any social contract was actually made on the ground that such a doctrine encourages the idea of popular sovereignty , and gives rise to insurrection and rebellion ; and while 1 It is impossible to render correctly the German word gerecht , which does not distinctly imply whether the act in question is right from a legal or from a moral point of view . in one place he argues strongly in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that , for pracifeal purposes , the origin of the supreme power is unsearchable by the people who are subjected to it , and that to throw doubt upon it is a crime . Kant , however , does not look on the social compact as a mere idle theory . In fact , the object of one of his treatises appears to be to show its practical importance ; not , indeed , in establishing rights , but in furnishing a rule by which to test the rectitude of laws . He states the test in this way : If a law is so made that it is impossible that a whole people should give its assent to it ( a law conferring hereditary privileges , for example ) , then the law is not just 1 but if such an assent is merely possible , then the law must . be held to be just . This test , however , is useful only as a guide to the law-giver , and it is not to be applied by the subjects , who have in all cases no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this test , and even if he violates the original contract , the subjects are not justified in resisting him ; because the sovereign being by definition supreme in the state , there can be no higher power to decide controversies between him and his subjects , or to enforce the rights of the latter . It is only by submission to his universal law-giving will that a condition in which legal rights exist is possible at all , and to resist the sovereign , therefore , is to bring about a state of things where all right ceases , or at least where it can no longer have any effect , and this is in the highest degree unlawful . If such assertions as these , Kant says , draw upon him the reproach of flattering monarchs to excess , he hopes that he may be spared the accusation of too much favoring the people when he maintains , in No doubt the absence of words clearly distinguishing between moral and legal right is partly cansed by , and has helped to aggravate , the confusion of the Germans upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain certain indestructible rights against the sovereign , and he stigmatizes as horrible Hobbes 's doctrine that the sovereign can do no injustice to the subject . But a closer investigation shows that his own views do not differ very much from those which he abhors , except that he objects to calling a spade a spade , and ilobbes does not ; for these indestructible rights - which , by the way , only entitle the subject to express his opinion in public affairs and to make a statement of his grievances - are not enforceable ( *wan*'srecht ) , and depend for their exercise entirely on the good will of the sovereign . Kant discusses at some length the rightful form of government , meaning by that not the form which alone can rightfully command the obedience of its subjects , but the only form of government constructed according to pure principles of right , and serving as a model which all others ought gradually to be made to resemble . He accepts to its fullest extent the principle of the separation of the legislative , executive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the people or their representatives . It is in this connection that the curious doctrine of the self-sufficiency of the citizen , to which I have already referred , becomes of importance , for , in Kant 's opinion , all the citizens are not capable of taking part in legislation , but only those who are self-supporting and therefore independent ; and in this category he does not mean to include all persons who are supported by their own exertions , but distinguishes between those who give their labor for hire and those who bestow their labor upon articles which they afterwards sell , - the former having no right to vote , while the latter are in the fullest sense citizens . The separation of powers does not afford , it appears , a sufficient security to the citizen , and we must never forget the fundamental axiom that it is only to himself that a man can do no wrong . Any person , therefore , who is set to judge may do an injustice , and the people ought to judge themselves by a jury taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaves to the court the questions of law . This is a strange application of Rousseau 's fiction that every one in the state legislates only upon himself . When Kant proceeds to discuss the criminal law , the characteristic yearning of the German mind seizes him with great violence , and rejecting indignantly all motives of expediency , he seeks an internal juristic necessity drawn from the nature of the crime itself . He finds it in the principle of equality that one ought to incline no more to one side than to another , and says , therefore , whatever wrong you have done to another , that you must do to yourself . It would take too long to explain here how , from this doctrine of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth , he deduces the fact that imprisonment is the appropriate punishment for theft , but it is obvious that death is the proper retribution for murder . So severe is he in the application of this intrinsic justice that he considers it a crime to allow a murderer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the consent of every member , to break up and disperse , the last murderer in prison must be executed before they do so , in order that the guilt of violating justice may not fall upon the people . A friend of mine has suggested that if this principle were so extended as to keep the community together until all the other criminals in jail had served out their sentences , it would probably have the desirable effect of preventing the community from breaking up at all . The theory of the social compact appears to have had a peculiar fascination for the German mind , for it was taken up by Kant 's successors , and it is only quite recently that it has been finally abandoned by them . We have traced the history of this ex // traordinary theory from the time of its first appearance at the end of the sixteenth century , and we have seen it used to support the most divergent doctrines and the most conflicting opinions ; and in fact , like certain ingenious Yankee inventions , it was capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to none . No better example , indeed , can be found of the fact so strongly urged by Lecky that men are chiefly persuaded , not by the logical force of arguments , but by the disposition with which they view them . We have seen the theory started by a zealous churchman to uphold his church . We have seen it wielded by Hobbes in favor of absolute monarchy in England . We have then seen it taken up by Locke as a shield to individual right and in defense of the limitation of the constitution ; and later still by Rousseau , as an argument for an unbridled democracy . We have seen its working here on the constitution of Massachusetts ; and after lighting the world for two centuries , we have seen it give a last despairing flicker in the courts of the United States , and fade away in the dim light of German metaphysics . It now remains for us to mark the causes of its rise and fall . To the Greeks and to those of the Romans who looked at jurisprudence from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of morals ; and this explains the absence among the ancients of any attempt to discover a special basis for the obligation of legal duties . When the Teutonic race , on the other hand , first appeared on the borders of the Roman Empire , it was still in that early stage of civilization in which the rightfulness of existing institutions is assumed without question ; in which it is enough that no one remembers a time when things were otherwise , and custom undisputed has the force of law . Under these circumstances legislation is unknown , and the slow change which takes place in the laws is brought about through the administration of justice and the exercise of those powers which we should class to-day among the executive functions of government . During the course of the Middle Ages , as the political needs of the day developed and were better understood , the idea of legislation as something distinct from administration , and as an intentional change in the existing law , begins to appear , but the form which it assumes is characteristic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ideas from the writings of the Roman jurists , asserted at quite an early period that the king was the source of all legislative power ; but underlying this doctrine and constantly cropping up we find the principle that any change in the law requires the consent of those whom it concerns . Such a claim was almost universal in the matter of taxation , and even on questions of general legislation it was constantly recurring where the change was clearly seen to affect anything more than the mere administration of the law . Now it must be remembered that in feudal times little or no distinction was made between public and private rights . All right , from that of the king to demand from his vassal an aid to ransom him from captivity , to that of the smallest land-owner to exact a heriot on the death of his tenant , was looked upon as private property . It was but natural , therefore , that an innovation in the law should be considered to require the consent of those whose property was to be affected by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid , " or a change in the established custom of the realm , and this idea can not be better expressed than in the famous saying of Edward I. : " That which toucheth all shall be allowed of all . " The conceptions of the Mid Ages upon this subject , therefore , were not of a character to excite political speculation , had that been an easy thing to arouse in those days , because the rightfulness of all property // was assumed without question , and of course there could be no doubt of the right of every man to dispose of his own . When , however , the Renaissance gave a new impulse to thought , and men began to distinguish more accurately between public authority and private right , it was unavoidable that they should investigate the rightfulness of that authority , and even inquire about the origin of property . The question , therefore , presented itself : Whence has a government a right to compel a man to act against his will , and what gives the binding force to law ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was to ascribe a divine origin to government ; but this view of the matter , for reasons which I have already explained , became monopolized by one school of political thinkers , and consequently discredited among those who did not agree with their tenets . One other solution of the difficulty suggested itself , and that was the consent of the person interested ; for clearly a man can not be wronged by an act to which he has freely consented , and what easier than to suppose a universal compact made at some remote period , by which every one consented to the institution of a government , and agreed to be bound by the laws enacted by it ? Such a contract appeared , therefore , to many men the only way of accounting for the rightfulness of government , and its existence was assumed without hesitation ; for anarchists being few in those times , every one was constrained to allow the lawfulness of some government or other , and when belief is indispensable it is easy to believe . In this way the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet it contained within itself the seeds of its own destruction , because if the theory were logically carried out , each man , when he came of age , ought to have a right , as Locke maintained , to sever his connection with the body politic and declare his freedom from its laws ; but such a doctrine , greatly impairing , as it must , the effect of the theory , and giving a constant encouragement to lawlessness , could not be admitted for a moment . The theory , moreover , rested on the assumption that a contract is binding in a state of nature when other rights do not exist , but such an assumption , although plausible , is clearly seen to be false by any one who will take pains to think about it . Spinoza and Leibnitz pointed this out in the earlier days of the discussion , but the tide was too strong to be stemmed at that time . As a matter of history , indeed , it is well known to students of the early forms of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not developed until long after the right to property is well established . But undoubtedly the chief causes of the decline of the theory were the change in the general tone of thought from speculative to positive , and the complete absurdity of such a compact from an historical point of view , - an absurdity which became more evident as a knowledge of semi-barbarous races became more extensive . It may well be doubted whether any one ever believed in the making of an actual compact of this kind by people in a state of nature . Just imagine a crowd of half-naked savages grouped around an ancient oak , while an old chief under its boughs explains to them that they have reached the point when it is advisable to form a civil body politic , and that it is proposed to agree , among other things , that when they become sufficiently civilized to understand the meaning of king , lords , and commons and to appreciate the benefits of taxation , then the king shall not have power to levy any tax without the consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shields in token of universal approval , and breaking up with a further understanding that the sacredness of the social compact shall instantly be made an article of the state religion .
