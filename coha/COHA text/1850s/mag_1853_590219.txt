txt THE INAUGURAL . TuE fourth of March , 1853 , like the fourth of July , 1776 , was the commencement , as we firmly hope and believe , of a new era in the history of the United States . The democracy have resumed their empire , and the destinies of the country have again , under Providence , passed into their hands . Will the sceptre again pass from their hands , or will it survive as an inheritance to posterity ? They have vanquished their adversaries , but their adversaries are neither subdued nor overcome . Parties founded on principles inherent in the nature of man and the constitution of society , never die . Like the seeds of plants that lie dormant in the earth for years , perhaps for ages , though they may not vegetate , they do not lose the inherent principle of life , and only require the vivifying influence of the sun to awaken them to a new and vigorous existence . Our democratic fellow-laborers may aolace themselves with the idea , that the Whig party is broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase , " horse , foot , and dragoons . " But they are greatly mistaken . It may be disorganized , but they may be assured , it is neither dead , dying , nor asleep . It may be dislocated in its limbs , but it is animated by one soul ; and there is still among all its parts a moral affinity , a magnetic attraction , which will as certainly bring them together again , as the needle points to the pole . They have still a North star // by which they will steer . They have certain great principles of action by which they are inseparably combined , and nothing is more dangerous to the ascendancy of the democratic party than the conviction that the late victory has secnred it a permanent ascendancy . Though the majority of General Pierce in the Electoral College is greater than that of any of his predecessors , with the exception of Washington and Monroe , the latter of whom was almost unanimously elected in consequence of an understanding that he was to be succeeded by Mr. John Quincy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of the popular vote was not great . Had the Abolitionists who gave their votes to Mr. Hale , rallied in favor of General Scott , it would have been still less . In many of the States the parties were almost equally divided , and a feather would have turned the scale in favor of the Whig candidate . The victory is therefore not decisive as to the future , and whether its effects will be anything like permanent remains yet to be seen . It will depend on the course pursued by the victors . One of the first and greatest difficulties presented to a new administration , is a discrimination between conflicting applicants for office . Whatever may be the desire and intention of the Ex*cutive , it is impossible he should be able to weigh the merits of any man in a just and equitable balance . He can not know every applicant personally , and if he did , no man is known until he is tried , and found capable of performing his duties , and withstanding temptation . He must , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recommendations of others in whom he has confidence ; and we all know , how many secret springs operate to induce men to lend their influence in such cases . Sometimes they yield to mere importunity ; sometimes to views of personal interest , and still more freqnently , perhaps , to feelings of friendship or disintere*ted good-will . The President will necessarily be sometimes wilfully , at others , unwittingly misled and deceived ; and there is perhaps , no act of Executive power more calculated to injure his standing with the people than the appointment of a man incapable of performing his duties , or who abuses the opportunities thus afforded him to purposes of fraud , and appropriates to himself what beloAgs to his country . Without meaning to intrude our opinion on the President , we would respectfully recommend one rule we consider almost infallible , namely , always to select the candidate least clamorous and importunate . It has been said by a Chief Magistrate , who spoke from . // experience , that in almost every appointment he made one hollow friend , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were disappointed in their expectations . The appointing power is a two-edged sword , and cuts both ways . It is a source of weakness as well as of strength ; and hence the longer an administration lasts , the more enemies it has to encounter in the multiplication of disappointed candidates . Further than this . To gain a victory is less difficult than to divide the spoils ; and a defeated party is more likely to be concentrated for the purpose of retrieving its disaster , than a victorious one in retaining its conquests . For these reasons , and many others that might be adduced , we repeat the opinion that the future ascendancy of the Democratic party , entirely depends on the course of the new administration . What this will be , is clearly and distinctly presented in the Inaugural Address of Mr. Pierce , on which we propose to offer a few brief remarks : The Address commences with an allusion to a late severe domestic calamity , so unaffected , so brief , and so touching , that we scarcely ever saw , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy , or more strikingly exemplifying the emptiness of all human grandeur . In the proudest moment of his life , when speaking to a great people , who by theif ' voluntary suffrages had placed him at their head , we behold the man thus elevated to as high a station as man can occupy , not triumphing in success , but mourning in sackcloth and in ashes the loss of an only son , an only child . The spectacle presents a moral , teaching us how much more of human happiness depends on those domestic affections which God hath implanted in the heart of man , than on all the outward trappings of office , or even the more substantial sweets of power . We know not how it may have struck others , but to us , it seems that this brief reference to a calamity so calculated to awaken the most solemn and affecting associations* gives us assurance that no man , at the moment of appealing to such an awful and inscrutable act of God , would dare to promise what he did not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do not doubt him . We place implicit faith in his integrity and his sincerity . We hold him to be one of those . just men , who in morals and politics , in public and in private affairs , believes , and will practice on the belief-that " honesty is the best policy , " and that an honest man , is indeed " the noblest work of God . " After briefly referring to the high duties imposed on the United States ; namely , affording an example of the blessings // of freedom , by not abusing them , and placing*them within reach of allmankind , **28;510;TOOLONG tbe disinherited children of the world ; and after solemnly inculeating strict justice to all nations , most especially the sister States of this continent , the President proceeds . briefly to touch on the subject of the " expansion " of the confederation . The stars upon your banner have become nearly threefold their original number , your densely-populated possessions skirt the shores of the two great oceans , and yet this vast increase of people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonious action of the States and the Federal government in their respective constitutional spheres , but has afforded an additional guarantee of the strength and integrity of both . With an experience thus suggestive and cheering , the policy of my ad*ninistration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion . Indeed , it is not to be disguised , that our attitude as a nation , and our position on the globe , render the acquisition of certain possessions not within our jurisdiction , eminently important for our protection , if not , in the future , essential for the preservation of the tights of commerce and the peace of the worl&amp; Should they be obtained , it will be through no grasping spirit , but with a view to obvious national interest and security , and in a manner entirely consistent with the strictest observance of national faith . We have nothing in our history or position to invite aggression : we have everything to beckon us to the cultivation of relations of peace and amity with all nations . Purposes , therefore , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of our foreign affairs . " As this is a subject of vast moment , and on which both parties and *ections will undoubtedly differ ; we shall take this . occasion to offer our views on the subject , not with any design or expectation of influencing the course of government on that ; point ; but that being as yet uncommitted , our readers and pa-* trons may know precisely our position . The Southern States . having been " compromised " out of their share of the territory , . partly purchased by their blood , partly by their treasure , and having every reason to apprehend , that they will in like manner be compromised out of all share in any future acquisition , are naturally disinclined to become parties in making them , because they see in an extension of territory , only an extension . of that power which may , and in all probability will becom&amp; only the more dangerous to their future interests and safety as . a constituent portion of the Union . They are therefore naturally , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this is one of the fruits of abolition . Should circumstances ever so imperative require the government of the United States to take possession , or receive the annexation of any territory , most especially towards the South , with a single exception , it will be opposed by that section from motives so strong as to overcome all other considerations except that of the general safety of the country . We have no // doubt of this , because it is perfectly natural , and , in our opinion , perfectly justifiable . They have interests at stake so vitally important to their personal property , and the safety of themselves aud families , that they must and will , and should supersede all other considerations . It will thus be seen that abolition has , and will continue to have , not only great influence on our domestic but on our foreign policy . One section will oppose the expansion of the United States on the southern portion of this continent , because according to the decision of Congress , its most important institution can not subsist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cuba , come how it may , because that institution already exists there , and must be recognized as an indispensable preliminary to annexation . Thus , in addition to other causes of domestic dissension , abolition has paralyzed the national arm in its most important point of foreign policy . We shall , ere long , see this more clearly exemplified . Were it not for this unfortunate state of things , that faSulty of expansion which is , as it were , the destiny of the United States , because it has an unoccupied world for its sphere of action , would continue to be , as it has hitherto been , the great instrmillent not only of our power but our happiness and freedom . Whenever the United States become as overburdened with population as Europe now is , with the exception of IRussia , the people will require the same system of government , and the same standing armies to enforce its authority . So long as the hive can swarm and the young bees find honey and a home elsewhere , all will go well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and set them scuffling for bread , and struggling for elbow room , and those daring adventurous spirits which are so dangerous to most communities , for want of an appropriate sphere of action , and so beneficial to the United States , because here it is without bounds , will require a strait-waistcoat , an armed police , a standing army , and all the jealous policy of cowardly despotism t'o restrain them . When the present limits of the United States comprise a population as crowded as that of China , the people will become little better than the Chinese , or those of Europe , who are like pigs ; only feed them well , and you have no more squeaking . They do n't mind the ring in their noses . For these reasons , we deeply regret that abolition has thrown almost inseparable obstacles in the way of that great faculty of expansion which might , and almost surely would otherwise have borne on its irresistible current the blessings // of freedom , plenty and happiness , over all this vast continent , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood ; not by force , but by example ; not by subjugating , but setting it free . Almost every sentence of this remarkable address conveys a maxim or a moral . " No example , " he says , " can be powerful for lasting good which is not based upon eternal principles of right and justice . " " An administration would be unworthy of confidence at home or respect abroad should it cease to be influenced by the conviction that no apparent advantage can be purchased at a price so dear as that of national wrong or dishonor . " Speaking of public officers , he says , " They , the people , require at my hands diligence , integrity and capacity wherever there are duties to be performed . Without these qualities in public servants , more stringent laws for the prevention or punishment of fraud , negligence and peculation , will be vain . With them , they will be unnecessary . " This is a most important truth . It is vain to pass laws unless you have honest men to execute them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office either by prevention or punishment . Laws never make mem honest ; and where the temptation is great it is more difficult to restrain a rogue than to hold an eel by the tail . There is plenty of talent in this country for performing the duties of every public office , and all that is wanted is a little  --  or rather a great deal more honesty-for , mortifying as it may be to the pride of every American , we are compelled to admit that at present the possession of office seems to be valued only as it affords an opportunity to sport with the public interests , and pocket the public money . " Galphinism " seems to pervade all classes , and if men can only escape the law , and avoid restitution , they appear not to care to what degree they may have become objects of public contempt and abhorrence . We most earnestly hope the President , to whom , as his highest duty , the constitution has committed the execution of the laws of the land , will deal out*inexorable , unrelent- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence and cheats his country . The impunity hitherto enjoyed by these , the worst species of criminals , is either a disgrace to the laws or those who administer them . The President proceeds to warn us against a concentration of the powers of the general government in a confederation so vast as ours : " The great scheme of our constitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power between the States and Federal authorities ; and experience // has shown , that the harmony and happiness of our people must depend upon a just discrimination between the separate rights and responsibilities of the States , and your common rights and obligations under the general governxnent . And here , in my opinion , are the considerations which should form the true basis of future concord in regard to the questions which have most seriously disturbed public tranquillity . " If the Federal government will confine itself to the exercise of powers clearly granted by the Constitution , it can hardly happen that its action upon any question should endanger the institutions of the States , or interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will of their own people . " This is perhaps as far as a chief Magistrate should go in an inaugural address , unless he has been elected with reference to any special principles or points of general policy . Unfortunately-as we think-adherence to the compromise has become of more consequence than adherence to the great fundamental principles of the ancient and venerable old Democracy , as understood by its acknowledged organs and representatives in days of yore . Of that compromise we shall only say , that having been acquiesced in-if not approvedby those who have most reason to complain , and we ourselves having given in our adhesion , in our Inaugural , we shall continue to stand on that basis ; nor will we ever wantonly disturb it unless when others set the example . While the abolitionists rerjiain quiescent , we will be so . But should they again attempt to infringe on what we believe to be the constitutional rights of the South , so far from promising silence , we hereby pledge ourselves to stand by their side in the last ditch-if they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presumed , that while new efforts are every day making , both at home and abroad , to keep alive and administer fresh fuel to the fires of fanaticism , the South and its friends will be silent as to the present and the future , because they have acquiesced in the past . The only condition of that silence is the silence of others ; and the only pledge to submission depends for its fulfilment on their being never hereafter called on to resist . Thus at once we define our position . We will leave it to others to disturb the compromise , but when once disturbed we shall assuredly mingle in the troubled waters . The precise line of distinction between the conceded and reserved rights of the States of this confederation , like that which separates the two colors black and white , is one of those nice points on which men have differed , and always will differ . For want of something more definite , one party advocates a strict , the other a liberal or latitudinarian construction of the constitution . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution on which the two parties differ materially , but these are capable of such distottion as to involve the very spirit and essence of the entire system of our government . It is on these , therefore , the two great parties have heretofore fought their battles in a great nieasure , until , as previously observed , superseded by the compromises : To those who are really and honestly desirous of knowing what powers were meant to be conferred on the general government , and what retained by the States individually , we would earnestly recommend an attentive perusal of the Report of the proceedings of the convention that framed the constitution as taken down immediately after by Mr. Madison , one of the great framers of that instrument . They will there see what the States meant to give and what they meant to withhold . The President , in the preceding extract , has declared himself a strict constructionist , and this is going as far as could be expected in an inaugural address . What he understands by strict construction will more distinctly appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believe the commentary will strictly accord with the texts . The foreign policy of the President is thus briefly sketched : " The great objects of our pursuit , as a people , are best to be obtained by peace , aud ire entirely consistent with the tranquillity and interests of the rest of mankind . With the neighboring nations upon our continent , we should cultivate kindly and fraternal relations . We can desire nothing in regard to them so much , as to see them consolidate their strength , and pursue the paths of prosperity and happiness . If , in the course of their growth , we should open new channels of trade , and create additional facilities for friendly intercourse , the benefits realized will be equal and mutual . Of the complicated European systems of national polity we have heretofore been independent . From their wars , their tumults and anxieties , we have been , happily , almost entirely exempt . Whilst these are confined to the nations which gave them existence , and within their legitimate jurisdiction , they can not affect us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of human freedom and universal advancement . But the vast interests of commerce are common to all mankind , and the advantacres of trade and international intercourse must always present a noble field for the moral influence of a great people . With these views firmly and honestly carried out , we have a right to expect , and shall under all circumstances require , prompt reciprocity . The rights , which belong to us as a nation , are not alone to be regarded , but those which pertain to every citizen in his individual capacity , at home and abroad , must be sacredly maintained . So long as he can discern every star in its place upon that ensign , without wealth to purchase for him preferment , or title to secure for him place , it will be his privilege , and must be his acknowledged right , to stand unabashed eves in the presence of princes , with a proud consciousness that he is himself one of a nation of sovereigns , and that he can not , in a legitimate pursuit , wander so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall leave behind in the place which I now occupy , will not see that no rude hand of power or tyrauideal passion is laid upon him with impunity. // He must realize , that upon every sea , and on every soil where our enterprise may rightfully seek the protection of our flag , American titizenship is an inviolable panoply for the security of American rights . And , in this connection , it can hardly be necessary to reaffirm a principle which should now be regarded as fundamentaL The rights , security , and repose of this Confederacy reject the idea of interference or colonization , on this side of the ocean , by any foreign power , beyond present jurisdiction , as utterly inadmissible . " We have here a *clear explicit pledge , that while the President will studiously refrain from all intervention in the relations of the powers of Europe with each other , or with those of sovereigns with their people , he will use every effort to resist any such intervention on the part of those powers in the affairs of neighboring States on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old system of colonization in any form or under any disguise whatever . In addition to this , we have a similar pledge in behalf of the safety of every American citizen everywhere , and at all times , while in pursuit of his lawful business . We hope and believe that this pledge extends to all American vessels navigating the high seas , and places a veto on the insolent pretensions of England and France to board , search , and if they please , carry into foreign ports , for trial and condemnation , any vessel under the American flag , on the mere suspicion of a design to disturb the repose of a neighboring people . It is hoped this attempt to revive the old *IRight of Search under a new pretext , will be now met by a prompt resistance , that is to say , a direct and positive assurance that it will not be submitted to by the government and people of the United States . We believe the United States are now in a position , where the assertion of a right , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will prevent a war . On the contrary , submission will only serve to encourage other powers to make advances , from which they , at least , imagine they can not recede without dishonor . With regard to the most important question of all , that of slavery , the President is sufficiently explicit . He believes that " involuntary servitude , as it exists in different States of this confederacy , is recognized by the constitution , " and that these States are entitled to efficient remedies to enforce the provisions of the constitution . He " holds that the laws of 1850 , commonly called the compromise , are strictly constitutional , and to be unhesitatingly carried into effect , " *nd finally declares , " Such have been , and are my convictions , and on those I shall act . I fervently hope that the question is at rest , and that no sectional , or ambitious , or fanatical ex // citement may again threaten the durability of our institutions , or obscure the light of our prosperity . " The position here taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world by the Democratic Convention , by which General Pierce was nominated . That Convention consisted of delegates from every section of the country , and every section of the Democratic party , not excepting that which had most strenuously opposed that very compromise , the finality of which was now made the cine qua of unity of action among all sections . Under these circumstances , we do not see how any Democrat can take exception to them without renouncing his allegiance to the party . It is too late now to take exceptions , even were we so inclined . The pledge has been given , that if the President administer the government on the principles asserted by the Convention , by which he was nominated , the Democratic party is bound in honor to give him its zealous undivided support . There is , we perceive , on looking back , one very important portion of the Inaugural we have omitted to notice in its due order . We allude to the subject of a national militia . The President , after paying a well-merited tribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the regular army , expresses the opinion verified by all past experience , that the maintenaiice of large standing armies in the United States would be not only dangerous , but unnecessary . The army , he says , " as organized , must be the nucleus around which , in every time of need , the strength of your military power , the bulwark of your defence  --  a national militia-may be formed into a well-disciplined and efficient organization . " We are pleased to see such sentiments emanating from such a quarter . The dangers arising from great standing armies to the liberties of nations , appear thickly strewed in almost every page of history , and the present condition of the people of Europe , pinned to the earth by the bayonets of two millions of hireling soldiers , furnishes an example of the invariable result of nations depending not on their own martial spirit , and patriotic devotion to their country , but on standing armies , composed of soldiers , who , whether in a free or despotic government , are equally the slaves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Sovereign . Such instruments always have been , and in the end always will be turned into the tools of despotic power . There are many instances of their defending their country against foreign invaders , but none of their ever giving freedom to a people ; nor should it ever be forgotten by the // citizens of the United States , that , but for the pure unsullied virtue of Washington , and his influence over ttie minds of men , those very soldiers who had just achieved the independence of their country , might have become the instruments of destroying its liberties . The people of a great and free nation are able to defend themselves . " The blood of Douglas can protect itself " and no nation can long preserve its liberties , that falls asleep under the protection of a standing army . They invariably lose every particle of that martial spirit without which no people can preserve their freedom at home or maintain their rights abroad . Since the disbanding of the militia of England , that country has become internally one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliable defence but its navy . It has no resource but to prevent invasion ; to quell it in a formidable shape , very little dependence can be placed on the people . A country of such vast dimensions as the United States can only be defended by the people . Armies and navies must be concentrated ; the people are everywhere . It is not necessary to sow dragon 's teeth , to have armed men spring up in the United States . Almost every native citizen has the rudiments of a soldier in his heart , and in his habits . He is accustoned to the use of a gun from his youth , and there is no civilized people on the face of the earth who can be so speedily converted into any shape for which they are required . To this the experience of General Pierce bears ample testimony ; and without similar experience , we give it as the result of our observation ; that under the instruction and lead of officers bred at West Point , the United States could , in three months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance of its rights , a hundred , ay hundreds of thousands of volunteer militia , that with the instructions of these officers , and the example of a few regulars , would , as by magic , be converted into soldiers capable of , coping with the disciplined armies of Europe . Such men could never be converted into instruments for robbing their fellow citizens of liberty , because they would be citizens themselves . They would not be permanently divorced from the habits of early life , and the domestic affections , and would always feel that in enslaving others , they were placing the ring in their own noses . The United States must either have an organized militia , or a great standing army . The constitution , notwithstanding the jealousies of the States on that head , has given to // Congress the power to effect such an organizati*n , but , it is presumed , from an apprehension that such a measure would be unpopular , that body has hitherto neglected the performance of that most important duty . If the people of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only disuse , but contempt , they must make up their minds to bear the expenses , and incur the danger of a great standing army . In order to maintain the independence and the rights of their country , they must have either one or the other . The United States are at peace at present , and long may they remain so , if it can be maintained with honor . But let no nation , hug itself in the delusive fool 's paradise of perpetual peace . It is the lot of nations , and if all the world were to turn Quakers , though they might not fight , they would cry " mad dog I " and run each other down , under pretence of self-defence , or common danger . There is a simple , brief , directness , as well as an earnest tone of seriousness running through this admirable address , which all combined bespeak sincerity . The principle omissions we notice are , the Tariff , Internal Improvements , and Corporate bodies . Each of these involves great Democratic principles , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have r*o hesitation in saying that , if not arrested forthwith , they will at no distant period undermine and overthrow the entire system of our government , or at least render it the mere fieshless skeleton of a Democracy . But as both conventions agreed in confining themselves on these points , to loose generalities , we presume the President did not deem it necessary to mention them , especially as it is no easy matter for any man to define his position precisely in respect to these matters . We . were , however , pleased to see that old obsolete word Economy , peeping forth once more . We do n't mean that new fashioned Economy , which consists in skinning flints , paring away a few dollars from the salaries of a few poor clerks , who have scarcely sufficient to maintain the decencies of life , while giving away millions of acres and millions of money to speculators in railroads and lines of mail steamers . This is not what we mean ; and it is precisely this species of economy we hope the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his constitutional power . There are times when Legislative Bodies become so radically corrupt , or so infatuated with some extravagant fanatical excitement , that the only safety to the people rests in the virtue and firmness of the Executive . We do not say , that time has already come , but we think it looks as if it were coming fast upon us , and that // the great Representative System which has been considered one of the most important improvements in the sciencg of modern government , is in imminent danger of becoming one of the most insidious , dangerous , and powerful of all the instruments ever devised for introducing corruption into governments , and robbing mankind of their most substantial liberties . The veto power is not only Republican but strictly Democratic . It is an appeal to the people , and leaves to them the decision . We feel almost assured General Pierce will not shrink from the exercise of this great conservative power , and that he will be President in more than name . His right to veto a Law , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is indispensable to maintain the balance of the separate branches of the Government , and it brings home every great questions to the final decision of the People . We do not mean , by this , that the people should become legislators , because they have delegated that power to others , and unless , in the case of the organic law , can only indirectly influence legislation . But in all cases , not coming within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court , and bringing the two branches of government into direct collision , it is their province to decide between them by the exercise of their great fundamental prerogative of choosing their representatives . It was thus , and only thus , tilat in re-electing Andrew Jackson , they pronounced the final doom of the Bank of the United States . Without the exercise of the veto power , there would be no effectual restraint on legislation . It would become absolute , and it was not the design of the framers of the constitution , that absolute uncontrolled power should be lodged in any single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is despotism by whatever name it may be called . The assent of the President is indispensable to every law and the  |p6wer  to consent , implies that of refusal . When Henry Clay , in a paroxysm of passion at the disappointment of a favorite measure , attempted to nullify this power , he aimed a fatal blow at the vitality of the whole system of government , which , had it been successful , would have placed it wholly in the hands of the two Houses of Congress , and converted the Representatives of the whole people of the United States into a mere register of the edicts of a co-ordinate branch . It was solely by the exercise of the veto power that the people have been protected from the domination of a great concentrated moneyed power , and from a system of internal improvements , which would not only have absorbed a great portion of the resources of the Government , but have been fatal to the rights of // the States , by bribing them into their relinquishment . An issue between the Executive and Legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have occurred , and will again occur , occasions when the consequences of avoiding it , will be far more mischievous and dangerous , than any that can arise from resorting to extreme measures . The veto is a power which should not be exercised without strong , almost imperative reasons , but at the same time it is , we think , a power which should not always lie dormant . It is not a mere feather in the cap of the President , but a necessary substantial prop to his constitutional functions , and it is , we think , his duty to exercise that power whenever lie deems it necessary to the welfare or safety of the Republic . The appearance and deportment of Mr. Pierce , at the Inauguration , was such as made a deep and most favorable impression on the vast audience assembled to witness the ceremony . He pronounced his admirable address with an earnest , dignified sincerity , in the highest degree impressive , and which gave testimony that he meant what he said . It was evident that the assembled multitudes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the least pleasing feature in this simple , yet sublime spectacle , was the presence of the gentlemam* who officiated at a ceremony , which , at the moment of its occurrence , divested him of his station and authority . It was honorable to the country ; honorable to the spirit of republicanism ; and doubly honorable to Mr. Fillmore as a proof of high-souled magnanimity . Though we have not approved his public course , we can not help confessing that in this last act of his public life , he has proved himself to be what is still better than a successful ruler , an amiable , and magnanimous gentleman . To his private and domestic virtues , we shall always be ready to bear our willing testimony , and we cordially wish him a long life of happiness and honor .
