txt ART . VIII . - Memorials of JOHN BARTRAM and LILJMPHRY MARSHALL , with Notices of their Botanical Contemporaries . By WILLIAM DARLINGTON , M. D. , LL . D. , &amp;c . Philadelphia : Lindsay &amp; Blakiston. 1849 . Svo. pp. 585 . THE name of John Bartram stands first on the long list of eminent men who have enwreathed their names with trophies from our North American Flora . He was the earliest explorer of the botanical wonders of the New World , from the then continuously wooded shores of Ontario and Cayuga to the source of the San Juan in Florida . The meagre sketches of his life , which have appeared in encyclopedias and biographical dictionaries , have made his name but lightly known to the public , though he has long been honored by the scientific world as the patriarch of hotany in America . He was the contemporary of Linnmeus , who considered him the best practk*al botanist of the age ; and while monuments have // been erected , medals struck , and memoirs written in commemoration of the Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of Bartram before he found a biographer . When standing under the splendid cypress planted by the patriarch 's own hands in the garden which , had it been duly preserved , would be his best monument , we hoped that some other memorial of him , equally interesting and more generally known , might yet appear and keep his memory green . This wish has now been fulfilled by the publication of his correspondence in a far more perfect form than could have been expected after the lapse of so many years . His letters are quaint and characteristic , and are written with delightful simplicity and frankness ; apart from their value as contributions to the history of natural science in this country , they throw more light upon the manners of the times and the character of the man , than could be derived from any formally prepared biography . The Bartram and Marshall Memorial is a handsomely printed octavo volume , with engraved illustrations representing the houses of both botanists , fac-similes of their handwriting , and the cup and gold medal that were presented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other by a society of gentlemen at Edinburgh . It is edited by an enthusiastic botanist , now nearly the Nestor of his brethren , who has passed his life near the locality where these pioneers of Amercan botany lived and died . Dr. Darlington is already favorably known to the public as the compiler of Reliquice Baidwiniane , and of a Flora of his own town and county . He has never lost sight of his favorite study amid the din and bustle of the other avocations in which he has been actively engaged ; and it is honorable to his feelings that he has given so much time to commemorating the services of those who preceded him in devotion to this delightful science . It is well that these papers came into the hands of one so able and desirous to do honor to the memory of the writers of them ; for if a few years more had passed , it seems that the curious might have sought in vain for any relics of them . The editor tells us that , - " These ancient manuscripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were generally much injured by time , and many of them scarcely legible ; so that it required no little care // and patient perseverance , to decipher and arrange them . This was especially the case with the letters from JOHN BARTRAM to his friends , of which letters he seems to have been in the habit of retaining the original rough draughts . It is , in fact , too probable , that if the opportunity thus kindly afforded by Colonel CARR and his lady had not been embraced , the portion of the correspond . ence here preserved would , cre long , have been scattered among the various branches of the family , and the recovery of it rendered wholly impracticable . " Dr. Darlington has performed his task with ability . The biographical notes are interesting , and though shorter than we could wish , are sufficiently explicit to give the reader a fair knowledge of the character and station of the persons to whom they relate . We think the harmony of the different portions of the book would have been better preserved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as it is , the letters which passed between Collinson and Bartram , extending from 1734 to 1768 , are placed first , and occupy about half of the volume . Bartram 's other correspondents were many of the most celebrated men of the last century , among whom may be mentioned Gronovius , Dillenius , Kalm , Sir Hans Sloane , Dr. Franklin , Dr. Fothergill , Miller , Catesby , and Wilson . We regret that none of Linn*us s letters have been preserved in the collection , although there are allusions to them by the other correspondents . Bartram says , " Linn*eus bath sent me the second edition of his Gitaracteres Flantarum with a very loving letter , desiring my correspondence , to furnish him with some natural curiosities of our country . I hope by next ship to send him some . " The Swedish naturalist was delighted with the plants he received from America , and often regretted that he could never visit this country , which then , in its vast unexplored regions , contained such treasures of natural history ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sending him specimens . John Bartrarn , the subject of these memoirs , was born in Darby , Pennsylvania , on the 23d of March , 1699 . He was the son of William Bartram , whose father , following the fortunes of William Penn , removed from Derbyshire , England , in 1682 . John Bartram inherited a farm near Darby from his uncle , and was bred a husbandman ; but he evinced in // early life an inclination for the study of physic and surgery , and as his biographer relates , " he even acquired so much knowledge in the practice of this latter science as to be very useful , and in many instances to give great relief , to his poorer neighbors , who were unable to apply for medicine and assistance to physicians of the city . It is extremely probable that , as most of his medicines were derived from the vegetable kingdom , this circumstance might point out to him the necessity of , and excite a desire for , the study of botany . " He was the first American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which purpose , in 1728 , he bought five acres of land having a favorable soil and exposure , on the banks of the Schuylkill , three miles from Philadelphia . Here he built with his own hands a comfortable house of hewn stone . This house and garden are still in existence , although modern innovation threatens their destruction . A railroad runs through the garden , and there is some danger that it will be converted into a coal and lumber yard . Of the five botanic gardens mentioned as established in the United States before 1806 , two have wholly disappeared , and only one , that at Cambridge , is still used for its original purpose . Dr. Darlington observes , " the last named , now under the skilful supervision of Professor A. Gray , is in a flourishing condition , and bids fair , if supported by an adequate endowment , to be a perennial monument of the liberality and love of science of those who projected it . " The adequate endowment , of which it stands sadly in need , we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenhouse in the garden had become so dilapidated from the want of funds for making the necessary repairs , that the plants were taken out of it , and distributed through the grounds . Some , too large to be removed , were left to await the chance of being killed by the cold ; among these was an enormous Camelia , fifty years old , the first that was brought to this country . Last winter , a small sum was spared from the funds to fit up temporarily one of the compartments of the greenhouse ; but the whole building is so much out of repair , that it would be better economy to erect a new one than to spend any more money upon the old edifice . The garden is kept in as good order as the trifling sum appropriated to it will admit ; but even now , with the utmost frugality , the annual expenses exceed the interest // of the fund* The establishment can not support itself , be cause it can not be devoted to any great extent to the cuItiva*. tion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vegetable productions of our own country and of other lands , to acclimate the foreign trees and shrubs which may prove useful or ornamental , and to distribute abroad the most curious of our indigenous plants . These purposes can not be answered without incurring considerable expense ; and we know of no worthier object to which the liberality of the patrons of science can be directed , than to the restoration and support of the garden at Cambridge . But we return to the history of our botanical patriarch . John Bartram , from the time he was ten years old , evinced a great inclination for plants , and as he says in one of his letters , he could recognize at sight all that he had once oW. served , though he knew not their proper names , having had no person or books to instruct him . He received the usual education which in those days could be acquired in country schools ; and he acquired also some knowledge of Greek and Latin , though probably not much , as he requests Gronovius to write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his Latin . He was about thirty years old when he laid out his botanic garden , and filled it with the curious trees and flowers he had found in his various excursions ; it soon attracted the attention of many persons , who encouraged him to persist in his labors . His particular friend , Joseph Breintnail , a merchant of Philadelphia , undertook to convey some of his collections and observations on natural history to Peter Collinson , in London , and thus laid the foundation of a friendship and correspondence which continued for fifty years . Bartram and Collinson both were Quakers , and both were passionately fond of botanical pursuits ; the Jatter accumulated a large fortune , and was rather generous in the use of it , though his benevolence was somewhat tinctured by the peculiar straitness and precision of his sect . He writes to his American friend with a rather paternal and patronizing air , but with great cordiality and frankness . From a life of Collinson , published in the University Magazine of 1795 , we extract the following : - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eminent naturalist by Mr. P. Cob . linson 's assistance . He it was who first recommended to him // the collecting of seeds , and afterwards aiding him in disposing of them in this country ; animated by his friend , Mr. Bartram persevered in investigating the plants of America with indefatigable labor , and with a success which rendered his name illustrious . " At first , Bartram received from his English patrons , in return for his plants and seeds , presents of money , clothes , and hooks ; but as their demands for new plants became greater , and he was obliged to extend his excursions beyond the district of Eastern Pennsylvania , Delaware , and the Jerseys , he very properly hinted to them that his journeys were not profitable to him , as his expenses in travelling were considerable , and his farm was neglected in his absence . Collinson 's reply is an amusing specimen of Broadbrim 's dictatorial disposition in small things . " As Lord PETRE desired to see thy letters , they are all there . Lie admires thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions of several plants . For want of them , I shall only take notice of thy proposal , in one of them , for an annual allowance to encourage and enable thee to prosecute further discoveries . Lord PETRE is very willing to contribute very handsomely towards it . Lie will give ten guineas , and we are in hopes to raise ten more . This , we think , will enable thee to set apart a month , two , or three , to make an excursion on the banks of the Schuylkill , to trace it to its fountain . But as so great an undertaking may require two or three years , and as many journeys , to effect it , so we must leave that wholly to thee . But we do expect , that after harvest , and when the season is that all the seeds of trees and shrubs are ripe , thou will set out ; and them that happen not to be ripe when thou goes , they may have attained to maturity when thou comes back . We shall send thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - expect thee II keep a regular journal of what occurs every day ; and an exact observation of the course of the river , which , with a compass , thee may easily do . " It will , we apprehend , be necessary to take a servant with thee , and two horses for yourselves , and a spare one to carry linen , provisions , and all other necessaries , if the spare horse , and the man 's horse , had two panniers or large baskets on each side , they will be very convenient to carry paper , to take specimens by the way , and to bring back the seeds ; thee may make a good many little , middling , and large paper bags to put the seeds in ; and be sure have some good covering of skins over // the baskets , to keep out the rain , &amp;c . Take some boxes for insects of all sorts , with the nets ; and on thy return , some particular plants , that thee most fancies , may be brought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipend of twenty guineas was finally promised , and paid for a long series of years , the two other subscribers being Philip Miller and the Duke of Richmond ; but Collinson often complains of the difficulty of obtaining the money from " great folks . " With this encouragement , Bartram every year undertook long journeys for the benefit of his foreign correspondents . He travelled over the Blue Ridge , and explored Virginia ; he made various excursions through New York , and several times climbed the Catskills ; he crossed the Alleghanies , and traced the Monongahela and Ohio for a great distance ; he visited the Carolinas twice ; arid , at the age of sixty-seven , being appointed botanist to the King , he went to Florida , and ascended the river San Juan for four hundred miles from its mouth . All these expeditions in a wild and unsettled country were not unattended with risk . He writes to a friend , " thee may suppose I am often exposed to solitary arid difficult travelling , beyond our inhabitants , in passing over rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often obliged to follow the track or path of wild beasts for my guide through the desolate and gloomy thickets . " And again , - " when I am travelling on the mountains or in the valleys , I chiefly search out the most desolate , craggy , dismal places I can find , where no mortal ever trod ; - not that I naturally delight in such solitudes , but entirely to observe the wonderful productions of nature . " It is evident that he richly earned his twenty guineas . The following shows how modest his expectations were , and throws a fine light on his kindly and simple disposition . " I have received the nails , calico , Russia linen , and the clothes for my boys ; all which are very good and well chosen , and give great satisfaction . The only thing that gives me any uneasiness is , that thee hath sent more than what is my due . " Now , though oracles be ceased , and thee bath not the spirit of divination , - yet according to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerely may , by an extraordinary spirit of sympathy , not only know each other 's desires , but may // have a spiritual conversation at great distances one from another . Now , if this be truly so , - if I love thee sincerely - and thy love and friendship be so to me - thee must have a spiritual feeling and sense of what particular sorts of things will give satisfaction ; and doth not thy actions make it manifest ? for , what I send to thee for , thee hath chosen of just such sorts , and colors as I wanted . Nay , as my wife and 1 are one , so.she is initiated into this spiritual union ; for thee has sent her a piece of calico so directly to her mind , that she saith that if she had been there herself , she could not have pleased her fancy better . " in the year 1743 , Conrad Weiser , the general Indian in*. terpreter , was despatched by government to Onondaga , to settle some differences with the Indians which originated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between some of the Six Nations and the whites . Bartram did not let this opportunity pass unimproved , and on the 3d of July , he started on borse* back to join Weiser 's party , accompanied also by Lewis Evans , a skilful physician of that period , who afterwards published a map of the Middle States . Bartram 's Journal during this expedition was published by his friends in London , in 1751 , without his knowledge ; and we refer the curious reader to it who is not satisfied with our slight sketch . The Journal treats of the soil , climate , productions , and natural curiosities of the rich hills and valleys of the interior of Penn* sylvania . The course of the travellers lay through the vale of Wiomic , or Wyoming , since so celebrated as the scene of Campbell 's poem , who doubtless gleaned material for his descriptions of natural objects from this work . The journey was not without its perils , for the route lay through the heart of the wilderness occupied by the Indians , who were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the ground , to live on Indian fare , and there was often a scarcity even of that . They were so fortunate as to obtain the services , as guides through the forest , of an Indian chief and his son , who seem to have discharged the trust with fidelity , as they were everywhere received with marks of honor by the natives . At one of the villages , a feast was given to Weiser in his character of peacemaker ; on such solemn occasions , Indian etiquette enjoins that every morsel be eaten . Weiser , not being well , obtained permission to eat by proxy , and called // in his compagnons de voyage to aid him ; but even their united forces were not sufficient to dispose of the neck of venison set before them , and one of them took up what was left to throw it to the dog . But before he could accomplish his design , an Indian seized it , and placing it on the fire , religiously covered it up with ashes . Bartram supposed this was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems more probable that , in the opinion of the savages , the food which bad once been touched by their guests became too sacred to be applied to vile uses . After a journey of nineteen days , the party reached Onondaga , where the council with the Six Nations was held , which terminated amicably . Leaving Weiser to settle the diplomatic affairs , Bartram and his friend procured guides and continued their journey to the trading post of Oswego , on Lake Ontario , where they obtained provisions for their journey home . He remarks that the waters of this lake had considerably diminished in the course of years , and offers several conjectures on the cause of the phenomenon , which he finally leaves for abler naturalists than himself to determine . The travellers were kindly entertained by the traders and Indians at the Castle , and were fully equipped for their journey home , which they accomplished without difficulty . The correspondence of Bartram and his friends was interrupte ( l during the war of 1745 , and some of their collections , which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish cruisers . He writes to Gronovius , in December of this year - " I have sent thee many curiosities in a box directed to thee ; which I hone our worthy friend , PETER CoLLINsoN , will send to thee according to my direction , - if the French and Spaniards do n't hinder him from the opportunity of obliging us . Indeed , it is very discouraging to think that all my labor and charges may very likely fall into such hands as will take no farther care of them , than to heave them overboard into the sea , as I suppose they did all that I sent last year , by the Queen of Hungaria . If I could know that they fell into the hands of men of learning and curiosity , I should be more easy about them . Though they are what is commonly called our enemies , yet , if they make proper use of what I have labored for , let them enjoy it with the blessing of God . " I have sent a variety of the clay-cells , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasps were gone , or dead , before thy instructions came to my hands . I believe we have a great variety of these kinds . 1 design , next summer , ( if my affairs go on pretty well , ) to make a fine collection of insects and fishes for thee . " In 1765 , Collinson writes to his friend , " I have the pleasure to inform my good friend , that my repeated solicitations have not been in vain . For this day I received certain intelligence from our gracious king , that he had appointed thee his botanist , with a salary of 50 pounds a year ; and in pursuance thereof , I received thy first half year 's payment of the salary . " In the autumn of that year , Bartrain set off for Florida , going by sea to Carolina , and thence by land to St. Augustine . Collinson speaks of this journey as dangerous* and laments that it was undertaken at so unfavorable a season , for Bartrain suffered much from seasickness and the " southward fever . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a determination which cost his father much money and caused him great uneasiness . Their voyage up the San Juan was made in an open boat , and occupied nearly two months . The journal kept during the expedition was sent to London and published with notes by William Stork , M. D. , who thus presents it to his readers : - " Mr. John Bartram , a native of Pennsylvania , the author of this journal , is well known and well respected in the learned world , as an able naturalist ; his knowledge in botany recommended him to the esteem and patronage of the great , and procured him the honor of being botanist to His Majesty for both the Floridas . The usefulness of his journal , in making early known to the world what are the natural productions of the country to which it relates , is a sufficient proof of the usefulness of his appointment . " Friend Collinson likens himself to " the Parson 's barn which refuses nothing ; " others might class him with the horseleech 's daughter , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows a little pettish under these repeated calls , and says , " Do they think I can make new ones ? I have sent them seeds of almost every tree and shrub from Nova Scotia to Carolina ; very few are wanting , and from the sea across the continent to the lakes . " " My correspondents near London write to me as freely for Carolina plants , as if they thought I could get them as easily as they do the // plants in the European gardens ; that is , to walk at their leisure along the alleys , and dig what they please out of the beds , without the danger of life or limb . " Collinson had a perfectly boyish fancy for turtles , and is never weary of sending for all the varieties of that class of animals , until he finds that the fish in his pond were rapidly diminishing , and at last discovers an enormous snapping turtle to be the depredator , when he forthwith prohibits the importation of any more . Yet the ' worthy Quaker expressed great delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My son and I were both surprised at the sight of the great Mud Turtle . It is really a formidable animal . He bit very fierce at a stick . He had near bit my finger . Thy former de . scription is very good , excepting his sharp hook at the point of its bill , and his shell being very jagged or notched near his tail . It made an uncouth noise , I ca n't say barking ; but what a full . grown one might do , I ca n't say . It is really a curiosity , and we are obliged to thee for sending it ; for we had no notion of such an animal , for writers , in general. , content themselves by saying there s terrapins , or land and water turtles , &amp;c . " I wish BILLY could get one of this size , and draw it , in its natural dress ; but pray let the shell be well washed , that the sutures of the shell may be well expressed . What eye it has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , as if asleep . " All the species of turtles , drawn as they come in your way , with some account of them , would prove a new piece of natural history , well worth knowing . " The pretty Frog came safe and well , and very brisk : more of these innocent creatures would not be amiss . But pray send no more Mud Turtle . One is enough . The other Water Turtle is a pretty species ; came very well . " Our countrymen travelling in England are often astonished by the great number of American plants which adorn the parks and gardens of the nobility , - plants considered rare even here , and proving by their size and vigor , that they must have been cultivated in English soil for many years . But after reading the letters of Bartram to his English correspondents , with the long list of seeds and plants constantly sent over the Atlantic , it ceases to be a matter of wonder that , in many gardens , a place is set apart as the American ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root and branch , from the magnificent White Pine to the // delicate Linmea creeping at its foot . Plants and trees growing within the borders of our own State can now be procured from England at a cheaper rate , and with less risk , than from their original locality . We receive the vegetable savages , civilized by their sojourn abroad , and fitted to become very ornamental , and ( what can not he said of all travellers ) very useful and contented , when returned to their native air . These letters introduce us familiarly into the home and private life of Bartram . Collinson advises and corrects him in regard to his reading , and even in the matter of dress . " One thing I must desire of thee , and do insist that thee oblige me therein : that thou make up that drugget clothes , to go to Virginia in , and not appear to disgrace thyself or me ; for though I should not esteem thee the less , to come to me in what dress thou will , - yet these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , perhaps , more at a man 's outside than his inside . For these and other reasons , pray go very clean , neat , and handsomely dressed , to Virginia . Never mind thy clothes : I will send more another year . " Shortly afterwards , he writes again to say that he had sent a parcel of seeds " to your proprietor , Thomas Penn . Dress thyself neatly in thy best habits , and wait on him for them ; for I have in a particular manner recommended thee to him . " But the good Quaker forgets not to teach economy as well as neatness . " One thing I forgot to mention before , and what very much surprises me , to find thee , who art a philosopher , prouder than I am . My cap , it is true , had a small hole or two on the border ; but the lining was new . Instead of giving it away , I wish thee had sent it me back again . It would have served me two or three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather . " Bartram wishes his friend to buy Tournefort 's book for him , which Collinson is unwilling to do on account of the cost , and he even misquotes Scripture to reprove him for his prodigality . " I shall first take notice of thy request to buy TOIJRNEFORT . I have inquired , and there are so many books , or parts , done , as come to fifty shillings . The first part may be got , perhaps , secondhand ; but the others are not yet to be expected . Now I shall be so friendly to tell thee , I think this is too much to lay out . Besides , now thee has got PARKINsoN and MILLER , I would not have thee 19 * // puzzle thyself with others ; for they contain the ancient and modern knowledge of Botany . Remember SoLoMoN 's advice ; in reading ( ? ) of books , there is no end . " Bartram wittily replies " I take thy advice about books very kindly , although I love such reading dearly ; and I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have been a wiser and happier man than he was . " The following enables us to picture to ourselves very distinctly the Quaker botanist as he appeared when arrayed in the clothes that were sent to him . " In the trunk of the Library Company , thee II find a suit of clothes for thyself . This may serve to protect thy outward man , - being a drugget coat , black waistcoat , and shagg breeches . And now , that thou may see that I am not thoughtless of thy better part , I send thee R. BARcLAY 'S Apology , to replenish thy inward man . So farewell . Success attend thee in all thy expeditions . " Bartram 's reply is quite characteristic , and does honor to his feelings . " I am greatly obliged to thee for thy necessary present of a suit of clothes , which just came in the right time ; and BARCLAY 'S Apology I shall take care of , for thy sake . It answers thy advice much better than if thee had sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have spent ten times the hours in reading of , while I might have labored for the maintenance of my family . Indeed , I have little respect to apologies and disputes about the ceremonial parts of religion , which often introduce animosities , confusion , and disorders in the mind  --  and sometimes body too : hut , dear PETER , let us worship the one Almighty Power , in sincerity of heart , with resignation to His divine will , - doing to others as we would have them do to us , if we were in their circumstances . Living in love and innocency , we may die in hope . " Bartram engraved with his own hands , on a stone in the wall of his house , above the window of his own apartment , where it may still be seen , the following lines - " T is God alone , the Almighty Lord , The Holy One , by me adored . " In the selection of a distich for the door of his greenhouse , he does not seem to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slave to no sect , who takes no private road , But looks through nature up to nature 's God , " // gave offence to some of his staid Quaker brethren ; and there is a tradition , that this public avowal of the liberality of his religious opinions caused him to be " read out of meeting. ** We have quoted liberally from this entertaining volume , and find that we have no room left for extracts from the letters of Bartram 's numerous other correspondents besides Collinson . Among them were many well known to fame , from Dr. Franklin down to an honest savant , whose Yankee origin is pretty clearly betrayed by the multifarious character of his employments , as the editor says that " he invented the drill plough , wrote a Dissertation on the Prophecies , and published a treatise on Inoculation for the Small Pox . " We must find space , however , for an extract from a very characteristic epistle of Dr. Franklin 's , dated at London , July 9 , 1769 ; it shows Poor Richard 's peculiar vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now be suitable for you to make such wide excursions as heretofore , you may yet be very useful to your country , and to mankind , if you sit down quietly at home , digest the knowledge you have acquired , compile and publish the many observations you have made , and point out the advan. tages that may be drawn from the whole , in public undertakings , or particular private practice . " It is true , many people are fond of accounts of old buildings , monuments , &amp;c. ; but there is a number , who would be much better pleased with such accounts as you could afford them ; and for one , I confess , that if I could find in any Italian travels a receipt for making Parmesan cheese , it would give me more satisfaction than a transcript of any inscription from any old stone whatever . " On the 22d of September , 1777 , Bartram closed his eyes upon the world whose natural beauties had so long engaged his devout attention . His illness was short , and about half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in considerable agony , and pronounced these words , " I want to die . " One of his granddaughters , who recollects him distinctly , says , " he was exceedingly annoyed and agitated , ( and she thinks his days were shortened , ) by the approach of the royal army after the battle of Brandywine . As that army had been ravaging various portions of the revolted Colonies , he was apprehensive it might also lay waste his darling garden , the cherished nursling of almost half a century* " // The two journals to which we have already alluded are all the writings of John Bartram which were given to the public , excepting some articles on Natural History in the Philosophical Transactions , between the years 1740 and 1750 , and the notes and appendix to the American edition of Short 's Medicina Britannica , published by B. Franklin and D. Hall . His son , William , published his own travels in Carolina and the Floridas at a much later date ; and the two Bartrams , as the mantle of the father descended upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his earlier years , led rather a roving life , to the great scandal of his father 's mentor , Collinson , who constantly exhorts him to marry and settle , the good Quaker being strongly impressed with the divine truth , that it is not good for man to be alone . But William , satisfied with his pencil and specimens , lived and died a bachelor . He was the friend and constant assistant of Wilson the ornithologist , whose premature death science still deplores , and whose last wish , so strangely disregarded , has become falniliar to us in the lines of M'Lellan : - " In some wild forest shade Under some spreadinb oak or wavinb pine , Or old elm festooned with the *addin* Let me be laid . " * vine , After Mount Auburn was consecrated , some gentlemen applied to his only surviving relative in this country for leave to remove his remains from under the brick Presbyterian church in Philadelphia , where they were buried , to that beautiful resting place for the dead . But his sister , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ye shall not disturb the bones of the dead ; let them aye rest in peace where the prayer was first spoken over them . " The last hundred pages of this volume are devoted to the life and correspondence of Humphrey Marshall . He was born in 1752 , at West Bradford , Penn. , his mother and the mother of John Bartram being sisters . The editor remarks , " It is altogether probable that Humphry Marshall 's taste for horticulture and botany may have been awakened and promoted by a familiar intercourse with his cousin John Bartram , and by the attractions of that cousin 's interesting garden . Enjoying such privileges , he would at once catch the spirit , and profit by the skill and experience , of his enthusiastic rela // tive . " Marshall was apprenticed to a stonemason , whose trade he followed for many years ; yet at the same time he showed his love of plants by embellishing his father 's farm at the Forks of the Brandywine . In 1773 , he built his own house , and planned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with curious plants , many of which , especially the noble oaks , pines , and magnolias , still survive , although the garden from neglect has become a mere wilderness . In 1780 , Marshall began to prepare an account of the forest trees and shrubs of this country , which was published about five years afterwards , in a duodecimo volume of about two hundred pages . This was the first truly indigenous botanical essay published in the western hemisphere ; it was in advance of the times , for it excited little interest in the community , and the publisher writes , " I have had accounts from Trenton and New York , but there is not one subscriber in either place ; they sell but slow . I think we have not sold a dozen beside those to the subscribers . " This book , the expense of the publication of which Marshall was obliged to defray for himself , was appreciated abroad , and translated into most of the languages of Europe . In the latter part of his life , Marshall 's eyesight was impaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed with only partial success ; but he was never entirely blind , and to the last enjoyed walking about his garden and examining the trees and plants . He died in 1801 , aged 79 . We have not room to make any extracts from his correspondence , although there are many interesting letters in it , particularly those written during the Revolution , which show the state of feeling on both sides of the Atlantic .
