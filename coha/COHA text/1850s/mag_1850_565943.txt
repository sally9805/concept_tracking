txt ART . VI. - ARCHITECTIJRE . The seven Lamps of Architecture . By JOHN RITSKIN , author of " Modern Painters . " Ne*v York : John Wiley , 1849 . ARCHITECTURE rightly conceived is intimately conuected , and at many different points , with the general life of man . The mass are probably little aware of this , and live oftentimes surrounded and acted upon by the influences of this truly creative art , while hardly suspecting how much they owe to it or what a power in the world it is and is yet destined to be . The comparatively few look upon it with different eyes and are awake to its value and use . And comparatively fewer still are ready to give this art its true place and acknowledge its importance in the fullest extent . Such men indeed , though few , there have been , perhaps in all ages , with whom architecture has been something more than either the study or the sport of an hour , something more than the execution of a sudden whim or fancy , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toil , even the outward exhibition and embodiment of inward // feelings , of the deepest springs of life , the dearest joys of existence . Men who have built the St. Paul 's cathedrals , the Doge 's palaces , the Parthenons , and other like structures , and those also who have been able to take into their souls the beauty and meaning of them , have been men to whom architecture has been something more than the piling up of walls and the spanning them with roofs . Such men have had their very souls almost vitally connected with these edifices . They have discoursed in , or drawn lessons from , these piles of stone and timbers hewed and fitted into a forest of art and becoming a language for all time . Nor is it only with these greater structures that architecture is chiefly or most appropriately concerned . The most elaborate piece of architecture in all Venice , we are told , is a small house at the head of the Grand Canal , consisting of a ground floor with two stories above , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hearts and the homes of a people a4 indeed most intimately connected , and what has to do with the one deals also , and almost necessarily , with the other . We are aware also that while we claim for the word home ' a meaning , a sacredness even , which makes it peculiarly an English word , we can not use it as signifying the mere edifices in which we are enclosed , be they never so elaborate and perfect as architectural works . We know it is the hearts emphatically that make the homes , far more so than the stone and wood , the bricks and mortar . Nevertheless these act and react upon each other , giving each other shape and tone , and therefore there is that in the mere house , which can give tone to the feelings of the heart , elevating , warming , purifying and chastening , or debasing and debauching them . Happily , within a few years past , this matter of architecture has begun to have a new interest in the minds of the many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and such is not the place to look for any art in a state of perfection or even that which is a very close approach to it . When the foundations alike of the social and civil state are all to be laid anew , little is to be expected in the way of art and especially of the fine arts . o be able to live in tolerable safety and comfort , is the all important thing tinder such circumstances . An enclosure of logs , with a stick chimney , or perhaps only a hole for the escape of smoke , divided off into no rooms adapted to the different purposes of life ,  --  this is the beginning of things in a new country , and this gives place to a different state only by a slow and gradual process . Then it is to be considered in respect to ourselves that we are peculiarly a migratory people . The circumstances in which we took our origin , and the place where we have been planted , have both contributed their part to beget this character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , we have disembarked upon a shore from which a fertile soil and salubrious climate beckon the advancing steps until our feet are // bathed in the calm waters of the Pacific . A " whole boundless continent is ours ; " and this operates to keep us restless , and incites us to a renewed emigration towards the setting sun as often as we are weary of our present abode or fancy we may find a better elsewhere . So we go on , like an army of locusts , the rear ones constantly flying over to the front , to find themselves soon again in the rear and so urged to another flight . All is motion with us in comparison with older nations . It is no more than what might be expected therefore , that the arts should be comparatively unknown among us . Arts , of the higher and finer order at least , do not grow so freely in a state of such constant motion as in one of more repose . The inventive powers indeed act as vigorously among us , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to economize labor and increase material production , are by no means lacking . But the fine arts , those arts which have to do not so much with outward and physical life as with the interior feelings and perceptions of the soul-all that is deepest and most valuable within us - these are as yet for the most part in their infancy , feeble and misshapen . And in respect to no art is this more apparent than that of architecture . In fact we have hardly any such thing as architecture as yet . Buildings , boxes iii which human beings eat and sleep we have , but very little that merits the name architecture . Certain philosophers tell us that we come to the knowledge of material objects around us by an inference from our prior knowledge of our interior selves , first being conscious of the mc and then perceiving them as the not me . So only reversing the order of sequence , we in this country are likely to know what architecture is by first knowing what it is not . We are a great people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consider ourselves not a whit behind Rome or Athens in their palmiest days , as , in respect to what is best and most vital , we are not . Republicans too , we naturally turn for our examples and patterns to the shores of the Mediterranean , rather than to those of more northern waters . Hence our architecture has hitherto pointed to those warmer latitudes . So we have our parthenons all over the country . Sometimes they are for the use of officers of government ; sometimes they are custom houses and smell of imports ; and sometimes again they are meat markets and smell of blood and what besides might be expected . And what parthenons ? Mere stucco work for the most part , and this not ' the best , needing to be replastered from time to time or kept in countenance by diligent applications of oil and lead ! In our churches we have done somewhat better . This however can hardly be said unless we confine attention to here and there a structure in some of our older and larger places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the arts have scope for their growth . Sometimes in such cases there will be found what is really worthy of notice // and prophesies better things to come . But take the country at large , and what are our churches ! Mere clapboards and white lead , inexpressive misshapen masses thrown together perhaps in some bleak and barren spot where two dusty highways meet , or lying on some level plain like so many boulders dislodged from the adjacent hills ! Not a tree casts its grateful shade across the threshold or relieves the glare of the naked walls . Then they must be saddled with a succession of towers piled upon each other and not unfrequently fairly breaking the back of the unfortunate edifice , while the shell is pierced with scores of little meaningless windows-mere light holes through which the sun is allowed to stream in unmitigated fierceness . Such are too many of our places of religious worship . Similar again is the description of our domestic buildings . The best that can be said of them collectively is that they are shelters from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not positively offensive by some manifest excrescence or deformity , they are usually bald , tame and expressive of the utter absence of taste in the builder . And then if one has been successful in his trade so as to amass money , and wishes , as he very naturally will , to outshine his neighbors , he will call to his aid some carpenter who has heard of the five orders and owns a " Builder 's Guide , " and forthwith will be seen to go up a Grecian temple in clapboards with its kitchen and cooking apparatus at one end and its prim fluted columns at the other ! A temple of Minerva with its sauce-pans and pianos ! Let us not however be thought to overlook those unobtrusive dwellings which may here and there be found , or those mansions even , which are occasionally to be met and which are worthy of regard and deserving of the name of homes . We know there are such , gems here and there upon which the eye rests with pleasure and the sotil feasts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with all the dwellings of the land ! Let it be remembered that we are speaking in general terms , endeavoring by a few quick , sketchy touches , to give some idea of the subject in hand , while it would be out of place to descend to more particular description or make all possible exceptions . And no one , we think , can set our various structures before him in one general view without being driven to the conviction , that there is little among us as yet which deserves the name of architecture . Happily this need not always be the case . This will not always be the case . In proportion as any parts of our country become free from the momentum of emigration and the agitation and feebleness of a raw state , as wealth increases and settles down in the form of solid capital , as there is found the opportunity of repose and reflection and quiet contemplation , in that proportion will the arts , and especially the fine arts , begin to rise into prominence and assume their proper place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of things thus far in our history . riThe older we become , the more refined , elegant and tasteful we are . Within a few years the advance of art in the earlier settled portions of our country has been quite noticeable . And it is as much so in respect to the art now under our consideration as to any other . The way for this advance has been preparing for a considerable time , and now the natural development appears . In our larger cities , and all through our lesser towns and villages , new ideas are seen to be written out upon and within the various structures that arise . As a part of this natural advancement , professed architects have been called forth among us , and these again have stimulated the natural movement in which they themselves have originated . These are hopeful signs among us . They point to better days and better times . They indicate advancement in a direction much to be desired , an advancement too in regard to which we have no need of apprehension lest evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can hail with unhesitating confidence . Undoubtedly there will be along with the real improvements in architecture the mere semblances of them . Shams always accompany realities . Counterfeits always follow close upon the genuine coin . We shall have temples oftentimes instead of cottages . But the true and real will far exceed the false ; and there will be a steady advancement in the right direction , and a continually increasing contribution to the stock of comfort and happiness . We feel bound to encourage every movement in this direction , and to help it forward so far as it may be in our power to do so . It is on this account that we have undertaken to call attention to the book of Mr. Ruskin ; and what we have already said in the present article has been designed rather as an introduction to that work , than in itself an adequate or satisfactory discussion of the subject in hand . We propose to let our author speak for himself and we shall do little more than endeavor to open his pages in such a manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book before us is one which makes large demands upon American readers . Much of it even will appear extravagant to many on this side of the Atlantic , while not at all so to the intelligent reader on the other . this will be simply because it is farther in advance of the taste and accomplishment of a new than of an old country . So far however as it is a book of principles , which it professes to be , it meets us on the same level with others . It seeks to bring out certain grand fundamental laws which apply to architecture in common with all the arts and with all human action . So far therefore as principles are concerned , in distinction from their practical application in particular instances , we are as competent readers of the book as any . It is as a book of principles  --  a book in which we are shown that architecture involves not only the application of mathematics , and a knowledge of the strength of materials , // but the knowledge and obedience of great moral principles-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reader of it will find himself made conversant not with the square and compass , the level and the plummet merely , but with the eternal laws of God and the principles of immutable morality . And when we find a treatise which like this dignifles and sanctifles one of the common pursuits of man , and redeeming it from the bondage of mechanical law brings it into the liberty of divine truth and makes it tributary to man 's highest welfare , we can not but commend it to the attention of the public . This we now do , not endorsing indeed all the opinions of the author , but believing that certain great and well understood principles are here shown to be applicable to the architectural art , and shown so plainly and so impressively as to promise much good to those who will lend the author an ear . The title of the book we think unfortunate , for while it is in one sense a good one , it is yet one which is evuigmatical and the relevancy of which is not manifest until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is positively repulsive to many and prevents their reading what they would find full of interest and value . On this account we shall be somewhat liberal in making extracts from the book in order that the true worth of it may be made to appear , and that those who after all may not become possessors of the volume , may become possessed of some of its important ideas . Architecture , our author defines to be " the art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by man for whatsoever uses , that the sight of them contributes to his mental health , power and pleasure . " He then proceeds to distinguish architecture from building , and indicates his view of the difference by saying , " Let us , therefore , at once confine the name ( architecture ) to that art which , taking up and admitting , as conditions of its working , the necessities and common uses of the building , impresses on its form certain characters venerable or beautiful , but otherwise unnecessary . " He then sets forth architecture proper as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected for God 's service or honor . Memorial ; including monuments and tombs . Civil ; including all edifices raised by nations or societies for purposes of common business and pleasure . Military ; including all public and private architecture of defense . Domestic ; including every kind of dwelling place . Now the great principles which , in our author 's judgment , ought to hold sway in the domain of architecture. * thus marked out , are the lamps of architecture , and these are the lamps or principles of Sacrifice , Truth , Power , Beauty , Life , Memory and Obedience . // The lamp of Sacrifice , which has particular reference to devotional and memorial architecture , is defined to be " that spirit which offers for such work precious things , simply because they are precious ; not as being necessary to the building , but as an offering* surrendering , and sacrifice of what is to ourselves desirable . ' * And again he says , " It is a spirit , for instance , which of two marbles , equally beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was so , and of two kinds of decoration , equally effective , would choose the more elaborate because it was so , in order that it might , in the same compass present more cost and more thought . It is therefore most unreasoning and enthusiastic , and perhaps best negatively defined , as the opposite of the prevalent feeling of modern times which desires to produce the largest results at the least cost . " rrhe author then goes on to argue the use and even necessity of this principle , law ' or lamp of sacrifice , by a reference to the requisitions of the Mosaic economy , insisting that the hangings of blue and purple and scarlet , and the expense of gold and silver were , in one view , calculated to lead the Israelites into idolatry , and were warranted only in the fact of their keeping before their minds the claims and the greatness of God through the instrumentality of the sacrifice or expense which was involved in them . As he expresses it himself , " There was but one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covenant which he made with men was accompanied with some external sign of its continuance , and of his remembrance of it , so the acceptance of that covenant might be marked and signified by use , in some external sign of their obedience and love , and surrender of themselves and theirs to his will ; and that their gratitude to him , and continual remembrance of him , might have at once their expression and their enduring testimony in the presentation to him , not only of the firstlings of the herd and fold , not only of the fruits of the earth and the tithe of time , but of all treasures of wisdom and beauty ; of the thought that invents , and the hand that labors ; of wealth of wood , and weight of stone , of the strength of iron , and of the light of gold . " It is then claimed that the principle here involved is one for all time , one that never has been , never will be abrogated , a principle founded in the necessities of our very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote , as an altogether sensible view of a certain portion of the subject . " It has been said-it ought always to be said , for it is true-that a better and more honorable offering is made to our Master in ministry to the poor , in extending the knowledge of His name , in the practice of the virtues by which that name is hallowed , than in material presents to His temple . Assuredly it is so : woe to all who think that any other kind or manner of offering may in any wise take the place of these ! Do the people need place to pray , and calls to hear His word ? Then it is no time for smoothing pillars or carving pulpits let us have enough first of walls and roofs . Do the people need teaching from // house to house , and bread from day to day ? Then they are deacons and ministers we want , not architects . I insist on this , I plead for this ; but let us examine ourselves , and see if this be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question is not between God 's house and His poor : it is not between God 's house and His Gospel . It is between God 's house and ours . Have we no tesselated colors on our floors ? no frescoed fancies on our roofs ? no niched statuary in our corridors ? no gilded furniture in our chambers ? no costly stones in our cabinets ? Has even the tithe of these been offered ? They are , or they ought to be , the signs that enough has been devoted to the great purposes of human stewardship , and that there remains to us what we can spend in luxury ; but there is a greater and prouder luxury than this selfish one-that of bringing a portion of such things as these into sacred service , and presenting them for a inemorial# that our pleasure as well as our toil has been hallowed by the remembrance of Him who gave both the strength and the reward . And until this has been done , I do not see how such possessions can be retained in happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own gates and pave our own thresholds , and leave the church with its narrow door and foot-worn sill ; the feeling which enriches our own chambers with all manner of costliness , and endures the bare wall and mean compass of the temple . * * * I do not say that such things have not their place and propriety ; but I say this , emphatically , that the tenth part of the expense which is sacrificed in domestic vanities , if not absolutely and meaninjessly lost in domestic discomforts and encumbrances , would , if collectively offered and wisely employed , build a marble church for every town in England ; such a church as it should be a joy and a blessing even to pass near in our daily ways and walks , and as it would bring the light into the eyes to see from afar , lifting its fair height above the purple crowd of human roofs . " - pp. 14 , 15 . The author then instances the pouring away of the dear bought water of the well of Bethlehem by David at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Savior 's head by Mary , as examples which the Scriptures afford , in which a divine recognition is given of the principle in question . The two grand conditions required by the Spirit of Sacrifice are held to be " first , that we should in everything do our best ; and , secondly , that we should consider increase of apparent labor as an increase of beauty in the building . " Upon these points we will quote two very brief passages . " All old work nearly has been hard work . It may be the hard work of children , of barbarians , of rustics ; but it is always their utmost . Ours has as coiistantly the look of money 's worth , of a stopping short wherever and whenever we can , of a lazy compliance with low conditions ; never of a fair putting forth of our strength . Let us have done with this kind of work at once : cast off every temptation to it : do not let us degrade ourselves voluntarily , and then mutter and mourn over our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parsimony , but not belie our human intellect . It is not even a question of how much we are to do , but of how it is to be done ; it is not a question of doing more , but of doing better . " - p. 18 . " The other condition which we had to notice , was the value of the appearance of labor upon architecture . I have spoken of this before ; t and it is , indeed , one of the most frequent sources of pleasure which belong to theart , Num. xxxi , 54 . Psa . lxxvi , 11. f Mod . Painters , Part I , Sec. 1 , Chap . 3. // always , however , within certain somewhat remarkable limits . For it does not first appear easily to be explained why labor , as represented by materials of value , should , without sense of wrong or error , bear being wasted ; while the waste of actual workmanship is always painful , so soon as it is apparent . But so it is , that , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be employed for the magnificence of what is seldom seen , the work of man can not be carelessly and idly bestowed , without an immediate sense of wrong ; as if the strength of the living creature were never intended by its Maker to be sacrificed in vain , though it is well for us sometimes to part with what we esteem precious of substance , as showing that in such a service it becomes but dross and dust . " - p. 19 . Mr. Ruskin proceeds next to treat of the lamp of Truth ; and treating here . of a principle of wider or at least more frequent application than that of sacrifice , he addresses a larger circle than in his previous chapter . If we had space , we should like to quote the opening portion of this chapter , as setting forth with great force and clearness the general obligations of truth . It is interesting to see how he sweeps from the abstract claims of truth to its application in the squaring of timbers and the fitting of stones , and thus sets what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral position , and invests it with a moral character . The principle of truth in architecture demands that all shall be what it seems to be , and therefore it is at war with all deceits. it is the principle of honesty and good faith , in other words , the principle which shrinks as much from telling a lie with bricks and mortar and paint as with the lips . It is only necessary to specify the principle , and every one will at once remember instances in which it is violated . We believe too that there is hardly any one point at which there is so much room to do our architecture immediate good service , as just where this grand principle has its application . To make men feel the obligations of truth , to show them the real significance of falsities when they are piling up their bricks , or framing together their timbers , or finishing up their various structures ,  --  what better task could be accomplished for the appearance of the buildings and the character of the bnilders . We wish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chapter on truth . The deceits by which the law of truth is violated he considers under three heads . 1st . The suggestion of a mode of structure or support , other than the true one . 2d . The painting of surfaces to represent some other material than that of which they actually consist , ( as in the marbling of wood ) , or the deceptive representation of sculptured ornament upon them . 3d . The use of cast or machine-made ornaments of any kind . He insists that architecture will be noble just in the degree that**1l such deceits are rejected . At the same time usage has so far sanctioned some of them that he feels compelled to make // them exceptions . For instance , gilding is not exactly a violation of truth in architecture , for it makes no claim and is never understood to be anything but gilding , while in jewelry it claims to be solid gold and is there a violation of truth . We can not follow the author in his reasonings upon these nicer points of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes up painting , and speaks thus " XVhatever the material , good painting makes it more precious ; nor can it ever be said to deceive respecting the ground of which it gives us no information . To cover brick with plaster , and this plaster with fresco , is , therefore , perfectly legitimate ; and as desirable a mode of decoration , as it is constant in the great periods . Verona and Venice are now seen deprived of more than half their former splendor ; it depended far more on their frescoes than their marbles . The plaster , in this case , is to be considered as the gesso ground on panel or canvass . But to cover brick with cement , and to divide this cement with joints that it may look like stone , is to tell a falsehood ; and is just as contemptible a procedure as the other is noble . " It being lawful to paint then , is it lawful to paint everything ? So long as the painting is confessed-yes ; but if , even in the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing painted be supposed real-no. " - p. 38 . In regard to the false representations of material , our author insists that the rule excludes them all , without exception , and uses the following language in respect to the decoration of churches , language perhaps as applicable just now on this side of the Atlantic as the other . " But even this , however derogatory to the noble architecture around it , is less painful than the want of feeling with which , in our cheap modern churches , we suffer the wall decorator to erect about the altar frameworks and pediments daubed with mottled color , and to dye in the same fashions such skeletons or caricatures of columns as may emerge above the pews : this is not merely bad taste ; it is no unimportant or excusable error which brings even these shadows of vanity and falsehood into the house of prayer . The first condition which just feeling requires in church furniture is , that it should be simple and unaffected , not fictitious nor tawdry . It may be in our power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure ; and if we can not permit much to the architect , do not let us permit any thing to the upholsterer ; if we keep to solid stone and solid wood , whitewashed , if we like , for cleanliness ' sake ( for whitewash has so often been used as the dress of noble things that it has thence received a kind of nobility itself ) , it must be a bad design indeed , which is grossly offensmve. " - p. 40 . Under the third head of deceits , that of cast or machine-made work , the author urges two reasons against its use , the one , that it is bad considered simply as work , and the other , that it is dishonest . This kind of work is usually employed in the way of decoration in the nicer portions of buildings , and the dishonesty of it consists either in the suggestion of false material , as when wood is painted and sanded in imitation of stone , or in the representation of great human labor and skill where there is really nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , which ought to tell of weeks of human labor and dex* // terous chiselling , is poured in an instant out of a furnace . On this point Mr. R. speaks thus : " Yet exactly as a woman of feeling would not wear false jewels , so would a builder of honor disdain false ornaments . The using of them is just as downright and inexcusable a lie . You use that which pretends to a worth which it has not ; which pretends to have cost , and to be , what it did not , and is not ; it is an imposition , a vulgarity , an impertinence and a sin . Down with it to the ground , grind it to powder , leave its ragged place upon the wall , rather ; you have not paid for it , you have no business with it , you do not want it . Nobody wants ornaments in this world , but everybody wants integrity . All the fair devices that ever were fancied , are not worth a lie . Leave your walls as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked mud and chopped straw , if need be ; but do not rough-cast them with falsehood. " - pp. 44 , 45 . In regard to bricks , they are an exception like gilding . Being always known to be moulded , they may be moulded into ever so elaborate a form and will not deceive . They will seem only what they are-moulded bricks . The next great principle of architecture , in the author 's arrangement , is that of Power , or that by which architectural works are endowed with nobleness , grandeur and impressiveness . In respect to this he says , that " in reverting to the memories of those works of architecture by which we have been most pleasurably impressed , it will generally happen that they fall into two broad classes : the one characterized by an exceeding preciousness and delicacy , to which we recur with a sense of affectionate admiration ; and the other by a severe , and , in rnnny cases mysterious , majesty , which we remember with an undiminished awe , like that felt at the presence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on to say farther , " Now , the difference between these two orders of building is not merely that which there is in nature between things beautiful and sublime . It is , also , the difference between what is derivative and original in man 's work ; for whatever is in architecture fair or beautiful , is imitated from natural forms ; and what is not so derived , but depends for its dignity upon arrangement and government received from human mind , becomes the expression of the power of that mind , and receives a sublimity high in proportion to the power expressed . All building , therefore , shows man either as gathering or governing ; and the secrets of his success are his knowing what to gather , and how to rule . These are the two great intellectual Lamps of Architecture ; the one consisting in a just and humble veneration for the works of God upon the earth , and the other in an understanding of the dominion over those works which has been vested in man . " - p. 58 . Inquiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible for man to cast over or infuse into his works , the effect of size comes at once to our notice , and every one will be ready to admit that there is a manifest connection between size and grandeur or power . It is equally obvious however , that mere size , apart from site and other attendant circumstances , may fail of producing the impression of grandeur . It makes all the difference // in the world , for instance , whether the work enters or not into close competition with nature . Bunker Hill Monument is a very different thing where it now stands from what it would be on the flank of the White Mountains . But here our author speaks so well he shall speak for himself . " While , therefore , it is not to be supposed that mere size will ennoble a mean design , yet every increase of magnitude will bestow upon it a certain degree of nobleness : so that it is well to determine at first , whether the building is to be markedly beautiful , or markedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withheld by respect to smaller parts from reaching largeness of scale ; provided only , that it be evidently in the architect 's power to reach at least that degree of magnitude which is the lowest at which sublimity begins , rudely definable as that which will make a living figure look less than life beside it . It is the misfortune of most of our modern buildings that we would fain have an universal excellence in them ; and so part of the funds must go in painting , part in gilding , part in fitting up , part in painted windows , part in small steeples , part in ornaments here and there ; and neither the windows , nor the steeple , nor the ornaments , are worth their materials . For there is a crust about the impressible part of men 's minds , which must be pierced through before they can be touched to the quick ; and though we may prick at it and scratch it in a thousand separate places , we might as well have let it alone if we do not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give such a thrust anywhere , there is no need of another ; it need not be even so " wide as a church door , " so that it be enough . And mere weight will do this ; it is a clumsy way of doing it , but an effectual way , too ; and the apathy which can not be pierced through by a small steeple , nor shown through by a small window , can be broken through in a moment by the mere weight of a great wall . " - pp. 60 , 61 . The question now arises , how shall the real magnitude of a structure be best exhibited ? Nothing is more indisputable than the fact that we are apt to under-estimate the real size of large buildings . One reason of this is that we are unaccustomed to measure such even with the eye . But another reason is that such structures are either in a bad position or have such form that we can not get their mass in one view . The more completely therefore we can see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , the more correct will be our estimate of its real proportions , and if it have size the more impressive will this be . In undertaking to give the simple effect of grandeur to any structure , we shall of course succeed best when we keep it somewhat in the cubical form , and when we do not stiffer its boundary lines to be broken . Hence the erection of a turret , however beautiful in itself , may take away the impressiveness of a wall or building and make what was before grand and noble quite spiritless and destitute of effect . The same expense too which is often lavished in the nice smoothing of stones , if laid out in the rough stone itself would be sufficient to add to the height and breadth of many a building so as to give it an air of grandeur which no polish of stones can ever impart . No one could hesitate , it would seem , in deciding which are the nobler , the rough // granite warehouses of India Wharf ; Boston , or the smooth-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all that we need in order to confer dignity and grandeur upon an architectural design . We need also the effect of light and shade . We want surface on which the light may fall , broad , free and full ; but then also we want the deep dark shadoxvs which shall give the light greater power . We want both , we want the contrast and the impressive effect which comes as the resultant of the two . Mr. Ruskin here expresses himself so well that we shall venture another quotation . " So that Rembrandtism is a noble manner in architecture , though a false one in painting ; and I do not believe that ever any building was truly great , unless it had mighty masses , vigorous and deep , of shadow mingled with its surface . And among the first habits that a young architect should learn , is that of thinking in shadow , not looking at a design in its miserable liny skeleton ; but conceiving it as it will be when the dawn lights it , and the dusk leaves it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crannies cool ; when the lizards will bask on the one , and the birds build in the other . Let him design with the sense of cold and heat upon him ; let him cut out the shadows , as men dig wells in unwatered plains ; and lead along the lights , as a founder does his hot metal ; let him keep the full command of both , and see that ho knows how they fall , and where they fade . His paper lines and proportions are of no value : all that he has to do must be done by spaces of light and darkness ; and his business is to see that the one is broad and bold enough not to be swallowed up by twilight , and the other deep enough not to be dried like a shallow pool by a noon-day sun . " - p. 70 . And again he sums up this whole matter thus briefly and vigorously . " The relative majesty of buildings depends more on the vigor and weight of their masses , than on any other attribute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light , of darkness , of color , not mere sum of any of these , but breadth of them ; not broken light , nor scattered darkness , nor divided weight , but solid stone , broad sunshine , starless shade . " - p. 82 . Our author passes next to the consideration of the principle of Beauty ; and he considers this to be characteristic of architecture , in proportion , or nearly so , as architecture is allied in its lines and forms to those found in the natural creation . He then proceeds to point out in brief how this element of beauty may be best engrafted upon architecture , the purest sources whence it is to be sought , and the mistakes to be guarded against in the pursuit of it . The matter of ornament , as connected with the beautiful , in architecture , involves most clearly the consideration of the proper place as well as the appropriate style of it . Ornament may be so misplaced as to become a positive deformity , or may be of such a kind as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day 's observation attests . On this point our author advances the following as law- ' not to decorate things belonging to purposes of active and occupied life . ' Wherever we can rest , he would allow us to decorate , but where rest is forbidden us he // insists that beauty is equally forbidden . We do not assent in full to this conclusion ; and if we had not already exceeded our prescribed limits , we would undertake to show that his law is quite too sweeping and arbitrary . Still there is a certain measure of truth in what he says . There is undoubtedly a connection between repose and the right perception of the beautiful , which is not acknowledged or understood as it should be . The elegant painting and sculpture which we find occasionally lavished on some place of mere trade or travel is a gross perversion . We sympathize too with Mr. R. in much of what he says in respect to the decoration of railway stations , though what he inveighs against is not found in this country to any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Better bury gold in the embankments , " he says , " than put it in ornaments on the stations . Will a single traveller be willing to pay an increased fare on the South Western , because the columns of the terminus are covered with patterns from Nineveh ? He will only care less for the Ninevite ivories in the British Museum : or on the North Western , because there are old Englishlooking spandrils to the roof of the station at Crewe ? He will only have less pleasure in their prototypes at Crewe House . Railroad architecture has or would have a dignity of its own if it were only left to its work . You would not put rings on the fingers of a smith at his anvil . " - pp. 100 , 101 . Mr. R. contends , and we think he is correct in it , that all men have a sense of what is right and wrong in the matter of decoration , but that they fail to act up to the sense they have . It is indeed painful to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrannize over men here as in other things of less consequence . The question too frequently is not what should be ? ' but what has Mr. A. done already in the same line ? ' And here we quote a passage as beautiful as the subject could demand . " The question of greatest external or internal decoration depends entirely on the condition of probable repose . It was a wise feeling which made the streets of Venice so rich in external ornament , for there is no couch of rest like the gondola . So , again , there is no subject of street ornament so wisely chosen as the fountain , where it is a fountain of use ; for it is just there that perhaps the happiest pause takes place in the labor of the ( lay , when the pitcher is rested on the edge of it , and the breath of the bearer is drawn deeply , and the hair swept from the forehead , and the uprightness of the form declined against the marble ledge , and the sound of the kind word or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heard shriller and shriller as the pitcher fills . What pause is so sweet as that-so full of the depth of ancient days , so softened with the calm of pastoral solitude ? " - p. 102 . The requisitions of symmetry and proportion as elements of the beautiful have here their place of consideration , in order to complete the subject ; but we have not time to enter upon these , nor upon the great topic of color and sculpture as related to beauty . In respect to the Lamp of Life we shall do little more than to name it in its place , the subject being too wide and even intricate for us to do it any justice in the limits to which we are confined . // What the author intends by life in architecture , is the expression which structures of wood or stone may be made to bear , of intelligence and purpose in the builder , and a certain animation of form . He insists that man shall throw his soul into architectural works and make it animate them so that every stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling . The Lamp of Memory leads us to the consideration of architecture in a very interesting aspect . In this aspect it is very much undervalued in our country . rfhere is so little of memorial architecture here that we have hardly any occasion to feel its power , and then again our restless and migratory character prevents our attention from being drawn in this direction . But in the volume now before us , it is well said of architecture considered in this aspect , " We may live without her , and worship without her , but we can not remember without her . " In speaking of the memorial character of architecture in its domestic structures , Mr. Ruskin touches a point which is well worth consideration any where , but which has special need of consideration among us . There is among us , what we do not know how otherwise to describe so well , a lack of the home feeling . As a people we are alive to all that is exciting . We want the world to be stirring all arouud us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while seeking to better it . The boy hardly gets above his boyhood before he feels the desire to outgo his father . The father too encourages him to this , even begets in him this desire and pushes him off into the world to shift for himself . Thus thrown on our own resources as for the most part we are at an early age , we grow up to be a people of great self-reliance arid fertility of resource . There is a feeling of independence which no other people probably have in equal measure . But it may well be questioned , whether we could not afford to forego some of our smartness for the sake of an increase of those quiet and contented feelings which may be nourished around the domestic hearth . We are in no little danger of losing sight of the importance which God has attached to the family relation . Instead of considering it as a permanent source of all that is best and most blissful , both for the present and the future , we too often regard the family simply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be nourished , only until we are fledged and able to shift for ourselves . It is not unfrequent to see father and son treating each other , when both have arrived at manhood , with less apparent regard than they do others with whom they are connected with no ties of blood . Would that we could be made to think that filial and parental affections are designed to be as permanent as life itself , and there is never any shame in their manifestation . Would that parents could understand what a nursery of all that is best and of immortal worth , home is capable of being ; // and that they would study to make it such . Then the children and the children 's children would find the roots of deepest affection clinging to the old hearth stones ; and the eyes , for many a generation , would brighten at the sight of the ancestral roof and the trees that stand as monuments around it . We pray that our people may think more and think better of home . Indeed we rejoice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point . We hope too that as our people come to think more of the home feeling , they will also think more of the home structure ; and that we shall not always build as though for one generation alone , as though we expected our children quickly to desert the house of their nativity and the place where they have received the principles which are to shape and color all subsequent life . We have indeed no system of entail , and we have no regret on this score . But we might build so for comfort and happiness at home , and might so use our houses as homes instead of mere conveniences for eating and sleeping while engaged in the great work of making money ; we might so identify the family history with the walls of the dwelling and the trees and fences round about , that it would be felt the greatest privilege of the children to live and die where they were born , or if that in the providence of God were impossible , then at least to make pilgrimages to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Mecca or Jerusalem . In respect to this whole matter there is food for reflection in the following remarks of our author . " When men do not love their hearths , nor reverence their thresholds , it is a sign that they have dishonored both , and that they have never acknowledged the true universality of that Christian worship which was indeed to supersede the idolatry , but not the piety , of the pagan . Our God is a household God , as well as a heavenly one ; He has an altar in every man 's dwelling ; let men look to it when they rend it lightly and pour out its ashes . It is not a question of mere ocular delight , it is no question of intellectual pride , or of cultivated and critical fancy , how , and of what aspect of durability and of completeness , the domestic buildings of a nation shall be raised . It is one of those moral duties , not with more impunity to be neglected because the perception of them depends on a finely toned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and patience , and fondness , and diligent completion , and with a view to their duration at least for such a period as , in the ordinary course of national revolutions , might be supposed likely to extend to the entire alteration of the direction of local interests . This at the least ; but it would be better if , in every possible instance , men built their own houses on a scale commensurate rather with their condition at the commencement , than their attainments at the termination , of their worldly career ; and built them to stand as long as human work at its strongest can be hoped to stand ; recording to their children what they have been , and from what , if so it had been permitted them , they had risen . And when houses are thus built , we may have that true domcstic architecture , the beginning of all other , which does not disdain to treat with respect and thoughtfulness the small habitation as well as the large , and which invests with the dignity of contented manhood the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lamp of Obedience , Mr. Ruskin sets forth the necessity of a fixed system of law in architecture , in obedience to which its various structures shall rise , rather than according to the whim or caprice of the individual builder . He insists that the great principles involved in building constitute a common law of architecture , which must not be violated , and which can not be violated except with dangerous results . He discusses in this chapter also the subject of new styles and of originality in architecture , and concludes that no new style is necessary and that the great architect has room enough to show all needful originality while working in conformity with the already accepted principles of the art . We have not space to enlarge upon these tol ) ics , important as they are , nor to go farther with the general subject be*-fore us . Our pages are not the appropriate place for formal and complete discussions of the subject in its more professional aspects . We can only touch the grand principles involved , and give to onr readers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a fuller examination of the matter we must refer them to particular treatises upon the subject . This we have at present endeavored to do . Our course of thought may appear disjointed and fragmentary . This has been even necessary on account of the wide field we have traversed , its many subjects of consideration , and the inadequacy of space for their orderly treatment . But if , by what we have now done , we are able to impress any with a sense of the dignity and moral importance of architecture , if we are able to beget in any an increased esteem of home and a desire to make the house more what the shrine of domestic affections should be , or if we can lead to the same result by leading any to the book which we have here and there opened before them , we shall not regret the labor which we have put forth for the accomplishment of this object .
