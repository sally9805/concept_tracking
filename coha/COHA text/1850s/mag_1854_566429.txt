ART . 111. - THE EARLY HISTORY OF OHIO . K scr ' *jpt Autobiography of Gen. Rufus Putnam . Orig ' al Journals and Letters . WE have heretofore ( Vol . VII ) spoken of ' the pioneer settlement of the Ohio valley , and of the Northwest Territory ; and , also , published a brief notice ( Vol . X ) of the pioneer settlers of Ohio . In the above articles we were indebted to the labors of S. P. llildreth , Esq. , who with great pains and fidelity has investigated the early history of Ohio . We propose now to give a more minute acount of its first settlement and early history . The present is regarded by all as a critical time in our national history . Our federal union , which has breasted every stqrm and recovered from every plunge , is now believed by all thoughtful people to be in perils which involve more fearful hazard than any which our past annals can show . The public mind at the North is agitated , as it has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who have hitherto sanctioned even questionable methods for " saving the Union , " are now becoming convinced that our Southern brethren consider that Union valuable only as a means of Slavery propagandism , and with this conviction , regard its existence with such an odious future before it as no longer to be desired . While the public mind is thus stirred to its profoundest depths , it may be well to look backward as well as forward , and inquire whether History can give us any light , by which we may now discern the path of duty which is ever the path of safety . Just now the organization of the territories of Nebraska and Kansas impels all to consider the general subject of territories , and the modes of settling , organizing , and governing them . Many of our readers belong to the old Thirteen States , and are little familiar with the methods of settling new territories and forming new States . We propose to give an outline of the early settlement , and of the territorial history of Ohio , believing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little aid in determining the nature and bearings of certain great questions before the people . // In the Manuscript Journal of General IRufus Putnam , kept during the winter and spring of 1778 , we find the following entry . " Monday , April 7th , passed the West line on the South range , 35 minutes after 11 o'clock , A. M. Arrived at Muskingum at 1 o'clock , P. M. , and came to , on the East point or fork between the Ohio and Muskingum . " This appears at first to be a very trivial event , and yet , this event makes the 7th of April , 1788 , the historical day of Ohio , and Marietta the Plymouth of the West . The State ilistorical Society annually celebrates this day . A traveler might pass by the Observatories at Greenwich or Washington and little think that from them the different geographers compute the longitude for the globe ; so the landing of a single ship upon the bleak coast of New England , and the landing of a few immigrants from a rude boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves insignificant matters , yet each is connected with results so vast and sublime , that it becomes a land-mark from which the historian and statesman take their reckoning . The landing at Marietta , April 8th , 1788 , introduced the first organized white settlement in the vast region lying Northwest of the Ohio River . It was the first link in that chain of events which reaches down to the present moment , the other links of which are the formation of great and mighty States , the onward movements of civilization and the settlement of millions of free people upon free soil . The design of making an organized settlement Northwest of the Ohio , was first publicly suggested , so far as we have been able to learn , by soldiers of the Revolution in June , 1783 . Peace with England had been declared on the 9th of April previous , but the army had not been brought to its final reduction . Anticipating this reduction , many of the officers had begun to look auxionsly into the future , and to inquire how they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these Officers had been in the army from early manhood , , and consequently had had no opportunity to acquire for themselves any competence upon which to rely for support . Others had spent all or nearly all their previous property to meet the necessary expenses of themselves and families during the war , and at the close of the war found themselves almost penniless . This was especially true of the officers from the Northern States . The thought of returning home in such reduced circumstances , to toil in subordinate conditions of manual labor , was painful . They were willing enough to labor but preferred to begin life anew , if it must be , upon a new sphere and in a new country . This was not the feeling of all probably , but certainly of most . // Hence they proposed to form a Military Colony in the West . It is probable that the idea was first suggested by General Rufus Putnam , because a similar plan had been proposed after the war with France . We give the following extract from his Manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , where he had been several years , soliciting the British Government for a grant of lands to the Provincial officers and soldiers who had served in the late war against France . Soon after General Lyman 's return , a meeting of the adventurers was notified , which was held at Hartford in November of the same year . To this meeting General Lyman gave information that an order had passed the King in Council , authorizing the Governor of West Florida , to grant lands in that province to the Provincials in the same proportion as had been provided for his Majesty 's regular troops . " It was voted to explore the lands , and the celebrated Israel Putnam , afterwards General Putnam , Rufus Putnam , Captain Enos and Mr. Thaddeus Lyman , were appointed to conduct the survey . The Committee spent eight or nine months in exploring , and located nineteen townships upon Big Black River , at its junction with the Mississippi . Several hundred families embarked from Massachusetts and Connecticut to make the settlement , but to their great dismay , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land office to be closed . Many fell sick and died , and the Revolutionary war breaking out , the enterprise was abandoned . Had that enterprise been successful , the settlement would have constituted an outpost of Freedom , and might have led ultimately to the establishment of free States upon the lower Mississippi . General Rufus Putnam 's journal states that the largest plantation they saw upon the River contained only sixteen elaves . Probably General Rufus Putnam had never abandoned the idea of forming such a settlement , and doubtless the plan of settling in Ohio originated with him . In June , 1783 , he , with two hundred and eighty-two others , officers and soldiers in the army , petitioned Congress for a grant of land iu the Western Country . Having confidence in their beloved commander , General Washington , they requested General Rufus Putnam to write to him a letter , to ask his influence with Congress in their behalf . The following extract from this letter , dated June 16 , 1783 , will show the rare good sense and foresight of Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , are much opposed to the monopoly of lands , and wish to guard against large patents being granted to individuals , as in their opinion such a mode would be very injurious to a country and greatly retard its settlement , and when such patents are tenanted , // it throws too much power into the hands of a few . For these and many other obvious reasons , the petitioners hope no grant will be made but by townships of six miles square , or six by twelve , or six by eighteen , to be subdivided by the proprietors into six miles square , that being the standard on which they wish all calculations to be made ; and that officers and soldiers , as well as those who petition for charters , may form their associations on one uniform principle as to number of persons or rights to be contained in a township . " And here we wish to quote a few words from the speech of Daniel Webster in 1830 , in the United States Senate , on Mr. Foote 's resolution relative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions , large enough almost for an empire , were to be appropriated to private ownership . How was this best to be done ? What system for sale and disposition should be adopted ? Two modes for conducting the sales presented themselves  --  the one a Southern , and the other a Northern mode . That which was adopted was the Northern system , and is that which we now see in successful operation in all the new States . That which was rejected was the system of warrants , surveys , entry , and location , such as prevails south of the Ohio . It is not necessary to extend these remarks into invidious comparisons . This last system is that which , as has been emphatically said , has shingled over the country to which it has been applied , with so many conflicting titles and claims . Everybody acquainted with the subject knows how easily it leads to speculation and litigation , two great calamities in a new country . From the system actually established these evils are banished . Now , sir , in effecting this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , New England acted with vigor and effect ; and the latest posterity of those who settled northwest of the Ohio will have reason to remember with gratitude her patriotism and her wisdom . * * * New England gave the system to the West , and while it remains there will be spread over all the West one monument of her intelligence in matters of government and her practical good sense . " Now , what Webster claims for New England , we claim especially for Gen. IRufus Putnam , a son of New England , who first proposed this system to Congress , even before Congress was in actual possession of the lands to be divided , and whose good sense and judgment in this matter so commended themselves , that Gen. Washington afterwards appointed him Surveyor General of the United States to carry out his system into practice . Although Washington warmly approved the object of the petition for land in the West , and addressed a letter to the P resident of Congress urging the matter , yet no grant was obtained . A reason assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these western lands were not in the actual possession of the IJuited States . It was , however , admitted that they belonged to the United States , since these lands were regarded as Crown lands before the Revolution , and having been conquered from the Crown by no one State , but by all the // States , they were justly considered as common property . Hence , Massachusetts and New York relinquished all their asserted rights in the West , and Connecticut did the same , reserving only a small tract in northern Ohio , and in March , 1784 , Virginia made a formal cession of all her claims beyond the Ohio river . We formerly supposed that this surrender of territory on the part of Virginia was done with the expectation that it was so much given to Freedom , and that it was at that time a certainty in the minds of her statesmen that it would be made free territory ; and under this supposition we have been led to honor her ancient character , rejoicing to find in her past so noble a contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to this great question of personal freedom , she has had no such glorious part . Daniel Webster has publicly declared the following facts . " The cession by Virginia was made March , 1784 . On the 19th of April following , a committee , consisting of Messrs . Jefferson , Chase , and Howell , reported a plan for a temporary government of the territory , in which was this article : That after the year 1800 , there shall be , neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the said States otherwise than in the punishment of crime , whereof the parties shall have been convicted . ' Mr. Spaight , of North Carolina , moved to strike out this paragraph ; the question was put according to the form then practised , Shall these words stand as part of the plan * &amp;c . New Hampshire , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania , seven States , in the affirmative ; Maryland , Virginia , and South Carolina in the negative . North Carolina was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the words could not stand , and were struck out accordingly . Mr. Jefferson voted for the clause , but was overruled by his collea*ues In March of the next year , ( 1785 , ) Mr. King , of Massac*rnsetts , seconded by Mr. Ellery , of Rhode Island , proposed the formerly rejected article , with this addition- ' and that this regulation shall be an article of compact , and remain a fundamental principle of the constitutions between the thirteen original States , and each of the States described in the resolves , ' &amp;c . On this clause , which provided the adequate and thorough security , the eight Northern States voted affirmatively , and the four Southern States negatively . The votes of nine States were not yet obtained , and thus the provision was again rejected by the Southern States . The perseverance of the North held out , and two years afterward the object was obtained . " We have been unable to find in any public documents to // which we have access the particulars of the final vote upon the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Hon. Mr. Seward and others in the United States Senate , that the ordinance passed unanimously , may refer to the subsequent re*nactment of the ordinance by a new Congress after the adoption of the Constitution . There would , of course , be uo opposition when it was known that opposition would be useless , the Northwest Territory having already been organized and civil rights gained under it . If the Ordinance passed unanimously in the old Congress , the vote of some of these Southern States was anomalous and at war with their antecedents and consequents. * The South has never been * The following extract from the most valuable historical speech of Mr. Upham , of Mass. , will perhaps explain the matter . " The secret history of the transaction is not yet revealed-perhaps never will be . The facts , so far as they are yet known , are these : On the 9th of July , 1787 , in the old Congress , the subject of the establishment of a Civil Government in the Northwest Territory was again taken up , and referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia was chairman , and Nathan Dane of Massachusetts a member . On the 11th of July , only two days afterward , this committee reported the celebrated instrument since known as the Ordinance of 1787 . ' It contains the clause forbidding the extension of slavery into that Territory  --  the very clause , substantially , which Thomas Jefferson had endeavored in vain to persuade the same body to adopt ; which Rufus King had also advocated in vain ; and which , for more than three years , the slaveholding Representatives had constantly resisted , with prompt and inflexible determination and unanimity . But now , the very next day after it had been reported , they unanimously and instantly accepted and agreed to it-every southern vote stands recorded in the affirmative ; indeed , every vote , North and South , except that of a single Delegate from New York , Robert Yates . why this sudden , utter , and universal change ? It was because there was attached to the restriction an obligation on the part of the States that might be formed within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not broached before in either the Congress or the Convention , and not known to the law of Nations or the comity of States . It was evidently the consideration offered by the free States to the slave States , and accepted by the latter , as an equivalent for their relinquishment of their claim of right to carry their institution into any part of the common territorial possessions of the United States . This arrangement at once removed all obstacles out of the way of establishing a union under the Constitution ; forthwith everything went on harmoniously and rapidly toward a satisfactory adjustment of every question in the Congress and in the Convention . Without further delay , it was admitted , all aronad , that the measure adopted , when burdens were to be imposed , was no more and no less than just when power was to be distributed , and the three-fifths ratio was agreed to in the enumeration of slaves in the population basis of this House . The grant of power to Congress to prohibit the importation of slaves after 1808 , and to levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to . The South relinquished all claim to carry slavery into new territory , thereby putting limits to its spread , and consented to allow a limit to be put to it , in time , by authorizing the importation of slaves to be tnxed , and , after a specified date , prohibited . The consideration paid by the free States to the slave States for these concessions and restrictions , was agreeing to allow that species of property the special privilege of representation , and to suffer the reclamation of fugitive slaves . But this latter obligation von . xii . 49 // willing to give one foot of land to Freedom , when it could be avoided , and Slavery had the same tendencies in the early days to corrupt and debase statesmen that it has now . It was , however , pecuniarily unprofitable then , and hence did not appeal to self-interest as strongly as it does now . It is the great fact , that George Washington , a Southern man , was ever true to his convictions of duty in regard to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the whole South upon him to make him swerve from those convictions , that , in our estimation , gives to his character its elevation and granXeur far more than his calmness in the presence of embattled hosts . Jefferson at first marked out for himself the same line of conduct , and indeed wrote noble words for freedom , rallying words for men and nations in all time ; but he afterwards yielded and fell , and , like the fall of the house builded upon the sand , great was his fall . Immediately after the cession of the Northwest Territory to the United States by Yirginia , Gen. Putnam again addressed a letter to Gen. Washington on the subject of a settlement in the West . From this letter , dated April 6th , 1q84 , we quote as follows : stands in particular and special relation to the non-extension of slavery . It is the equivalent paid by the free States to the slave States , in consideration of the abandonment by the slave States of all claim to extend their slavery beyond their own limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordinance of 1781 : Article the Sixth-There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said Territory , otherwise than in punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted . Provided always , That any person es caping into the same , from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original Statcs , such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service , as aforesaid . ' " So far as States might rise within thc limits of the Northwest Territory , the arrangement was made unalterable and perpetual by the express language of the Ordinance : it is hereby ordained and declared by the majority aforesaid , That the following articles shall be considered as articles of compact between the original States and the people and States in the said Territory , and forever remain unalterable , unless by common consent . ' " The Constitution of the United States impressed the seal of its sanctity and inviolability upon this compact by ordaining ( Art . vi , 1st paragraph ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as valid against the Tjnited States , under this Constitution , as under the Confederation . ' I hold , Mr. Chairman , that no man can study carefully the proceedings of that day , without being compelled to the conclusion , that the real bargain , compromise , compact between the two great sections was , that the South would not attempt to carry slavery into new territory , and the North would extend a certain degree of protection over that species of property where it then was , and so long as it might last , particularly in allowiiig the recovery of fugitive slaves within the limits of the free States . " // " The settlement of the Ohio country , sir , engrosses many of my thoughts , and much of my time since I left the camp has been employed in informing myself and others with respect to the nature , and situation , and circumstances of that onatry , and the practicability of removing ourselves there ; and if lam to form an opinion on what I have seen and heard on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that country , as soon as the honorable Congress make provisions for granting lands there , and locations and settlements can be made there with safety ; unless such provision is too long delayed-I mean till necessity turn their views another way , which must soon be the case with many . * * * Another reason why we wish to know as soon as possible what the intentions of Congress are , respecting our petition , is the effect such knowledge will probably have on the credit of the certificates we have received on the settlement of accounts . Tbose securities are now selling at no more than three shillings sixpence or four shillings on the pound ; which , in all probability , might double , if no more , the moment it was known that 4*overnment would receive them for lands in the Ohio country . From these circumstances , and many others which might be mentioned , we are growing quite impatient , and the general inquiry now is , When are we going to Ohio l ' Among others , J3rigadier General Tapper , Lieut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accompany me to that country the moment the way is opened for such an undertaking . " We have in our possession the original reply of Washington , dated Mt . Vernon , 2nd June , 1784 : " I wish it was in my power to give you a more favorable account of the officers ' petition for lands on the Ohio and its waters than I am about to do . After this matter , and information respecting the establishment for peace , were my inquiries , as I went through Annapolis , solely directed ; but I could not learn that anything decisive had been done in either . On the latter I hear Congress are differing about their powers ; but as they have accepted the cession from Virginia , and have resolved to lay off ten new States , bounded by latitudes and longitudes , it should be supposed they should determine something respecting the former before they adjourn ; and yet I very much question it , as the latter is to happen on the 3d , that is , to-morrow . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjournment , will be composed of an entire new choice of delegates , it is not in my power at this time to direct you to a proper correspondent in that body . I wish I could ; for persuaded I am , that to some such cause as you have assigned , may be ascribed the delay the petition has encountered ; for surely if justice , and gratitude to the army , and general policy of the Union were to govern in this case , there would not be the smallest interruption in granting its request . I really feel for those gentlemen , who , by these unaccountable delays , ( by any other means than those you have suggested , ) are held in such an awkward and disagreeable state of suspense , and wish my endeavors could remove the obstacles . At Princeton ( before Congress left that place ) I exerted every power I was master of , and dwelt upon the arguments you have used , to show the propriety of a speedy decision . Every member with whom I conversed acquiesced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to yield , to the policy of it , but plead the want of cession of the land to act upon ; this is made and accepted , and yet matters ( as far as they have come to my knowledge ) remain in statu qUO . " Generals Putnam , Tupper and their associates , having thus earnestly petitioned for a grant of Western land , and the matter having been urged by Washington with " every power he was master of , " upon the attention of Congress , finding themselves treated with entire indifference and neglect , at last determined // to adopt a new plan of effort . They would no longer petition , for they wonld buy the lands they needed . They hoped , of course , to use their Continental certificates and warrants , and other evidences of claim , as well as the greatly depreciated currency in which they had been paid , as in part payment for their land . How far the hope was realized we are unable to say . In 1792 , several years after the purchase was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres of the previously purchased land might be paid for in " army bounty rights . " It was the opinion of Daniel Webster that the soldiers of the Revolution could maintain an action against the Government for the full and par value of the depreciated money with which they had been paid . We know not that such a suit was ever attempted . In Jan. 1786 , Generals Putnam and Tupper issued a call for a public meeting of soldiers and others interested in the proposed settlement on the Ohio and for the purpose of forming an " Ohio Company . " Previous to this , however , Gem Putnam had been appointed one of the UAited States Surveyors of Western lands , but as he was engaged in public surveys for the State of Massachusetts in the province of Maine , he secured the temporary appointment of Gen. Tupper in his p lace . Gen. Tupper visited Ohio and made a favorable report , which greatly aided the project of the settlement . After various meetings of the Ohio Company , each resulting in greater definiteness of plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass. , ( and father of the late Judge Ephraim Cutler of Warren , Washington County , Ohio , ) was sent in July , 1787 , to negotiate with Congress , then in session at New York City , for a tract of land for the Company . The Journal he kept of his journey and negotiations is a historical paper of rare interest , and has never been published , except a small part , in a valuable article on the early history of Ohio , in the North American Review of Oct. 1841 . Congress before this , had been troubled to know what to do with the public lands of the West . It would neither give them away nor sell them , and yet they were very troublesome to keep . It was in the deplorable condition of the man who had received the gift of an elephant . The States regarded these lands as a great public treasure and expected by them to p*y off their debts . It will be remembered that we emerged from the Revolution victors upon the battle field alone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indeed in all respects we were a crippled and bankrupt people . Overwhelmed with debts , we had nothing with which to pay , but the wild lands of the West , then in the joint occupancy of wolves and Indians . We need not stop to mention // how entirely changed public sentiment now is , in respect to the precionsness of public lands . They are now opened by Congress for general seiznre . The national domain is now wasted with that kind of startling prodigality with which the early Californian miners wasted their abnndant gold . A resigned philosopher seems to say , " let it be wasted , and the sooner it is gone the better , for thus a great source of political corrnption will be dried up . " The present state of things contrasts strangely with the tight grasp with which lands were held when Gen. Putnam and his brave associates of the Revolution in vain implored for a grant , and at last were obliged to purchase at what have ever since been considered as exacting rates . We wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of late the Western States claim the entire right to these lands , and the Eastern States , the partners in the firm of States , and originally constituting the entire firm , are smiled at for their superannuated simplicity when they assert that these lands belong to the United States , and not to the West alone . The ancient firm , it must be admitted , was a little frugal , but its capital was small . It had only the Northwest territory extending to the Mississippi River , a small farm compared with the vast plantation now possessed , and which , alas ! has become of late a plantation in the worst sense of the term . This treatment of the old thirteen States is neither just nor honorable . It is a little remarkable , that at the very time Dr. Cutler was negotiating with Congress for the land for the Ohio Company , the celebrated ordinance of 1787 was passed . Indeed Dr. Cutler was consulted in regard to it , and was requested to propose amendments , which he did , and he writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except one , which was better qualified . " The Ohio Company had proposed , then , the only plan of a definite settlement of the Northwest territory , and it may not be too much to say , that the ordinance was passed especially for Ohio , although , of course , provisions would be made in it for new settlements and new States . The passage of this glorious Ordinance only a few days before the Northwest was opened for settlement , must ever be regarded as one of those Providences which show the ever watchful care of the Almighty over human affairs . Had that Ordinance never been passed , we have no hesitation in saying , that Ohio , instead of being the third State in the Union , would now have been a driveling Slave State , with a small and scattered population of white people , eking out a precarious subsistence gained by the forced toil of a few lazy , half-starved negroes . Instead of her Cincin // natis , and Clevelands , and Daytons , those busy hives of an ever wakeful industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand trains , each carrying the population of a village , or the prodnce of a hundred farms ; instead of her highly perfected system of Common Schools , furnishing the means of education so excellent , and adapted to all , that the rich and the poor alike , joyfully employ them ; instead of a vast agricultural population , intelligent and industrious , sending abroad from its surplus products the food for millions , instead of tens of thousands of mechanics supplying her with all that an inventive industry can furnish ; in line , instead of all those elements of prosperity which have made Ohio a great , and free , and glorious State : she would have had , what ? a few debased negro slaves and the masters who debased them . All would be changed . Her noble cities would be gone , to be replaced by a meagre village in each county , all grass-grown except in front of Court House and tavern ; the Common School would be unknown , her products for exchange would be a little corn from the valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her laboring classes , who by their intelligent industry have honored themselves and honored the State , would give way to the debased white laborer , the " poor white trash " of the South , and the dirt eaters of the Carolinas ; all would be changed , and the State of Ohio , that young Samson with flowing locks of strength , would have been , if a Samson at all , shorn of his strength , and with eyes put out , would be grinding in the prison house of the enemies of Freedom . It was under the guardian care of this noble Ordinance that the fathers of Ohio laid the fIrm foundations of that mighty State ; under it they lived and many of them grew great and immortal ; under it their children now live , realizing its worth and enjoying its abundant blessings , and hoping to transmit all to their posterity . We earnestly trust that the people of Ohio will transmit with these blessings an earnest and manly love for the charter of Freedom , that has made them what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to loathe those , who , brought up under all the elevating and ennobling influences of Freedom , are themselves so little elevated and so little ennobled as to ignore all distinction between the fundamental principles of right and wrong , and to betray to their haughty Southern masters , that vast region of territory which had been consecrated to Freedom , regardless alike of the indignation of the civilized world and of the condemnation of Him who declares , " cursed be he who removeth his neighbor 's land-mark ; and all the people shall say , amen // The act of Congress anthorizing the sale of land to the Ohio Company , passed July 7th , 1787 . Active preparations were at once commenced for making a settlement upon the lands , and Gen. Putnam , who had been appointed the Superintendent of the Colony and Surveyor , left Hartford with his associates on the 5th of January , 1788 . They were nearly seven weeks on their weary way over the mountains , in the depth of winter , before they reached the Yohio-geny River , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats and obtain provisions , until the 1st of April . On that day they embarked on the downward current , and reached the month of the IMluskingum the 7th of the same month-sixty-six years ago . In this company there were forty-eight persons , all men . It should be remembered , that on the West side of the junction of the Muskingnm was a Fort , called Fort Harmar , from its commander , Gen. ilarmar . There had also been a few scattered families along the Ohio , between the Muskingum and the Pennsylvania line . It may not be without interest to quote from the journal of Gen. II3utler , who was appointed one of the Commissioners to make treaties with the Northern and Westem Thdians , and who also selected the location of Fort Harmar . He passed down the Ohio River with troops , in the Autumn of 1785 . " Friday , Oct. 1st , passed Yellow Creek , and found several improvements on both sides of the River ,  --  put in at one Jesse Penniman 's on the North side , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one Pry , who I warned off also ; this appears to be a shrewd sensible man . * * * Passed on to the Ningo towns where we found a number of people , among whom one Ross seems to be the principal man of the settlers on the North side .

At this place , found one Walter Kean , who seems but a middling character , and rather of the dissentious cast ; warned all these off , and requested that they would inform their neighbors , which they promised to do . * ** Called at the settlement of one Capt . Hoglan , who we also warned off ; his house had also been thrown down and rebuilt . Tuesday , Oct. 4th. * * * * wrote to Col. ilarmar for threc other men to joiii these as an escort , and to give Maj. Dougherty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Zdushingum , that is , on the North side of the River . " There were probably as many of these settlers in the Northwest territory then , as there are of the same class now in Elansas and Nebraska , but alas , Mr. Douglass ' idiotic idea of " squatter sovereignty " had not then been developed , and Gen. Butler , with the orders and proclamation of Congress in his hands , ordered them all off the United States territory , and pulled down their houses . Mr. Douglass ' amiable heart must be deeply pained at this recital , and he may be disposed to destroy // the Ordinance of 1787 , in order to rectify these atrocious wrongs to the poor yet sovereign squatters . On the 2d of July , the Directors and Agents of the Ohio Company West of the mountains held a meeting at Marietta , there being present Gen. Parsons , Gen. IR . Putnam and Judge Yarnum , Directors ; Col. John May , Winthrop Sargent , Col. Archibald Crary , Maj. William Corlis , Col. Return J. Meigs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haffield White , and Gen. K. Putnam , Agents . From the titles , the military character of all these men may be learned . Among the resolutions passed was the following singular one . " That the city near the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum be called Marietta , that the Directors write to His Excellency Count Monstiers , informing him of their motives in naming the city , and request his opinion whether it will he advisable to present to Her Majesty of France ( Marie Antoinette ) a public square. ** It may be thought that the views of the first settlers were somewhat extravagant in regard to their metropolitan city Marietta . Compared with those of modern projectors of paper cities , their views were modest . Had it not been for the war with the Indians which was waged for many years after the settlement of the town and the immediate offering by Congress of large tracts of land further West for sale , it is possible that Marietta might have distanced all competition and have become commercially as well as chronologically , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequent importance , from a merely accidental cause . Columbia and the city of Symmes ( now North Bend ) each at one time had a decided advantage over it . According to Judge Burnet it was a mere affair of the heart on the part of an officer who was to erect a block house at North Bend , but who followed the removal of his fair Dulcinea to Cincinnati , and there erected the block house , that determined the superiority of the latter place . Columbia , which is six miles above Cincinnati , was settled in November , 1788 , ' or eight months after the arrival of Gen. Putnam at Marietta . The first landing was made at Cincinnati , the 24th of December , of the same year . For many interesting facts relative to the settlements , we must refer the reader to the invaluable work of Judge Burnet , entitled " Notes on the Northwest Territory . " hi e he work contains some slight inaccuracy of details , it nevertheless possesses great merit , and is indeed the only work which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio . Very soon after the landing of the first settlers at Marietta , the territorial officers , Gov . St. Clair , and Judges Parsons and // Yarnum , arrived and entered upon their duties . Winthrop Sargent , who was invited by iRev . PrI Cutler to aid him in the negotiations with Congress , for the land for the Ohio Company , and who signed the contracts with Dr. Cutler , was appointed the Secretary of the Territory . Upon the Governor and Jndges devolved the government of the territory , their acts being subject to revision by Congress . The Ordinance also provided , that , " so soon as there shall be five thousand male " ( not free white male ) " inhabitants , of full age in the district , " there may be formed a territorial Legislature , composed of iRepresentatives who have been residents in the district three years , or of the United States three years , and resident in the district at the time of the election , a five years probation of foreigners not being required . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the territory , that there was any Legislature , the delay being caused by the want of a sufficient population . During much of this time the people of the territory were engaged in the Indian war , and gave comparatively little consideration to other political matters , but they were generally well satisfied with the government of the Governor and Judges . These men were regarded as honest , good men , who had at heart the welfare of the territory . Gov . St. Clair stood high with the people of the whole country , and at the time he was appointed to this office , he was the President of the Continental Congress . Respecting the Indian wars our narrow limits will not allow us to speak but a word . There were three campaigns , the first an unsuccessful one , under the command of Gen. ilarmar ; the second , a far more unfortunate and disastrous one , under Gov . St. Clair ; the third , securing a complete and decisive victory , under the command of the brave Gen. Anthony Wayne . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saved the whole frontier from Canada to the Spanish possessions on the South , from a general and terrible war with the Indians . Cincinnati and the neighboring settlements were in the direct war path of the Indians as they passed from the Lakes to attack the people of Kentucky . Marietta was also upon another war path of the hostile tribes , as they passed down the Muskingum into the Ohio , for the purpose of attacking the scattered settlements on the East of that river . The military character of the leading men of the Ohio Company settlements , and in a less degree of the settlers about Cincinnati , led naturally to well planned methods of defense , and so vigilant were the guards , that comparatively few of the people were killed . At night the people of the colony slept within their block houses , and while at work in their fields , always had their guns // near , and also had sentinels posted on some stump or tree to give timely alarm . They still followed the pursuits of peace , although in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in no small degree , their safety , for they thus kept near their fortifications , while those settlements that were composed to a greater degree of hunters and more restless spirits , lost considerable numbers , the rangers being cut off in small parties by the ever watchful savages . The settlers of Ohio generally , and esp*cially of the Ohio Company , presented a marked contrast to m any of the frontier men who lived on the East of the Ohio . The region alluded to , extending upward into Western Pennsylvania , was cursed with a set of lawless and infamous men . Their treatment of the Indians was such as excites our deepest abhorrence and indignation . They waged a war of cold blooded extermination . We could give many well authenticated instances of the merciless wart*re . Such of our readers as are acquainted with the early missionary operations in our country , have doubtless read of the Moravian mission upon the head waters of the beautiful iMluskingum . It was established before the Revolution , and so successful was it , that hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince of Peace , and at once renouncing all their former practices , devoted themselves to the pursuits of a more civilized life . In 1782 , there having been some Indian murders committed in the vicinity of Wheeling , and these peaceful IMloravians living nearer than any other tribe , it was wickedly claimed that they must therefore be the guilty party . Accordingly the destruction of those missionary stations , and of all the Christianized Indians , was resolved upon . A company of nearly ninety men was gathered and started for these IlVioravian towns . Arriving at Guadenhutten , they found a large number of Indians gathering corn in the fields , the crops not having been gathered the Autumn before . Professing peace and good will , they told the IMloravians that they had come to take them to Fort Pitt , ( now Pittsburgh , ) for safety . This was pleasant intelligence , because their present position exposed them to attacks from hostile Indians , on the ground that they were friendly to the whites , and with all speed they begun to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the Indians were sent with a party of whites to the neighboring town of Salem , to bring the people from there . These were found also gathering corn in the field , and they cheerfully obeyed the summons . On the return to Gnadenhutt en , the Indians were divided into two parties , and thrust inLo two houses and guarded . Being thns secured a council was held to decid*e upon // their fate . The commanding officer , Col. David Williamson , drew the soldiers up in a line , and put the question to them , " whether the Moravian Indians should be taken prisoners to Pittsburgh , or put to death ? " and requested " all in favor of saving their lives , to step out of the line and form a second rank . " Sixteen or eighteen stepped forward , but as Rev. Dr. iDoddridge , a historian of Western Yirginia , well remarks , " the line of mercy was far too short for that of vengeance . " The Indians were at once told to prepare for death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been spending their time in singing , and praying , and exhorting each other to place a firm reliance in the mercy of the Saviour . When their fate was formally announced , these poor devoted Christian Indians embraced , and kissed each other amid tears and sighs , and asked mutual pardon for any wrongs they had ever done . To the demand of the soldiers , already impatient for blood , " whether they were ready to die " - they answered that they had " committed their souls to God , and were ready to die . " The scenes of the next hour are too horrible to relate . The interior of those houses presented an awful spectacle of the dying and ghastly dead . The old and young , women and children , were , equally with the men , the victims of this fiendish massacre . Thus ninety-six were slaughtered , of whom more than twenty were women , and thirty-four were children . But two escaped , and these were lads . One had been knocked down and 8ca*ped , but not killed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slain until the dusk of the evening , when he crept out of the door , and escaped . The other had slipped through a trap door into the cellar of one of the slaughter houses , from which he escaped through a small cellar window . That night the houses were burned , as was the whole village , and then these white hell-hounds hurried back rejoicing , to their own settlements . Respecting these men , Dr. Doddridge , who was personally acquainted wit 1 Col. Williamson , the leader , says : " Should it be asked what sort of people composed the band of murderers of these unfortunate people * I answer , they were not miscreants , nor vagabonds ; many of them were men of the first standing in the country . " If these were the best men of that country , what must be thought of the worst ? It was some of these " first men of the country , " who exterminated the family of poor Logan , the Mingo Chief , who lived not far from Wheeling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornstalk , the friend of the whites , at the mouth of the Kanahwa River . But a speedier vengeance overtook many of these ' men than they expected . In a month they started again // to complete the work of exterminating the Christian Indians , the inhabitants of one of the ilVioravian towns having lied in time to avoid the previous slaughter . The destruction of every Indian , friend or foe , was resolved on . But the unchristianized tribe , exasperated by these fearful massacres , sought revenge . They rallied and drove back the invaders , and many of the white captives were burned alive . Col. Crawford , the leader , and who was in the first expedition , was taken prisoner , and burned in a slow flame . We allude to these dreadful transactions , not only because they took place within the limits of Ohio , but to show the marked contrasts between the settlers of Ohio , and those of the State adjoining on the East , and also to show the great and terrible wrongs which the Indians sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white settlements encroaching upon their territories , they should raise the war-cry , and fall upon their intruders . They made a great mistake in confounding the people of Ohio , who went West to establish peaceful , enlightened , and industrious communities , with those border men we have described , who went out from civilization because they were not of it , and who regardless of the Christian IReligion , to which the IMioravian Indians had been converted , regardless of the confidence reposed in them by the child-like IMloravians , regardless of age and sex , thirsted for the blood of indiscriminate butchery . These Indians defeated Gen. Harmar in 1790 . In 1791 , they cut to pieces and routed with great slaughter , the army of Gen. St. Clair , killing twenty-eight commissioned officers on the battle field , and wounding twenty-one more , of whom many died , killing also , six hundred soldiers , and wounding two hundred and forty-two , of whom many afterward died . It was not until three years after , that they were subdued by the sagacious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to the second grade of territorial government in 1799 , when the first Legislature assembled in Cincinnati , February 4th . This Legislature was composed , for the most part , of excellent men . The people having had for many years no voice in general political affairs , party lines had not been drawn . Washington had administ*red the general government to their satisfaction , and Gov . St. Clair and the Judges . had governed the territory in a manner which was generally acceptable . At the time the first Legislature met , Judge Burnet affirms that Gov . St. Clair was the most popular man in the ter ? ritory . William Henry Harrison was elected the first delegate to Congress . During the cession of this first territorial Legislature a petition was presented , // signed by officers of the Virginia line on Continental Establishment , praying for toleration to remove with their slaves upon the Virginia bounty lands , west of the Scioto . The lands belonged to these soldiers , and were the reward of their bravery in the dark and perilous days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located in Kentucky , and this led to the settlement of that State ; but the good lands there being supposed to be all taken np , permission was given to locate in Ohio , then in possession of Virginia . Many of the men who in 1799 petitioned for permission to settle with their slaves upon their dwn lands in Ohio , were excellent and intelligent men , been regarded as a valuable acquisition . Slavery has never since had so apparently just a claim upon soil consecrated to freedom . How was that claim met ? It was rejected firmly and at once . The Legislature believed that the Ordinance of 1787 left them no option whatever , and they did not even entertain the petition . Had the question been properly presented , Judge Burnet thinks the request would have been denied by a unanimous vote . Gem Harrison having accepted the office of Governor of Indiana Territory , Hon. Paul Fearing , of Marietta , was chosen at the second session of the Legislature for the next term of two years . This second session was held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change . The harmony existing in the first Legislature , in the political relations of the members to each other and to Gov . St. Chair , was gradually broken , in the second . Party spirit crept in and produced its fruits of bitterness . Gov . St. Chair became unpopular , and there was an increasing desire to be formed into a State . The discussions of the day were excited and often acrimonious . There were several difficulties , the first being the fact that the territory did not contain the number of people required by the Ordinance , viz. , sixty thousand . In answer to this it was said that Congress had power to admit , if it chose , with a less population . If the territory could not enter the Union by right , it might by favor . It was , however , found that favor could only be purchased at a dear price . One of the conditions imposed by Congress was , that the new State should not tax any lands sold by Government to her citizens until the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , for many years , one-third , and perhaps more , of the farms of the State would be exempt from bearing their due proportion of the burdens of taxation . Such a condition was evidently un // just , and constituted a more gross assault upon State rights and sovereignty than the Resolutions of 1798 ever dreamed of . Another reason urged for forming a State government so prematurely was , the desire to get rid of what was deemed the arbitrary rule of Gov . St. Clair . The Governor was in many respects a most excellent man , and indeed a great man ; yet it can not be denied that , after the transition of the territory to the second grade , and he came to govern men , who in their Legislature had determined to govern themselves , he disappointed even his best friends . He was better suited to the camp than to civil life , although he had presided acceptably over the Continental Congress in 1786-7 . An old soldier , he had no flexibility , and although he was a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . We believe that he was a true patriot , and was sincerely devoted to the interests of the people of the territory ; and although not in all respects a model Governor , yet by the side of modern territorial Governors , he would suffer little in the comparison . The history of his last days should allay enmity and take away all bitterness from our criticism . He was removed from office by President Jefferson , in 1802 . After his removal , he returned to Legonier Yalley , his former home in Pennsylvania , very poor and destitute , and unfortunately he was too old and infirm to embark in active business . While Governor of the territory he had made himself liable for the purchase of packhorses , &amp;c. , necessary in an expedition against the Indians . This he was obliged to pay to the amount of two or three thousand dollars ; but , not needing the money , he carelessly neglected to present his claim to the Government . After his removal from office he looked upon this small fund as his only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that it would be paid him at once , he went to Washington , and presented his account to the proper officer of the Treasury . " To his utter surprise and disappointment , " writes Judge Burnet , " it was rejected , on the mortifying ground that , admitting it to have been originally just , it was barred by the Statute ; and that the time which had elapsed afforded the highest presumption that it had been settled , although no voucher or memorandum to that effect could be found in the Department . To counteract the alleged presumption of payment , the original vouchers showing the purchase , and the purpose to which the property was applied , and the payment of the money , were exhibited . It was , however , still insisted that , as the transaction was an old one , and had taken place before the burning of the War Office in Philadelphia , the lapse of time furnished // satisfactory evidence that the claim must have been settled and the vouchers destroyed in that conflagration . The pride of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his claim was refused ; and he was induced from that consideration , as well as by the pressure of poverty and want , to persevere in his efforts to maintain the justice and equity of his demand , still hoping that p resumption would give way to truth . *** After spending the principal part of two sessions in useless efforts , subsisting during the time on the bounty of his friends , he abandoned the pursuit in despair , and returned to the Legonier Yalley , where he lived several years in the most abject poverty , in the family of a widowed daughter as destitute as himself . At length Pennsylvania , his adopted State , from considerations of personal respect and gratitude for past services , as well as from a laudable feeling of State pride , settled on him an annuity of three hundred dollars , which was soon after raised to six hundred and fifty dollars . That act of beneficence gave to the gallant old soldier a comfortable subsistence for the little remnant of his days which then remained . The honor resulting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact , that the individual on whom their bounty was bestowed was a foreigner , and was known to be a warm opponent in politics to the great majority of the Legislature and their constituents . " But to return to the subject of forming a State government in Ohio . It was strongly argued against the project that the territory was too large for one State , and should be divided into two . It will be remembered that Washington , in one of the letters already quoted , alluded to the desire of Congress , in 1Th4 , to form ten States northwest of the Ohio . This number was reduced in the Ordinance to five . This reduction of number was a very great mistake , and must ever result disastrously to the interests of Freedom in its conflict with Slavery . There was a desire on the part of many of the people of Ohio for a division of the territory . Accordingly , the Territorial Legislature , in 1801 , passed an act requesting permission of Congress to change the terms of the Ordinance so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and second State , the western boundary of the second State extending a little into Indiana . This threatened division of the Ohio terntory by the Scioto river gave great offense to the people of the Scioto valley , and especially to the inhabitants of Chillicothe , it being the expectation of the latter that Chillicothe would be the capital of the future State . In regard to this interesting subject , we have in our possession several original letters from // prominent men of the territory . They were written at the time , and have never been pnblished . They were written by Jndge Bnrnet , who represented the views of the people of Cincinnati , by Hon. Solomon Sibley , of Detroit , then a part of the territory , and by Gen. Putnam , of Marietta , and all addressed to Hon. Paul Fearing , the Representative in Congress from the territory . Judge Burnet thus writes : Cltillicothe , Dec. 17 , 1801 . " Mv DEAR SIR : -I should not have omitted a compliance with my inclination and promise until this time had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private conveyance , as I view the mail as a very uncertain channel of correspondence with you , in consequence of what happened during the last session. * A bill has passed both Houses , declaring the assent of the Legislature to an alteration of the Ordinance , so far as it respects the boundaries of States , which will be forwarded to you without delay , in order to obtain the assent of Congress . The bill proposes to divide the States by the Scioto river , and by a line drawn from the West boundary of Clark 's grant to Lake Michigan ; the alteration is so necessary for the convenience of the people at large , that I can not but expect that it receive the sanction of Congress . The inhabitants of this place , however , are enraged to the highest degree , and have gone so far as to insult the members who voted for the bill , and in fact attempted to influence them by intimations of personal violence . Finding that these measures would not answer their purpose , they have chosen two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat the bill . I am told that the persons are Messrs . Baldwin and Worthington . You may expect great opposition from them , and from many others who are willing to sacrifice the general good to promote the private advantages of this place and neighborhood . I think it must be evident to every person acquainted with the geography of the Territory , that the convenience of four-fifths of the country requires that the alteration should be made ; and I am persuaded that the people will never rest contented until the measure is confirmed by Congress . * * * * * * With respect , I am , dear sir , " Yours , JAC . BURNEr . " The letters of Gen. Putnam and Mr. Sibley are similar . Gen. Putnam also alludes to a plan which he suspects to have been formed , to make a new State from Jefferson and Belmont Counties , and " perhaps the County of Trumbull , " in Ohio , the Western part of Pennsylvania , and Ohio and Brooke Counties of Virginia . The remonstrance of Messrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served to defeat the wish *Exactly to what Judge Burnet alludes here we do not know ; but the following extract from an unpublished letter of Gov . St. Clair to Mr. Fearing at Washington will perhaps give a hint . " Chillicothe , 24th Jan. , 1802 . " SIR : -I have been favored with your letter on the 11th inst . It gives me some satisfaction that both my public and private letters of the 25th ult. got to your hands , of which I own I was doubtful , of the private one at least , though I had taken the precaution to have directed by another person ; and to that circumstance I ascribe its safety . The others sent at the same time , and which have miscarried , were directed by me , and my hand-writing is known , and the letters generally intercepted . I can not tell where , but supposed to be at this Post-Office. " // of the territory , as expressed by its Legislature , for a division of the State . For many reasons the result is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite too large in territory , and is becoming too large in population . Legislation we believe is far better adapted to the wants of the peopl9 in smaller States , and besides , smaller States beget a much stronger and healthier local attachment . A better reason still is fouud in the fact , that there is no justice in giving to Florida , with less than fifty thousand white people , two United States Senators , while Ohio with over two millions , has no more . In the formation of new States , the North has committed a great mistake , in making her States too large . She has given the South the entire advantage . In the South it is necessary to make the States cover large areas in order to secure the requisite population , but with the North it is not so . The increase of population would make a free State large enough every two or three years . The original plan of making ten new States out of the Northwest Territory , alluded to in Washiuglon 's letter , should never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be remedied , the future still is ours . Let our Northern Statesmen look to this matter . Let not the South cheat us into muaking only one or two free States out of Nebraska , Oregon , and Washington territories . In April , 1802 , Congress passed an act authorizing the people of the Ohio territory to meet in convention and form a State Constitution . Gen. Putnam , Judge Cutler , lIon . Benjamin Ives Gilman , and John IMiclntire were the delegates from Washington , and constituted a most noble band of men . Washiugton County was opposed to the formation of a State Government , aud a County Convention was held , which voted unanimously against the project . When the Constitutional Convention assembled , and the first question came up , " Is it expedient to form a State Constitution ? " Judge Cutler alone , voted " nay , " and why ? Because he thought that the right vote to give . us colleagues entertained the same opinion , but voted differently because they thought it useless to contend with the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that majority , and destroy their own influence in the couvention . We have in our possession , the papers of Judge Cutler , containing many notes respecting the doin of t is convention , which are of great historical value . We wish now only to quote from them , that which relates to the attempted introduction of slavery into the State Constitution . A portion has already been published in a late discourse occasioned by the death of Judge Cutler , but // as the facts disclosed have excited a good deal of interest , we propose to make pretty full extracts . " The 8th article , or bill of rights , as it is called , was committed on the third day of the session , to Goforth , Dunlavy , Brown , Baldwin , Grubb , Woods , Updegraff , Cutler , arid Donaldson . A hasty report was made upon it , which was afterwards withdrawn , and the Committee directed to consider it their duty to report it as the 8th article . An exciting subject was of course immediately brought before this committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown produced a section which defined the subject thus : No person shall be held in slavery if a male , after he is thirtyJive years of age , or a female after twenty-five years of age . ' The hand writing I had no doubt was Mr. Jefferson 's . I had a conversation with Gov . Worthington at Washington City , at the time Congress passed the law , authorizing the convention , and he informed me , that he ( Jefferson ) had expressed to him that such , or a similar article , might be introduced into the Constitution , and that he hoped there would not be any effort made for anything further for the exclusion of slavery from the State , as it would operate against the interests of those who wished to emigrate from the slave States to Ohio . ' " I observed to the committee that those who had elected me to represent them there , were very desirous of having this matter clearly understood , and I must move to have the section laid on the*tabIe until our next meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each member of the committee would prepare a section which should express his views fully on this important subject . The committee met the next morning , and I was called on for what I had proposed the last evening . I then read to them the section , as it now stands in the Constitution . Mr. Brown observed that what he had introduced was thought by the greatest meu in the nation , to be , if established in our Constitution , obtaining a great step towards a general emancipation of slavery , and was greatly to be preferred to what I had offered . I then at some length urged the adoption of what I had produced , and dwelt with energy on the principle , that the Ordinance of 1*87 was strictly a matter of compact , and that we were bound either to pass it ( the section excluding slavery ) or leave it , which I contended would be the law , if not so defined by our own action . Brown made a very weak reply , and Mr. Baldwin , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed with me , that the Ordinance was , iu its legal aspect , a compact , and although many of his constituents would prefer *o have slavery continue in a modifled form , he should vote in favor of the section as I had reported . // Brown , who was chairman of the committee , then called the yeas and nays , and his report was negatived . Mine was adopted , the ayes being Baldwin , Dunlavy , Ontler , Goforth , and Updegraff ; nays , Brown , Donaldson , Grubb , and Woods . Several efThrts were made to weaken or obscure the sense of the section on its passage , but the Brown or Jeffersonian version met with fewer friends than I expected . On one occasion , when it was before the committee of the whole , a material change was introduced . I was unwell and did not attend that day . " General Putnam , when he came into our chamber after this occurrence , exclaimed in an earnest manner , Cutler , you must get well , or you will lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather lose all we had gained than lose that . I went to the convention and moved to strike out the obnoxious matter , and made my objections as forcible as I was able , and when the vote was called , Mr. Milligan changed his vote , and we succeeded in placing it in its original state . Thus an overruling Providence , by His wisdom , makes use of the weak often , to defeat the purposes of the great and wise of this world , and to His name be the glory and praise . " That Mr. Jefferson wished the introduction of slavery into Ohio , seems to be abundantly proved . The testimony of Gov . Worthington above alluded to , is to the point . The following facts also corroborate the statement . When Gov . Morrow , who was the first Representative in Congress from the new State of Ohio , went on to Washington , he called on President Jefferson . The President at once introduced the subject of the new Constitution of Ohio , much of which he approved ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter the new State . The reason he assigned was , that the extending of slavery over a larger area tended to destroy it ! The State Constitution of Ohio was finally formed ; but the convention resolutely refused to allow the people to have the power to accept or reject it . It can not be disguised that the formation of the State government was precipitated by politicians who cared less for the State than for the offices of a new State . It was a time of high political excitement , and the Jeffersonian party had everything their own way . Among the many offices to be bestowed by #he first legislature , very few , if any , were given to the Federalists . Thus such noble men as Gen. Putnam , Benjamin Ives Oilman , Judge Cutler , and others of the Ohio Company settlement , and similar men from other portions of the State , many of whom had fought the battles of the Revolution , and who had adhered honestly to Washington 's // political faith , were set aside , and nearly twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they had been doomed . Gen. Putnam , the confidential friend of Washington , and a man whom he thought to be worthy the office of Surveyor General of the United States , was rudely thrust from his office by Jefferson , and he was never after permitted to hold any public political station . So meanly was the founder of the great State of Ohio treated .
