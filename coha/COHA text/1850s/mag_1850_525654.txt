txt // THOMAS JEFFERSON. * Tins is quite an old book , but , under the circumstances of the day , not too old to be examined , or rather re-examined , and brought , along with its distinguished subject , to the test of a critical review . For reasons which may appear during this examination , we begin by expressing our sincere regret that such a work , in view of all its contents , was ever given to the world and we are as little able to appreciate the motive as we are to admire the taste which prompted the editor to compile and publish such a series : -A series of private papers containing indeed many things extremely interesting and valuable as political history , but suggesting much that is painful in the same connection , and subjecting his venerable relative to a criticism that might have slumbered but for this unwary challenge . We have long been of the opinion that sons or immediate relatives of deceased statesmen , whose lives have been commingled with the fierce political storms of the republic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of giving to the world , the life , character , and correspondence of their fathers . It is , under any circumstances , and by whomsoever it may be undertaken , a task of great delicacy , requiring the clearest faculties of discrimination , the nicest sense of prudence , and the most guarded vigilance . It is rare , that sons or relatives can lay themselves under such restraint when their subject is viewed only in the li* , ht which affection dictates ; one to whose faults filial tenderness and respect have kindly blinded them , and whose virtues shine to their vision with a lustre which the golden eye of the world receives undazzled . Deformities appear where least expected , and are evolved from passages and scenes which seemed to a partial judgment only as so much that was bright and honorable ; and while charity may lift its soft mantle to shield the motive from harsh impeachment , it can not disarm criticism of its legitimate province , nor be suffered to detract from the truth of history . When the angler casts his hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he brings up . He must be content to abide the issue . And while we are fully willing to allow to the poet or the painter , all the indulgences which the " Ars Poetica " claims for them on the score of craft , we can not consent to apply a like rule to biographers and historians , nor even to those who make their appearance before the world under the less pretending , but not less responsible character of editors of private papers and correspondence . These last may , indeed , be shielded from much that the two first do not hope to escape , but they are fairly and fully liable in the way of taste , judgment , and that method of argument which looks to attain by inferences from ingenious collation and compilation , the same end that might be less easily accomplished by a different and more direct course . We shall not deviate from the immediate objects of this review to find fault with our editor 's preface . It does not encroach on modesty , and infringes naught of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a source so intimately allied with its distinguished subject . Indeed he could not have said less , or said better , if he said anything at all ; and if Mr. Randolph could have squared his selection and compilation by as perfect a rule of taste , our pen might never have been employed in its present task . The life , character , and public career of Thomas Jefferson are identified with much * . Memoir , Correspondence , and Lliiscellanies , from the papers of Thomas Jefferson . Edited by THOMAS JEFFERSON RANDOLPH . Boston and New York . 1849. // that is glorious and interesting in the early history of these United States , and the struggle for independence that resulted in their severance from the parent country . The first germs of that mighty intellect which afterwards impressed itself on every department of the government , and diffused its influences so widely through every class of our people , were called into life in the dawn of that troubled era . Its blossoms expanded and opened with the progress of the revolution , and ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independence Square , its fruits had ripened in the fullest and most luxurious maturity . The events amidst which he had been forced into manhood were too hurried and interesting , the opening scenes of the drama too exciting and startling , and their promise too enticing not to draw out in full strength and majesty the richest treasures of one of the master minds of the period , and develope in the inception those peculiar and vast powers which , but for their occurrence , might have lurked under ground for long years subsequently , and in all probability , might never have reached the same enviable climax . Nor did he enter on the scene grudgingly , or by insensible degrees . His heart was fired from the beginning , and his first advance into the very body of the melee . He staked all , and became at once , and among the earliest , one of the responsible personages of the struggle . The memoir or autobiography with which the volumes before us open , affords a very sufficient clew to explain this precocious ardor . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stamp Act took place , Jefferson , as he tells us himself , was yet a student of law at Williamsburgh . Among the members who participated was Patrick Henry . His genius had then just burst from obscurity , and an eloquence scarcely akin to earth had dazzled all Virginia-an eloquence which lives , as it must ever live , in tradition alone . The circumstances were most thrilling  --  the occasion one of intense anxiety . The annunciation of the Stamp Act had thrown a feeling of despondency and gloom over the entire republic . Hearts which had never faltered , spirits which had never quailed , minds which had never shrunk before , seemed now on the point of giving way . Even the presses , which heretofore had sounded nothing short of direct rebellion , were manifestly confounded , and their tone changed suddenly from resistance to consolatory appeals and submission . It was evident that the dreaded crisis was at hand . " It was just at this moment of despondency in some quarters , of suspense in others , and surly and reluctant submission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouse the drooping spirit of the people , and to unite all hearts and hands in the cause of his country . " He projected and moved the celebrated resolutions in opposition to the Stamp Act , and resolved to support their adoption with the full and concentrated force of that supreme oratory , which swept , tempest-like , from one quarter of the confederacy to the other ,  - -  thrilling , trumpet-toned , and resistlessand nerved even weakness to lift an opposing voice . Jefferson was a listener from the lobby . His young and ardent mind drank in eageily the inspiring draughts , and his bosom throbbed with emotions of unknown , inexplicable cestacy . The display , so splendid , so unnaturally original , and so overpowering in its effects and influences , took his imagination captive , and enchained his senses with dream-like delight . The elements of sympathy were too strong to resist the effort , and his judgment followed his imagination . " He appeared to me , *isaysthe memoir , " to speak as Homer wrote . " This thought gave birth to the after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and splendid imagery of the Iliad were here brought , by a niagic stroke , into full embodiment and bewildering reality . America oppressed-struggling - imploring- was a theme more alluiing than " the weightier matter of the law ; " and fancy , returned from the flaming walls and crimsoned rivers of Troy , found in the sufferings of Boston the living semblance of imagined woes , and fastened there with a tenacity that soon enlisted the strongest sympathies of his towering mind . The impression thus made was never forgotten , but strengthened with daily reflection ; and we are at no loss to account for that restless ardor and untiring energy which characterized Jefferson through every and all phases of the great strife that followed . Four years subsequent to this period Jefferson had become a member of the // 35 General Assembly . The insulting and arrogant address of the British Lords and Commons on the proceedings in Massachusetts was the first matter which engaged attention at the opening of the session . Jefferson took a prominent and undisguised part in getting up counter resolutions , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dissolution by the Governor followed , but the patriots met by concert in a hall of the Raleigh tavern , called the Apollo , and there drew up articles of association against any further commercial intercourse with Great Britain . Copies were signed and distributed among the people , and the people sanctioned the proceedings , failing to re-elect those only who had given reluctant assent to the course of the majority . Lord Botecourt was excitable , a thorough Briton in feeling and prepossession , and , as might naturally have been supposed , violently opposed to the pretensions of the American colonies . Angry contests followed . In the interval he was succeeded by Lord Dunmore . Dunmore , already incensed , was still more impracticable and unapproachable , and vastly more obstinate and imperious than even Botecourt . As it happened , an interregnum of comparative quiet followed . The Governor , flippant and vain-glorious , grew inor. dinately sanguine . But , in the meanwhile , a new storm was darkening the horizon . In the spring of 1773 a grievance of a character far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a topic of discussion in the Assembly . This was the institution by Great Britain of a Court of Inquiry with power to transfer to England persons committed for offences in the American colonies , Opposition to this at once became universal and alarming . It was even regarded with more abhorrence than the stanip act or the duty on tea . It caused the most conservative and moderate to despair of reconciliation with the mother country . Voices which hitherto had been silent , now raised the cry of resistance-resistance to the extremity . Fuel was added to the flame of revolution . Rebellion seemed inevitable . Men were convinced that it was the only remedy . Then , for the first time , the star of Independence , like the first light of hope , appeared on the verge of the horizon . Its genial ray , though ephemeral and meteoric for the time , was welcomed as the beacon of safety . Lukewarm members of the Assembly , whose courage and whose zeal diminished as difficulties increased , were promptly thrust aside , and such spirits as Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were placed in the van . The crisis was soon reached . It was proposed and carried at a private meeting in the Apollo , that committees of correspondence and safety be established between the colonies . The resolutions to this effect were drawn up and prepared by Jefferson . They were proposed , at his suggestion , by Dabney Carr , his brotherin-law . Of this committee , Peyton Randolph was appointed chairman . Measures were forthwith taken to communicate their action to the different colonies . Messengers were despatched , and it is said that those from Massachusetts and Virginia , each bearing similar propositions and tidings , crossed on the way . This presents a fair question for historical research . We shall pause long enough only to give on* or two facts , and our own inference from those facts . There can not , we think , be any fair or rational doubt as to the real source from which such proposition originally emanated . Universal suffrage will assio'n its proper authorship to the distinguisl*ed subject of the volumes now before us . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously proposed by Samuel Adams in Massachusetts is a settled fact . As we incline to think , after a careful and minute examination of the leading authorities , the Virginia plan of committee correspondence was intended to embrace all the colonies , the Massachusett 's plan only the cities and towns of that particular province . A strong proof of this is found in the simple fact that no such plan as that suggested by Jefferson was ever submitted to the Virginia Assembly as coming from Massachusetts . On the contrary such plan did reach , and was laid before , the Legislature of the latter colony as a suggestion from the Virginia Assembly . The plan of intenor or local correspondence belongs to Massachusetts . The plan of colonial inter-communication originated in Virginia . The first of these , we incline to think , was the most prudent and practical method , but the latter looked more to the grand // ulterior result , viz : united resistance to the aggressions of Britain . These proceedings happened early in the spring of 1773 . In the meanwhile , events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of rebellion , and clearly foreshadowed the grand issue . The interdict of Boston harbor , or as it is commonly called , the Port Bill , passed the British Parliament early in the year succeeding . The news reached the colonies in the spring , and thrilled with electric violence from Cape Cod to the Savannah . So far from increasing the confusion and dismay which had followed on the passage of the Stamp Act , or allaying the patriotic tumult , this intelligence served only to nerve the bolder spirits and to re-assure the weak . It roused the people from their temporary lethargy , and incited them to prepare for extreme measures . The Virginia Assembly moved promptly and nnshrinkingly up to the mark , and passed a resolution setting apart and recommending the first day of June , on which day the Port Bill was to be carried into effect , for a day of fasting and prayer , imploring Heaven to avert the horrors of civil war . The design was obvious , and the language employed terribly significant . The Governor promptly dissolved them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had passed the resolution , was not so to be subdued . Jefferson , although no orator and never essaying to speak , had now become the master workman in that distinguished assembly . The work of the House was entrusted mainly to his discretion and guidance , although the junior of many whose names had already become distinguished . But his whole heart and mind , the entire energies of his own nature , were given to the task he had undertaken . Nothing was allowed to distract or seduce him from the pursuit of the grand object which possessed him . The attractions of a polished society , the temptations of joyous social intercourse , the *dlurements of a home made cheerful and happy by a lovely young wife , were all insufficient and powerless to divert him for an instant . It is hardly , then , to be wondered at that a man thus sleeplessly and entirely absorbed by the startling events now daily transpiring , especially when we consider that , even at his thea early age , the evidences of that strong and towering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest in the world , were already stamped on many an endurin* monument , should have been entru*ted with the work of a body whose proceedings were giving tone to the sentiments of the entire country . On this occasion he was ready for the emergency . The dissolution had scarcely been announced , before measures were taken to hold a private meeting at the Apollo . The members promptly assembled , and on that night was projected and passed the most important resolution ever adopted on the American continent . It was the initiative step of the revolution , the one from which all that followed was traced , the beginning which led to the glorious end . This was the proposition to the various colonial committees , that delegates should assemble in a C*ongress , to be holden at such place as might be agreed on , annually , and to consider the measures proper to be adopted for the general interest ; declaring further , that an attack on one colony should be considered an attack on the whole . This was in May . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August next ensuing , and on the 4th of September , Philadelphia having been agreed on as the place , the first Continental Congress assembled in Independence Hall . Its important and splendid proceedings are known to every reader of American history . Jefferson was not then a member ; but in March of 1775 he was , by general consent , added to the delegation from Virginia . A second career of action now opened before him . He had passed through the first honorably and successfully . Another was now to be ventured , and an enlarged field of labor and usefulness invited to the trial . About this time the conciliatory propositions of old Lord North , commonly known as the Olive branch , were submitted by Gov . Dunmore to a special session of the Virginia Assembly . It was found , on close exaniination , to contain nothing which entitled it to so honorable a designation ; - artful , indefinite , ambiguous and full of that ministerial trickery for which the old Premier was so famous . Jefferson , at the solicitation of many who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , framed the answer of the delegates , and , // water here and there , " the Assembly decided almost unanimously to rej*ect the proposition . They were , of course , immediately dissolved , and Jefferson took his departure for Philadelphia . He was in his seat on the 21st of June . As an evidence of the high esteem in which his talents were already held by the members of that august and venerable Congress , he was appointed two days afterward on one of the most important committees of the session , and , indeed , of the whole revolution . This was to prepare a declaration of the causes of taking up arias in opposition to the exactions of the British Parliament . It was a task of the greatest delicacy , and , as the premonitory step to an open and general rebellion , loaded with many difficulties , especially considering the complexion of a portion of the Congress . There were , even yet , many who clung to the hope of a speedy and satisfactory adjustment . Jefferson knew this well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he proposed to Gov . Livingston to draw up the paper , trusting alike to the influence of his name and character , and to the admirable beauty and readiness of his pen . Livingston haughtily and somewhat impertinently refused , insinuating to Jefferson that he was quite too familiar for " a new acquaintance . " The latter receded with a complimentary apology , and on the assembly of the committee , the duty devolved on Jefferson himself . Not used to shrink from responsibility , Jefferson at once consented to undertake its preparation . Of course it was similar in its tone to those which had previously been prepared by his pen in Virginia . Many objected , and iVir . Dickinson balked outright . Dickinson was among the most fervent of those who yet hoped for a reconciliation with Great Britain , and in deference to the scruples of one so eminently honest , the paper was handed over to him to be put in such shape as would more approximate his peculiar views . He presented one entirely different , and as a mark of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . Another paper from the same source was also received and passed by Congress , in the midst , however , of general dissatisfaction and disgust . Tbis was an address to King George . Its humility was inexpressibly contemptible ; but the conscript fathers of America were men of compromise and moderation ,  --  an example which might be patterned with some profit by their descendants and successors . But the author was delighted with its passage , and " although , ** says the Memoir , " out of order , he could not refrain from rising and expressing his satisfaction , and concluded by saying , There is but one word , Mr. President , in the paper which I disapprove , and that is the word Congress ; ' on which Ben Harrison arose and said , There is but one word in the paper , Mr. President , which I approve of , and that is the word Congress . ' " On the seventh of June , 1776 , the delegates from Virginia , in accordance with instructions , moved " that the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ought to be , free and independent states , that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown , and that all political connexion between them and Great Britain , is , and ought to be , totally dissolved ; and that measures should be immediately taken for procuring the assistance of foreign powers , and a confederation be formed to bind the colonies more closely together . " The reading of such a resolution startled the whole House . It was , in one sense , the utterance of downright treason . But there was no avoiding the issue . The majority were resolved , and the whole people called for actwn . Nor did any body doubt for a moment the source from which the resolution sprang . All that was culpable and all that was meritorious , its odium and its popularity alike helonged to Thomas Jefferson . Its tone , its wording , its emphasis and expression , all bore the unmistakeable impress of his mind . He watched its fate with intense anxiety , and the moment of its reception was to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then as if the die had been irretrievably cast , the Rubicon passed ; that the day had at length arrived " bio* with the fate of Cato and of * But it encountered powerful and serious opposition , and from persons and quarters where persevering opposition might have defeated its passage . Livingston , Rutledge , Dickinson , and some others , expressed doubts as to its necessity . They argued that action then would be premature , that the middle colonies were not ripe for // revolt ; that unanimity was the first thing to be desired ; that some delegates were expressly forbidden to yield assent to any such measure ; that France and Spain could not yet be counted on ; that England might find the means of satisfying both of these powers ; and that , above all , there was prudence in delay . It thus became apparent that New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , and South Carolina , " were not matured for falling from the parent stem . " The consideration of the resolution was , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great point had , nevertheless , been gained . Congress agreed that a committee should be raised for the purpose of drawing up the form of a Declaration of Independence . This committee consisted of John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Roger Sherman , Livingston , and Jefferson . The latter was again selected for the duty of preparing the draught . We approach this period of Mr. Jefferson 's public career with sincere and unalloyed pleasure . Envy does not interpose , malice itself has invented naught to discourage that heartfelt admiration which fills all America when contemplating this grand achievement . We feel the more gratification from the fact that in the course of these pages , we shall be compelled to offer a contrast between this and a subsequent period of his public life , which may not be at all favorable to the latter . On the first of July , the resolution of the Virginia delegates was taken up and considered . After some discusssion it was passed . The vote , however , was not unanimous . Pennsylvania and South Carolina went against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure , but pleading the want of necessary instructions . Delaware was divided . When , however , the committee rose and reported to the House , Mr. Rutledge requested that final action might be suspended until the next day . The suggestion was caught at eagerly , and the request granted . No door was closed that might preclude unanimity . Accordingly , when the ultimate question came up , the delegates from that colony gave an affirmative vote , though they disapproved of the terms of the resolution . The timely arrival of a third member from Delaware , also changed the vote of that July colony ; and , in the meantime , the Pennsylvania Jelegation mustering its entire strength , cast her final vote in favor of the resolution . Thus , out of thirteen colonies , twelve gave their voices for Independence , while New York had no authority to vote at all . The result of this vote closed all avenues to a reconciliation with the mother country , and men 's minds were , from that auspicious day , turned wholly to contemplating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and the most important , step remained yet to be taken . That was to publish to the world the Declaration of Independence . The vote on the resolution had scarcely been announced , before a report was called for from the committee which had been previously raised and charged with the execution of that duty . The task of preparing the draught every body knew had been assigned to Jefferson , and all eyes were turned instantly towards his seat . The members sat in stern and silent expectation . The galleries and lobby , the aisles and passages of the Hall were filled to overflowing , and trembled beneath the weight of anxious and curious spectators . All who were privileged , and many who were not , had crowded within the bar , and occupied the floor of the house . While this excitement was at its height , Jefferson rose , holding in his hand the consecrated scroll which spoke the voice of freedom for a New World . All was calmed and hushed in a moment . We may easily imagine the varied feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the clear , full-toned voice of the young Virginian sent forth the melodious sentences and glowing diction of that memorable body and revered document . The annunciative tone of the first para* graph , excited at once the most eager attention . The declaration of rights followed , and the grave countenances of the delegates assumed an aspect of less severe meditation , and opened with the inspiration of kindling hope . The enumeration of wrongs done , and of insults perpetrated , falls in succinct cadences from the reader 's lips , and the effect is told on frowning brows and crimsomed cheeks , and in eyes flashing with aroused anger , and the throe of bosoms burning with intense sympathy . And when , at the close of this significant and withering summary of wrongs and op // pressions , the reader came to the eloquent ' sentence , " A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant , is unjit to be the ruler of a free people , " a picture presents itself to the mind 's vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heartfelt and ominous approval . The conclusion was anticipated . The inward pledge of " life and fortune , and sacred honor , " had been registered long crc it was reached in due course , and the form of subscription gave only the outward sign of sanction . When Jefferson sat down , he took his seat crowned with a fame that will perish only with the earth itself , and which has linked his name forever with American Independence . An cestacy of patriotism pervaded the entire audience . Statesmen and warriors , divines and philosophers , old and young , high and humble , were all alike filled with sensations of delight , of fervor , and of buoyant hope . Nor was night suffered to put an end to the joyous manifestations . The people were aroused ; the spirit of revolution had diffused its heat among the masses of the city . Bonfires were lighted in the principal streets , and illuminated windows sent forthtb eir merry light ; sparkling libations were quaffed , and the " voluptuous swell " of music mingled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all its faults , with all its susceptibility to criticism , we have ever regarded the Declaration of Independence as one of the most remarkable and eloquent productions that ever came from a human pen . Association , doubtless , has contributed much to induce this prepossession . It is right that it should do so . It is interwoven with the dearest recollections of every true American . It is whispered to him in the cradle ; it is learned by heart in the nurserythe boom of every cannon on the Fourth of July , imprints it deeper in his memoryit gathers accumulated force in his youthit is sacredly treasured in his old ageand yet , candor and the facts of history compel us to the belief , that all the glory of its composition should not he associated with the name of Jefferson alone , although he himself has laid exclusive claim to its authorship in the epitaph prescribed to be engraven on his tombstone . Throwing aside tho alleged discoveries and researches of Mr. Bancroft , we are willing to go to the record as left by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The original draught was , doubtless , prepared by Jefferson , unassisted and without much consultation . But the original was vastly mutilated and cut down by the severer pens of Adams and Franklin , and parts of paragraphs supplied anew , particularly by the latter . It was changed both as to phraseology and sentiment , and materially improved in point of taste . These facts will be apparent to any who will examine closely the fac simile of the original copy appended to the memoir of the book now under review . As it was first prepared , there was an unseasonable preponderance of the high sounding Johnsonian verbosity without the palliation of its elegance . It abounded with repetition and unmeaning sententiousness in some parts , while paragraphs and sentences , were prolonged to an extent which might have startled Lord Bohingbroke himself , who , however , would have missed the grace and polish of his own didactic periods . In fact , the entire document underwent a shearing process in the revisory hands of the author 's coadjutors , and was reproduced in a shape that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the his tory of any other nation . Some parts of it were really objectionable , and would most certainly have created bad blood both in the North and in the South . We allude to the long denunciation in the original draught , of commerce in slaves , and charging that commerce as one of the grievances on the part of the British Monarch . Two of the Southern colonies , Georgia and South Carolina , were clamorous for the continuance of this traffic . Citizens of the North were the carriers and merchantmen , and it was , therefore , in both cases , a question of dollars and cents . Where great movements are contemplated , dependent on unanimity for their success , it is hazardous and impolitic to begin operations by a war on sectional interests . Both Adams and Franklin knew this , and , although they must have agreed with Jefferson in the sentiment , they advised its total expunction . A few years later , such a clause might have met with the heartiest reception , and in this day would have been sanctioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil too general to be rebuked in such // a document , written , as averred , mainly with the view to " a decent respect for the opinions of mankind . " In 1776 it would have been a difficult matter , if history is to be believed , to have laid a fingeron any portion of enlightened Christianized mankind who were not equally obnoxious to the charge of slave-stealing or slave-working as his Britannic Majesty . We speak of Governments or organized Societies , else we would pause to make an exception here in favor of the Quakers . This body of unpretending , consistent devotees , are the only portion of the Christian world , so far as we can now call to mind , whose hands are clear of this most abominable and nefarious traffic . That Jefferson was thoroughly anti-slavery in his notions , the whole of his political history in connection with the subject most conclusively establishes . He was so , conscientiously and uncompromisingly . He never degenerated into rabid or radical abolitionism , hut his moderation and tolerance evidently cost him many struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper occasion , and before every legislative body of which he became a member . We find him meeting it at every assailable point , heartily endeavoring to promote speedy emancipation , and to impede its extension . In the first of these objects he failed entirely . In the last , he met with gratifying success , through means of the celebrated Ordinance of 1787 . Among the latest records of his pen , after he had lived nearly fourscore years , is the emphatic prophecy , " that emancipation must he adopted , or worse would follow . That nothing was more certainly written in the book of fate , than that these people ( the negroes ) were to be free . " The manner of this expression is less that of a philosopher than of an enthusiast . Whenever he speaks of slavery at all , he speaks of it in terms never less moderate than those quoted ; and its opponents can fortify themselves , as we think , with no more reliable authority than the name of him who forms the subject of these volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independence , Jefferson resigned his seat in the colonial Congress , and became once again a delegate to the House of Burgesses of the Virginia Assembly . He entered at once upon a difficult line of duties . He introduced bills establishing Courts of Justice , to regulate titles to property , to prohibit the further importation of slaves within the colony , to institute freedom of opinion in religion ; and aided in reconstructing the entire Statutory Code of Virginia . Soon after , he was made Governor . He then declined , successively , three foreign appointments from Congress . He served the Commonwealth with distinguished ability during the darkest period of the war , narrowly escaping , several times , the dragoons of Tarleton and Simeoc . In the spring of 1783 he was again appointed a delegate to Congress , then in session at Annapolis . He served about a year , when he was again appointed to a foreign mission , and this time he accepted . On the sixth day of July , 1784 , he arrived at Paris , where he was to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and concluding a general treaty of commerce with foreign nations . We design not to dwell on this portion of his public services , as it does not come properly within the range of the object we have in view , lie remained abroad until September of 1789 . Returning home , he was appointed during the following winter to the new Department of State , under the Presidency of George Washington . This ends the second and brightest , if not the most important epoch of Jefferson 's public career . The fourth and last may , indeed , have been philosophically and tranquilly passed ; but the third , on which we are now entering , is chequered alternately with light and gloom ; with much that is worthy of admiration , with more , we fear , that is obnoxious to censure . We proceed to the task of criticism under stern convictions of duty , but not without reluctance . At this date of his political history , Jefferson concludes his memoir . Henceforth we must look to the Correspondence , and to what other authorities may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries . Up to the year 1792 , no distinct party organization had existed . The administration , fortified in the love and respect of the entire people , went on swimmingly . Washington himself could not be assailed . The other members of government were // sheltered by the protecting Egis of his popularity . But the gigantic financial policy of Alexander Hamilton began now to beget serious uneasiness in the minds of all who dreaded the centralization of power in the hands of the general government , and the consequent depreciation of the State sovereignties . The State debts had been assumed , and a large and powerful body of creditors turned their attention to the Union , and not to the separate independencies . Duties were laid on imported goods , and the merchant transacted his business under the authority and patronage of the United States . The Bank , which now formed the great connecting link of commerce between the States , was of federal origin . The manufacturer looked to the Union for the protection he needed ; and the ship-owners and seamen looked also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition sprang up . It found an adroit and a willing leader iii Thomas Jefferson . He felt his way cautiously , secretly , and by slow degrees . But there was one material obstruction in the way of an active and effective opposition . All the respectable presses in the country were strongly federal ; stout advocates of Washington 's administration . Nothing could be done , so long as this impediment remained in the way . Jefferson soon fell upon a plan to surmount it . His residence in France during the revolution , and his intimate acquaintance with the revolutionary chiefs , had schooled him in those arts and intrigues which ripen party schemes . He had his . eye now upon a man , the only man perhaps in all America admirably adapted to the purposes of the opposition . A restless , narrow-minded , distempered little Frenchman , named Philip Freneau , was then conducting a low and scurrilous print in the city of New York . His boldness and carelessness of character , together with some fluency in the language of the fish-market , attractcd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan of opposition to Washington 's administration . Jefferson , now Secretary of State , tempted him , by the offer of a clerkship in his own Department , to remove to Philadelphia . The starving Frenchman , whose most sumptuous diet had been only stale crackers and cheese , of course jumped at the offer , and pledged himself to pursue with indiscriminate rancor , the wisest as well as the worst of Washington 's measures . The National Gazette was established , and a repository of more than Augean uncleanness became the head quarters of those who had raised their parricidal hands against the Father of his Country . " During its short-lived existence , " says a modern author , " it was notorious for its scandalous falsehood and misrepresentations , its fulsome adoration of Mr. Jefferson , and its gross abuse of leading federal men . " The example thus conspicuously set , has been ever since assiduously followed by the party which dates its origin at this period , and which claims the powerful paternity of Jefferson 's name and principles . We shall not contravene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We believe that the claim is well founded , and the origin fairly attested . But their efforts against Washin*ton and his administration signally and ingloriously failed . They did not venture even to name the real object of assault . The demonstration was made against Adams , the Vice-President , and Alexander Hamilton , Secretary of the Treasury . Against the administration of the first they subsequently succeeded ; while , in connection with the latter , they carried their design of opposition by coupling his name with an undue bias in favor of England ; thus making use of the ferocious prejudice which still existed against that country . Even so late as 1848 , a distinguished statesman and Presidential nominee of this same radical party , has condescended to avail himself of this odiuni , supposed to be attached to Hamilton 's name , and , in the same letter , ( unwittingly , but , doubtless ) tacitly admits his lineal *party descent from the Jacobinical faction of 793 , by claiming this period as " the starting point of difference " betwixt the two great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of 1794 occurred the famous , or rather infamous , Whiskey Rebellion in the State of Pennsylvania . The law of 91 had imposed a duty on spirits distilled within the United States . It was violently menaced and resisted by the parties interested . Inspectors were insulted , officers of the Excise tarred and feathered , marshals attacked and fired upon . At length the patience of the // President was exhausted ; he marched an army into the disaffected country , and the insurrection was speedily quelled . The opposition had not discountenanced the course or the cause of the rioters . Some of their presses had openly fomented and excited the revolt . " It was shrewdly suspected , " says the same author before quoted , " that Jefferson did not look with very great repi'obation on the Pennsylvania * This suspicion has not been controverted , but rather confirmed , by the tenor of his published correspondence , and opens a dark and unpleasing chapter of his public history . Just previously to this nefarious outbreak , he had given utterance to opinions in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can not now be characterized by a less mild term than atrocious . Speaking of Shay 's rebellion in Massachusetts , he had said , " God forbid we should even be twenty years without such a rebellion . What country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that the people preserve the spirit of resistance ? Let them take arms . The remedy is , to set them right as to facts , pardon and pacify them . The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and of tyrants . " We venture the assertion that no sentiments more anarchical and dangerous can be found in any document of history from the period of Machiavelli 's " Prince " to Dorr 's Manifesto . They are precisely the sentiments which animated such men as Jack Cade and Watt Tyler , and Philip Freneau , and Callender , and Citizen Genet . The Russian Strelitzes or the Turkish Janizaries can not be charged with motives more criminal , or with deeds more abhorrent than such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their utterance is to be found in that charity which covers the zeal of a sincere though misguided opposition . The French associations and prejudices of Jefferson had seduced him into a lamentable departure from the safe , moderate and consistent revolutionary principles which marked the period of 1776 . He had heard the fierce debates of the Jacobin Clubs , and thrilled under the reeking eloquence of Danton and his tigertempered colleague . All the murders committed by the Revolutionary Tribunal - all the blood which flowed from the scaffold of the death-dealing guillotineL**-the horrors of the Reign of Terror-the sighs and tears which had made Paris the terrestrial counterpart of a hell , were insufficient to disgust the author of the Declaration of American Independence . His philosophic eye beheld , tearless , the walking images of broken hearts and crushed affections which crossed his daily path , and surveyed , unmoved , the mournful emblems which shrouded an entire city with funeral drapery . Nor do we assume any too much in saying this . The memoir before us contains nothing which can rescue its distinguished author from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correspondence to explain the omission . It may , therefore , be fairly supposed , that Jefferson was not so greatly horrified at these manifold and ceaseless atrocities as ever to think that the cause of Liberty , thus conducted , was the cause of anarchy and of murder . We might extend these inferences further . Di*ring the reign of the bloody Triumvirate , private conversations and careless expressions , uttered even in the recesses of the family circle , were made the plea for butchering the speakers on the following day . It is not unlikely to suppose that Jefferson here learned his art of noting down what occurred at dining tables , and private parties , and social gatherings , that the compiler of the volumes before us might afterwards give to the world , in the shape of the " Ana , " a method of espionage which would have shamed even Lavellette or Savary , and challenged attention from Bourienne himself . We would willingly have drawn a veil over this portion of the published p*olitical works of Thomas Jefferson . But we consider that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Ana " into the hands of the printer . It is not for us to find fault with the taste which prompted the publication of a private journal . Our duty and intention are , as the undisputed right of a reviewer , to express our opinions of the production . But we must not digress further . Thus imbued with the effects , if not with the spirit , of Jacobinism , Jefferson had returned to America ; and we may thus account for his opinions on Shay 's Rebellion , // 43 his supp ? sed sympathy with the Whiskey insurrectionists , his intimacy with such men as Callendcr , and Frenean , and Tom Paine , and his early and insidious opposition to the administration of George Washington . The first object of attack had been the financial policy of Hamilton , and thus far we sanction , in part at least , this course of policy . The views and the aims of that eminent minister have never had entirely our political sympathies . There was , in all his measures , a too consolidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the thunders of the opposition were soon turned more directly against Washington himself by a merciless assault on the treaty of John Jay , which , it was known , had received the President 's cordial approval . It was fought in every way known to Parliamentary warfare , and Washington was goaded by every means to which an adroit and inventive opposition could resort . It was wranglingly and factiously debated in the Senate , and it was threatened with the vengeance of the House . To crown all , a resolution was brought forward by Livingston , requesting the President " to lay before the House a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the United States , who negotiated a treaty with the King of Great Britain , communicated by his message , together with the correspondence and other documents relative to the said treaty . " This was subsequently qualified by a clause to the effect , " excepting such papers as any existing negotiation may render improper to be * To this resolution the President first responded , " that he would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay any such papers before the House . This refusal stimulated the opposition to increased bitterness , and " appeared , " in the language of Marshall , " to break the last chord of that attachment which had heretofore bound some of the active leaders of the opposition to the person of the President . " Long anterior to this , however , Jefferson , although still recognized as the head of the opposition , had resigned his post of State Secretary , and from his retirement at Monticello fulminated the signs , tokens , and passwords of determined and ceaseless hostility to the policy of the administration . He had openly ridiculed the course of Washington in the Whiskey Rebellion , and had encouraged , while engaged in combatting , the pretensions of citizen Genet . He now resorted to the more candid warfare of denunciation , and directed the whole influence of his name and the whole power of his pen against the Jay treaty . But all would not do . The magic of Washington 's popularity continued to prevail , and it became evident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was ratified , and the hopes of Jefferson and his now numerous friends had to be postponed for a season . On the 4th of March , 1797 , John Adams was inaugurated President of the United States , and , at the same time , Thomas Jefferson was sworn in as Vice President . The character of Adams , according to the testimony of his best friends and warmest admirers , was an anomaly . " Of a restless and irritable temperament , ** says a strong federal biographer ; " jealous of other 's praise , and suspicious of their influence ; obstinate and yet fickle ; actuated by an ambition which could bear neither opposition nor lukewarmness , and vain to a degree approaching insanity , he was himself incapable alike of conceiving or of acting upon a settled system of policy , and was to others as easy a subject for indirect management , as he was impracticable to more legitiniate approach . With the noblest impulses and the meanest passions , he presents a portrait which , in its contradictory features , resembles more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual being . " It does not come within the design of this article either to endorse or to combat this opinion . We will barely add what the writer might properly have added , that the patriotism and native honesty of John Adams were sadly blurred by a bad temper and an excitable vindictiveness . " As was his character , so proved the administration of such a man ; flickering , unstable , without fixed rule or definite object . " The hitherto obstructed road of the opposition was now fairly cleared . The awe of Washington 's great name stood no longer in their way . The far reaching sagacity of Jefferson was at work , and his policy and plan of operations were soon developed . During the storniy period of the Revolution he and Adams had been attached and intimate friends . Their associations had been of a character more than usually cordial and // confidential . Soon after Jefferson 's return from France they fell out , and became partially estranged . But the difference did not quite amount to a personal quarrel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one knew better than Jefferson the weak points in the character and constitution of John Adams . He believed firmly in the honesty of his heart , but he was well acquainted with the instability of his political opinions ; with his leaning , one day , to rank federalism , and the next , to downright radicalism . " He ( Adams ) by turns defended the mob , and advocated hereditary power . " This was an open prey to an ingenious and a watchful opposition , and Jefferson did not scruple to turn his private knowledge and past associations to leo4timate political account . We do not mean to say that he ever betrayed confidence . Jefferson had both too much caution and too much pride of character to act dishonorably . It may be explained easily on the score of ambition and selfishness , neither of which can be denied to him in their fullest latitude . But the object was now to estrange A.dams from the party which had elected him , by this move , to weaken the federalists , to destroy the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson and the Democrats . The accomplishment of such a plan required the most consummate address . It was not hard to perceive that such requisition was more than fulfilled in the person of the acknowledged leader of the opposition . Jefferson was just the man to play the game which was now in hand . His affectation was in being plain , and his plainness of appearance and intercourse , did amount almost to unvarnished demagoguism. lie desired to be known in America by the same popular cognomen by which William Pitt had been long hailed and worshipped in England , that of the " Great Commoner. ** Pitt , however , not only was ambitious to lead*but to be thought to lead . Jefferson , on the contrary , was neither bold enough nor haughty enough to court the latter distinction . He desired to lead , but to make others believe that he was led . This , however , was the choice rather of policy than of timidity . He may have lacked candor-he may have been time-serving , accommodating , and subservient-but he was not deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had acquired , about this time , a less enviable ' surname than the one which distineuished Pitt . He was called " The Trimmer . * But all this , as Terry O'Rourke would say , was " a part of his 5ystem. ** He was engaged in running a mine which , when completed , was to demolish the federal party , and he did not pause in his work or stop to defend himself from mere personal attacks . He , therefore , set assiduously about renewing his former intimacy with Adams . It was very well known that a portion of the Federalists , with Alexander Hamilton at their head , had maneuvred to place Mr. Pinekney ahead of Mr. Adams on the party ticket ; and , if possible , to give the Presidency to the former . Adams 's hot temper rose to the boiling point when this was made known to him , and he set the brand of his never-ending hatred on the brow of Hamilton . To foment this difference became the chief end of the opposition . Adams was adroitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson addressed to him the most seductive and weaning letters , and wrote flatteringly about him to others . Prominent ultra-democrats , his former personal friends , crowded his reception rooms , and haited him with a thousand tempting morsels , all artfully directed against the known vulnerable points of his character . The vain old man proved an easy victim , and fell unwarily into the snare . He met cordially the advances of Jefferson , took Gerry , one of the most determined democrats , into the closest confidence , and , in a tempest of exacerbation and rage , drove many of the warmest federalists from his councils and his presence . This was precisely what had been played for by the opposition . Their point was gained , the fatal breach irrevocably effected . In the meanwhile the difficulties with France assumed an alarming aspect . The conduct of the Directory had become intolerable . They had first insulted the American Envoy , and then driven him from the French territories . A special session of Congress was called by the President . The Federalists had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and vengeance against France , and breathed them most justly . The opposition then showed the drift of their policy . Denunciations the most ireful and , menacing were hurled // against the recommendations of the Executive , and against a war with republican France . The President was roused to desperation by these sudden and withering assaults , and followed up his recommendations with all the influence of his name and his office . Measures were taken to prepare for hostilities ; Washington was drawn from his coveted retirement to be invested once more with the chief generalship of his country s armies , and the spirit of the nation seemed to favor the course of the government . The result might have been auspieious for the administration , if matters had been suffered to remain in this situation . But the temper of the President was despotie , and the least draught of popular favor intoxieated him with vanity . At the next session of Congress at the especial instance of the Executive , were passed the celebrated Alien and Sedition Laws , and from that day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were the worst laws that ever emanated from American legislators , and their passage was a death blow to the federal party . The opposition charged upon them with concentrated , irresistible force , and the thunders of the press were turned to the work of their demolition . The legislatures of the different States entered energetically into the strife . The Virginia and Kentucky resolutions of *98 followed , destined to a notoriety co-existent with the most treasured archives of the republic . The first were prepared by James Madison , and the last by Thomas Jefferson . It is foreign to the purposes we have in view to discuss elaborately the merits of these well-known documents . We shall content ourselves with a single remark . They contain , in our humble judgment , much that is conservative and worthy of remembrance ; but they also contain much more that we deem dangerous , Jacobinical , and wildly revolutionary in tendency . The remedies they inculcate for constitutional infractions are extreme , repugnant to genuine patriotism , and wholly unnecessary in a government where the people hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight when it is considered that an intermediate umpirage exists in the Supreme Court . In fact , the American Constitution neither countenances nor warrants extreme measures in any case . If we correctly understand its language and spirit , we should say that all chances of aggression , from any quarter , are amply provided for and guarded against . Balances and checks , and legitimate remedial processes pervade its every feature . We regard it as the mere silly cant of suspicious , overzealous enthusiasts and designing dem4igogues , to advocate *ullification , revolution , or dissolution as ulterior or unavoidable remedies in cases of encroachment . The ship may spring a leak , but the mariner does not desert and take to the open and unfriendly seas until the pumps have been thoroughly tried and exhausted . It will then be soon enough to take refuge in extreme iimeasures , when the safeguards of the constitution are found unavailing . But the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions answered and fully attained the objects for which they were designed . They served to beat down the Alien and Sedition laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradication of the old federal party . So far it was good . Happy would it have been for the country , if this good could have been effected without the entailment of an evil scarcely less deplor*-ble than that which had been crushed ! But from that day to this , the objectionable doctrines taught in these papers ( especially those of Jefferson ) have been made the theme and the authority of coagitators , of aspirants , of factionists , and of demagogues . They have been leaned upon for apology , and for shelter from obloquy and odium . The tendency of their principles reaches and covers anarchy itself , and justifies the overthrow of established governments , as a primary , extra-constitutional remedy against supposed infractions . Their abstractions and , indeed , their proposed remedies , would have applied to the old colonial government under G'reat Britain . But the mischief was complete , when they were offered as suggesting a method of resistance to the authority and laws of the government of the United States . Their teachings were hailed by all the discontented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Whiskey insurrectionists , the Jacobin clubs of Philadelphia and other cities , the followers of the Genet faction , and the satellites of Freneau and Callender , received them as text books , and became associated in one solid Democratic // July , phalanx . The federalists shrank into disrepute , and gradually dwindled until they were extinguished by the proceedings of the Hartford Convention . Until then , or at least , up to 1807 , the radical Democratic party , founded and fostered by Jefferson , held undivided , undisputed sway . But at the latter period a new party emerged from the political chaos . It was composed of the moderate democrats and the more liberal portion of the defeated federalists . It numbered in its ranks such men as Monroe , and Crawford , and Gerry , th' younger Adams , and Henry Clay  --  the dawn of whose genius was just then irradiatin* the horizon . It was the Conservative party of the Country  --  the medium spot of patriotism , beat upon alike by rank federalism and impracticable democracy . It gathered strength with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , however , had favored it from the first . We must here pause for the present . In some future number , the grounds here assumed will be further elucidated . We have now brought Jefferson to the end of the third era of his political life , and leave him on the eve of success and of ebvation to the highest and proudest honors of his country . We shall soon resume the narrative , if permitted by health and life .
