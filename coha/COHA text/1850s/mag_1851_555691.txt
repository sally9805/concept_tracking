txt ART . IV . - Poems and Prose Writings . B* RICHARD HENRY DANA . In two Volumes . New York : Baker &amp; Scribuer. 1850 . To many of our readers these volumes will have the freshness of novelty . The poems and fictions formerly published by Mr. Dana have been so long out of print , and most of the essays buried for so many years in the forgotten numbers of old Reviews , that some , even of those who would not willingly be thought ignorant of our native literature , will be taken by surprise . Others will recognize here , in an accessible and agreeable form , writings with which they have long been familiar ; which more than once , with grateful labor , they have brought together from dark closets and dusty shelves , to which the monthlies and quarterlies which contained them were long since consigned . It is because we remember the deep interest with which we early read most of these works , and are glad to acknowledge our obligation to them , as well as from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our permanent literature , that we hail // this reprint with so much satisfaction . By an accident we have suffered the volumes to pass too long without notice ; yet even this seems somewhat accordant with their calm power and unobtrusive beauty . To have caught them up before the sheets were dry would have seemed almost like an indecent haste which they might resent . As they are the offering of a thoughtful , self-relying , yet most genial and sympathizing mind , they might well enough be left to float awhile with the current , touching all along their course , with gentle but strong impression , mind after mind , heart after heart , and imparting happy influences to be felt no one knows how widely . We do not prophesy for these volumes a rapid or unbounded popularity ; they are too thoughtful and serious , and require too much intellectual activity in the reader , for that ; but the number is large , and we believe increasing , to whom they will be permanent and friendly monitors of good . The thought which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from even a rapid perusal , without a fresh impulse towards the noblest objects of life ; no one can become familiar with them without being unconsciously led to a habit of serious thought , and finding his best affections most cherished , and his sympathies with the beautiful , the good , and the true , enlarged and strengthened . Thorough earnestness is so enstamped upon these writings , is so pervading a type of both prose and poetry , that some may think it trenches a little upon the variety which we look for in a volume of miscellanies . And it might be so , were there not other characteristics to counteract and counterbalance . Covering , as these volumes do , the thought of nearly thirty years , there is evinced in them a remarkable unity of spirit ; a proof in itself of early maturity , and of a homogeneous and organic culture . A strong individuality everywhere exhibits itself , not in saying smart , or odd , or bitter things , and least of all in affected expressions or thoughts , but by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which evidently have been felt , always deeply , sometimes painfully . These writings are the product of a mind that has its humors , too , its affections and antipathies , and does not feel always obliged to justify by argument either the one or the other ; yet nothing is said merely for effect , nothing capriciously . The // light does not glare upon us as from a meteor in a dark night , but shines with the mild effulgence of the day , the " Sweet day , ao cool , so calm , so bright , The bridal of the earth and sky . " The stream of thought rolls on so quiet and unruffled , bearing us by green meadows , and drooping trees , and cheerful villages , and tangled wild-woods , and within full sight of distant and solitary mountains , that we forget almos t , how deep it is , and that it owes its quiet strength to its volume , - to what is hidden rather than to what is seen . An exquisite and indescribable delicacy and gentleness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which another would have expressed , if at all , with a glaring obtrusive .. ness . How refreshing the calm and quiet power ! There is , however , no excessive and unmanly niceness . We rise from these works with the feeling that we have been communing with a mind at once vigorous and gentle , the very tone of which harmonizes and elevates ours . There is stren0 h without violence , and beauty without weakness . It is all the better that we may occasionally find an opinion strongly argued , to which we can not at once agree . That which makes no demands upon us , which by merely echoing our own sentiments , of course receives our assent , for that very reason may profit us not at all . The opinions expressed in these volumes come from a full mind and heart ; they have been pondered upon , and are the result of thorough conviction . Truths are spoken fearlessly , because felt deeply . In almost every article , some train of thought is started which carries us in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general course of thought be plain , yet , now and then , abysses are opened beneath our feet , fathomless chasms , whose bottom the eye strives in vain to reach . The style is fresh and idiomatic , reminding us of the days of the best English writers , and only possible to a mind of ample resources , fully alive to the beauties of nature and art , and accustomed to see things in their relations , not naked and isolated , but it may be " trailing clouds of glory , " and bound by mysterious and invisible threads to the world around , to the past and the future . That is a beautiful power of the imagination , illustrated not unfrequently in these // volumes , by which what at first seems to us a common thought is wafted insensibly up from the region of prose to that of poetry , from that of bare fact to feeling , and thus endowed with new qualities and powers , as if a cloud resting at evening on the hill-side were lifted to catch the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The feeling glides so insensibly into the thought , is so diffused through every part of it as to become inseparable from it . Let us illustrate this by a brief quotation from the essay on the Past and the Present ! The author is speaking of the mellow affection which we come to have for that which has been long with us . " Through a long acquaintance with any thing , no matter how insignificant in itself , it becomes imperceptibly inwrought with our accustomed associations of feelings and thoughts , and thus partakes of their common life , and , by sharing in it , adds to it . How much there is in the term , wonted to a thing ! We can not utter it without being conscious of a gentle stirring among the affections . It is something that took life early in our hearts and grew up , unobserved , it may be , branching in among our gentler feelings and quieter meditations , till the whole shoots up into a beautiful tree top ; and when the air of some outward circumstance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth altogether , and what a melody there is in its low murmur ! " - Vol. ii . p. 17 . This special power of the imagination , interpenetrated , warmed , and directed by the affections , gives a peculiar and inimitable vitality to the style ; and perhaps there is no single quality of Mr. Dana 's mind which so strongly individualizes , elevates , and , as we may say , glorifies his writings . In the gravest essay , no less than in the story , you fall upon some touching expression upon almost every page , to which the heart gave birth , not the head . The logic , however concentrated , is never formal . One thought so melts and sinks into another , like wave into wave , that you are hardly aware of the progress , and find yourself every now and then pausing to take a more accurate observation of your movement and position . You get the impression , therefore , of a mind working in the fulness , the completeness , the totality of its strength and resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor can an adequate impression of the fulness and richness of the thought be gained by extracts necessarily brief and // disconnected , nor in any way but by continuous and repeated reading . Strange is it , too , that what is so quiet , should unawares take such bold of you . There is strength , not violence . Your mind is not impelled by a sudden blow , but irresistibly borne on without shock or jar , by the steady , harmonious , uniform movement of the body of thought and feeling . Hence you are not startled with smartness or oddity , and are for the moment unaware of the genuine excellence of the style , and how vital is the connection between it and the thought which it expresses . To use Wordsworth 's fine expression , it is the " incarnation of thought , " - the mind by its natural and necessary action clothing its conception in a visible and tangible form , - the manner becomes confluent with the matter ; and the style , so far from being a mere dress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patched or changed at pleasure , is the living body enlivened by the indwelling spirit . " Style - it is the man himself . " Of the two volumes of Mr. Dana 's works which constitUte this edition , the contents of the first were published in 1833 , under the title of Poems and Prose Writings . We shall return to it after noticing briefly the essays and reviews now for the first time collected . The subjects of the essays are Old Times , The Past amid the Present , and Law as suited to Man ; of the reviews , Aliston 's Sylphs of the Seasons , Edgeworth 's Readings on Poetry , Hazlitt 's Lectures on the English Poets , The Sketch Book , Mrs. Radcliffe 's Gaston de Blondeville , The Novels of Charles Brockden Brown , Polbk 's Course of Time , The Natural History of Enthusiasm , and the Memoir of Henry Martyn . These originally appeared in the North American Review , the United States Review and Literary Gazette , the Spirit of the Pilgrims , the American Quarterly Observer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more observable in these writings than their opposition to the fictitious , and their genial sympathy with every mood of true and hearty feeling . The false refinement which makes society artificial and formal , and the false dignity which would make of every boy a man and of every girl a woman , which would check the buoyancy of youth lest it should violate a stiff decorum , and prune and cramp the affections lest their exuberance should too much // overshadow the pathway of life , come in , at all times , for their proper share of rebuke . In all imaginative and highly sensitive minds there exists a strong love for the past . its greatness and permanence are contrasted with the littleness and instability of the present . From the annoyances and follies of our daily life we shrink with pain , and turn to other ages whose evils are forgotten in the grateful memory of their blessings , while , by a fiction which we are apt to overlook , the few years of our present are weighed against the whole series of former generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly allied to healthful reverence and filial obedience , and producing that conservatism which saves us from rash counsels and measures . It betokens nothing good , hut fearful and untold calamities , for a people to cut itself sheer off from its ancestors , to refuse the instructions of their experience and the guidance of their wisely adjusted laws . This is as unnatural as it is suicidal , for by nature and providence one generation is hound to another ; passions , sympathies , destiny , are all interwoven . The part which any one generation bears in the great work of advancing the race , is , except in the greatest epochs , very limited . But for accomplishing that little measure of good , the very worst preparation is to live and act regardless of the past . In a progress with such principles , every thing that is worth living for is apt to be trampled in the dust , and the march of the nation is in quick time towards barbarism and dishonor . We have no great sympathy with those who see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; hut we certainly have quite as little for those who see in the present only good , and in the past nothing which deserves our reverence and love . If the one indicates a mind morbidly alive to evils which it can not cure , the other as surely betrays an ignorance and self-conceit still less to he tolerated , still more unsafe as a guide . The popular tendency with us is , doubtless , to the new and untried . We are full of self-reliance . Nothing but an occasional commercial crisis checks our course , and that even is felt by comparatively few . The vastness of our domain , the immensity of our resources , the rapidly developed physical agencies by which we bring the land and the sea under our control , our civil freedom , so great that , but for the taking of the census , one might never learn the existence of a // general government , our very history itself , - all conspire to render us self-confident , and therefore forgetful of our fathers and ungrateful to their memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the authority of the present hinds us only so long as it falls in with our inclinations . One of the great dangers of our prosperity is that of political and social demoralization ; nor are they to he stigmatized as croakers who are sharp-sighted enough to detect , and bold enough to proclaim the evil . In the scramble for wealth and power , in the luxury , and what we may generally call the worldliness , of the times , we are in danger of degrading our best affections , of destroying our most elevating sources of joy , if not of irretrievably sullying our character itself . He then does us some service who protests against this carelessness of old duties and affections , and who would entice a busy generation to a new recognition and love of that from which alone the wealth and honor which we insanely strive after can derive any real value . The essays on Old Times , and on The Past and the Present delineate , with exquisite beauty , the softening and humanizing tendencies of the old , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under the influence of things in themselves trivial , but which connect us with interesting scenes and events , with the pleasures of childhood , or even with situations which we once thought disastrous , and sufficiently hard to endure , the heart becomes young and tender again , and ready for any impression of good . The arm-chair which a father or mother has hallowed , the old rooms in which we sat when children , the old paper upon the walls , the stone before the door , a thousand nameless things move the affections , because they seem in some way to have shared life with us . They bear us , on softly moving pinions , away from the present to other scenes and other times . This truth , familiar , yet touching us so nearly as never to be unwelcome , takes other forms when expanded to larger circles of thought . The Past , with all its works , immutable , irretrievable , looks down upon us sometimes with a minatory face , or , if it does not threaten , admonishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not only has the past this life.giving power , by which , through the according action of heart and mind , the being grows up and expands with a just congruity throughout ; it also imparts // stability to the character ; for the past is fixed ; to that is neither change nor the shadow of turning . We may look back along the shores of that sea , and behold every cliff standing in its original , dark strength ; we may hear the solemn moving of its waves , but no plunge of a heavy promontory , tumbling from its base , startles us ; what hath been in the soul can not cease to be . Every secret thought of all the races of men who have been , all forms of the creative mind , put forth in act , still live . Every emotion of the heart that beat away back in time may sleep , but is not dead : it shall wake again . The hands that moulded the images first embodied in the mind may be dust now ; the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ; castle and fane , pyramid and column , may have come down ; but the forms in the mind , of which these were but the outward show , still stand there perfect . True , a veil may hang befoxe them for a while ; but when the angel , that standeth upon the sea , and upon the earth , shall utter the voice , Time shall be no longer , ' that veil shall be rent from the top to the bottom . 0 , it seems to me that I can look even now into this temple and its chambers of glorified imagery , and behold these spirits of the past in all their aspects , - of mysterious thought , subduing love , passionate endeavor , and lofty aim , and forms beautiful as the angels and noble as the gods ! Ho*v populous is the past ! Yes , not a passion , not a thought , not an image of the minds that have been , has perished : the spiritual can not die . What mean we by that we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - Vol. ii . pp. 21 , 22 . And here is a word of warning : - " lie who has no reverence for the past is an unnatural son , mocking at age , and forswearing his own father . And should this reverential feeling die out , and the children of this or the coming time make light of it , we may depend upon it , in its stead , passion will break into their social state , which shall rend them like the two she bears out of the wood . *- Vol. ii . p. 23 . But the ages are connected beyond the possibility of severance , notwithstanding any materializing and selfish individualism that may for a time hold sway . Were it otherwise , history itself would not be possible , experience would have no value , the future no hope . There is a deep and subtle philosophy in the following : - " Here let me just notice the mystery of this principle of unity , as it appears in the sacred history of the creation of man . God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman ; but // first the man , and thence the woman : Behold the One ! And if I might , without irreverence , call the created , in a lower sense , by that name which , in its first sacred sense , belongs to the In. create alone , I would say , Behold Our First Cause . There he stood , on this broad world , the only man . But what a man ! The world is populous enough now ; but since he fell and brought death into the world , and all our woe , ' not a human being that has lived , but had his life in that man . And not a desire , not a thought , not an act of all who now are , or of all who have followed him through the gates of death , but has been the unfolding of what was in Adam , and had its principle in him . The history of the thousands of years which are passed , and of the countless thousands of men who have died , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery of unity ! One , yet in and through all ; many , yet one . But what shall we say of myriads of unrelated existences ? Are these a mystery ? No ; for it is the oneness of the all.pervading , unseen power in the mysterious , which awes us so , - felt , though not understood . But unrelated existences ! It is all folly and confusion . " - Vol. ii . pp. 33 , 34 . We can not , for want of room , quote more from this delightful essay ; but our readers who have thus received an earnest of it , will not suffer it to remain long unread . In the same general strain , but with a wider sweep of thought , and with even greater seriousness and earnestness , is the essay on Law as suited to Man . Few questions involve more , or deserve to be discussed with a more tranquil and truth-loving spirit than this , - " What Form of Government , or Law , is best suited to the individual and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch upon the question without at once awakening political jealousies , and if one chances to differ from the popular notions , be is pretty sure to bring against himself , and what is more , against the objects of his regard , and the very institutions he may be connected with , the noisy rage of every brainless demagogue , who hopes by clamor to make himself notorious or bring his party to the majority . The writer endeavors to distinguish the tendency of that form of Law which is carried out through hereditary orders and a permanent authority , and of that opposite form which rests on popular equality and the frequent change of the executive by elections . It would be difficult to conceive a discussion more alien in its tone from a common political // diatribe than this . Extremely delicate and intertwining with all our choicest affections , the thought amplifies itself to the extent of the ethics of the subject , and wins its gentle way to our inmost breasts , whether we assent to the conclusions or not . No one can read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some respect , better . Many things will probably be suggested to him which he never before thought of . He may get an idea of the majesty and beneficence of Law in its larger acceptation , such as , if not familiar with Hooker or Burke , he may never have conceived of before . So complete is this essay , such a fulness , a roundness to it , that we can with difficulty seize upon a portion which , read by itself , might not seem incomplete , and torn harshly from its place . We will , however , make the experiment . The author is speaking of the way in which Law , considered not merely as something extrinsic , some formal rule , but as an inward guide , through the very relations and conditions which it creates and sanctions , blends with the finest feelings and closest relations , and gives congruity to the soul , and raises it to healthful action . From this he goes on - " That has been called the best form of Law which leaves man the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save where he openly and purposely violates it , that he is under Law . " If by this were meant , that the less of Law there is in the form of arbitrary , teasing enactments , or dark oppression , the better , it may not be questioned . And yet , even where no immediate and outbreaking licentiousness is the consequence , there may be too little , as well as too much of Law for man 's xvell-being . For he needs frequent reminding of his limited nature , by the hinderances of set boundaries , or , in his forgetfulness , self-will would , first or last , carry him over all bounds . It is well for him that Law should now and then say to him , Thou shalt not do this ! Thou shalt not do that ! And if he ask , Why ? - that she give no other reply than , Thou shalt not do it ! But especially is Law well , where its all-pervading spirit reaches man immediately through his calling in life , and through the established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady , diffusive , and multiplied influences , softened by the medium through which it passes , becoming emotion to the heart and reverence to the mind . Made one with his religion , his household , his toils , it imparts a unity , steadiness , and spirit of respect to his character , which must be for his common good , in // his private relations , and in those more abroad . " - Vol. ii . pp. 69 , 70 . " It has been said already , that this principle of Orders does not cut off kindly interchange between individuals of different Orders , though the intercourse is modified by the relations in which ranks stand to each other . And I would appeal to those who remember the earlier state of our domestic relations , when the old Scripture terms of master ' and servant ' were in use . I do not fear contradiction when I say , that there was more of mutual goodwill then , than now ; more of trust on the one side , and fidelity on the other ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude and affectionate respect in return ; and , be . cause each understood well his place , actually more of a certain freedom , tempered by gentleness and by deference . From the very fact that the distinction of classes was more marked , the bond between the individuals constituting these two was all the closer . As a general truth , I verily believe , that , with the exception of near blood-relationship , and here and there peculiar friendships , the attachment of master and servant was closer and more enduring than that of almost any other connection in life . The young of this day , under a change of fortune , will hardly live to see the eye of an old faithful servant fill at their fall ; nor will the old domestic be longer housed and warmed by the fireside of his master 's child , or be followed by him to his grave The blessed sun of those good days has gone down , it may be for ever ; and it is very cold I - Vol. ii . pp. 71 , 72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see in one form of government nothing but good , and in its opposite , nothing but evil ; and certainly not so foolish as to sup .. pose that any established form can at once be put aside for another . He must be a sturdy monarchist , indeed , who would wish , even , to try a different experiment in this country , from that which we are working out with quite sufficient rapidity ; and a very verdant one who should suppose that a change towards greater permanence of authority is at present within the limits of possibility . Yet it is never amiss to discuss , and , i f possible , determine , abstract principles . The truth may come into play when we least suspect it . No one of tolerable sagacity can mistake our political tendencies . The wheels of the world do not turn backward . The time is past when one voice , though that the wisest , or one arm , though that the strongest , or one body of representatives , though that the most sagacious and patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ion . Ominous and fearful is the intense life , - vapid , and often selfish and unscrupulous , the movements of these latter days . But for this very reason ought sober and earnest men not to despair of the truth , nor cease to utter it . The time may come when we shall need all its power to sustain us ; need to gather in one phalanx the good and the true , the strong-minded and truly patriotic , of whatever name or state , to arrest , at least for a time , the wild current of misrule , and perhaps , to save " from the wreck of the empire , the jewels of liberty . " The essential evils of society are deep seated , and can be touched only by a remedy which shall touch the disease at the heart . " If Law is ordained to have an influence upon the passions , sentiment , and affections , let it be remembered , that these are the prime constituents of man 's nature , and must exist along with it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into subjection to the understanding , by first of all pouring know . ledge into the mind , is beginning at the wrong end , and attempt . ing to subject the moving powers of the soul to that which is moved by them . While , for instance , there is pride in the heart , it is in vain to attempt subduing it by adding to our knowledge ; for here " knowledge puffeth up . " While there is malignity , craft , envy , the more knowledge , the more with and upon which these may act . The selfish principle may change its mode of operation , through its increased knowledge of means ; but it is still the master-mover , and will continue to be so , till the moral evil is first subdued , and the head be taught wisdom through the heart . It may be , that God is permitting the popular system of education to be tried out , only to convince man how worse than in vain is the endeavor to bring society into order by any other way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Himself . The first breach of God 's Law was not a mistake of the head , it was a sin of the heart ; and thus discord was brought in ; and that man may come once more into harmony with himself and with his fellow.man , he must again come under obedience of heart to his God : As ignorance was not the cause of sin , so knowledge will not cure it . And , in very deed , there can not be a just perception of a moral truth , save through a first quickened moral affection . If this be so , that form of Law which is best fitted to awaken and keep alive these principles in man will be just as necessary in ages to come as it is now ; man will ever need those influences which shall shed through the soul the spirit of Obedience , Humility , and Content .

This essay , following a train of thought so subtile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , overlooked or despised , - so independent , and , in our times , so unique , - abounds in truths which we may apply as we please , however we dissent from the conclusions of the writer . The real anirnus of it lies , perhaps , not in an exclusive attachment to one form of Law or another hut in a keen feeling of the evils of the times . Against a disregard for authority , a want of reverence for age and wisdom , the radicalism which would level time-honored institutions and despise sacred principles , it enters its grave protest and utters its solemn prophecy . The remedy it indeed finds in forms which embody principles , and by their constant presence , their gentle though unfelt pressure , acting upon all the relations of life , restrain and educate ; but it values the form for the sake of the virtue which it is supposed to protect and develop . Of the literary articles of these volumes , several of which were originally published in this journal , the review of Llazlitt 's Lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The criticism turns not only on Mr. Hazlitt , hut more at length on Chaucer , Spenser , Pope , Thomson , Cowper , Swift , Crabbe , Goldsmith , and Wordsworth . We know not where to find , within the same compass , a criticism so complete and so true . The virtues of these various poets are duly estimated , and of their vices , nothing is extenuated and nothing is set down in malice . As a critic , Mr. Dana is of that wise and liberal school which seeks to determine with a large justice , the true intellectual position of the authors criticized , and to judge them by a fixed and generous standard . It is the smallest office of the critic to detect blemishes ; his larger and more essential duty is to comprehend the excellencies , the idea , the principles of a composition . Hence there is needed not only sufficient knowledge , but breadth and variety of sympathy . The critic must in one sense rise above his age and country . " The man who likes widely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some defect in us , which weakens our relish and warps our judgment even of those things which we like best . He who has sentiment and humor is more tho. roughly possessed of both , than he who has a feeling of but one of them can be of either . Where we are moved violently , we // are moved strangely . Through the overshadowings of affliction images the most grotesque are passing , now dimly , now dis . tinetly , before us ; and even into the depths of a sorrow which seems to have driven out from the heart nil that is impure , and to have made it the dwelling of heavenly visitants , unholy thought , seemingly formed from without us , and on which we shut our eyes with loathing and horror , make their way . " - Vol. ii . pp. 202 . A mind , therefore , cultivated only in one direction , or cramped in its tastes , fails to comprehend the rich and endless variety which shows itself in the world of mind no less , cer-* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we a right to judge peremptorily of another , unless , by equal learning or by much meditation , we have come to a knowledge of his principles , and to a degree of sympathy with his spirit . Then only can we pronounce with entire authority on even the minor faults . The review of Pollok 's Course of Tinie strikes us as nearly a model of impartial criticism . It holds the balance with an even hand . With fine acumen , it points out the weaknesses and deficiencies of that once excessively over-praised , and now too much slighted , work , and yet sympathizes with its real power and beauty , and strives to exhibit fairly and fully its better qualities . The criticism was written when the rage for " The Course of Time " was at its height , when the poetry was estimated by its religious fervor , and very good men , though very poor critics , placed it above the Paradise Lost . At such a moment , the criticism doubtless seemed somewhat severe , and perhaps cruel , throwing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration . But time has more than justified the critic ; the poem fell from its dizzy and unnatural elevation , and poor Pollok is now hardly mentioned once a year ; adulation is changed into something that approaches contempt . To one who should read the review now for the first time , the censure would not seem unduly severe , nor the praise too moderate . Possibly , even , the reader would assign to the poem a rank higher than he has been accustomed to award to it . The semi-oblivion into which the work has sunk , among those even who once praised it most , though really more favorable than the former illfounded fame , is not more truly just . From its present neglect , it will , we think , in due time recover , and maintain // an honorable and somewhat unique positi6n in English letters . Its fair fame will even be enhanced by a recollection of the pure life and early death of its author . A feeling of melancholy comes over us in the recollection of high promise so soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgments . We have a feeling , too , of instinctive respect for one who , yet so young , plumed his wings for so daring a flight . Though he failed , and the great religious poem of the language is yet to be written , yet the effort of a young man who died at the age of twenty-seven , to realize an idea so lofty , can not be regarded with indifference , and partial success is no moderate honor . The article on the Natural History of Enthusiasm is a discriminating essay on some of the more refined forms of religious and moral error . It uncovers their roots and traces their growth out to the slenderest ramifications . In this essay as in most of the writings of Mr. Dana , there is such compactness , one portion depends so much upon some other for its full significance , there is such completeness and fulness in every part , that we must say of it as our author himself speaks of the work of Isaac Taylor , " We scarcely know how to select from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel as if we were leaving a better behind . " There is an admirable exhibition , in the following passage , of the subtle yet mighty operations of the perverted religious element of man 's nature , in circumstances where the element itself , if not so profound , and intertwining with the very roots of our being , would be entirely destroyed . But so it is , that the absence of truth leaves us not in a mere negative state , and skepticism comes round in its course to join hands with drivelling superstition . The writer is speaking of the variety of truth as presented in the Bible . " Thus is the Bible adapted to the condition and twofold nature of man . We are struck with this most forcibly , when considering man in the different states of society ; that in which the Word of God has never been set before him , and that in which he rejects it , and shuts out its influence . Where , in a state of ignorance and sensuality , he comes nearest to the mere brute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong principle within forces itself out through all his fleshliness , and he whom we had coupled with the fed and lazy swine is found superstitiously peopling infinitude with wild and giant shapes of terror // and awe , at the sight of which his soul trembles . There is an intensity of strength and action in this principle in man , which makes the scoffer 's heart beat quick ; for he feels that there is a meaning in it , and a dreadful meaning . Call it imagination , or what he may , it is not so to be passed by ; there it is , a reality in it to himself as well as to him he would despise . It may take other forms , - as those of beauty , and of a cheering , enticing nature ; it is still the same restless power at work , striving after something beyond the visible and tangible , and by its blind , uncertain efforts warning man that there is something beyond .

" - Vol. ii . pp. 387 , 388 . Of the same spirit is another passage of solemn grandeur , and suggestive of much in these self*complacent days . " When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshipped stocks and stones , creeping things , and the lights of heaven , and peopled earth and air with deities , it was not because there were no sciences in the world and no mighty intel . lects . Every day is making better known to us how much in the arts and sciences , and in the philosophy of mind , has floated down to us out of the wrecks of former times , and how many of our discoveries are but rediscoveries . Verily , ' may the man say who reads the philosophy of this day , there is nothing new under the sun . ' It is forgetfulness , or ignorance of the intel . lectual advancement of those times , which has helped so much to the self-complacency of our own , and begotten that dangerous and presumptuous confidence , that man 's reason is sufficient to itself , and treats with scorn the thought that the now enlightened man should again wander back into darkness .

Where he first // set his foot , the strong trees root themselves amidst mighty ruins , and from between leaning columns and shattered arches comes a voice of warning , - Stand not up in thine own strength , 0 man , lest thou be brought low ; nor trust alone to the light of thine own reason , lest thick darkness encompass thee . ' - Vol. ii . pp. 387 , 388 . No less admirably written are others of these admirable essays and reviews , especially those on Irving , Allston , and Brown . The author 's estimate of the works of this lastnamed writer is high , - rather higher than our own has commonly been , - and yet he is not sparing in censure . " The energies of his soul , " he says , " were melancholy powers , and their path lay along the dusky dwelling-places of superstition , and fear , and death , and woe . They manifest themselves in the most striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets and plainly constructed houses of a freshly brick-built city , the gloom , awe , and mystery , which hitherto had hung over the damp , dark , intricate passages and dread chambers of inquisitions , dungeons , towers , and hoary castles alone. ** This is high and grateful praise , most beautifully expressed ; and we are sorry , not having read the novels of Brown for many years , to remember them more for their painful and gloomy impression , mingling sometimes with dissatisfaction both at the methods and the results , than for their more excellent qualities . The contents of the idle Man have been long known to the lovers of Mr. Dana 's writings . It is now nearly thirty years since that little publication was suspended , and nearly twenty , since its stories were collected , together with the poetry , and published in a single duodecimo volume . The most powerful of the fictions is Paul Felton , - a terrible delineation of the course of a highly sensitive and educated mind , the victim of morbid feelings , perverting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dragged , as by the power of fiends , along its wretched path of misery to murder , exhaustion , and death . To depict such scenes demands very high powers , - a profound insight into the heart , and a certain experience of the sorrows of a morbidly sensitive mind . One must have come within the outer circle of those fatal influences , where the soul quivers between life and death , - when if the judgment and the resolute will // but relax their hold for a little while , it is irresistibly dashed onward in the rapid whirl , and , bewildered , distracted , tormen ted , finds no rest this side the grave . Almost every person of keen sensibility , at some fearful moment of life , has felt enough to make him see the possibility of all this , and to shudder at the sense of his own insecurity ; but to portray it without apparent violence , and without crossing the narrow line which separates the awful from the horrible and shocking , without practically confounding the sublime in suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are simply painful and repulsive , demands something of the Shakspearian judgment and instinctive sagacity as well as imagination . We would gladly , if our limits permitted , run over every separate piece in these volumes ; selecting for our readers the passages which have pleased us most , and gathering up their minor lessons of practical wisdom , regretting only that so much of the finer spirit of the whole necessarily exhales in the brief extract . That is the true idea of literature and art which regards them not- as factitious , but as the necessary , expression of the intellectual life of man . This is exhibited in the works before us , and constitutes , if we mistake not , the secret source of their attractiveness . We can not help , if we would , seeing the writer in the writings . There is a sincerity and conscientiousness , an unaffected and honest utterance of unborrowed thoughts and feelings , which enters into our hearts and seems to make us stronger and better . Hence , their educational influence on susceptive minds can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does us no harm when reflection is forced upon us , when we are compelled to inspect the operations of our own minds , to dwell at home . " Proneness to melancholy is not the evil of our times . We live too much abroad for that ; daytime and evening , we are running at large with the common herd , or are gathered into smaller flocks and folds , called societies . No one is seen ruminating alone in the still shade of his own oak or willow . " To lead us to a wise meditation will be one tendency of these works , but their good influence will not be confined to this alone ; for they have this quality in them , - ( we must say it in their own language , for none other can express it so well ) - " The more they are studied , the closer hold they take upon // the mind . They shoot up and overrun us like vines . Creeping along the windings of our feelings and twining in among our thoughts with a growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kept fresh hy them , and our minds overhung with their dangling beauties , the grateful sense that they impart to us is hardly noted , and is in us as if it were only our own happy nature . " From the prose writings we pass easily and naturally to the poetry , still breathing the same ntmosphere , only purer and more sublimated . The poetic spirit is peculiar to no time , to no people , though ever varying its form and tone according to the changes of human life , so as to be no poor indication of the thought and character of different ages . We may safely presume that Wordsworth , had he lived in the reign of Eliza .. beth , would not have written the Excursion ; and that Spenser , in the reign of Victoria , would not have traced his " Continued Allegory , or darke Conceit ; " yet each in his day was true to himself , and to the Muse which inspired him . All through the world , all down throughout the centuries , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their songs of beauty and grandeur , enlightening the blind eyes and cheering the sad hearts . Why , in these later and prosaic days , should their music cease ? Do we not need it as much as ever ? More than ever . Nor will it cease ; poetry can never fail among men while human hearts throb with hope and fear , or any thing is left in the world to delight the eye and elevate the soul . Criticism may demonstrate that the early ages alone were apt for poetry , when nature was fresh , and language picturesque , and manners simple , and that we have lost or changed all that ; that knowledge has chilled enthusiasm ; and science , by revealing the mysteries of nature , has shorn away her power ; that the heavens are cold and unanswering ; and the earth is dry dust beneath our feet . But before the curl has vanished from the self-satisfied lip , the poet 's " winged steed , " ignorant of the harsh demonstration , has " strayed into the village , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " green sward where trod his struggling hoofs . " It is the very province of genius , - that peculiar power in virtue of which it is genius , - to open new and untrodden ways in which criticism may patiently and honorably follow , but // which it never could have discovered . Where , until the fourteenth century , was the Divine Comedy ? Where , until the seventeenth , the Paradise Lost ? Between doing a thing and not doing it , there may seem to he hut the breadth of a hair ; yet the difference is immeasurable . On one side of the line , talent wearies itself with fruitless endeavor , and demonstrates , if it he necessary , to everybody 's satisfaction , that it has accomplished all that is permitted to mortal power ; on the other , genius , with the clear insight , the unstammering tongue , the practical capacity in which its divine virtue lies , sees the beauty , speaks the word , does the deed , and the impossible vanishes forever . There are periods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry unhonored or mechanically grinding out its numbers in some prison-house ; hut to suppose that it will ever die out from literature , is to suppose a change of our nature so radical that it well might he termed destruction . And as the poet 's dominion will extend down to the " last syllable of recorded time , " so will the manifestation of his power assume forms ever new and fresh , to meet the new wants of age after age . " That which to my mind is poetry , " says our author , " is a manifestation of the dearest faculties and affections of man , in their greatest strength , beauty , and variety . There is nothing more serious than poetry . Many content themselves with ad. miring its more delicate branches , its leaves and blossoms ; not heeding that this fair array is put forth through roots which run down deep into the soil of our humanity , and are watered by its nether springs . " - Vol. ii . p. 74 . The poetry of Mr. Dana is quite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate its peculiarities by contrasting it with that of some of our other writers who are favorites with everybody . How clear , sparkling , and keen , is the verse of Dr. Holmes ! It flies through the welcoming air like a silver arrow , straight to its mark , nor is he to he envied who stands in the way of it when satire draws the how . Nobody can mistake the aim of the writer , nobody is compelled to pause and painfully gather up the tenuous threads of thought . How exquisite the delicacy of Mr. Longfellow 's muse ! The verses flow spontaneously at their own sweet will ; they make music for themselves ; the air is vocal with melody . How tenderly and softly , with an occasional touch of sadness , and an occa // sional lift of power , ever responsive to the varying moods of human feeling , flow forth the strains of Bryant ! Different from these , though in calm thoughtfulness , in gentleness and melancholy , most like the last , is the poetry of our author . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The spirit of his poetry is not lyrical and passionate ; it does not stir the blood like a trumpet ; yet sometimes it lifts us on the slow-swelling tidal wave of thought and feeling , to the sublimest heights of emotion . Apart from the Buccaneer , and the satirical portions of Factitious Life , the materials of the poetry are mainly drawn from within ; from the soul itself , its hopes , fears , and destiny ; its religious life , its affections and sorrows . With these are intimately associated whatever in the outer world attracts the poet 's regard . Hence , the thoughtful , contemplative character of the poems . They are pervaded by a philosophy which does not merely tinge the surface , but permeates the substance . Mr. Dana 's muse seldom dances gaily upon the mountain tops , fanned by the breezes and rejoicing in the clear sunlight ; but moves solemnly amon0 the graves of the early loved and lost , - on the shores of dark and fearful seas , within the power of an awful , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes labors with the weight of the thought ; it is torn and rough in the effort to concentrate within the limits of the line the exact and full idea . No " creamy smoothness " nor " fatal facility " of expression carries the writer beyond the limits of the subject or the feeling . If there be an occasional want of melody , there is never of strength , nor of delicate sensibility , nor of imagination , nor of genial and hearty sympathy . How strong , too , as in all genuine poets , is the love for nature , animate and inanimate ! The dying raven and the little beach bird , the clump of daisies , the early spring brook , and the moss growing beside it , each wakens the music of a responsive affection . Yet in nature alone the soul can not be satisfied ; its cravings reach farther , and are imperative . In Mr. Dana 's poetry , the moral and religious element is as strongly marked as in his prose , and constitutes that indwelling power which elevates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth touches the soul so closely , and affects its most hidden and secret life , excites its profoundest and loftiest emotions , no mind which has not been moved by // such truths can fully appreciate the highest products of liter-. ature or art , much less produce them . The noblest purpose of all art , is to raise those who come within the circle of its power to higher regions of thought and feeling . We do not say that this is its sole purpose ; for beneath this loftiest aim , within this amplest sweep of it , lie a thousand subordinate designs to be accomplished , a thousand delights which it may afford . Poetry is still such when its themes are bumble and its ends gay and frolicsome ; hut it puts on its mightiest panoply , and dazzles from afar , and careers victorious over all people and all ages , when it " rides sublime upon the seraph wings of ecstasy " and gazes upon " the sapphire throne , " and ministers to the deepest fears , the loftiest hopes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are capable . The longest poem in the volume is The Buccaneer , a tale of lust and blood , and then of terrible vengeance wrought upon the guilty by mysterious and supernatural powers , against which , though apparently " of such stuff as dreams are made of , " the soul of the coarse and murderous pirate could offer no resistance . The peculiar force of the poem lies , we think , in the mingling of the natural and supernatural , and the air of reality which is thrown over both . A certain mystery shrouds the scenes , the transaction , and its consequences . The island , so tranquil in its beauty , is anywhere along the rocky stretch of our shore . One little restrictive word alone keeps it from floating away into the unknown waste of waters ; binds it to the continent , and makes us feel a kind of home interest in the events described ; but every looker-out from the headland , who , when the wind and air are favorable , sees the distant island looming up , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee . " The island lies nine leagues away . Along its solitary shore , Of craggy rock and sandy bay , No sound but ocean 's roar , Save where the bold , wild sea-bird makes her home , Her shrill cry coming through the sparkling foam . But when the light winds lie at rest , And on the glassy , heaving sea , The black duck , with her glossy breast , // Sits swinging silently , - How beautiful ! no ripples break the reach , And silvery waves go noiseless up the beach . And inland rests the green , warm dell ; The brook comes tinkling down its side ; From out the trees the Sabbath bell Rings cheerful , far and wide , Mingling its sound with bleatings of the flocks , That feed about the vale among the rocks . Nor holy bell , nor pastoral bleat , In former days within the vale ; Flapped in the bay the pirate 's sheet ; Curses were on the gale ; Rich goods lay on the sand , and murdered men ; Pirate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices , words of grace , Now slowly fall upon the ear ; A quiet look is in each face , Subdued and holy fear ; Each motion gentle ; all is kindly done . - Come , listen how from crime the isle was won . Vol. i. pp. 3 , 4 . The poem proper opens with a description of the " dark , low , brawny man , " who once collected his booty and buried his dead in this isle . In some strange freak , he determines to regain by trade the losses which waste and extravagance have occasioned . He freights his ship with the spoils of former piracies . A storm overtakes him , the cargo is thrown overboard , and at last , with torn sails , and broken spars , he reaches a Spanish port , disappointed , sullen , and revengeful . The tempest of war is sweeping over the land , and driven before it , there comes down to the shore a Spanish lady , seeking a passage to some more peaceful clime . Her young husband had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was gone who made it dear . " Deceived by the pirate , she embarks with all her wealth , and " that white steed she rode beside her lord . " The consequence - who can not foresee ? Yet the catastrophe is held back a little . A struggle is goings on in the heart of the wretch . It is not so easy , after all , to lay violent hands on immaculate purity and goodness ; not so easy , coolly to brave the vengeance of the unseen powers . 12 * // Lie can not look on her mild eye ; Her patient words his spirit quell . Within that evil heart there lie The heats and fears of hell . His speech is short ; he wears a surly brow . There 's none will hear the shriek , what fear ye now ? The workings of the soul ye fear ; Ye fear the power that goodness hath ; Ye fear the unseen one ever near , Walking his ocean path . From out the silent void there comes a cry , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shalt die ! " P. 11 . Here is shadowed forth the future avenger . Lee is a pirate , cold , cruel , unrelenting , hypocritical , vulgar , and brutal ; yet he is a man , and shall no more certainly commit his crimes than he shall be tormented with the whip of scorpions . The pause in the action is but for a moment ; the sign is given , and , after a brief but terrible struggle , all is over . The attendants are despatched , and the lady , to avoid the touch of the murdering fiends , rushes past them and leaps into the waves . She is sleeping in her silent cave , Nor hears the loud , stern roar above , Nor strife of man on land or wave . Young thing ! her home of love She soon has reached ! Fair , unpolluted thing ! They harmed her not !  --  Was dying suffering ? p. 13 . This is little more than the old tale of piratic barbarity told with startling brevity and power . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance veils its atrocity ; no mist dims the sharp outlines of its repulsive form . Now comes a touch of great imaginative power . The favorite horse must share the fate of his mistress ; there must be no tell-tales in the ship , and the poor animal , in excess of cruelty , shall be cast out alive upon the waves . Such sound to mortal ear ne'er came As rang far o'er the waters wide . It shook with fear the stoutest frame : The horse is on the tide ! As th&amp;waves leave , or lift him up , his cry Comes lower now , and now is near and high . // And through the swift wave 's yesty crown His scared eyes shoot a fiendish light , And fear seems wrath . He now sinks down , Now heaves again to sight , Then drifts away ; and through the night they hear Far off that dreadful cry . - But morn is near . p. 16 . A strange shudder comes over us at the thought of the terror-smitten creature , his huge bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of hopeless agony , - always deeply distressing in a brute , - coming all night long out of the dark and dreary waste of ocean . An act of superfluous cruelty to a domestic animal strikes us as a proof of greater barbarity almost than cruelty to one of our own race , whose intelligence can ward off the danger , or , at least , enable the sufferer to bear the pain with fortitude . Hence , too , the frantic efforts of an animal to escape an impending danger have in them something awful and startling ; the eye gleams with a supernatural intelligence ; sometimes it seems threatening and revengeful ; - " fear seems wrath . " The course of the pirate , on reaching the shore again , runs fast in reckless carousals , which only seem to drown remorse and fear . Men gather around to ask questions which are answered with a sneer , or a bold , or a hypocritical lie . Lee 's favor and his power begin to be feared alike . Meantime the unseen avengers are not sleepless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , and the pirates are gathered to celebrate it " with royal state and special glee . " The revellers grow furious in their horrible festival , till , just at midnight , a sudden light appears far off upon the waters ; at first no bigger than a star , it soon swells out like the " bloody moon , " then " shoots in hairy streams , " then , sweeping nearer and nearer , assumes a definite form , a ship all on fire , flaming in every part , yet unconsumed . The lurid light gleams along the shore and startles the wild sea-birds , while men look on in wonder and awe . And what comes up above the wave , So ghastly white ? A spectral head ! A horse 's head ! ( May Heaven save Those looking on the dead ,  - -  The waking dead ! ) There , on the sea he stands , - The Spectre-Horse ! He moves ! he gains the sands ; // And on he speeds ! His ghostly sides Are streaming with a cold , blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spectre-Horse to-night ! His path is shining like a swift ship 's wake ; Before Lee 's door he gleams like day 's gray break . The revel now is high within ; It bursts upon the midnight air . They little think in mirth and din , What spirit waits them there . As if the sky became a voice , there spread A sound to appall the living , stir the dead . The Spirit-Steed seat up the neigh ; It seemed the living trump of hell , Sounding to call the damned away , To join the host that fell . It rang along the vaulted sky ; the shore Jarred hard , as when the thronging surges roar . It rang in ears that knew the sound ; And hot , flushed cheeks are blanched with fear . Ha ! why does Lee look wildly round ? Thinks he the drowned horse near ? He drops his cup , - his lips are stiff with fright . Nay , sit thee down , - it is thy banquet night . " I can not sit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my spirit now . I go to dread ,  --  Igo to woe ! " 0 , who so weak as thou , Strong man ! His hoofs upon the door-stone , see , The Shadow stands ! His eyes are on thee , Lee ! Thy hair pricks up ! - " 0 , I must hear His damp , cold breath ! It chills my frame His eyes , - their near and dreadful glare Speak that I must not name ! " Art mad to mount that Horse - " A power within , I must obey , cries , Mount thee , man of sin ! ' " He 's now upon the Spectre 's back , With rein of silk and curb of gold . T is fearful speed ! - the rein is slack Within his senseless hold ; Borne by an unseen power , right on he rides , Yet touches not the Shadow-Beast he strides . // He goes with speed ; he goes with dread ! And now they 're on the hanging steep ! And now the living and the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops short , - his feet are on the verge He stands , like marble , high above the surge . And , nigh , the tall ship 's burning on , With red , hot spars and crackling flame ; From hull to gallant , oot hing 's gone ; - She burns , and yet 's the same ! Her hot , red flame is heating , all the night , On man and Horse , in their cold , phosphor light . " pp. 20-22 . All night , until the faint gray dawn , the light of the burning ship glared on the man and horse . The spectres fade with the light of day ; 1 ) ut Lee is left alone , standing insensible alike to the fresh morning air and the hot noon-day sun . For him there is " no rest below , " " no hope above . " The vision of comm woe fills and overwhelms him . His companions forsake him , forsake the island where he dwells . But the certain and sure catastrophe does not come upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine " - to wander " a man forbid . " His audacity , after a while , recovers itself a little , but another awful anniversary crushes it irrecoverably . The once hardened and reckless murderer is become weak as a child under the revelation of his fate . There is nothing to support him ; nothing without , nothing within . He wanders by the sea-side , and gathers pebbles and scores the wet sands . A sweet , low voice , in starry nights , Chants to his ear a plaining song ; Its tones come winding up the heights , Telling of woe and wrong ; And he7 must listen till the stars grow dim , The song that gentle voice doth sing to him . 0 , it is sad that aught so mild Should bind the soul with hands of fear ; That strains to soothe a little child , The man should dread to hear .

Another besides Matthew Lee , - we must remark in passing , - has listened to the heavy breaking of the sea beneath the cliff ; or we should never have had verses like these , and many others which we could quote . The dreadful year again came round , and with it the last day of the wretched sinner . Again the burning ship floats into the bay , but , unlike former appearances , and as if to mark the winding up of the dreadful series of events , she rolls , settles , and goes down forever . And where she sank , up slowly came The Spectre.Horse from out the sea . And there he stands ! His pale sides flame .

How still they stand ,  --  the man and Horse ! " Thine hour is almost past . " " 0 , spare me , " cries the wretch , " thou fearful One ! " " The time is come , - I must not go alone . " " I 'm weak and faint . 0 , let me stay ! " " Nay , murderer , rest , nor stay for thee ! " The Horse and man are on their way ; He bears him to the sea .

They 're seen no more ; the night has shut them in . May Heaven have pity on thee , man of sin ! The earth has washed away its stain ; The sealed-up sky is breaking forth , Mustering its glorious hosts again , From the far south and north ; The climbing moon plays on the rippling sea . - 0 , whither on its waters rideth Lee ? pp. 32 - 34 . So mysteriously out into the lonely waste of waters , the Buccaneer is borne to expiate his crimes . This , on many accounts , may be considered the most powerful poem in the volume . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a kind of verse more difficult , we should think , than some others , for the sententious brevity of expression , and the dramatic form into which parts of it are thrown . The poem abounds in exact and delicate descriptions of nature , which , at the first reading , are apt to be overlooked . There is in it , too , a profound moral , and the catastrophe , as we intimated before , is brought about through a highly imaginative mingling of the common with the rare . The material and supernatural marvellously hlend , so that each receives new force from the other . The retributive powers , though unseen , infuse into nature herself unwonted energies . Earth and sea can not rest . The burning ship and the spectral horse are sustained and impelled by the invisible avengers , whose interference is warranted by the atrocity of the crime , till that crime is expiated and retributive justice is satisfied . Notwithstanding the strength and purely poetic characteristics of this poem , there are others which are more pleasing , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the author , as if they were a more immediate breathing out of his spirit . There is apparently a more direct and strenuous effort of the mind in the Buccaneer than in The // Changes of Home , Factitious Life , or Thoughts on the Soul ; while in these is more evident the exquisitely tender and delicate spirit , the keen , but not harsh , satire , and the contemplative , philosophical , and religious mind , so abundantly exhibited in the Prose Writings . We have not room for the quotations which we have marked , but can not omit giving a few passages from the longer poems , and one or two of the shorter pieces entire . Factitious Life begins with all the sharpness of picture , the definiteness of scene , the " nudity of description , " for which Crabhe is distinguished . It ends with a serene dignity which that poet never equalled . Take the following passage on that virtue whose standard is fashion ; for more than one reason it will do us good to lay it to heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right betraying , lest you should be rude , Excusing wrong , lest you be thought precise , In morals easy and in manners nice ; To keep in with the worl&amp; your only end , And with the world to censure or defend , To bend to it each passion , thought , desire , With it genteelly cold , or all on fire , What have you left to call your own , I pray ? You ask , What says the world ? and that obey ; Where singularity alone is sin , Live uncondemned , and prostrate all within . You educate the manners , not the heart ; And morals make good-breeding and an art . Though coarse within , yet polished high without , And held by all respectable , no doubt , You think , concealed beneath these flimsy lies , To keep through life the set proprieties .

Of Mr. Dana 's minor poems , all of which have a certain exquisite finish and sometimes a recondite beauty which amply repays the attention necessary to the full apprehension of them , we have chosen two which somehow , almost without our will , cling to our memory so tenaciously that we could not easily loosen the grasp if we would ; we certainly would not if we could . The first is entitled Greenough 's Statue of Medora . How the soul of the poet is breathed into the statue ; how the spirit of the statue informs the soul of the poet ! Medora , wake ! - nay , do not wake ! I would not stir that placid brow , Nor lift those lids , though light should break Warm from the twin blue heavens that lie below . Sleep falls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Touched by its might , The soul comes out in loving dreams , And wraps thy delicate form in living light . Thou art not dead ! - These flowers say That thou , though more thou heed'st them not , // And lay thee here where thou rnight'st weep , - That Death hut hushed thee to repose , As mothers tend their infants ' sleep , And watch their eyelids falter , open , close , - That here thy heart hath found release , Thy sorrows all are gone away , Or touched hy something almost peace , Like night 's last shado*vs hy the gleaming day . When he who g ye thee form is gone , And I within the earth shall lie , Thou still shalt softly slumber on , Too fair to live , too beautiful to die . Vol. i. pp. 131 , 13*2 . But our favorite verses we have reserved for the last . They are placed last in the volume , as forming perhaps the most fitting conclusion to the series . If our walk has been along sad places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects of our dearest affections , there is yet for us the dawn of a better day . The dusky lights have fled ; we are cheered with calm but joyful anticipations , and feel stronger for the duties of life . For delicacy and finish , for tender and thoughtful musing , for a beautiful touch of sadness , which is often the attendant of a sensitive mind and a precursor of generous action , for an indescribable con4leteness which fills and satisfies the mind , we know nothing in our literature which surpasses it . The few lines from the Pilgrim 's Progress which form its most appropriate motto , connect it with all the associations of that inimitable volume . We look out froni the upper chamber ; we see that glorious star flaming in the forehead of the morning ; we see the streaks of dull red , the bars of the chamber whence corneth the sun like a bridegroom ; we feel the mists which creep over the still , cold , and dark valley ; we start at that straight and glittering shaft that shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire up comes the Day . " We hardly know why , but this piece has always , in our memory , lain side by side with Bryant 's address to the evening wind . A kindred spirit is in them both . Now , brighter than the host that all night long , In fiery armor , far up in the sky // Stood watch , thou com'st to wait the morning 's song , Thou com'st to tell me day is again nigh , Star of the dawning ! Cheerful is thine eye ; And yet in the broad day it must grow dim . Thou seem'st to look on me , as asking why My mourning eyes with silent tears do swim ; Thou bidd'st me turn to God , and seek my rest in Him . Canst thou grow sad , thou sayest , as earth grows bright ? And sigh , when little birds begin discourse In quick , low voices , crc the streaming light Pours on their nests , from out the day 's fresh source ? With creatures innocent thou must perforce A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And holy hour like this , save sharp remorse , Of ills and pains of life must be the cure , And breathe in kindred calm , and teach thee to endure . I feel its calm . But there s a sombrous hue , Edging that eastern cloud , of deep , dull red ; Nor glitters yet the cold and heavy dew ; And all the woods and hill-tops stand outspread With dusky lights , which warmth nor comfort shed . Still - save the bird that scarcely lifts its song - The vast world seems the tomb of all the dead ; The silent city emptied of its throng , And ended , all alike , grief , mirth , love , hate , and wrong . But wrong , and hate , and love , and grief , and mirth Will quicken soon ; and hard , hot toil and strife , With headlong purpose , shake the sleeping earth With discord strange , and all that man calls life . With thousand scattered beauties Nature s rife ; And airs , and woods , and streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art to wife ; Nor binds his heart with soft and kindly ties : - He feverish , blinded , lives , and feverish , sated , dies . It is because man useth so amiss Her dearest blessings , Nature seemeth sad ; Else why should she in such fresh hour as this Not lift the veil in revelation glad , From her fair face ? - It is that man is mad ! Then chide me not , clear Star , that I repine , When nature grieves ; nor deem this heart is bad . Thou looks't toward earth ; but yet the heavens are thine ; While I to earth am bound : - When will the heavens be mine ? // If man would but his finer nature learn , And not in life fantastic lose the sense Of simpler things ; could Nature 's features stern Teach him be thoughtful , then , with soul intense , I should not yearn for God to take me hence , But bear my lot , albeit in spirit bowed , Remembering humbly why it is , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud , My solitude is sad , - I 'm lonely in the crowd . But not for this alone the silent tear Steals to mine eyes , while looking on the morn , Nor for this solemn hour : fresh life is near ; But all my joys , - they died when newly born . Thousands will wake to joy ; while I , forlorn , And like the stricken deer , with sickly eye Shall see them pass . Breathe calm , - my spirit s torn ; Ye holy thoughts , lift up my soul on high ! Ye hopes of things unseen , the far-off world bring nigh ! And when I grieve , 0 , rather let it be That I , - whom Nature taught to sit with her On her proud mountains , by her rolling sea , - Who , when the winds are up , with mighty stir Of woods and waters , feel the quickening spur To my strong spirit ,  --  who , as my own child , Do love the flower , and in the ragged bnr A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave , and go with care , and passions fierce and wild ! How suddenly that straight and glittering shaft Shot thwart the earth ! In crown of living fire Up comes the Day ! As if they conscious quaffed The sunny flood , bill , forest , city , spire , Laugh in the wakening light . - Go , vain desire ! The dusky lights are gone ; go thou thy way ! And pining discontent , like them , expire ! Be called my chamber PEACE , when ends the day ; And let me with the dawn , like PILGRIM , sing and pray . Vol. i. pp. 139 - 145* . After these quotations it surely needs no word of ours , as it has by no means been our object , to vindicate the claim of the author to what the gentle Sir Philip calls " the sacred name of Poet . " That verdict was given long since . Accuracy of observation , a wide and generous sympathy , an insight into the secret heart of things , a just judgment and ample 13* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warm and enliven , an ear for the music of language , and a mind all a-glow with the fire of thought , attest the truth to which we most readily assent . We have thus endeavored , with more care than may to many seem necessary , to give a brief sketch and analysis of these writings . They are of a kind far too rare amongst us , of a kind we hope finally to secure their large and appreciating audience . They can afford to bide their time . Gold need not fear becoming superannuated or worthless . We commend them to thoughtful students whether of letters or of practical life . Not once reading , nor twice , will be sufficient to exhaust them . Most of all will the reflective , the serious , the truly religious mind find in them abundant material for wise meditation , suggestions of great practical value , and of the most profound import ; nor will those who may dissent from the conclusious take offence , won by the beautiful spirit which controls the expression of them . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest a fault or two here and there , a rough line or an imperfect argument ; too much sensitiveness in this e*say , and something unnatural in that fiction ; but we doubt whether by any fault-finding , real or pretended , we should leave a more correct impression of these delightful writings . Our task has been more a reeable and more profitable ; - to exhibit , so far as embodied in these volumes , for the imitation of others and for the honor of our literature , the spirit and works of the thoughtful , religious scholar and poet . In conclusion , we venture to express the hope that we may , before long , be gladdened by other writings of Mr. Dana , which we have had some reason to expect , - by the Memoirs of Allston , fit accompaniment as they would be of the writings of that accomplished artist , - and the Lectures on Shakspeare , which none have heard but to feel a thousandfold the more desire to read them . We remember , too , that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the light . Have not others of still larger compass been in the mean time slowly shaping themselves , - forms of loveliness and power coming out from the dark back0round of thought and taking their places , one by one , in the solemn procession on which we and many others shall // yet look with mingled delight and awe ? Or if not so , is it impertinent in us to quote , with another application , the words addressed , in the close of his critique on Pollock , to a then living poet ? " May he , with the full sense of his responsi* bility in such an undertaking , mature well the plan of a poem , and give these his latter days to the work , having , for the strengthening of his spirit through his labors , the sanctifying dew of which Pollock speaks , - " comii*g unseen Anew creating all , and yet not heard ; Compelling , yet not felt .
