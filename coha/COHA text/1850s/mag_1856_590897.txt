txt THE EVE OF BATTLE . BEFORE we shall again have an opportunity of addressing our readers , the friends of the Constitution , and the " free lances , " the " Condottieri " of Disunion , will have measured swords . The issue is with God , and we can not persuade ourselves that he will withdraw his hand from us as a nation , and permit a people he has so signally blessed to fall a prey to the greed and folly of a party of speculators and fanatics . It is the Eve of Battle : " *rom camp to camp The hum of either army stilly sounds ; That the fixed sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other 's watch . Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighings , Piercing the night 's dull ear . Hark ! from the tents* The armorers accomplishing the knights , With clink of hammers closing rivets up , Give note of dreadful preparation : while some , Like sacrifices , by their fires of watch , With patience sit , and inly ruminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter class , to those who think , and whose minds are capable of appreciating the danger to which the success of the miscalled Republican party would expose the Union , but who are yet undetermined upon the great question which has been put in issue before the country , we desire to speak . We ask to offer them a plain argument upon State Rights : for it is the question of State Rights , and none other , which is now debated between the Democracy upon the one side and all opposing factions on the other . Disguise it by whatever name or pretext they may , the whole assault of Black-Republicanism is delivered against State Rights . They have chosen Kansas as their battle-field , and on that field as readily as on any other we will meet them . We shall not bring into the discussion the means they have adopted there and elsewhere . It is in evidence before the country that they are and have been factious , revolutionary , and bloody . Passing over , however , the agencies of blood and fire they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad cause , and leaving the pious souls who have made their pulpits the common larum-bell and tocsin of murder and civilwar , to heaven " and those thorns which in their bosoms lodge , to goad and sting them , " we shall simply present an argument to show that the position of the Democratic party , and its nominees , is in accordance with all the antecedents and principles of the party from its earliest records , and is also the only position which can be maintained by any party with honor to itself or safety to the Union . And we propose , to that end , to state its position in the boldest and most unmistakable manner . The bona-fide citizens of Kansas will ultimately determine whether it shall be a slave State or a free State ; but for the purposes of this argument , and that the question may be presented in the broadest and clearest form which the question of State Rights can ever assume under the Federal Constitution , we propose to assume that Kansas presents herself before the Federal Congress and asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to assume that the demand for admission has , been presented in that precise form which would arouse all the most violent opposition of African Republicanism and its affiliated heresies . Let us assume then , that Kansas has applied for admission into the Union as a slave State . What would be the position of the opposition ? They would argue undoubtedly thus : That the sole clause in the Constitution regulating the action of Congress is in these words , of Article 4th , Sec. 3 : " New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union. ** // 261 That the word " may " involves a discretion to admit , or to refuse to admit ; and that the discretion to admit or to reject , carries in it a further discretion to say how they will admit-.  - -  that is , to dictate the terms or conditions of admission , on the ground that the legal maxim , " cujus est dare , ejus est di*pouere " applies . That Congress may enter into stipulations and impose conditions upon a territory , because Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts upon the Territory as such , and not upon the State , and therefore does not interfere with State Rights . That slavery , and a republican form of government , which it is their constitutional duty to secure to a new State , are mora antagonisms , and incompatible with each other . That slavery is a terrific monster capable of desolating the fairest territory , and destroying the moral symmetry of the noblest institutions , and can not be recognized without committing a high crime against humanity . This , we apprehend , is about the form which would be taken by the argument of the opposition in the event supposed . It would , of course , be beautifully draped with sentiment , and adorned with rare jewels of rhetoric . But it is not with figures of speech or cant , however elegant , that we have to do . We , and the Congress of the United States , have to examine the plain and simple questions of power , right and duty under the Constitution . First then , of " power . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union ? " That is universally admitted as a self-evident proposition . Has it the power to refuse them admission ? No one will deny that it has . Yet how far that naked and arbitrary power may be legitimately exercised , is a question into the solution of which " right " and " duty " must also be admitted as constituent elements . It " may admit new States into this Union . " Into what Union ? Into the Union of thirty-one States ? Yes ! But how into that Union ? Into it as it is made and moulded by the Federal Constitution . It is not into some imatinary union-into some union the terms of whose confedera*y are loosely and vaguely set down-into a union of independent States , the powers and capacities of which are such as adhere to every body politic , or independent political association of human beings . These are not the kind of unions contemplated or described . It is into " this " Union , that is , the Fed* eral Union , that they have to admit . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . other . They have no relative existence to any other . They must then admit , if they admit at all , into this Union . That is , into the Union of these American States . And what is that Union ? It is a confederation of equals . Size , population , geographical position , create no difference . Every State is equal with every other State . Every State was sovereign and independent before it united with th' others . It had all the attributes of sovereignty which nature has established as the necessary characteristics of every independent nation . When it entered the Union it surrendered some of these , reaeiving as the consideration of the surrender the perfect guaratee of all and every part and particle of its unsurrendered sovereignty , How much it surrendered it is not necessary to : onsider , nor how much it kept . It is simply necessary to know that it defined by the description in the deed of conveyance , that is , the Constitution-all it conveyed . It is also particularly necessary to remark that each State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other State , and no more . Thus the Union is a union between equals . They were sovereign and equal before the Union . Relatively to each other , they are just as sovereign and equal after it . Now the act to be done by Congress is to admit a new State into this Union . But tlTht State , we are assuming , asks to be admitted as a slave State , and the opposition say , No ! we have the power to reject , if you do not comply with our terms . Strike the slavery clause out of your constitution , or we will exert that power and refuse admission . Here the question how far that power is naked and absolute , or how far right and duty must control and modify it , instantly arises . Can Conar*s exact terms ? We peremptorily deny its power to do so , and challenge the proof of its existence . In what part of the Constitution can they find the article , or clause , which authorizes such an inquisition into the character of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies ? In what legal manner can they thus travel behind the record ? We answer in none ! The Constitution authorizes them to admit , that is all . No power of rejection was meant to be conveyed by it . Above all , no power to impose terms , to bargain away and sell their consent for a price , and that price a different and larger portion of State sovereignty than that paid into the general treasury and storehouse of federal power by the original parties to the agreement of union . The territory seeking to become a State has no power to contract for such a payment ; the Congress // of the United States has no capacity to receive it it assented to . The Territory , being a minor , can not give a good deed ; the Congress , being its guardian , can take no grant of the property of its ward . Thus it is thrown back upon the naked power of rejection . Let us examine the extent and nature of that power. : We grant it to be " power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Nero , a Caligula , a Bajazet , to decree the punishment of virtue , or the murder of innocence , and to have his decree executed , is power . We grant it , as we would be compelled to grant the conclusion of the Dutch judge who replied to counsel , when remonstrated with , and told he had no power to do a certain act : " No power ? Gott in himmel , do n't ter fool sees I am doing it ? " So far we grant their power , their bald , naked , absolute , arbitrary power to reject . But we deny that into the idea of power so defined , and so exercised , there enters either the ideas of propriety , justice , or right . It is a simple assertion or arbitrary exercise of the jus fortioris , the law of barbarians and tyrants , and not to be pleaded in the court of the iRepublic in justification of any act of its legisla* tors . We deny that it is competent for the Federal Congress to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be rendered than that they can do it if they please . Admit the converse of the proposition , and to what dQes it lead ? Congress could decree that all things which have ever been held anci considered as maics in se , were good and pious . They have the naked ability to do it ; but is ability power in the sense either of the Constitution or of right reason ? Would theft , or blasphemy , or murder , be honesty , or piety , or philanthropy , because Congress enacted that their names should be changed mutatis mutandis ? We wot not ! Our position then is , that duty is a component part of every power of the Federal Congress , and of this because of every other ; and that the question is not only what is their power , but what right and what duty limit the exercise of that power ? Let us grant , however , for argument 's sake , the proposition of all the isms , and Mr. Senator Seward , that the power to admit implies a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit , a second discretion to prescribe terms and impose conditions . What is meant by the word " discretion " in this relation ? Not an arbitrary liberty of change . It is not equivalent to " whim** or " caprice . " It can mean nothing then but a legal discretion . Let us illustrate our meaning . If I leave my estate in trust to my executors to pay my son , in any // event , $2000 a year , and in their discretion the whole income of his share of my estate , which amounts , we will say , to $10,000 , and they choose for one year to exercise that discretion and pay him the full income , having once exercised this discretion , they may not the next year fall back to the $2000 , for their discretion is a legal one and not a whim to be exercised in a vexatious manner and to the ruin of my son . So , admitting , for the sake of argument , that Congress by the Constitution , especially by that clause which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Union , " has a discretion as to the admission of new States ; yet by every rule of fair interpretation that discretion is a legal one , and has by a long course of legislative action come to be very clearly defined . Some eighteen States have been admitted into the Union within the last sixty years . As Territories they adopted , in convention , each a republican form of government ; they had the requisite number of inhabitants , and on their application were admitted as States into this Union . This unvaried construction given , during so long a period , to the power , discretionary or not , has clearly defined it . Every settler upon territory of the United States trusts to this construction and justly supposes that when a sufficient number of settlers shall have selected the same territory , he has chosen , for their home , and framed a republican constitution , so complying with the constitutional prerequisitions , it will be their undoubted right to demand and receive from the Congress of the United States *dmission into the Union as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that admission no larger fee than was paid by the parties to the original compact of union . Having exercised their discretion in one uniform manner many times , and paid the whole income of the estate , of which they are trustees , to many sons , they are not at liberty to recede , to retrace their steps , and say to the youngest heir , we have indeed allowed your brothers their full share of the income , but we will allow you no more than the minimum . That would not be the exercise of a legal discretion , but the indulgence of a caprice . Hence even if we admit the existence of this discretion to reject , we can not for a moment agree that it involves in it a second discretion to prescribe any other terms of admission than the one made by the Constitution , namely , the adoption by the potential State of a republican form of government . For what would be the consequence ? If one other term may be prescribed , is it not clear that more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more than one ? Where will // you stop ; what boundary or limit will you fix to this discretion ? If one power may be taken from an infant State as the price of admission , may not several ; and if several , why not all ? How much will you leave her ; and what is to be the measure of your demands ? The Federal Constitution took away from each State a certain quantity of sovereign power . It took from all alike . But with that first subtraction its power to subtract ceased . A common and equal contribution was made to its fund of power by the voluntary act of the parties to it , but capacity to increase its power at the expense of any of the coparceners was not granted to it . As it was made at the beginning so it remains , so it must continue . Especially no power over the institution of slavery was granted . The primal act which instituted federal authority over any thing , debarred it with a careful distinctness from meddling with that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituent element of that very federal power , in the clause of the Constitution which prescribes as the ratio of representation " three fifths of all other persons except ' of free persons , " sec. 2d , article 3d . Thus the Congress of the United States exists now , and has always existed on a slave basis . It is idle to deny it . It could never have existed on any other , because without that provision it could not have been instituted ; and so long as a single State chooses to continue the institution of slavery within its limits it must continue on that basis . Thus the most rampant African-Republican or Abolitionist in Congress is living in a perpetual course of self-stultification and enacting an hourly lie . He is denying with his lips that man has any power to hold a fellow-creature in slavery ; and at the same moment admitting that he has the power , and not only the power but the right to do so , by holding a seat , and voting , and acknowledging as legal and valid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave compact , and assembles for the purpose of representing " the whole number of free persons , and three fifths of all other persons " - that is , slaves . Farther still , Mr. Giddings or Mr. Hale represent and accept the position of representatives of those " three fifths " just as much as Mr. Clay of Alabama , or Gen. Quitman of Mississippi , since every representative is the representative , legally , of the whole Union , as well as of a particular moiety . How will honorable gentlemen reconcile the discrepancy between their doctrine and their practice ? It appears , then , that the right to hold slaves was a right enjoyed by every one of the original parties to the Union . It // appears farther that a majority of them exercised that right long after the Union was formed . With what face then , or what color of justice shall a new State be asked to surrender that right ; or if asked , where is her capacity to do so ? When she becomes a member of the Union as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or either of the original thirteen . She can not , therefore , surrender any greater proportion of her sovereignty prior to admission than they surrendered . To use a legal form of expression , she has no capacity to make any such surrender . A territory is in a state of legal infancy , and the rule of law is , that an infant can not contract at all ; above all , a contract between a guardian and infant ward is flagrantly fraudulent . The agreement of a territory to surrender the right to hold slaves , or any other right which inures to it by the Constitution , wonid be simply a contract made by an infant covenanting to convey to his guardian a part of his estate . Such a contract is absolutely void . Thus you are reduced to this dilemma . You demand a surrender which you know the territority has no legal capacity to make , and which if made is void a13 initio ; or if it refuse to perform an act which it is not capable of performing , you refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You exercise your naked , arbitrary ability to reject , because the proposed party to your bargain is under a legal disability to contract . You parade your tyrannical power in mere wantonness . You revel in a licentious exhibition of oppression . You strut , and fume , and bully , and all at the expense of a feeble and defenseless thing which is as incapable of performing the act demanded by you , as it is of defending itself against your violence and injustice . Suppose a territory consented in advance to surrender every right into your hands , and receive back as a State only so much as you pleased to return . And if it could surrender a single right , it could surrender all , for the quantity surrendered is not the measure of the act , but the capacity to surrender at all . Suppose it did this , and you in your discretion , " which is the law of tyrants , " should give it back a miserable modicum , say a thousandth part of the rights reserved by its sister States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a " State , " a " sovereign State , " in the sense of the Constitution , and co*qual with its sister States ? Would it not rather be a kind of step . sister to them ; a sister of the half-blood , inheriting nothing more than the family name , and condemned to pine in want whilst its sisters rioted in wealth ? We think we have now fairly considered the question of power . Let us look at that of rzght. // You claim that you not only have the power to reject , but also the right . And this claim carries with it the idea of something original and inherent in the Federal Government , which was not in the original States . The creature is claimed to be superior to the creator ; the servant more powerful and of greater dignity than the master ; the machine more cunning than the hand which made it. ; the body worthier than the soul . The claim has at least the merit of boldness . And you claim that this power vests in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central , conservative power , charged with the general care of the moral as well as political condition of the whole nation . You claim that man has no power to enslave , or keep enslaved his fellow-creature ; that where he does so , a republican form of government can not be truly said to exist , and as it is your duty to guarantee that form of government to every State of the confederacy , you have a right to reject a territory which establishes slavery by its local law . This is the scope of all the argument on the side of free soil , and its affiliated heresies . Let us dispose , at the outset , of the foundation of the whole . Government is not a moral machine . All government should be , and the Federal Government of these States is a mere political machine . Since the destruction of the Jewish Theocracy no government ever existed which had the right to go beyond political and enter the sphere of moral action . That all go . verilments have gone beyond it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue . Weakness , and often ruin have resulted , but never happiness or good . This itching and unholy desire to trespass upon the moral domain , over which God only is sovereign , and to better his eternal plans by man 's wisdom , has been the spring of every heresy , and all tyranny . It founded the Inquisition ; it originated the Maine Liquor Law . Far apart as they may seem , their spirit is identical . The moment human government exceeds its just limits , as the agent of the system which guarantees and preserves to every citizen the right and ability to do every thing he pleases , which does not interfere with the exercise of the same privilege in every other citizen , and engages in an active interference with those actions which are personal , and the direct effect of which is limited to the individual - it becomes a tyranny as odious as that of the bigot Philip 's , and creates on every hand its Ignatii and Torquemadas . Our government , therefore , is a political , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the political relations of // its citizens . Their moral condition or duties are beyond its purview . Whether slavery , therefore , be in the abstract , a crime or no crime ; whether slaveholders be moral delinquents or not ; whether the institution be virtuous or vicious , are matters beyond its ability to inquire of . It is as idle for the pro-slavery fanatic to lose his time in the consideration of the moral question of slavery , and hunt up arguments to defend it , as it is for the anti-slavery fanatic to hurl his rhetoric against it . The common power to which they appeal-that is , the Federal Government-is in that relation no power at all . The act and instrument of its creation denied it the faculty of discrimination in the premises . It is restrained from the consideration of the question by the organic law . To all inquirers it can return but one answer : " I , , exist as the representative and agent of " the whole number of free white persons , " in the thirty-one States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three fifths of all other persons . " What answer will freesoilism and abolitionism make to that ? What becomes , in this view , of the foundation of their argument ? But we will follow them patiently in their argument even further . It is objected that man has no power to hold his fellow-creature in bondage , and that institutions which concede that power to him can not be republican . Now , what is a IRepublic ? " iRes communis et publica civium una viventium. " - Faeciolati . " A state in which the power is lodged in more than one . " - Dr. Johnson . " Quae ex tribus generibus illis , regali , optimo , et populari , sit modic* confusa. " - Cicero . " A State where the constitution is democratic , or the people govern themselves , either directly or by representatives . " - Bescherreelle . " A state in which the exercise of the sovereign power is lodged in representatives elected by the people . " - Webster 's Dictionary . The latter definition , at least , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitions go , we really have not the ability to see that the idea of a republic precludes the idea of different classes of inhabitants for the country in which it obtains , or of the existence of peculiar institutions in the different States which may compose it . But it is pertinaciously alleged that no man can have the power to hold his fellow-creature in bondage . This can not extend to mean that it is physically impossible for him to do so ; it must mean , therefore , that he can not do so legally . But he has always done so . What will you do with that stubborn // fact ? He has always done so under form and color of law . In whatever way slavery was first established in this or any other country , whether by violence or fraud , the fact remains that it was established , and being established was sanctioned by legal enactments . The sovereign power of states legalized it at different times , both ancient and modern . Will men say that sovereign power could not establish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they not as well say that men could consent to no other government but a republic , because all others have been founded in injustice , or consolidated by usurpation ? And , therefore , that we could not recognize as a government any monarchy , autocracy , or empire ? What would this be but madness ; what but to fight windmills , and attempt to bind the sea with ropes of sand ? The Institutes of Justinian regulate the relative rights of master and slave . iJfagna Charta protects only freemen , and by saying that " Nullus liber homo " shall go unprotected of the law , left all the villeins , or slaves in England at the mere will and mercy of their lords . Thus human legislation has always , where it was wise , refused to inquire of the origin of existing rights , when the date of that origin mounted to a remote time , and accepted them as vested rights . To do otherwise would be to act like those crazy philosophers who impeach the wisdom of God in the ordering of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make over again they could exile from it sin , and all its attendant train of misery and sorrow . In passing there is one fact , commonly forgotten by our opponents , which we should be pleased to have their legal opinion on , namely : How is it that the original coinpact , hyxirtue whereof we became a Union , not only recognizes the legal existence of slavery , but provides for the slave-trade by prohibiting the passage of any law against it for twenty years ! The fugitive slave clause is pretty direct evidence on our side in favor of the ability of the sovereign power in the state to give one man a property in another ; but this " twenty year " clause is still stronger . We say to our opponents , too , as the representative of the " learned Bellario " says to*Shylock : " Stay ! the law hath yet another hold on you . " You demand of Congress the exercise of its naked arbitrary power to reject a State because it recognizes slavery by its local law . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fugitive slave law ? If power be competent to the one because it is sovereign , it is just as competent to the other for the same reason . And here // we may with pertinency quote the opinion , in this regard , of one of our greatest lawyers : " It is idle , " says he , " to make the rightfulness of an act the measure of sovereign power . The distinction between sovereign power , and the moral right to exercise it , has always been recognized . All political power may be abused , but is it to stop where abuse may begin ? The power of declaring war is a power of vast capacity for mischief ; and capable of inflicting the most wide-spread desolation . But it is given to Congress without stint and without measure . Is a citizen , or are the courts of justice to inquire whether that , or any other law , is just , before they obey or execute it ? And are there any degrees of injustice which will withdraw from sovereign power the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our antagonists , therefore , sovereign power has no legal incapacity . Moral right can not restrain , although it should , in a virtuous government , be . always a controlling element in its exercise . But moral right is not the principle which applies to the admission of new States . A strict system of legal right already existing , and long active in defining and maintaining State relationships in the Union , precludes a moral discussion . All evidence of that nature is ruled out as irrelevant . It having been conceded as a legal right to many States heretofore admitted that they should establish or forbid slavery by their municipal or local law , as they saw fit , the precedents established govern the case of every new State applying for admission , and it is its right to be admitted , either with or without slavery , as it shall elect . This right has , indeed , now grown by long custom , as well as by constitutional privilege , to be an ancient and indefeasible one . There is another important point entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We will suppose that you have imposed this condition , for which you contend , upon the new State . What have you done ? Have you not destroyed its sovereignty as a State ? We answer , totally . The government , which any State may institute , contains only a part of the sovereignty of that State . All power and sovereignty are in the people of the State . Whatever portion of these they choose to invest their government with , so much it has , and no more . The residue remains in the people . But above all machines for the exercise of certain attributes of sovereignty , the people are always and absolutely sovereign . They can , at any time , resume the grant of power they have made , and make a new machine of government , to which they // may grant larger , or more restricted powers than before . Of this they are the absolute masters . At least this is our Democratic creed . But if it were possible for you to exact the condition referred to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , what has become of her State sovereignty ? It is gone at a puff . It is dissolved by the breath of the Federal Congress . It has no existence forevermore . Your restriction enters every individual within its limits , and paralyzes his will . It substitutes afederal will in its place . An act of the Federal Congress becomes the organic and eternal law of State existence . The people of the State may never imitate New . York , or Massachusetts , or Rhode Island , and alter or amend their State Constitution . You have exacted from them the surrender of this power before you accorded to them the ques. tionable favor which insults them with the derisive name of a sovereign State , whilst it filches from them all the attributes of sovereignty . It will not do to say they are restrained only as to one attribute of sovereignty . Sovereignty is either every thing or nothing . It exists as a perfect whole or it has no existence at all . To restrict and destroy are convertible terms in this relation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State a legal right of admission with all its attributes of sovereignty unimpaired , beyond the measure and amount given up by all its sister States already in the Union , but it is also under a legal disability to surrender the smallest particle of sovereignty beyond that which they also surrendered . Because this is a union between States equally sovereign . Introduce a single State into it less sovereign than a11 the rest , and the balance of the Union is lost . Every relationship of the parts is altered , and the whole nature of the Confederacy is changed . We have thus patiently , and we hope liberally considered the questions of power and right , granting , as we proceeded , all the weight to the arguments of the opposition which we think any well-balanced mind will allow them to be entitled to . The question of duty therefore alone remains . And we think we hazard nothing in saying that it is the first and highest duty of Congress to keep a jealous eye upon the equality of the States , and see that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many upon one , or by a majority upon a minority of them . In respect to the latter more particularly , the general rule , under which we proceed in political affairs , that the will of the majority is the proper law of the minority , can not obtain . Since there can be , in the matter of States , neither minority nor majority . Every State is // relatively to every other distinct , sovereign , and independent . A combination of States numerically greater against States numerically smaller might be a belligerent coiilition , and result in the conquest and subjugation of the weaker ; but it could never be a result of the constitutional compact . Hence it is the first duty of Congress to guard every attempt to disturb the equality of the States . All men of all parties will , we think , agree to this , as a naked proposition , since all profess abhorrence for any thing which takes the shape of interference with State iRights . We fear , however , that this duty will be neither so plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them . Let us see what those results would be . And will any man deny that if Congress has power to exact a single condition of admission from a new State , beyond the ones plainly provided for by the Constitution , it may exact as many as it pleases ? Will he deny that the competency of Congress to exact any , results from its competency to exact all ? Will he deny that if it can clip a single hair from the brow of the young Samson , it may play the perfect Delilah , and receive him only when , shorn of his locks , his whole strength has departed , and he is a helpless plaything in the hands of his betrayer ? Was not the right to hold slaves a right enjoyed by all the original States , and exercised by most when the compact of union was made between them ? How then can that be withheld from any future State without disparagement of its powers ? How can it be denied without bringing that State into the lllnion bound by an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original articles of agreement ; without diminishing its sovereignty ; without crippling and curtailing its legislative competency ; without making it just so much less than any other State by how much more you exact from it than was paid by them as their contribution to the federal coffers without placing it , with regard to the Federal Government , in a new , strange , and anomalous position , namely , with added energy infused into the latter , and a diminished power of resistance accorded to the former ; without dividing our federal system into two parts , one the union between equals , and the other a union of many equals with one inferior ? Thus the exaction of terms unknown to the Constitution , and unaccorded by the original States , would directly and on the instant destroy the equality of the States , and turn our perfect and equal Union into a confederation of States different in power , capacity , and dignity ; into an unhallowed league between the arrogance of strength upon one side // and the servility of weakness on the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve us from so great a misfortune ; and guard against it as the known and fatal tendency of all national leagues between independent states from the days of the Amphyctonic Council and Achaian league , to the pre . sent hour ? All the States which form this Union grant whatever powers of sovereignty they have granted to the Federal Government , for no other purpose than to create a something capable of guaranteeing to them the unvexed exercise and enjoyment of all their unsurrendered sovereignty . The sole use and purpose of the Union is to maintain the rights of the States in all the force and extent which the Union itself left them at the moment of its ratification by the several States . When it ceases to do this , it is a failure . The experiment has so far proved , however , that it is not a failure . It has maintained the rights of the States in all their plenitude . It has proved a perfect guarantee . It remains now to see whether fanaticism and the ambitions madness of particular men have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fountain , and damming every legitimate outlet , compress its turbid waters within unnatural boundaries , until , unable longer to control the mighty waves , they break through every artificial mound and barrier , and carry with them a wide and appalling desolation . Against a result so destructive to the Union of these States , and the hopes of mankind , the fidelity of the Democratic party to the plain letter of the Constitution has hitherto provided . Again and again it has met the shock , and broken the force of every party which threatened interference with State Rights . Once more it presents itself on the same vital issue , and asks the indorsement of the States which are indebted to it for their sovereignty so long and happily maintained , as well as for a Federal Union so long and inflexibly preserved within the just limits of constitutional powers . In the persons of James Buchanan and John C. Breckenridge it presents itself as the conservator of State Rights and Federal unity .
