A NEST OF CAVALIERS . WITH OUTLINE SKETCHES OF ITS INMATES . " Neither king nor prince am II am the sire of Coucy. " 1. - ONCE UPON A TIME . " THE GLADES " is two hundred years old . I- Its gray walls proudly crown the lofty eminence , and look serenely on the noble river , as in the days of the royal governors . The materials were all brought over from England , and the first brick was passed through the baby hands of the eldest son . The young gentleman endeavored to make his tiny fingers meet around the object , but , failing in this praiseworthy attempt , struck it indignantly with his clenched fist , and exhibited no further interest in the ceremony . Shall I say a few words of this worthy ? He was afterward known as Colonel Tom , and came near being hanged by the old tyrant Sir William Berkeley , for siding with General Nathaniel Bacon in his famous rebellion , just one hundred years before the Revolution . His name was in the black list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bland , and others ; but the old despot thought better of it . Colonel Tom escaped with a heavy fine , which forced him to sell to a neighbor-with whom he was eternally at war-two thousand acres of his finest " James River lowgrounds . " Colonel Tom was accustomed ever thereafter to use profane oaths in speaking of his Excellency , Sir William Berkeley ; a habit which he continued religiously to preserve to the day of his death . He duly transferred to the governors succeeding Sir William his peculiar views . When Lord Culpepper debased by proclamation the coin known as the " piece of eight , " he expressed his opinions of the measure with great frankness , and declared that before he would comply with the law he would cut the Governor 's ears off . It is thought that his Lordship 's invariable politeness to the Coloi*el preserved him from this awful mutilation . Colonel Tom was one of the party , however , which marched under Governor Alexander Spottswood , to discover the source of the Mississippi River on the western slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Rock Fish Gap , and then returned , in perfect order , under their experienced commander . The gentlemen of the expedition were created " Knights of the Horse Shoe " - an order of nobility invented for the nonce by his Excellency , and they still preserve at " The Glades " a small golden horse-shoe , set with garnets , the badge of knighthood . Colonel Tom never set much store , however , by this distinction . His family , he was accustomed to say , had always despised titles of nobility . They came originally from Herefordshire , in England , and were landholders there . There was some family connection with the Duke of Somerset-called " the proud duke . " The Colonel was proud of the kinship , but this fact he was far from ever acknowledging . On the contrary , he was much in the habit of maklag little of it . It was a much finer thing , be would say , to be a Virginia gentleman ; and the impression derived from his conversation was , briefly , to the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing the privilege of living in Virginia ; but rather fortunate in being kin to himself , Colonel Tom . The worthy Colonel was of a spirited and conibative character . In his heart he was firmly convinced that might was right , and that the simple plan ' ' afterward upheld by General Rob Roy was the essence of the best social organization . He believed in the " good old English rule " that the victor should dispose of the vanquished , together with his goods - or , in more vulgar parlance , that " the longest pole should rake the persimmons . " In this conscientious conviction he remained firmly established to the end of his life . Colonel Tom feared nothing and nobody , in the full meaning of the term . But there were two persons whose prowess and " pluck " he greatly respected . These were his wife and the parson of the parish . His wife was a Griddle . At that time the Griddles were one of the first families of Virginia . The male line , unfortunately , became extinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the inspiring bowl . Mrs. Tom was what is called in our own day a " tartar ; " at the period I speak of however , she was called a " vixen . " She was fond of rule . She respected greatly her own opinions . What she wished was , by a sihgulnr combination of circumstances , invariably right . She might have been the mother or grandmother of the lady who innocently expressed her astonishment at the singular fact that those who differed with her were uniformly in the wrong . It is needless to say that when a gentleman of the character of Colonel Tom , and a lady like Colonel Tom 's wife , come together there is almost always an explosion . The lady was accustomed to explode on numerous occasions ; indeed , the fuse seemed always lighted and ready to be applied . Colonel Tom rarely winced , however ; he remained in pointblank range , and defied the enemy . He would beg the lady not to injure herself , and go on reading his newspaper , affecting to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad actor ! The wit of his wife would sometimes , in the end , prove too cutting - her sarcasms would corruscate with a brilliancy too dazzling . He would hurl down his newspaper , swear that woman was made to be the thorn in man 's side , and then would retreat to his library , discomfited and overwhelmed . It was not long after their marriage that an incident similar to the well-known one in the life of John Parke Custis happened . Colonel Tom and his wife were riding out one day in a two-seated vehicle , when a quarrel commenced . They were near the banks of the river , and , in an evil moment , the exasperated Colonel threatened to drive in and drown himself and all . // Mrs. Tom uttered a mocking laugh , and dared him , declaring her ability to follow him . The enraged Colonel thereupon lashed his horses and plunged in , proceeding onward until the animals , wild with fright , began to swim . The lady , instead of being frightened , laughed louder than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beaten . With an oath , he turned his horses and drove home . He afterward declared that " pity for the weaker vessel restrained him ; " but the victory remained with the vessel in question ; and thenceforth it was observed that Mrs. Tom was more spirited and triumphant than ever . A few years ended these domestic jars , however . Mrs. Tom was conquered by an enemy too strong for her - and she had a " happy release . " The Colonel was accustomed ever after to declare that she was the noblest and sweetest of women , in spite of her trifiin* faults . But I never heard that he contemplated a second trial of matrimonial felicity . He organized a jolly establishment , and so continued to live until the time of his death . I have said that the second of the two persons whose prowess Colonel Tom respected was the parson of the parish . With a few words about this worthy I shall end my notice of the Colonel . Mr. Backrack had come from England to Virginia some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character became very soon sufficiently established . He was large of stature , fierce of mien , and assumed from the beginning a pleasing air of command . At the end of the first year the Rev. Mr. Backrack bullied his vestry , and from his lofty pulpit denounced , with great unction and agreeable particularity , the favorite vices of each and all of these gentlemen . He then turned his attention to the other officers of the church , and particularly to the clerk , whose duty it was to sit beneath the pulpit and make the responses . The clerk had opposed Mr. Backrack in some illegal claims - and there had been a clashing between the worthies on the subject of tithe-rates . The Rev. Mr. Backrack accordingly conceived the idea of demolishing the clerk , which design he proceeded on the next Sunday to carry into execution . He preached a brimstone sermon , in which he painted the sins of evil-doers , and the terrors which awaited them - wiuding up his discourse with a personal application to the clerk , whom he threatened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded from his office and prosecuted in the courts of law . Having ended his terrific discourse , he was about to give out the concluding hymn , when the old clerk , with loud and triumphant intonation , and hand outstretched and keeping time , relieved the parson of that trouble . He read : " Why doth the heathen rage , And , like the wicked , storm , And fondly beast to do the deeds Which they can not perform * " Having given out this hymn , the old clerk scowled at his enemy and sat down , amidst a smothered titter . I never heard the end of the scene , but take it for granted that Mr. Backrack mildly expressed his disapprobation of the proceeding . It seems sufficiently established that he did not break a blood-vessel . The little incident , however , which caus&amp;d Colonel Tom to respect the " pluck " of the Rev. Mr. Backrack is still to be related . I shall speak of it very briefly . A new vestry was elected , with the Colonel at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthies soon found themselves the victims of a " slight iiiisunderstanding . " At a full vestry meeting the Rev. Mr. Backrack charged Colonel Tom with illegal interference , and defied him , officially and personally . To this the Colonel replied , with great wrath , that nothing but his opponent 's cloth protected him . This produced a declaration from the parson that he was above relying on any thing of the sort , and , like David , was ready to encounter even Goliath of Gath , much more an army of pigmies . This being an allusion to the assembled vestry in decided bad taste , Colonel Tom declared the parson a blackguard ; whereupon the man of peace " closed in " with his opponent , and for some moments nothing was discerned but flying coattails , red faces , and wigs rolling about , leaving the combatants quite bald-pated . The other vestrymen came to their chief 's assistance , but the Rev. Mr. Backrack courageously engaged them all ; and when the conflict terminated , seemed as far from being conquered as ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes of stately hanteur and retire for consultation on this unheard-of indignity . The next day was Sunday , and they remained , one and all , at home with their families , taking it for granted that service would be omitted . What was their horror , in a day or two , to hear that the Rev. Mr. Backrack had appeared in his pulpit with a patch on one eye , and preached from the text in Nehemiah : " And I contended with them , and cursed them , and smote certain of them , and plucked off their hair ! " Indeed , this last boast was a literal fact . The parson had " plucked off the hair " of an exmember of his majesty 's council . This soothing recollection remained with him when , after a month or two , he was ejected from his pulpit . As to Colonel Tom , he ever afterward respected the parson , and was accustomed to say that this gentleman possessed the hardest fist he had ever encountered . * After the death of his wife the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comfort . He added to the manor-house , from time to time , such wings and outhouses as he wished - in which he was imitated by his son and grandson . This latter was Captain Tom , of the Revolution , whose portrait hangs on the left of the door as you enter the hall . This gentleman kept up the old house in the family * The anecdotes here related are literally true . // way , projected numerous additions and improvements ; and it was not his fanlt that they burdened the estate hugely . He devoted his means to the War of Independence , achieved the greatest distinction , and left behind him a glorious ihemory , together with a mountain of debts . 11. - CAPTAIN TOM OF THE REVOLUTION . Captain Tom was a great man in his day . It was he who imported the celebrated Bessarabian stock . For one of his racers , Sir Absaloin , he paid two thousand pounds sterling . He was very fond of fox-hunting , and kept a ? - ways a pack of at least twenty dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his own hands . With these he harried the surrounding country , up to the age of thirty-five , when he married his second wife . She was a Crab . The Crabs , of Crab Hall , are still well known . Her dowry was twenty thousand pounds sterling , derived from her mother , an English lady . This money the Captain devoted to the contest against England , with the full knowledge and consent of his wife , who was a woman of the ancient spirit , and hated tyrants . The Captain early made the acquaintance of Mr. George Washington , of Mount Vernon , whose career was afterward so glorious . He was at the battle of " Great Meadow , " and there received the sabre-slash which added so much to the martial expression of his jolly countenance . Returning home , he devoted himself as above related , to fox-hunting , and became a justice of the peace . In religion he was , of course , an adherent of the Established Church , and cordially despised every other denomination . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely . When he heard that his friend Lord Fairfax , of " Greenway Court , " had written two or three numbers of this periodical , he conceived a great respect for that nobleman , and declared that if he would remove to the county he would vote for him for the House of Burgesses . The Captain preserved the family dislike for English governors . He was accustomed to call Lord Dunmore a " buzzard ; " and when that gentleman removed the powder from the magazine at Williamsburg , in 1775 , Captain Tom aroused the entire southern bank of tide-water James River , riding day and night , and undergoing tremendous fatigues . His exertions were quickly crowned with success . The whole country flew to arms . A company was enrolled , at the head of which Captain Tom marched upon Williamsburg , and assisted in driving the last royal governor from Virginia soil . After fighting at " Great Bridge , " and burying Fordyce with the honors of war ( " A brave fellow , Sir ! - as brave as Julius Ca3sar ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned home  --  but only to go and join Washington , with whom he fought throughout the Revolution . He was a hardy old gentleman . When the news of the Boston Port Bill- all about the naughty behavior of the Massachusetts men - came to Virginia , he ordered all the tea in the house to be emptied into the fire , and no more to be purchased , on pain of something dreadful . Miss Artemesia , his maiden sister , a lady of romantic disposition and uncertain age , endeavored to enjoy her inspiring cup in private  --  but in vain . The Captain descended on her maiden bower - used , I am informed , highly improper expressions-and ended by emptying Miss Artemesia 's whole supply out of the window . Having performed this ceremony , he presented the vacant canister to the lady with a courteous smile and a ceremonious inclination of his powdered head , and so retired . When the 1st of June was appointed as a day of fasting and prayer for the Port Bill 's repeal , the Captain habited his entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chariot , with its six horses , all the way to Williamsburg , to attend church and hear the eloquent Mr. Price . Having listened to the sermon , he again entered his chariot , proceeded to the old Raleigh Tavern to procure dinner , and after expressing his views of the crisis at length to Mr. Jefferson , Mr. Pendleton , and Mr. Henry , returned to his home . A week afterward Miss Artemesia published , in the Virginia Gazette , her poetical effusion , entitled " A Farewell to my Tea-Table . " On this occasion the Captain is said to have kissed the lady 's cheek , presented her with a favorite riding-horse , and sworn that she was the greatest poet since Mr. Pope . It was during the Captain 's absence at headquarters that some of the traitor Arnold 's soldiers made an attack on the mansion . They ransacked the cellar , guzzled the Captain 's favorite wines , and made themselves quite at home . The fine volumes in the old libtary were piled up before the house and burnedcoats-of-arms and all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the powdered portraits , ran his bayonet through the first Colonel Tom 's nose , thereby causing that fierce old rebel and oath-swearer to present an appearance to the eyes of his descendants more ferocious than comely . Flushed with his success , the wretchedly inebriated trooper then looked around for further game . Unfortunately his eye fell upon the portrait of Mistress Barbara , of the days of Queen Anne  --  the beauty of the family , and a great favorite , when she visited London , with my Lord Bolingbroke and other noble wits and gallants . The style of dress in which Mistress Barbara was represented probably attracted the admiring attention of the trooper . Between the hare shoulders and the bare arms a strip of blue silk alone intervened ; and , speaking in general terms , the costume of Mistress Barbara was designed and executed upon a somewhat scanty pattern . In consequence , the graceful bust was the object of the trooper 's attention ; at this he directed his bayonet . Mistress Barbara received a mortal wound , which has ever since made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were some more incidents of the inroad as the Captain 's mansion at this time . // Even Miss Artemesia 's maiden bower was invaded . The closet in which her great hooped dresses and farthingales were hung up was ransacked for concealed rebels , and more than one mysterious and **32;428;TOOLONG article of female attire was pierced by the ruthless bayonet or sword 's point . The avowed object of the enemy in this was to discover the hiding-place of traitorous rebels against his Majesty King George ; but it would rather appear to have been a mirthful jest of the invaders ; for Miss Artemesia was standing by , wringing her hands , and protesting , weeping , and scolding , to the entertaining character of which exhibition she was ignorant how much she had added by unconsciously losing her wig of sunny curls . It was finally stuck upon her head , hind side before , by one of the troopers , who laughed and cheered her , and then they made preparations to depart . The only other white inhabitant of the household was little Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artemesia np stairs Kate had been the object of the amused and admiring attention of the young lieutenant of the troop . All the blood and spirit of a long line of spirited men and women flushed into Kate 's cheeks as the young officer jested with her , and she replied to him with a plainness which threw the soldier into ecstasies . A bowl of punch had been brewed in the great family punch-howl , covered with enamel and blue figures , and , having secured as much of the silver-plate as he could lay his hands on , the trooper distributed the punch , and made ready to depart . Kate was looking indignantly at him , when he turned and approached her , his drawn sword in one hand , the goblet of punch in the other . " Pretty little mistress ! pretty little mouse ! " he said , laughing , " drink this cnp to the health of his Majesty King George-instantly , on pain of death 1 " And he flashed his sword before the child 's eyes . " To your knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks flushed up , she caught the cup firmly , and kneeling , drank , with the words , " Success to Washington The trooper stared-was silent-then burst into laughter . " Game , by George I " he cried , raising the child quickly ; " you would make a soldier 's wife , mistress ; so I 'll annoy you no more . I have the honor of bidding your ladyship good-morning In half an hour they were all gone , having taken every thing they could lay their hands on . Among the rest was a favorite fox-hunter of the absent Captain's-Bogus by name-which the young officer had " borrowed . " It proved a somewhat unlucky transaction . Two hundred yards from the mansion Bogns took the bit between his teeth , whirled round , and made for the stable , clearing in gallant style a fivebarred gate which intervened . The officer was landed in a pile of stones-from which disagreeable bed he rose , after some moments , shaking his fist and uttering wrathful expressions . Nothing more came of the incident , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket his ire , and , mounting his proper animal , both he and his myrmidons soon disappeared , to the in tense satisfaction of Miss Artemesia . Kate was trying , with flushed cheeks and trembling fingers , to fit together the fragments of the punchbowl , which had been thrown down and broken . That the young lady succeeded is proved by the fact that the bowl is still preserved , the pieces having been cemented together with a mixture , the receipt for making which is an heir-loom in the family . When the " Captain of the Virginia company " heard of this outrage on his manor-house his feelings were , for a time , " too big for utterance . lie finally found relief , however , by swearing such oaths as are dreadful to reflect upon . Thenceforth the sight of a red-coat would almost throw him into convulsions , and he never met any of the British officers after the Yorktown surrender without scowling at them  --  a prcceeding which caused those innocent warriors to regard him as the most ferocious of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion was the sole event which cast a gleam of joy over the Captain 's reflections , and ever afterward the patriotic animal occupied a separate stable , built for his sole accommodation , and was attended to by an African , who was commanded to concentrate his entire faculties upon Bogus and his wants . The officers jested with the Captain on his wrathful expressions ; and even the great General-in-Chief who had been his friend , as I have said , from boyhood , alluded to it . " I think , friend Tom , " he said , " you are too much moved by this . T is the fortune of war , and the noble conduct of your little dame in drinking to the success of our great cause should make you rejoice at the incident . It is my purpose to come and see you when my affairs permit , designing to return the brave young lady my thanks in person . " Miss Artemesia had written her brother an account of Kate 's bravery , and this had been communicated to his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise of paying the visit , and Kate , who is now " grandma " at a great age , is fond of relating the circumstances which attended it , with various allusions to the visits which she paid in turn afterward to her friend at Mount Vernon . The General took her on his knee , protesting , indeed , that she was much too old to be treated so much like a child , but alleging his own gray hairs in excnse . He then solemnly and ceremoniously kissed her , gazed into her eyes with much sweetness and affection , and said that . Virginia women had always been true to their soil . He then helped papa to empty the punch-bowl , and papa , who had drunk the greater part of the punch , so that his cheeks were red , laughed , and bade her kneel and drink " Success to Washington I " // She could not , though-it seemed so ridiculous iu that way  --  and the General did not seem to wish it . He smiled , and said , " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into the drawing-room ; but not before I heard the General say , as he looked at me , " She is very like one I saw in Williamsburg the other day , on our return from Yorktown . " He sighed somewhat , I thought ; and now , children , do you know what he meant ? Your old grandmaknows all about it . When the General was a very young man , and a younger brother , he fell very much in love with a young lady , Miss - , w*o lived near Mount Vernon , his elder brother 's place at that time . Her father was very wealthy - one of the gentlemen of the old school , when they dressed so grandly in powder and silk stockings , and embroidered coats - with sleeves so bi*-I could not tell you how big they were . Well , Mr. - was a great man in the country , and the General was only a younger son ; but , for all that , he called on the old gentleman , and requested permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you believe what followed ? The old man answered , very indignantly , " If that is your errand here , Sir , I beg that you will leave my house , as my daughter has been accustomed to ride in her chariot . " The General said nothing in reply ; he only bowed , and went away . Miss - married Mr. - , and the General , a long time afterward , met Martha Custis , you know , and they made a match . Well , it was just before he came to our house that he saw his old ilame again . He returned , after the surrender of Yorktown , to Williamsburg , at the head of his troops , and the people gave him a splendid reception . There were arches , and garlands , and music , and shouting ; and I never saw any thing so wild as the multitude who pressed around his horse , trying to touch his band . The windows of the houses were crammed with heads , and the ladies waved their handkerchiefs , and almost cheered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about like the sea . The General was mounted on a great-looking horse , and his uniform and laced cocked-bat shone in the sun . He bowed to every one , using his drawn sword to salute with , gazing with that calmness , unlike any body else 's I ever saw , at the crowd and up to the windows full of heads . Among the faces in a window near the Governor 's palace he saw all at once tha lady 's whose father had asked him out of his house . The General made a profound salute with his sword , lowered it , and , raising his hat , bowed low as he passed on . The lady could not return the salute ; her a , itation was too great ; her cheeks grew pale , and she fainted . This was the " one he saw in Williamsburg the other day , " a he said to papa , and I think he always liked me because I chanced to resemble her . The young lady had committed no fault , and , doubtless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as they were uttered . But what a narrow escape she did make from being immortal ! " Well ! well ! " grandma goes on to say , busily knitting , after fixing her spectacles ; " well ! well ! all that seems a long , long time ago ! Just to think how young I was then and how old I am now ! Things have changed a great deal , and men , too , my dear . The General has been dead more than half a century . Are tbere any more such men ? I do n't think I know any . Every thing is different , and the young men are not improving . They do not show that respect for age which I should like-except my son , who , I 'm willing to allow , has much of the old r*-gime about his manners . You should have seen the General on this visit I have been talking of . He held his head so proudly erect that the earth did not seem good enough for him to walk on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cold ? Indeed , neVer ! He loved children greatly , and would to ke off his hat to the simplest girl and make her a grand inclination . He always conversed very pleasantly and sweetly ; and when he went away he made Aunt Artemesia and myself a low and profound salute , kissing both upon our cheeks , and begging us to come and see him . No no , my dear children , the times have changed ; the old race is all gone , or disappearing very fast . Pm going soon , my children ! " And grandma shakes her head , and goes on knitting . But the present household are waiting to be sketched . Enough of attention has been given to the elder days . III. - " TILE GLADES " TO-DAY . " The Glades " is a curious old place . It is built upon no settled plan , and rambles about the sunny bill upon which it stands after a fashion very unlike our more modern mansions . There is a great " chase , " as they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them dead at the top , and two great trees of the same species overshadow the porch . The great door is always open . Such is generally the case with houses in Virginia . In the present instance the heavy oak has furrowed a deep semicircle in the floor . Often the portal remains unlocked throughout the night . You enter a hall hung round with portraits in antique oaken frames . Among them you may discern at a glance that of the fierce old rebel , Colonel Tom , with his mutilated , or , rather , annihilated nose , and the fair Mistress Barbara , of Queen Anne 's time , mortally wounded in the bosom . There are many more-pictures of cavaliers and dames , in lace and powder , and piles of curls , and hanging sleeves ; the ladies in attitudes of smiling grace , the gentlemen with serious faces , looking out sedately from beneath their huge perukes . There are portraits of children , too , in colors once brilliant , but now faded from age-children who caress pet dogs , or play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to count , you will find that the pictures embrace a dozen generations . Between them are hung up great " branches of the deer , " and fowling-pieces , // game-bags , fishing-rods , and favorite specimens of the Major 's wheat , or corn , or tobacco crops , exhibited thus as trophies of his skill . The apartments of the old hail are of every imaginable size . It has a hundred passages , myriads of nooks and porticoes favorable for lovers , snug recesses , quiet retreats , and in the spacious garden , arbors covered with thick festoons of grape-vine and honey-suckle . In these localities many courtships have taken place , grandma relates . An old bench is pointed out as the scene of  --  s proposal to Miss Nelly early in the present century . Mr. - was one of the most famous of Virginia statesmen ; but Nelly discarded him , and married a handsome black mustache  --  a circumstance which she had reason ever afterward to deplore . Of course " The Glades " has its haunted chamber . Such an appendage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Robert of old days " walks " there periodically , and it would be useless to tempt any of the servants to enter it without a light . Mainmy Louisa saw the old doctor walking there , distinctly . You need n't tell her any thing about it . The furniture of the mansion is old and dark . The chairs are of oak , carved in figures , like those upon the wainscoting around the rooms , and above the mantle-pieces , if the narrow ledge in reach of a tall man only may be called by the name . The mahogany tables are black with age . The sole exception to this antique character of the furniture is a splendid new piano , which Miss Carry has induced her father to substitute in place of the wheezy old harpsichord . The Major long held out against the feminine wiles of Miss Carry , backed by mamma ; but was finally forced to yield . He takes his revenge by claiming from the young lady at least one sentimental Scottish ditty every evening- " Flowers of the Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " Katherine Ogie " - songs which the old gentleman declares in every way superior to the trivial or mock sentimental airs of our own day . Miss Carry is of a wild and frolicsome disposition . She declares that the old songs are " dreadfully stifl " her preferences being for " Sebastopol is taken , " and others similar ; but she dutifully seats herself and sings what her father requests , executing the tender madrigals of other days indeed with a pathos which often makes the old man 's spectacles grow moist . At such times he is thinking of one who used to sing them for him when he was a boy . He has never forgotten the sunny curls , the blue eyes , or the voice like the carol of a bird . The old familiar " Katherine Ogie , " and " Flowers of the Forest , " bring her to his memory as she was once-living , breathing , loving-as before that day when the violets bloomed in the grass above her grave . The Major has but slender liking for any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rising generation . He thinks that his ancestors were taller by half a head than himself . They lived in the good old times , Sir , and truckled to no one-not to the King himself . To-day , men truckle , Sir . The Major is called by his neighbors a " gentleman of the old school . " Less than twenty years back he continued to wear knee-breeches , lengthy waistcoats , and powder . It was a grand sight to see the worthy walking on the great piazza , his hands crossed behind him , his shoulders covered with powder , and his feet incased in good broad shoes with antique buckles . " The progress " penetrated even to " The Glades , " however , and before this potent enemy the Major 's old-time peculiarities of costume were forced , one by one , to retreat . First his powder disappeared , then his waistcoats were curtailed , lastly , his pantaloons descended to the ankle ; and the triumph of the present over the past , in the person of the Major , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The worthy gentleman sets his face obdurately against the habitudes of the nineteenth century , declaring , with persistent solemnity , that the age is regularly deteriorating . His manners , as I have intimated , are still rigidly of the " old school " character . When be makes his great bow to a lady , nothing can be conceived of more profoundly respectful ; when be touches his hat to the negro who bows to him , he resembles his Majesty Louis XIV . giving a salute to some rival potentate ; when he smiles and welcomes you at his door , you imagine yourself the honored guest of some old nobleman of the ancient r6girne . The Major has a fiery temper under perfect control . His sweetness of manner conceals a slumbering volcano which no one ever cares to arouse . The phenomenon has been observed but once within the last ten years . The occasion was Tom 's return from college ; and the explosion was caused by a Northern publication , violently abusive of the South , which that young gentleman brought with him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye over it , and Tom was thoughtless enough to enter into an argument to show that some of the views were founded in truth . Upon this provochtion the Major exploded . I forbear from relating the tragic particulars of the scene . It is enough to say that in ten minutes the periodical was hurled furiously behind the fire , where the Major stabbed it ruthlessly with the tongs until it was consumed ; and Mr. Tom thought it advisable to vacate for a time the apartment ; the fierce glaring eyes of the Major presenting a very disagreeable and nupleasing appearance . The storm was not long in blowing over , however . The fiery old gentleman is not implacable . He could not harbor ill-feeling against his boy . In the evening father and son had a long interview in the library , and then with serene faces went out to ride . Their demeanor toward each other was very gentle and kind , and I am disposed to think that , at that moment , Tom would have taken the life of any man born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picturesque narratives the worthies of old days rise from their tombs-they stand before you in their old dresses - they langh , and appear as they were when alive-they breathe and move as before . A thousand traits not delineated in any books are painted and dwelt upon  --  the Revolution and its colossal forms move before you as in a grand drama-you live in the iron days of old . Coming down to his own time , the worthy discourser is rich in anecdote about the leading men of the first quarter of the century . They were all " colonels , " " majors , " " captains , " or " generals , " except when they were " Jack , " or " Tom , " or " Dick . " They seem , one and all , to have been jolly old bucks , with an uniformly glorious idea of themselves ; or gay young fellows , living the merriest lives , and crying begone to dull care . The Major brings in his stories with much art-as he supposes ; but in reality with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the anecdote just related was a bona fide occurrence ? He can easily believe it , and it reminds him of a little circumstance which he chanced to witness as far back as the year 19 . No , it was in the year 18 . Was it ? Yes , in the year 18 . In 18 he and Jack Taliboys ran against each other for the House - and so on through two bottles of the Major 's best Madeira . The connection between the two incidents is mysterious , if not undiscoverable , but the story is capital . During the summer , and at Christmas , the house is full of visitors  --  to the great satisfaction of the Major , who is never so happy as when there is not a spare bed to be found in the establishment . This event , however , has never been known to occur at " The Glades . " The visitors are nearly all relatives - sons and daughters , with their children , and cousins , of whom the Major has some threescore in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins would tax an improved method of arithmetic . No one is treated with any ceremon*y ; there is hearty affection and perfect liberty ; and the days glide by like dreams . At Christmas the good Major likes a great frolic . A countless number must sit down to the broad board ; and in the evening Sandy is seat for from the quarters , with orders to bring his violin . The party then begin and dance until the next morning . The Major and his wife dance a minuet , to the great delight of the little folks ; and then , with tumultuous kisses from dozens of little maidens , they retire , making place for cotillions and reels . Thus , in the exercise of hearty hospitalitysurrounded by children and children 's children - does the honest old Major live his honest old country life . He rules his great household , his family , and servants with patriarchal affection , and has both their respect and their love . When he passes , in due time , to his long home , many tears will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 97. -F fited ; the neighbors will mourn for another type of the old Virginia gentleman passed from them , and the Land of the South will have lost one of her truest and most sturdy liegemen . May the day be far distant yet ! We have not " lost the breed of noble minds , " but can not spare the master of " The Glades . " The promise in the title to my sketch is kept . I have spoken of the good old mansion and the representatives of three generations . Here I might pause . But two or three figures more put in their claims to notice . Will you listen , good my reader , while I hold you by the button and add a few words more about these too ? " Grandmamma " sits by the fireside through the long summer days and the winter nights-a venerable landmark of the elder day . She wears a black silk gown , a snowy handkerchief secured by a pin across her brettst , huge spectacles , silver-rimmed , and a great cap , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells her old world tales . She is a living chronicle of the Virginia past . You have but to listen , and the former years will rise before you with their stately actors - the noble men of old , and the days that are dead . Once grandmamma was called " Little Katy , " and his Excellency General Washington took her on his knee and saluted her rosy cheek , thanking her for drinking the great toast to him in presence of the drunken troopers of Benedict Arnold . She will talk with you by the hour - garrulous , and running into endless particulars and details ; for grandmamma s eyes have now looked upon the world for more than fourscore years . It is the past which she rules over in right of her venerable age  --  the land of recollections and of dreamsof traditionary tales and forgotten histories . Soon she will pass from us , and a portion of the history of a vigorous race will disappear or live only as a myth . All these old stories of dream-land you will hear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicar ' affairs , attracts you , come to " Mamma 's " chamber . Do not be afraid . In our country there is no ceremony . Mamma 's chamber is as much the sitting-room of the mansion as the parlor - if you be a relative , or even a friend . You will find the good dame busy superiatending the cutting out of the immense African army 's full-cloth clothes  --  or rating soundly the idle young servant-girls - or teaching the little lump of charcoal on the cricket at her feet the art of handling the knitting-needle . To-morrow she will be busy in the spacious store-room - seeing to the manufacture of preserves , or cakes , or pickle , or going the round of the quarters , inquiring about and doctoring the sick . Mamma is a sensihle* woman in the main , but she is the victim of a deplorable hallucination upon certain subjects . She believes that the chief end of woman in this wicked world is , to read her Bible , go to church , love her husband and children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // her . What a low opinion she must have of the rights of women ! She mends stockings , instead of seeking to amend the Constitution . She " communicates " recipes to her scrap-book instead of articles to the newspapers ; she prefers the cradle to the rostrum ; and would rather be esteemed a tender mother than a brilliant genius . This is the chief defect in mamma 's character ; otherwise she is regarded as an extremely sensible woman . Shall we glance now , in conclusion , at those two youthful ornaments of " The Glades , " Mr. Tom and pretty Miss Carry ? Tom is twenty-one , and has recently returned from his first year at the University . He is a handsome , dandified young fellow , with a mustache and English side-whiskers-as yet of modest development . He has graduated already , though not precisely after an examination by the Faculty . His tickets were supposed to be law , modern languages , and mathematics . Ja reality , however , he devoted his attention to the games of " seven up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the art of compounding hot whisky punch . In all these branches of polite learning he has made a gratifying progress . But with the ardor of true genius he is not satisfied . His thirst for scientific acquisition is not quenched . He proposes to continue his arduous exploration into these mysteries for two years more . His friends already regard him with respect - his claims are not unrecognized . Some of them , however , have the bad taste to shake their heads , and ask what he will do if he is " thrown " on all his tickets ? To this question Tom replies that his " Faith is large in time , And that which shapes it to some perfect end . " Tom is literary and critical . Violently Southern , he yet takes the Northern side of the argument for the sake of a good debate . This , as we have seen , occurred once too often . In reality , no stronger Southern man exists . Tom 's literary partialities are modern . He admires Dumas , and Thackeray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , with Mr. Alexander Smith 's " Life Drama . " He has spoken favorably of a Southern work , entitled " The Virginia Tragedians , " or something of the sort-declaring that , with the benefit of a few hints from himself a remoulding of the plot , an omission of all the dialogue , a change of time and place , and a different catastrophe , the book would be an admirable performance . The author is not aware of his views ; if they were known to him he would , doubtless , write Mr. Tom a letter of thanks , and remodel the entire production . Tom does not suffer acutely from a want of self-appreciation . He believes himself destined to direct the future destinies of this Republic . A year ago he hesitated between the United States Senate and a seat in the Cabinet . At present his thoughts are directed toward a foreign mission . He has expressed his sentiments at length to a cousin in the Senate on three sheets of gilt-edged pote paper " Such , my dear cousin , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may feel surprise at this communication from a man of my age . But the world is invariably governed by young men . Alexander , C*sar , Pascal , Abelard , Prince Eugene , Pitt , and Napoleon , were all young . The old fogies are doomed . America demands the services of the rising generation . I should like a foreign embassy-say the Court of St. James ; if that is engaged , I should have no objection , under present circumstances , to Madrid . Let me hear from you very soon , as I shall have some arrangements to make . Your affectionate cousin . " I have not heard the issue of this correspondence . I presume the President is in consultation with his Cabinet . Meantime Tom has forgotten all about it . He has fallen in love . For a long series of years he remained rooted in the conviction that all the young ladies were in love with him . His favorite boast was that no girl could humbug kim , my dear fellow-he was n't green enough to get sentimental , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their flirting with him-well , the idea was ridiculous , positively ridiculous . Love was a silly infatuation  --  the thing for sentimental boyshanged if he was a green-horn . But alas ! and welladay ! " who can control his fate ? " Like some of those great conquerors of the world whom he referred to , Mr. Tom has fallen a victim . Cherry - , his cousin , has finished him . In Virginia you always fall in love with your cousin . There is an ancient statute against marrying any body but cousins . Cherry spent a month at " The Glades " this fall , and on the tenth day Tom succumbed to her dangerous eyes . He exhibits every symptom of a fatal attack . Carry has seen him walking by moonlight three times within the last week ; and in his fire-place , the servant girl found half a dozen sheets of paper covered with poetry , in which " Cherry " rhymed to " merry , " and " eyes " to " sighs . " Carry fought for them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom , however , could not " screw his courage to the sticking-place ; " he confined his demonstrations to a few disconsolate looks , and never " spoke . " The entire establishment enjoyed his state of mind , and even the Major found out how the land lay . The old gentleman shrugged his shoulders , smiled , and protested that the course of lovers at the present period filled him with astonishment . When he went courting in the good old times  --  and then came duly a long story . Yes , in his time , things were different . Tom did not profit even by this , and I have no doubt that he will soon recover from the disease , as Cherry is gone now ; so I shall say no more about it . In due time Mr. Tom will doubtless succumb , finally ; and then I predict that he will become a sober , serious , country gentleman ; reigning at " The Glades , " on his father 's throne , and bragging about the good old times when James IV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me // little space to delineate the manifold charms and attractions of the pretty Miss Carry . Still , an outline sketch is batter than none at all . Carry is eighteen . A pair of large hazel eyes look forth , with dangerous brilliancy , from a profusion of sunny curls ; that is to say , when Miss Carry permits those natural ornaments to ripple at their " own wild will . " They are generally carried back Pompadour fashion ; and I assure you that the little romp of " The Glades , " thus adorned , is dangerous to behold . When she tosses her handsome head she resembles a fallow-deer about to dart off like the wind . Carry is something of a flirt ; she has been repeatedly detected " making eyes " at her cousins and their friends . She has a dangerous fashion of passing from mirth to seriousness ; from merriment to sadness . She holds her little head as proudly as a young girl who has just discarded her first lover ; but Carry has been fatal to foer young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying to make up his mind . He daily repeats to himself , in an imbecile way , the fact , that " Either he fears his fate , Or his desert is small , Who fears to put it to the touch , And win or lose it alL " But this ceremony gives no relief . He is miserably afraid , too nervous to attempt his philosophy in practice , wants pluck , and meditates suicide . I predict , however , that Chancy will die a natural death . Charley may thus be represented as one half demolished . The four who preceded bim were discarded definitely , but under " extenuating circumstances . " The first addressed Carry , on an evening ride , when they contemplated the glories of sunset from a lofty hill . He adroitly referred to the Fairy Land beyond sundown , and said that if he possessed a palace there , " with one dear object by his side , " he would ask no more . This remark naturally led to a difference of opinion upon the subject of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking of Nannie C . Why will the more angelic half of humanity play with their adorers as a pretty tortoise-shell cat does with a mouse , enjoying keenly the agitation of the unfortunate captive ? Carry knew that Alfred would address her on the slightest provocation , and she fearlessly brought on the deaouement , enjoying the excitement . Men drink . But let us not philosophize . The " one dear object " to make Cloudland happy , heard herself identified , and murmured with a blush that - that - something ; but ( recovering her voice ) , " would always love him as a brother . " She gave him her soft little hand when they dismounted at the front door ; there was a slight pressure , like a humming-bird 's plumage on a flower ; and on the same evening the unfortunate Alfred 's disease became of a type still more alarming . Carry 's second victim addressed her on the great piazza by moonlight . He brought my Lord Byron to his assistance . His melting glances indicated the fact that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cloudless climes and starry skies ; all that was beautiful and bright met in her aspect and her eyes . A quarter of an hour after this declaration Jack - was surreptitiously overseen , by a curious young African , kneeling on the portico , at Miss Carry 's feet , and pressing kisses upon her gloves . When the criminal eaves-dropper was questioned in relation to what followed , his reply was to the effect that they quarreled-then made upand Miss Carry called Mas ' Jack her brother . Jack , however , had received his dispatches , and departed on his mission up Salt River . Carry 's third victim addressed her at a grand country frolic , in the midst of a crowd , while the " Splendid Voice " of the evening was banging the piano . He told her that he was a miserable old bachelor of twenty-one-that he wanted a dear little wife to take home-he loved her with his whole heart-would n't she marry him ? Carry blushed more deeply than she had ever been known to blush before , and her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in a whisper , discarded him . She almost forgot to tell him that she would " love him as a brother ; " and his unhappy look made such an impression upon her that I should not be at all surprised if Carry thought better of it , and consented to be Mrs. Walter . The three " brothers " duly found their affairs publicthough Carry declares upon her honor , and I believe her , that she never breathed a syllable to a soul  --  and the friends of these gentlemen are accustomed , from time to time , to tenderly inquire " if they have seen their sister lately ? " As to Carry 's fourth admirer , the girls all agreed that he was sentimental and lackadaisical , and that they never could respect a man who accepted meekly every species of insult . He paid Miss Carry great attention , and finally addressed her in church . His tone and manner were meeker than usual . Of course the temptation could not be resisted . Carry tossed her head , gave the gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an agonized whisper , to " make him happy or miserable forever , " curtly replied that she " wanted to hear the sermon , Sir ! " after which the triumphant little maiden took no further notice of him . The reply finished him . He issued forth from church in an exceedingly weak and imbecile state of mind , and was observed to hold a white handkerchief to his face . He had " a sty on his eye , " he murmured - which observation caused Miss Carry to shake from head to foot with smothered entertainment . When she reached home Carry nearly died laughing at the occurrence ; but I do n't think that the expression of her pretty face on a fine morning some months afterward indicated much amusement . Her cheeks were flushed with indignation , her pretty lip elaborately pouted , and her bright eyes darted flashes of unmistakable anger . That morning she had received an invitation to the // imbecile gentleman 's wedding , his bride being one of the wealthiest and most beautiful girls of the county . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was more . Charley , who " dropped in " soon afterward , communicated the intelligence that Mr. Imbecile had said that he " courted Miss Carry only from a sense of propriety , after paying her so much attention ; " and further , that when he issued from the church he held the white handkerchief to his face to conceal his satisfaction and smiles ! Charley offered to put the intended bridegroom to death , but Carry dissuaded him from this rash measure . She was too much mortified even to be angry long , and soon changed the subject . When she met Mr. Imbecile , on the next Sunday , she passed grandly without bowing . Such is the history of Carry 's fourth admirer . I have sported with her little caprices and coquettish ways , and told of her love affairsbut Carry is an excellent girl .. She will make an admirable wife . She loves her father and mother , and every one around her , with a depth and tenderness of affection , which indicates an earnest nature . She only takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense hoops , and all a young girl 's personal adornments . One day she will dismiss these trifles from her thoughts and become a good wife . Now , she pouts and smiles with the prettiest little air , and tosses her head , and dances on the tiptoes of her little rosetted slippers , and says the sauciest things , and teases and worries , and snubs and soothes her admirers , and even her family . In due time she will meet with some honestgentleman whom she will love , and then I predict that our little beauty of " The Glades " will make as good a wife as ever lived upon Virginia soil . So may it be ! With this brief sketch of pretty Carry I end my talk about the old Virginia country-house . It is an honest old place , and deserved thus much mention at least . If you will leave your ledgers or your books , and , shaking off the dust of the city streets , come into the serene fields , by the great river , you will discern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glades ; " and , perhaps , may be tempted to approach the hill . Once within the grassy chase , beneath the century oaks , you may feel an inclination to see the inside of the old mansion . If so , you need use no ceremony . Approach and enter . The door is not closed ; it stands always hospitably open . The Major will meet you on the threshold-he will press your hand , and in a quarter of an hour you will no longer feel like a stranger . Would you listen to the honest , prejudiced , eloquent talk of a lingering type of the old Virginia gentleman ? Ask the Major if he really thinks that Mr. Calhoun was a great statesman ? or , whether " degrees in a state " are not objectionable ? Upon these subjects you will receive an amount of information which many books would fail to supply . Would you see a good representative of Young Virginia ? " Do you like college jokes , and boundless conceit , and generous enthusiasm about Harry Clay , or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take one of Tom 's cigars , and go with him to the stables . He will show you all the horses , point out their various good points , and inform you of his views and opinions upon every imaginable subject . Or , if you are young and fond of ladies ' society , Miss Carry and mamma will talk with you in the drawing-room . Manima will not sit long , however-she has many duties to perform . Her key-basket will rattle slightly , she will glide away with a smile , and you will be doomed to a t*te-&amp;-tib*e with Carry . The young lady will make you laugh with her mirth , or weep with her tender Scottish songs . Take care ! If , lastly , you care for none of these thingsneither for politics , nor blooded horses , nor young ladies-if you are a student of the past , and like to linger amidst the sad or glorious scenes ' of other days-you have only to take your seat beside good graudmamma , and pay attention while she talks . Listen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , speak to you in its eloquent and gracious voice  --  the elder day will live again for you in all its strength and splendor . You will be a spectator of , if not an actor in , the drama which was played by giants-those men of other days who tower above the present like so many Titans . Listen , and all those noble figures will defile before you in a long glittering line-you will see their lordly brows , and clear eyes with the eagle 's glance , and firm lips full of iron resolution . The past will live again ; the former day will lie before you like a stately landscape , brilliant in the sunshine ; the stormy glories of the Revolution will burst into bloom , like bloody flowers , and you will clasp in your own-warm , throbbing , and impulsive  --  the ponderous hand whickm shaped our destiny  --  the hand of Washington . All this , and more , will rise before you , and be your life for the time , as you listen to good graudmamma , reviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other years .
