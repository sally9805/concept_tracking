ART . II . - Histoire du Gonsulat et de l'Empire . Par M. THIERS . Paris : 10 vols . Svo. 1845-.1851 . THIS work has not yet been noticed in our pages , as we hoped its publication would be completed , and that we might view it as a whole . But six years have now elapsed since the first volume appeared , and although the tenth volcrme is now before us , there seems to be but little prospect of its speedy completion . We must therefore content ourselves with what has been done ; and , indeed , the field seems sufficiently large . The volumes published carry the story from the Revolution of the 18th of Brumaire to the German campaign of the year 1809 . From a view of the manner in which this period has been treated , we may infer the spirit in which the whole work will be conceived and executed . But before we enter into any account of the book itself , we would give a brief sketch of the life and labors of M. Thiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in France during the last twenty-five years , though the system which be so strenuously labored to establish there has been overturned . He has been judged , sometimes with all the partiality with which political partisans are apt to regard their leaders , sometimes with all the severity of bitter and implacable opponents ; but no one at all acquainted with the history of the latter years of the Restoration and the reign of Louis Philippe , can deny that he is endowed with remark . able talents , and that , whether he be regarded as a writer , a statesman , or a debater , he has but few equals in France . Louis Adolphe Thiers was born on the 15th of April , 1797 , at Marseilles , of an humble but respectable family , which , during the Revolution , had been deprived of the small fortune they had amassed in trade . He was fortunate enough to obtain a fellowship in the college of his native town , and was thus enabled to acquire an education , which , had he depended on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attained . It was not long before he justified the favor which the government had shown him , by placing himself at the head of the different classes through which he passed . Napoleon had hoped , by founding these fellowships in the different colleges in his empire , to be able to educate // young men , who , at a future period , might become the defenders of the d*potic though glorious system he was so anxious to establish permanently in France . But even before Thiers had finished his college studies , the empire had vanished , and Louis XVIII . was restored to the throne of his ancestors . Finding that he could no longer look to government for any assistance , Thiers immediately left college . Ohliged to choose a profession as a means of obtaining a livelihood , after considerable hesitation , he entered his name at the Law School of Aix . It was there that he formed an Intimacy with M. Mignet , the distinguished secretary of the Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences , which has since ripened into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , nor literary emulation , have ever for a moment impaired . While at Aix , Thiers devoted himself with zeal to the study of his profession , but without neglecting mathematical and metaphysical pursuits , for which he seems to have acquired a fondness at college . An opportunity of availing himself of these studies was soon afforded . The city of Aix , desirous , like most of the provincial cities of France , of imitating Paris in literary matters as well as in every thing else , had an academy which annually proposed prize questions . In 1818 , the subject given out was a sketch of Vauvenargues , an eminent writer on moral philosophy , who was born at Aix . Thiers resolved to try his fortune , and his paper was read by the Academy , and received general approbation . Unfortunately for the author , his name was discovered before the prize was awarded ; and the judges , who disliked him on account of his liberal principles , resolved not to grant any prize , but to give out the same question for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated . With the facility which has always distinguished him , he immediately wrote another paper , treating the subject in an entirely different manner ; and in order to make sure of the victory , he sent his manuscript to a friend in Paris , who forwarded it to the Academy through the post-office . The result of this little stratagem was what might have been expected . The provincial Academy was so flattered by the honor conferred on it by the metropolis , that it unhesitatingly awarded the first prize to this essay , at the same time granting the second to Thiers 's paper of the pre // ceding year . Their surprise and mortification , on finding that both papers were by the same hand , may readily be imagined . This success gave Thiers considerable reputation ; but he soon found that a provincial town was too small a sphere of action for him . The practice of the law , with all its drudgery , was ill-calculated to satisfy his ambition . He resolved to go to Paris ; and in the summer of 1821 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their course towards the capital . The moment for visiting Paris could not have been better chosen . Six years only had elapsed since the Restoration of the Bourbons , and already , by the faults which they had committed , they had alienated the people from them . The opposition party was daily gaining ground , and was threatening the government with ruin . Manuel , the ardent leader of this party , was devoting himself in the Chamber to the defence of liberal principles . Beranger , perhaps the greatest , and certainly the most popular , of the French poets of the age , was arousing the nation from its apathy by those patriotic songs which recalled so vividly the glories of the Empire , and in-. spired feelings oC hatred and revenge against a government which owed its existence rather to foreign bayonets than to the will of the people . Lafitte , whose name is so closely connected with the government established in 1830 , had already begun to collect around him the discontented of all parties . The two newspapers which then represented the liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon became the principal contributor to the former , and Thiers , through the agency of Manuel , was intrusted with the political control of the Constitutionnel . He soon attracted public attention by the able and spirited articles which he wrote for that paper , and by the eloquent manner in which he defended , in the political salons of the day , the principles of his party . He did not , however , confine himself exclusively to politics . Like most young men , who have not yet entered on the regular occupations and duties of life , he seemed as yet undecided in respect to the choice of a profession for life . In 1822 , we find , in the same paper in which he wrote his essays on the leading political questions of the times , a series of articles on art , for which he has ever entertained , even amidst the cares of office and the harassing duties of public life , a fond love and a discriminating // taste . In 1823 , he published an account of a journey which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal object of this work was to give a sketch of the political condition of that part of the country , it contains many passages in which the beauties of nature are delineated in the most striking colors . While engaged in the turbulent political discussions of the day , Thiers had necessarily frequent occasion to refer to the speeches and writings of the leading men of the Revolution of 1789 . He identified himself with them , and imbibed their spirit . He believed , that , in the present degraded position of France , all her hopes must rest on those who should undertake to carry out the principles proclaimed during that memorable crisis . One of the principal objects of the despotic government of Napoleon had seemed to be , to blot out from the memory of the nation the recollection of the source whence it sprang ; and to a government like that of the Restoration , a revolution which had abolished the feudal rights of the aristocracy , and had proclaimed the equality of all Frenchmen , seemed the incarnation of all that was monstrous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had endeavored to regenerate France by violent and revolutionary means ; and for this purpose , he gave his countrymen a history of the generation from which they were descended . He succeeded but too well . His history of the Revolution soon made the author 's name known throughout France . In a short time , it was in the hands of every intelligent Frenchman , and contributed not a little to discredit the administration of the Bourbons , and to prepare the public mind for the Revolution of 1830 . In perusing this work , the reader should always bear in mind the object which the author had in view in writing it . It should be regarded rather as a political manifesto than as a history . Although portions of it give'evidence of the author 's powers as an historical writer , and some of the descriptive passages are very successfully executed , the reader easily perceives the work to be that of a politician , who is writing a defence of the Revolution and its principles . It is evident that the author 's intention is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , as to arouse his countrymen , and to induce them to found a government which should be based on the principles of liberty and equality proclaimed in // 1792 . A work of this sort is not written for posterity , and it is not detracting from the author 's merits to say , that it will probably be but little read at a future period . The work of Mignet , on the same subject , though it is also marked by too much partiality , will probably have more lasting value . But whatever may now be thought of the history of the Revolution as an historical composition , its success at the time of its publication was unbounded . It at once placed Thiers at the head of the opposition , or rather of the revolutionary fraction of that party ; which was at that time divided into two distinct classes . The one of which Thiers became the leader looked forward with impatience to the moment of the downfall of the reigning dynasty , as the only hope of France ; the other , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its ranks such men as Guizot , Villemain , Cousin , and R6musat , believed that a durable constitutional monarchy might be founded with the Bourbons . Both these fractions were , however , opposed to the course pursued by government ; they differed only as to the manner of their opposition . Such was the state of feeling in the liberal party when , in August , 1829 , M. de Polignac was called to the ministry , and it became evident at once that the administration was determined to resist to the utmost the just claims of the nation . It was then that Thiers , Mignet , and Armand Carrel decided to establish a paper called the National , which should protest against the reactionary conduct of the ministry , and defend to the last the constitutional charter . In this journal , Thiers treated with remarkable ability the principal constitutional questions of the day . The true theory of a limited monarchy , the form of government to which he has always been attached , and his confidence in which was not shaken even by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published by him at that time . As a specimen of his views on this subject , we translate the following extracts from an article entitled " The King reigns , but does not govern . " " We have again become involved in a discussion with the ministerial journalists concerning the form of our monarchy and the limits of the royal and parliamentary power . They make an admission of which we hasten to take notice , - namely , that in England , the ministry is always chosen from the majority in Par . // liament , and receives its power from parliament alone ; - that , in fact , parliament chooses the ministers . They add , that it is because parliament has the initiative in law-making in England , and because this initiative and the choice of ministers are two rights that necessarily go together , that the English monarchy is not the same as the French ; and thus they avoid the consequences of their admission . It remains then for us to show , that , with regard to royal and parliamentary rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we most sincerely believe . We think that there is but one possible form of representative monarchy , and that the differences between England and France consist merely in the social condition of the two countries , that of the one being still feudal and aristocratic , that of the other revolutionized . In both , the rights of King and parliament are absolutely the same , because they can not vary ; because representative monarchy , whether established in Spain , Italy , Germany , or Russia , would be in all these countries the same . t is a system of which all the different parts are necessary , and can not vary . " The king does not administer , does not govern , but reigns . Ministers administer and govern , nor can they be compelled to retain a single subaltern against their will ; whereas the king may often have a minister against his will , because , we repeat it , he does not administer , he does not govern , lie reigns . rf* reign is a noble privilege ,  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but which the sovereigns of England under . stand perfectly . An English king is the first gentleman in his kingdom . He hunts , has a taste for horses , is fond of travelling , and visits the continent , so long as he is Prince of Wales . He is even a philosopher , when it is the fashion for the nobility to be philosophers . He has English pride and English ambition developed to the highest degree . He wishes the triumph of the English flag . His heart is the happiest in England after Aboukir and Trafalgar . In a word , he is the highest expression of the Eng . lish character . The English nation respect and love in him their truest representative . They enrich him , and wish that he should live in a style becoming his position and , the wealth of the nation . The king has the feelings of a gentleman ; he has his preferences , his antipathies . He has the veto power ; he may dissolve a parliament , or refuse a bill , when things seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not govern ; he lets the country govern itself . He rarely follows his inclinations in the choice of his ministers ; he takes Fox , whom he does not like , and Pitt , whom he does ; he takes Canning , whom he does not dismiss , and who dies in office . Chatham , having left the ministry , was still , in the opinion of the Commons , the man necessary for the times . The king // sends Mr. Fox to ask him to take office " Go and tell the king , " replies he , " that when he shall send me a messenger more worthy of himself and of me , I will answer so honorable a message . " This more worthy messenger is sent , and Chatham becomes the founder of a dynasty of ministers disagreeable to the king and rulers of the kingdom for more than half a century . To reign , then , is not to govern ; it is to be the truest , the highest , and the most respected representative of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man . " Meanwhile , government was pursuing its arbitrary course , and at last crowned all its follies by the ordinances of July , 1830 , which cost the Bourbons their throne . Thiers took an active part in the events which ended by placing Louis Philippe on the throne , and the young politician was at once admitted into the councils of government . The first office he held was that of Councillor of State in the financial department . Shortly after , he was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies by his native city . In 1832 , at the death of Casimir Perier , he became Minister of the Interior . It was during his ministry that the Duchess of Berry undertook her celebrated expedition in La Vend6e . Much and well-merited blame has attached to M. Thiers for his conduct at that time . The arrest of the Duchess was undoubtedly an event which all the friends of the new government considered as most fortunate ; for with the failure of her undertaking , the hopes of the Legitirnist party were crushed until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more than questionable whether the means resorted to by the minister , in order to accomplish so desirable an object , were such as can be justified . Government being extremely anxious to discover the place of concealment of the Duchess , M. Thiers one day received an anonymous note , requesting an interview in a deserted alley of the Champs Elys6es , as the writer had important secrets to reveal to him . After some hesitation , M. Thiers went to the rendezvous , and there found a man of the name of Deutz , who offered , on condition of being well rewarded , to assist the government in arresting the Princess . This man had been in the service of the Legitimists , and possessed all their secrets . M. Thiers accepted his offer ; and a few days afterwards , Deutz , accompanied by a police officer , left Paris for Nantes , where the // Duchess then wasA . He there sought an interview with her , during which he again assured her of his devotion to her cause . Hardly had he left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the unfortunate Duchess was arrested , and Deutz was rewarded for his base treachery . It would be transgressing our limits to enter into a discussion of the question , how far a government is justified in taking advantage of the crimes of a subject in order to benefit the state ; still we can not but think , that the government which has recourse to such means must always lose something of its dignity , and lower itself in the estimation of the nation . We can not follow M. Thiers through all the varied phases of his political life ; it would be to write a history of Louis Philippe 's reign . Up to the close of 1840 , M. Thiers was several times minister , and rendered eminent services to his country . The last cabinet of which he was a member was that of the 1st of March , 1840 , during which France was nearly involved in a European war on the Oriental ques* tion , one of the most interesting diplomatic problems that had arisen for many years . This is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that time . We would only say that whatever may be thought of its prudence , it was a patriotic one . The king at first favored it , thinking thereby to acquire popularity ; but finding that it would necessarily lead to a war with the great powers of Europe , he abandoned his minister at the eve of the opening of the Chambers , and called to his councils M. Guizot . N. Thiers at once passed to the ranks of the opposition , in which he continued until the downfall of the king , though occasionally defending government measures , such as the regency bill , and the bill for fortifying Paris , when he considered them as important to the maintenance of the thron&amp; he had assisted in establishing . It was a fortunate thing for the reputation of Thiers as an historian , that he should have been obliged to leave the ministry ; for he thus acquired leisure to devote himself to the composition of the great work of which we are now to speak . The first volume of the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author has found time to publish nine other volumes in spite of the // active part he has taken in the debates'of the le* , islative bodies of which he has been a member . This prodigious activity of mind , and the facility with which lie passes from one subject to another , are among his most remarkable qualities . At one time , he may be found defending at the tribune the political doctrines of his party ; at another , maintaining , as in his work on property , the fundamental principles on which society rests . Yet lie finds time to collect the materials for his great work , and to continue its composition , not only examining attentively the documents contained in the archives , and innumerable private memoirs , and questioning such of the actors in the memorable scenes which he describes as still survive , but visiting the great battle-fields , Marengo , Ulm , Austerlitz , Jena , Wagram , etc. , of which he has given such admirahle and glowing descriptions . From his position both as an eminent politician and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had great facilities for the preparation of his work . Unpublished memoirs , family papers , public documents , all have been alike accessible to him . There are hut few published works of high authority on the period which he has treated . Except the Lemoirs of Napoleon himself , which of course throw much light on his administration and his campaigns , and those of General Jomini , the Dukes of Ga*ta , Rovigo , and Albufera , and the interesting work of Thibaudeau on the Consulate , there has been hut little published which could be of much use to any one writing such a work as that of Thiers . But the manuscript memoirs of Jourdan , Macdonald , Davoust , Cambac6r*s , etc. , have been of inestimable value to him . There is , perhaps , another source , more available than any of those mentioned ; we mean the correspondence of Napoleon with his generals and ministers , or diplomatic agents . Five or six marshals ' usually conimanded an army under his orders , and of course were constantly writing to him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the enemy* or to give an account of the condition and disposition of the troops under their command . Napoleon , in his answers , expressed his wishes and plans , his opinions , his approbation or disapprobation of what had been done . The same sort of relations existed between the Emperor and the other branches of the administration . Napoleon , // indeed , was so much in the habit of giving his instructions in writing , that it was only when in presence of the enemy , and when there was danger of any written communication being intercepted , that he gave them verbally . Even when in Paris , he communicated almost entirely in writing with his ministers . He dictated , with astonishing rapidity , sometimes a hundred letters a day , on the most varied topics . As an instance of this , when at Osterode , in Poland , in 1807 , he wrote on the same day to the Minister of Police at Paris , concerning those persons whom he was to watch with special care ; to Cambac&amp;*s about the affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Naples , and to Louis , King of Holland , on the art of governing new subjects ; to Madame Campan on female education ; to Murat on the organization of the cavalry ; and to M. Berthollet , for whom he had much regard , for the purpose of sending him fifteen thousand francs to enable him to settle his private affairs . There exist in Paris no less than forty thousand letters or orders signed by him . All these documents were kept among his private papers . In 1814 , the Bourbons , not knowing what to do with this mass of papers , had them transported to the Louvre , where they still remain . It may readily be imagined what interest they must possess for the historian of that period , and what additional value they must lend to his writings . Yet , in the hands of an ordinary writer , even such materials would he of little value . Without a master-mind to select and arrange them , to distinguish what is important from the unimportant , to ascertain when credit is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rejected as untrustworthy , they would form but an undigested and confused mass , devoid of interest . In order to be made generally useful , they could not have fallen into better hands than those of Thiers . He has become penetrated with the spirit of all these documents , rather than with their details ; he never says more than he ought on any subject , and the abundance of his materials never tempts him to overstep the limits of history . The work , indeed , is composed with all the severity which the importance and grandeur of the subject demand . The manner in which the different parts are arranged is admirable . Each book bears the title of the principal event or 25* // subject of which it treats , and around it are grouped with infinite art the minor events or circumstances which have a natural bearing on it . This arrangement is so simple , that , at first , the reader is not aware how much it contributes to the pleasure which the book affords and to the ease with which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general division of a subject according to this method ; the great art consists in selecting , among the minor details , those which belong more especially to a certain part of the subject . The art of thus presenting the events which he relates in their most logical order and connection is one of the great merits of this work , and shows at once that the historian has taken a part in the active life of a statesman . It is only by this means that one is enabled to take a comprehensive view of a historical subject , and to see at a glance the relations which exist between its different parts . Any one can be methodical by simply following the external order of events ; to be clear and logical , it is necessary that they should he presented in their more philosophical and less apparent connection . The history of the Consulate and Empire begins at the point where that of the Revolution ended ; the coup d ' etat of the 18th Brumaire . The author 's only allusion to himself is at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fifteen years have elapsed since I traced the annals of our first Revolution . Those fifteen years have been passed amidst the storms of public life . I have seen the fall of an ancient throne , the erection of a new , one . I have seen the French Revolution pursuing its invincible course . Although the scenes which I have witnessed have caused me but little surprise , I have not the vanity to suppose that I had nothing to learn from the experience of men and affairs . I am confident , on the contrary , of having learnt much , and of being , consequently , more fit to understand and to relate the great things which our fathers did during those heroic times . But I am certain that experience has not chilled within me the generous sentiments of my youth ; I am certain that I love as much as I ever did the liberty and glory of France. * , It is , of course , not our intention to give an analysis of this work . To do so would be but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one is familiar . We may better meet our readers ' views by considering one or more of the topics of which it treats . To us , the most attractive portions of this work are those in which questions of internal policy and of diplomacy are treated . The narratives of those great campaigns in which France acquired everlasting renown are admirably written ; they present the details of the subject with a clearness and force which could hardly be expected from any but a military man ; they not unfrequently are highly eloquent . But however captivating they may he , it is not in them that we seek for the true interest of history . We turn to those portions of the work in which the author explains the internal organization of France , the complicated negotiations which ended in the signing of the Concordat , or the dissensions in the Council previous to the promulgation of the Code Napoleon . In these , the true greatness of Napoleon is revealed . Glorious as was his military career , we believe that he showed more real greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as the hero of Marengo or Austerlitz . It is often said in disparagement of Napoleon , that he founded nothing . Even M. de Lamartine , in his recent history of the Restoration if a political pamphlet , written to defeat the ambitious schemes of the President of France , may be called a history - repeats this old and absurd calumny . Of his conquests , nothing , it is true , remains . Like a mighty river , which , after it has overflowed and devastated large tracts of country , is obliged , by that invisible power which said to the waters , " Thus far shalt thou go , and no farther , " to return to its ancient bed , so France , after having overrun the greater part of the European continent , was compelled , by that same power , to confine itself within its former limits . But if nothing is left of the territorial conquests of Napoleon , the internal administration of France , the Code , the many establishments founded by him for scientific or literary purposes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain as monuments of his genius . As a military man , he probably has had equals . Hannibal , C*sar , or Frederic may compete with him ; but as a man , combining military talents of the highest order with the wisdom of a statesman , a legislator , and a sovereign , he stands alone in the history of the world . // It required , indeed , a genius like that of Napoleon , to reorganize France after the convulsions through which she had passed . When he was appointed First Consul , every thing was in confusion ; the country was impoverished , the administration weak and divided , ti ) e judiciary badly organized . The first thing to be done , then , was to remedy these evils . Accordingly , as soon as the legislative Vodies established by the new constitution had commenced their labors , he proposed to them two bills of the greatest importance , - the one relating to the administration of the country , the other for the reorganization of the judiciary . These bills were passed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has resisted all the storms by which France has since been agitated . In establishing the new system , Napoleon 's object was to form a strong central government , on which the departmental administrations should be almost wholly dependent . The constitution had placed at the head of the state an executive , formed of three consuls , in one of whom all the power was in reality vested ; by the side of this executive was the legislative power , divided into several deliberative assemblies . So , at the head of each department , Napoleon placed an executive officer appointed by the government , called a prefect , whose duty it was to execute the orders of the general government , and , at the same time , to administer the affairs of the department with the advice and consent of a council elected by the people . Each department was divided into arrondissements and communes . At the head of each arrondissement , composed of a certain number of communes , was placed a sub-prefect . Finally , at the head of the commune itself was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefect , and consequently on the head of the state in all government affairs , but the agent of the commune itself , and acting for it , with the advice of the municipal council , in all matters that related exclusively to it . " Such , " says M. Thiers , " is the admirable hierarchy to which France owes an administration incomparable for energy and precision in its action , for the accuracy of its accounts , and which is so excellent that it sufficed , in six months , to re*Sstablish order in France . " It can not be denied , that , for the object which Napoleon had in view , - that of establishing a strong government , - // nothing could have been more wisely planned than this system . That it should have taken so firm root in the country as to form , at the present day , one of the most serious obstacles to the establishment of a republic which may truly deserve the name it hears , seems to he a strong proof of that admirable knowledge , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French nation . Yet the pernicious consequences of such a system are too numerous to be overlooked . The whole nation is kept in a state of constant dependence on govern rnent . The Minister of the Interior and the Council of State , in fact , decided on all the internal affairs of the various departments throughout France . A mine can not be explored , a marsh drained , a road laid out , or a factory built , without the authority of the minister and council . The people came at last to look to government for protection and assistance on every occasion ; and in order to enable the government to grant such assistance and protection , it is necessary that it should wield a power nearly akin to despotism . For Napoleon 's object , this was desirable ; but now that France is seeking to establish a republic , this system is found to clash with its desire and to prevent its fulfilment . The system is , indeed , fit only for a monarchical form of government . It commences with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor , or king , - it matters little . He is the type to be reproduced through all the different stages of the administrative scale ; in the prefect , the sub-prefect , and the mayor . The republican system is entirely different . Instead of commencing with the head of the government , and descending to the inferior executive officers , the republican hierarchy - if we take our own republic as the model - may be said to commence at the bottom of the scale , with the town governments ; thence it rises to the state governments , and finally ascends to the chief magistrate . Before a republican government can be firmly established in France , she will have to modify her whole administrative system . These remarks must not be understood as detracting from the merit of Napoleon in organizing the administration as he did ; for , as we have already said , nothing could be better conceived for the object which he desired to accomplish . // The reorganization of the judicial system proposed by Napoleon , and adopted by the legislature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested against the administrative system . In each arrondissement was established a court called Tribunal de premi3re Instance , from which there was an appeal to a superior tribunal , called the Tribunal d'Appel , of which twenty-nine were established . Criminal causes were to be tried by juries , and by one of the judges of the Cour d'Appel , thus forming what was called a Gour d'Assises . At the summit of the whole judicial system was to be maintained the Gour de Cassation , which had already been established . The object of this tribunal was not to try again a cause already tried by the Tribunal de premiire Instance , or the Cour d'Appel , but merely to decide , in doubtful cases , whether the law had been properly applied . This system has been maintained in France , with slight modifications , ever Since its adoption in 1800 , and has been found admirably adapted to the wants of the nation . Several other important laws were at the same time proposed , in order to improve the financial condition of the country ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may mention the establishment of the Bank of France , with a capital of thirty millions . But we must refer the reader to the work itself , if he would have a complete idea of all the measures adopted at that time , for the purpose of restoring order in a country so thoroughly disorganized as was France after the storms of her Revolution . It is almost impossible to analyze his clear , and at the same time condensed , account of that wonderful period . Napoleon was wise in devoting his first thoughts to the reorganization of the country ; for hardly had the essential measures which he proposed been adopted , hardly had he put an end to the civil commotions which were still raging in Vend6e , when war once more broke oUt . We shall not attempt to follow M. Thiers in his descriptions of the battles of Ulm , Genoa , Marengo , Heliopolis , and Hohenlinden , or in his account of the peace of Luneville , the armed neutrality of the maritime powers , or the negotiations which led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1801 . We can not , however , resist the pleasure of translating the eloquent passage by which the historian closes the account of the effect produced in England by the news of the peace . // " During this period , unfortunately so brief , the English nation almost thought they loved France ; they admired the hero and statesman by whom she was governed ; they cried with enthusiasm , Long live Bonaparte . ' Such is human joy ! it is great and deep only when we are ignorant of the future . Let us thank God for his wisdom in closing to the eye of man the book of destiny . How every heart would have been chilled on that day , if the veil which concealed the future had suddenly dropped , and the English and French bad seen before them fifteen years of implacable hatred and bitter war , the continent and the seas red with the blood of both nations ! How terrified would France have been , if , while she believed herself so great , she had dimly seen in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hero , victorious and moderate as he was , what would have been his surprise and terror , if , in the midst of his greatest works , he could have foreseen his immense errors ; if , in the midst of unmingled prosperity , he could have anticipated his downfall and his martyrdom. ! Oh yes ! Providence has done well , in his impenetrable wisdom , to disclose only the present to man . The present is enough for his weakness . And we , who know all that then happened , and what has since happened , let us try , for a moment , to revive the ignorance of that period , in order to understand and to share its deep emotions . " Having thus , made peace with all the temporal powers of Europe , Napoleon turned his attention to the affairs of the Church , and commenced those ne0otiations which ended by the signing of the Concordat , and the reestablishment in France of the Catholic Church . " The views of the First Consul on the constitution of society , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book , " were too just and too profound for him to regard with indifference the religious disorders of France at that period . Every human society needs a religious faith and a public worship . Man , thrown into the midst of this universe , without khowing whence he comes or whither he is going , why he suffers , or even why he exists , What recompense or what punishment is reserved for the long agitations of his life , beset by the contradictions of his fellow-men , who tell him , some , that there is a God , an intelligent and consistent Being , author of all things , others , that there is none ; some , that there exists a right and a wrong , which are to serve as the rule of his conduct ; others , that there is neither right nor wrong , that they are merely inventions of this world ,  --  man , in the midst of these contradictions , feels the absolute , the irresistible , necessity of forming a firm belief on all these points . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he forms one . Everywhere , at all times , in all countries , in antiquity as in modern times , in civilized as in barbarous countries , man is found bowing before some altar . Where an established faith does not reign , a thousand sects , eager for controversy , as in America ,  --  a thousand disgraceful superstitions , as in China , - agitate or degrade the human mind . Or if , as in France in 93 , a passing revolution destroys the ancient religion of the country , man , at the very moment when he has taken a vow no longer to have any belief , soon gives himself the lie , and the insensate worship of the Goddess of ileason , established by the very side of the scaffold , proves that this vow was as vain as it was impious . To judge him , then , by his ordinary conduct , man needs a religious belief . What can be more desirable for a civilized society than a national religion founded on the true sentiments of the human heart ; according with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and which , without intolerance or persecution , may unite , if not all , at least the majority , of the citizens at the foot of an ancient and respected altar . Such a belief can not be invented , where it has not existed for ages . Philosophers , even the most sublime , may create a philosophy , and agitate , by their learning , the age to which they do honor ; they may make you think , they can not make you believe . A warrior , covered with glory , n-my found an empire ; he can not found a religion . That , in former ages , philosophers or heroes , by attributing to themselves relations with heaven , have taken possession of the mind of nations , and imposed a belief upon them , may be true . But in modern times , the creator of a new religion would be held as an impostor . Surrounded by terror , like Robespierre , or by glory , like Bonaparte , he would be an object of ridicule . In 1800 , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary than to raise again that altar of St. Louis , of Charlemagne , and of Clovis , for a moment overthrown ? General Bonaparte , who would have been ridiculous if he had attempted to appear as a prophet and the teacher of a new revelation , was fulfilling the part which Providence assigned him , by raising with his victorious hands that venerable altar , and by bringing back to it those who for a short time had strayed away . Only such glory as his could have sufficed for such a work . Great geniuses , not only among philosophers , but among kings , like Voltaire and Frederic , had thrown contempt on the Catholic religion , and for fifty years givbn the signal for scoffing . General Bonaparte , who had as much mind as Voltaire , and more glory than Frederic , could alone , by his example and by his respect , put an end to the mockery of the last century . " Is it necessary with such motives as those which guided him , to inquire whether he acted from religious faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wisdom ; that is to say , in virtue of a profound knowledge of human nature . That suffices . The rest is a mystery which curiosity , always natural with regard to a great man , may seek to penetrate , but which is of little importance . We may , however , say on this subject , that General Bonaparte 's moral constitution inclined him towards religious thoughts . A superior mind is struck , in proportion with its superiority , with the beauties of creation . It is intelligence which discovers intelligence in the universe ; and a great mind is more capable than a little one of seeing God through his works . General Bonaparte frequently disputed on religious and philosophical subjects with Monge , Lagrange , and Laplace , men whom he honored and loved , and often staggered them in their incredulity by the clearness and original vigor of his arguments . To this we must add , that , brought up in an uncultivated and religious country , under the eye of a pious mother , the sight of the old Catholic altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a lively and great imagination . As for ambition , which some of his detractors have assigned as the sole motive of his conduct on this occasion , he at that time had none other than to do good ; and without doubt , if he saw , as a recompense of this good when accomplished , an increase of power , he may well be pardoned for it . The ambition which seeks to found an empire on the satisfaction of the true wants of a people , is the most noble and legitimate ambition . " Of all the plans which the First Consul had formed for the regeneration of France , none was more difficult to realize than this reconciliation with the church . At the time of the adoption of the new constitution , the utmost confusion reigned throughout the country with regard to religion . The Catholic religion was , it is true , tolerated ; but the members of the clergy were divided among themselves . Some of them had taken an oath of allegiance to the civil constitution ; others had merely sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused all connection with the government . The two former classes alone were allowed to perform mass in the churches the latter officiated in private houses , and were , by all those who kept up their ancient opposition to all revolutionary governments , regarded as the only true ministers of the Catholic church . To complete the disorder caused by these divisions in the church itself , the sect of the Theophilanthropists had taken possession of the vacant churches , where they performed ceremonies in honorof the various virtues ,  --  courage , // temperance , charity , etc . The frequent imitations of Catholicism to be found in the ritual of that sect , whilst it was striving to establish a new religion , would be simply ridiculous , were it not that the subject is one of such serious importance . Such was the religious state of the country in 1,800 . Napoleon resolved to deliver it from this condition . That he should have succeeded in the attempt in spite of the opposition with which his views on the subject were met by the leading men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making any compromise with Rome , the government would lose something of its dignity , must be considered as one of his greatest achievemeats . There was , indeed , no absurd proposition that he was not obliged to listen to and to combat . Some proposed that he should make himself the head of a French church ; others advised him to embrace the Protestant faith , and to lead France to Protestantism by his example ; others , again , entreated him not to meddle with the religious affairs of the country . Nothing can be more interesting than the discussions of Napoleon , as they are given by Thiers , with those who thus sought to turn him from his purpose . Napoleon was , indeed , the only man in the French government who really wished for the re*3stablishment of Catholicism in France . This was well understood at Rome . " Let us not irritate that man , " said Cardinal Caprara to the Pope ; " he alone is on our side in a country where every one else is against us . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered opposition to the realization of his wishes . The plan which he proposed for the reconciliation of France with the church of Rome was much discussed at Rome itself ; and it was not until after long and arduous negotiations , that Napoleon succeeded in having it adopted . He undertook to bring about this reconciliation without sacrificing any of the principles of the Revolution . The clergy was to be reI*stablished , not on the same terms on which it had existed prior to 89 , but on an entirely new basis . It was to be exclusively devoted to the exercise of its religious functions ; it was to have neither political power , nor large domains ; its members were to be appointed by the government and confirmed by the Pope ; they were to receive their salary from the state . The number of dioceses was to be reduced ; the civil authorities were to have the control of public worship ; // the jurisdiction over the clergy was to belong to the Council of State . Such were the principal measures proposed by Napoleon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. vail upon the Pope to adopt , was that relating to the dioceses . By reducing their number , many of the former occupants of the episcopal sees would be obliged to resign their func* " tions , or to be dismissed by the Pope , - a thing unheard of in the annals of the church . Napoleon , by his indomitable will , gained his point . He had , too , it must be confessed , a great advantage over the court of Rome . Being , as we have said , the only member of the government who favored the reconciliation with the church , he knew that Rome ought to yield to his desires . Nor was this feeling concealed from those with whom he negotiated . One day , during the protracted discussion to which the subject gave rise , growing impatient at some of the demands of the papal legate , . " Come , Cardinal Caprara , " said he , " do you still possess the power of performing miracles ? do you ? If so , make use of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , leave matters to me ; and since I am reduced to human means , permit me to act as I see fit to save the church . " The Concordat was signed on the 15th of July 1801 , but was not finally adopted and ratified until the following spring . On the 18th of April , 1802 , the Concordat was solemnly pub lished in Paris , and the first religious ceremony was performed in the cathedral of N*itre Dame . This great act , perhaps the greatest which the church of Rome ever adopted , was thus definitely concluded . To complete the pacification of France , this important measure was followed by the law re . calling the banished emigrants . The next subject to which the First Consul turned his attention was public education . A law on this subject was drawn up , and presented to the Council of State , who soon after adopted it . This law , with some modifications , forms the basis of the whole educational system of France as it still exists . This step closed the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To recompense him for the services he had rendered the country , the nation resolved to give him a signal mark of its confidence , by appointing him Consul for life , with the power to name his successor . The senate waited on him in a body , to announce to him the new // honor which had been conferred on him . Bowing to the members of that body , he replied in these noble words : - " The life of a citizen belongs to his country . The French nation wish that the whole of mine should be devoted to them . I obey their will . By my efforts , and by your assistance , citizens , by the confidence and the wish of this great nation , the liberty , equality , and prosperity of France will be protected from the caprices of fate , or the uncertainty of the future . The best of nations will then be the happiest , as it is worthy of being , and its happiness will contribute to that of the whole of Europe . Satis. fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom all kings emanate , to bring back on earth order , justice , and equality , I shall hear my last hour strike without regret , and without uneasi* ness as to the opinion of future generations . " To close this period , the finest in Napoleon 's career , and one of the most brilliant in the world 's history , we can not do better than to transcribe the eloquent passage in which our author ends the third volume of his history . Now , if , forgetting what has since happened , we imagine for a moment this Dictator , necessary at that time , remaining as moderate as he was great , uniting those opposites which God , it is true , had never before united in one man , - that vigor of genius which constitutes the great Captain , with that patience which is the distinctive characteristic of founders of empires , - calming , by a long repose , French society then so agitated , and preparing it little by little for that liberty , the honor and want of modern society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeasing instead of irritating the jealousy of Europe , changing into a permanent political fact the negotiations of Amiens and Lun*ville , and seeking at last , no matter where , the most worthy successor , in order to give into his hands this reorganized France , prepared for liberty , what man would ever have been equal to him ? But such a man , a warrior like Cresar , a statesman like Augustus , and virtuous as Marcus Aurelius , would have been more than a man ; and Providence does not give the world gods to govern it .
