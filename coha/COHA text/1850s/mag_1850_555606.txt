txt ART . V. - Lectures on Subjects connected with Literature and Life . By EDWIN P. WHIPPLE , Author of " Essays and Reviews . " Boston : W. D. Ticknor &amp; Co. 1850. l2mo. pp. 218 . MR . WHIPPLE may now fairly be called the most popular essayist in this country ; and he has substantial merits which go far to justify the favor with which his writings have been received . To a large acquaintance with English literature , a prompt and retentive memory , a lively fancy , and considerable wit , he joins the brisk and smart exuberance of style which is the most agreeable quality of the essayist , and the most essential to his success . His command of expression is almost marvellous ; he showers words upon the page with a prodigality that astonishes the lean  --  and bare scribblers who , after painful search and with many contorsions , clothe their shivering thoughts in scant and inappropriate garments . He revels in the abundance of his wealth , and changes his rich costume so frequently and swiftly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dress , or is substituting words for thought . Yet the suspicion would he groundless . The expression , though lavish and ornate , is almost invariably clear , pointed , and precise . Because he has a large store to choose from , the word selected is just the appropriate word , conveying the precise idea that the writer wishes to impart , without distortion or indistinctness . Mr. Whipple 's essays , therefore , form easy and luxurious reading . We are not obliged to pause and dwell upon a sentence before we can detect its meaning , or discern its connection with what precedes and what follows in the train of thought . The essayist does not aim at complete and elaborate inves // tigations ; he touches upon many subjects , but exhausts none . He has no excuse , therefore , for tiring the reader with wiredrawn disquisitions , complex processes of argumentation , painful collections of facts , or a mere farrago of other men 's ideas . He is at liberty to skip all that is tedious in the exhibition of his theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to most of his readers . He is bound not to be dull , feeble , or common-place , but he is not obliged to be methodical , far-reachin * , or profound . He is a gleaner on the fields of thought , and is expected to bring into barn only what the regular reapers have left behind them . Still he must bring wheat , and not tares ; he must gather what the husbandmen have overlooked , or what has dropped from their wearied arms , not what they have intentionally left to decay . We look to the quality , not the quantity , of the collection that he has made , and are grateful to him for any addition , however slight , that he may make to the sum of knowledge , the means of entertainment , or the materials of thought . The aggregate of good done by many laborers in this department of effort may be considerable ; English literature would lose much of what is most entertaining and valuable in it , if the productions of all the essayists were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are some minds - Lord Bacon 's and Dr. Johnson 's , for instance , judging the latter , however , only from his conversations - the mere drippings of which are of more worth than the full flow of other men 's thoughts . We prize both the essays of the former and the talk of the latter for the acuteness and originality displayed in them , and never think of censuring them for not looking at all sides of a subject , or not exhausting all that can be said upon it . It is often a greater mark of genius to be able to say something that is new and striking upon a very trite theme , than to spread out a more novel topic in all its breadth and variety . These considerations , which in themselves are sufficiently obvious , are very necessary to be kept in mind in passing judgment upon such a volume as Mr. Whipple has just published ; as we might otherwise unfairly accuse him of presumption in selecting ambitious but hackneyed topics for his Lectures , or of superficiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little book of about 200 pages , which professes to // treat of " subjects connected with Literature and Life , " subjects which are subsequently specified as follows - Authors in their Relation to Life , Novels and Novelists , Wit and Humor , the Ludicrous Side of Life , Genius , and Intellectual Health and Disease . Volumes might be written upon any one of these themes ; but we doubt whether they would be half as entertaining as these slight but spirited essays . Of course , they are " Lectures " only in name , that appellation being given to them because they were written for the purpose of delivery before a literary association in Boston , and also before several of the lyceums in our country towns . The miscellaneous character of the audiences to which they were addressed made it necessary to treat familiar topics , and imposed some restrictions upon the writer in regard both to the selection of his materials and the characteristics of his style . He could not wing a very lofty flight without passing beyond the range of vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had also too much good sense to hug the ground from an affected desire of accommodating himself to their perceptions . He does not pay his audience the poor compliment of telling them , by implication at least , that he is making an effort to keep himself down to the level of their apprehensions . Confiding in the general transparency of his style and in the obviousness of the associations in his trains of thought , he writes frankly and naturally , without any painful reference to the tastes or powers of his auditory . Some of the literary criticisms interspersed in these Lectures relate to books which most of his hearers probably had never seen : many of the allusions to facts in literary history could not have stirred their recollections . And yet , the fact that these performances were received with applause by such an audience as can be collected in any of our small villages , bears honorable testimony both to the tact of the speaker and to the general cultivation of the people of New England . The chief negative merit of these essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer is not bitten with a pestilent desire of playing any other part than that for which nature has designed him . He is neither a pedant , a sentimentalist , nor an enthusiast ; though he has the taste and feelings of a poet , the gleams of a very rich fancy often irradiating the substance of his prose , he does not fly off into // rhapsodies , or die away in ecstacies . His vigorous common sense and quick perception of the ludicrous guard him effectually from such follies , and he launches some keen shafts of ridicule against those who are guilty of them . He does not belong to the modern school of political philanthropists , and has no universal nostrum to recommend as a cure for all the evils with which society is afflicted . He is not possessed by one idea , but looks round the whole horizon of truth , and welcomes the light which comes to him from any quarter. * There is a pervading air of kindliness and good nature in his estimate both of books and men ; if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his laugh is genial , leaving no trace of party prejudice or personal animosity . This negative praise may not seem a high compliment either to his disposition or his talents ; but the faults of pretension , cant , and savageness infect so much of the popular fugitive literature of the present day , that it seems to us no small merit in an author to be entirely free from them . Of all the later English essayists , Mr. Whipple may most properly be compared with Hazlitt , whom he closely resembles except in this very point of his imperturbable good humor . Hazlitt was a soured man , who had quarrelled with the world , and was disposed to avenge his supposed wrongs on every person who crossed his path . He was a savage politician , and many of his essays on public affairs show the concentrated energy of hate . But his perception of the beauties of literature was as keen as his perception of personal wrong . His taste was formed by diligent study of the writers of the Elizabethan age , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manifested a degree of critical insight and a power of metaphysical analysis which have seldom been surpassed . Felicities of expression stud his page as frequent as the stars in the evening sky . When he wholly forgets himself and his supposed injuries , he is delightful , though he has none of the sly humor of Lamb , and but little of the affectionateness and simplicity of Leigh Hunt . Mr. Whipple reminds us of him at every turn , especially in his fondness for the use of metaphysical terms in criticism . The ordinary resources of the critical vocabulary are not enough for these two writers ; they carry the analysis so far that they are obliged to give the results in phraseology borrowed from // another science . They are constantly striving to fix evanescent beauties upon the page , to mark vanishing lines of difference , and to describe in words what can only be felt . This detracts somewhat from the naturalness of their style , though it does not injure its transparency ; they are both too great masters of English idiom ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hazlitt often wrote narrative , and we wish Whipple would follow his example ; for his style now too frequently creams like sparkling , but very light ale , which lacks body . Thought always lies beneath , but it is often subtile and over-refined thought , or a playful repetition of one idea , which is meant to tickle the reader 's fancy after it has satisfied the demands of his intellect . Rapid , vigorous , and condensed narration is the best exerciseground for writers whose tendency is to be continually fencing with words . The rigid demands of the story oblige them to take the buttons off from their foils . But it is time that we should give our readers a taste of Mr. Whipple 's quality ; though there is less need of making extracts in this case , as he has been a frequent and favored contributor to our pages . On account of the bias that we naturally feel from this circumstance , our readers may make such deduction from the praise already bestowed as they may think proper . The following lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and certainly very good ; the lines which we have italicized are as witty as any thing in Dr. Barrow 's celebrated description of wit , which is daringly quoted in the very lecture from which this extract is taken . " Wit was originally a general name for all the intellectual powers , meaning the faculty which kens , perceives , knows , understands ; it was gradually narrowed in its signification to express merely the resemblance between ideas ; and lastly , to note that resemblance when it occasioned ludicrous surprise . It marries ideas , lying wide apart , by a sudden jerk of the understanding . Humor originally meant moisture , a signification it metaphorically retains , for it is the very juice of the mind , oozing from the brain , and enriching and fertilizing wherever it falls . Wit exists by antipathy ; Humor by sympathy . Wit laughs at things ; Humor laughs with them . Wit lashes external appearances , or cunningly exaggerates single foibles into character ; Humor glides into the heart of its object , looks* by . // ingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Wit is abrupt , darting , scornful , and tosses its analogies in your face ; Humor is slow and shy , insinuating its fun into your heart . Wit is negative , analytical , destructive ; Humor is creative . The couplets of Pope are witty , but Sancho Panza is a humorous creation . Wit , when earnest , has the earnestness of passion , seeking to destroy ; Humor has the earnestness of affection , and would lift up what is seemingly low into our charity and love . Wit , bright , rapid and blasting as the lightning , flashes , strikes , and vanishes , in an instant ; Humor , warm and all-embracing as the sunshine , bathes its objects in a genial and abiding light . Wit implies hatred or contempt of folly and crime , produces its effects by brisk shocks of surprise , uses the whip of scorpions and the branding-iron , stabs , stings , pinches , tortures , goads , teases , corrodes , undermines ; Humor implies a sure conception of the beautiful , the majestic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes their opposites . It is an humane influence , softening with mirth the ragged inequalities of existence , promoting tolerant views of life , bridging over the spaces which separate the lofty from the lowly , the great from the humble . Old Dr. Fuller 's remark , that a negro is the image of God cut in ebony , ' is humorous ; Horace Smith 's inversion of it , that the taskmaster is the image of the devil cut in ivory , ' is witty . Wit can coexist with fierce and malignant passions ; but Humor demands good feeling and fellow-feeling , feeling not merely for what is above us , but for what is around and beneath us . When Wit and Humor are commingled , the result is a genial sharpness , dealing with its object somewhat as old Izaak Walton dealt with the frog he used for bait , - running the hook neatly through his mouth and out at his gills , and in so doing ' using him as though he loved him ! ' Sydney Smith and Shakspeare 's Touchstone are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writer accumulates the points in regard to which wit differs from humor , we are not sure that he hits with a sure aim , or even keeps constantly in sight , the fundamental distinction between them , upon which all their other differences depend . Humor , as it seems to us , is continuous and consistent wit embodied in character . Hence , wit sparkles , and humor flows . Falstaff is a humorous character who says witty things ; Corporal Nym , on the other hand , is a humorous creation , but he has no wit at all . Wit gives a pleasing shock , but humor affords continuous delight . Unexpectedness in the combination of ideas is characteristic of both ; but in the case of humor , one // of the related ideas is , so to speak , a fixed quantity , being the character which is to be illustrated . Witticisms have no connection with each other , so that a constant succession of them may tire ; they are like a bunch of India crackers all fired off at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect produced . But every stroke of humor has a relation to the character which is its object ; all the strokes are in keeping with each other , and all tend to make the portrait more complete and lifelike . Uncle Toby 's merciful treatment of the bluebottle fly is a humorous illustration of the same benevolence and simplicity of heart which appear in his conduct towards poor Le Fevre . Humor , consequently , never tires ; the effect of successive strokes is cumulative , not disjunctive . The wit of the characters in Sheridan 's comedies , for instance , tells like frequent blows from a hammer , the effect constantly diminishing as the nail is driven nearer home ; but humor acts like gravity on a descending weight , which moves faster and faster every instant . The wit of Shakspeare 's characters is all , to a certain extent , humorous ; for it is all in keeping with the minds and hearts of those who utter it . Rosalind 's wit differs from Touchstone 's as plainly as the moralizing of Jacques from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's description of irony is very much in his manner , fanciful illustrations of the leading thought being clustered together with a sort of comic rapidity and earnestness . " Irony is an insult conveyed in the form of a compliment ; insinuating the most galling satire under the phraseology of panegyric ; placing its victim naked on a bed of briers and thistles , thinly covered with rose.leaves ; adorning his brow with a crown of gold , which burns into his brain ; teasing , and fretting , and riddling him through and through , with incessant discharges of hot shot from a masked battery ; *laying bare the most sensitive and shrinking nerves of his mind , and then blandly touching them with ice , or smilingly pricking them with needles . Wit , in this form , caniiot be withstood , even by the hardest of heart and the emptiest of head . It eats and rusts into its victim . " The extracts already made illustrate our essayist 's command of language and the peculiarities of his style ; but they are not fair specimens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his judgment , or his facile use of the rich stores of English literature for the purposes of illustration and ornament . It is partly his own fault , if these more substantial merits of his writings have been sometimes overlooked , or not clearly perceived , through the glitter and sparkle of his sentences , and his frequent playfulness of manner . The last Lecture in this volume , on Intellectual Health and Disease , does more justice than the others to the higher qualities of his mind ; we shall therefore make liberal quotations from it , though to he fairly appreciated , it must be read as a whole . The leading idea of the essay , or the philosophy of mental disease , is thus stated . " An analysis of our consciousness , or rather a contemplation of the mysterious processes of our inward life , reveals no faculties and no impulses which can be disconnected from our personality . the mind is no collection of self-acting powers and passions , but a vital , indissoluble unit and person , capable , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nature a unit , not an aggregate . For the purposes of science , or verbal convenience , we may call its various operations by different names , according as it perceives , feels , understands , or imagines ; but the moment science breaks it up into a series of disconnected parts , and considers each part by itself as a separate power , that moment the living principle of mind is lost , and the result is an anarchy of faculties . Fortunately , however , we can not free ourselves , by any craft of analysis , from personal pronouns . A man who speaks or acts , instinctively mentions it as- I said , I did . We do not say that Milton 's imagination wrote Paradise Lost , but that Milton wrote it . There is no mental operation in which the whole mind is not present ; nothing produced but by the joint action of all its faculties , under the direction of its central personality . This central principle of mind is spiritual force , - capacity to cause , to create , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; interpenetrates , fuses , directs all faculties . This thinks , this feels , this imagines , this worships ; this is what glows with health , this is what is enfeebled and corrupted by disease . Call it what you please , - will , personality , individuality , character , force of being ; but recognize it as the true spiritual power which constitutes a living soul . This is the only peculiarity which separates the impersonal existence of a vegetable from the personal life of a man . The material universe is instinct with spiritual existence , but only in man is it individualized into spiritual life . // even exist , by itself . It can only grow by assimilating something external to itself , the very condition of mental life being the exercise of power within on objects without . The form and superficial qualities of objects it perceives ; their life and spirit it conceives . Only what the mind conceives , it assimilates and draws into its own life ; - intellectual conception indicating a penetrating vision into the heart of things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this distinction between perception and conception , we have a principle which accounts for the limited degree in which so many persons grow in intelligence and character , in grace and gracelessness . Here , also , is the distinction between assent and faith , theory and practice . In the one case , opinions lie on the surface of the mind , mere objects , the truth of which it perceives , but which do not influence its will ; in the other , ideas penetrate into the very substance of the mind , become one with it , and are springs of living thought and action . For instance , you may cram whole folios of morality and divinity into the heads of Dick Turpin and Captain Kidd , and both will cordially assent to their truth ; but the captives of Dick 's blunderbuss will still have to give up their purses , and the prisoners of Kidd 's piracy will still have to walk the plank . On the other hand , you may pour all varieties of immoral ol ) inions and images into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there they will remain , unassimilated , uncorrupting ; his mind , like that of Ion , Though shapes of ill May hover rouud its surface , glides in light , And takes no shadow from them . ' " In accordance with the same principle , all knowledge , however imposing in its appearance , is but superficial knowledge , if it be merely the mind 's furniture , not the mind 's nutriment . It must be transmuted into mind , as food is into blood , to become wisdom and power . . . - - . " If the mind thus grows by assimilating external objects , it is plain that the character of the objects it assimilates will determine the form of its development , and its health or disease . Mental health consists in the self-direction of mental power , in the capacity to perceive its own relations to objects and the relations of objects to each other , and to choose those which will conduce to its enlargement and elevation . Disease occurs both when it loses its self-direction , and its self-distrust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every outward impression ; when it loses its self-distrust , it surrenders itself to every inward whim . In the one case , it loses all moral and intellectual character , becomes unstrung , sentimental , dissolute , j4* // with feebleness at the very heart of its being ; in the other , it perversely misconceives and discolors external things , views every object as a mirror of self , and , having no reverence for aught above itself , subsides into a poisonous mass of egotism , conceit , and falsehood . Thus disease occurs both when the mind loses itself in objects , and when objects are lost in it ,  --  when it parts with will , and when it becomes wilful . The last conse quence of will submerged is sensuality , brutality , slavishness ; the last consequence of will perverted is Satanic pride . Now , it is an almost universal law , that the diseased weak , the men of unrestrained appetites , shall become the victims and slaves of the diseased strong , the men of unrestrained wills , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and death , to both . Here is the principle of all slavery , political , intellectual , and religious , in individuals and in communities ? ' The danger of losing one 's individuality , or the power of self-direction , is thus illustrated - " Look around any community , and you find it dotted over with men , marked and ticketed as not belonging to themselves , but to some other man , from whom they take their literature , their politics , their religion . They are willing captives of a stronger nature ; feed on his life as though it were miraculous manna rained from heaven ; complacently parade his name as an adjective to point out their own ; and give wonderful pertinence to that nursery rhyme , whose esoteric depth irradiates even its exoteric expression - Whose dog are you ? I am Billy Patton 's dog , Whose dog are you ? ' " This social servility , as seen in its annual harvest of dwindled souls , abject in every thing , from the tie of a neckcloth to the points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyranny which a few forcible persons can establish in any of our free and enlightened* communities ; but perhaps a more subtle influence than that which proceeds from social relations , comes from that abstract and epitome of the whole mind of the whole world , which we find in history and literature . Here the thought and action of the race are brought home to the individual intelligence ; and the danger is , that we make what should be our emancipation an instrument of servitude , fall a victim to one author or one age , and lose the power of learning from many minds , by sinking into the contented vassal of one ; and end , at last , in an intellectual resemblance to that gentleman who only knew two tunes , one of which , ' he said , ' was Old Hundred , // and the other - was n't . ' The danger to individuality , in reading , is not that we repeat an author 's opinions or expressions , but that we be magnetized by his spirit to the extent of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . Now , no man is benefited by being conquered ; and the most modest might say to the mightiest , - to Homer , to Dante , to Milton , to Goethe , - Keep off , gentlemen , - not so near , if you please ; you can do me vast service , provided you do not swallow me up ; my personal being is small , but allow me to say of it , as Touchstone said of Audrey , his wife , A poor thing , sir , but mine * The fatal consequences of erring in the opposite extreme , by allowing will to degenerate into wilfulness , are set forth , first , in the case of individuals , and afterwards , of communities . " In passing from the simple forms of Asiatic life to the complex civilization of Greece , a more difficult problem presents itself . The Greek Mind , with its combination of energy and objectiveness , its open sense to all the influences of nature , its wonderful adaptation to philosophy , and art , and arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect disease in that ? The answer to this question is fortunately partly contained in the statement of a fact . Greek civilization is dead ; the Greek mind died out more than two thousand years ago ; a race of heroes declined into a race of sycophants , sophists , and slaves ; and no galvanic action of modern sympathy has ever yet convulsed it into even a resemblance of its old life . Now , if it died , it must have died of disease ; for nothing else has power to kill a nation . In considering the causes of the decay of a national mind so orderly , comprehensive , and creative as the Greek , we must keep steadily prominent the fact that it began in Satanic energy , and that it is an universal law that this energy in the end consumes itself . Perhaps the history of the Greek Mind is best read in the characteristics of its three great dramatists , - sublime and wilful in iEschylus , beautiful in Sophocles , sentimental in Euripides . The Greek deified Man , first as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art . Now , as it is a consequence of high culture , that a superstition , having its source in human passions , shall subside from a religion into an art , the Greek became atheistical as he grew intelligent . He had , so to speak , a taste for divinities , but no belief in them . He acknowledged nothing higher than his own mind ; waxed measurelessly proud and conceited ; worshipped , in fact , himself . He had opinions on morals , but he assim. ilated no moral ideas . Now , the moment he became an atheist , // the moment he ceased to rise above himself , he began to decay . The strength at the heart of a nation , which keeps it alive , must either grow or dwindle ; and , after a certain stage in its progress , it can only grow by assimilating moral and religious truth . Moral corruption , which is the result of wilful energy , eats into the very substance and core of intellectual life . Energy , it is true , is requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , while it has the strength and fearlessness of Prometheus chained to the rock , or Satan , buffeting the billows of fire , is also meek , aspiring , and reverential . Its spirit is that of the stout old martyr , who told the trembling brethren of the faith who clustered around his funeral pyre , that if his soul was serene in its last struggle with death , he would lift up his hands to them as a sign . They watched , with tremulous eagerness , the fierce element , as it swept along and over his withered frame , and , in the awful agonies of that moment when he was encircled with fire , and wholly hidden from their view , two thin hands quivered up above fagot and flame , and closed in the form of prayer . " In the Greek mind , the wilful element took the form of conceit rather than pride , and it is therefore in the civilization of Rome that we must seek for the best expression of the power and the weakness of Satanic passion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suckled by a wolf , aptly symbolizes that base of ferocity and iron will on which its colossal dominion was raised . The Roman mind , if we look at it in relation to its all.conquering courage and intelligence , had many sublime qualities ; but pride , hard , fierce , remorseless , invulnerable pride and contempt of right , was its ruling characteristic . It existed just as long as it had power to crush opposition . But avarice , licentiousness , effeminacy , the whole brood of the abject vices , are sure at last to fasten on the conqueror , humbling his proud will , and turning his strength into weakness . The heart of that vast empire was ulcerated long before it fell . The sensuality of a Mark Antony is a more frightful thing than the sensuality of a savage ; and when self-abandonment thus succeeds to selfworship , and men are literally given over to their lusts , a state of society exists which , in its demoniacal contempt of restraint , sets all description at defiance . The irruption of barbarian energy into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that swept in a devouring flame over its plains and cities , - we view with something of the grim satisfaction with which an old Hebrew might have surveyed the engulfing of Pharaoh and his host in the waters of the Red Sea . " These are copious extracts ; but we must borrow one passage more , though from a different Lecture , to illustrate // the writer 's ready application of the materials both of civil and literary history to the illustration of his subject . " Satirical compositions , floating about among a people , have more than once produced revolutions . They are sown as dragon 's teeth ; they spring up armed men . The author of the ballad of Lilliburlero boasted that he had rhymed King James the Second out of his dominions . England , under Charles II. , was governed pretty equally by rou6s and wit-snappers . A joke hazarded by royal lips on a regal object has sometimes plunged kingdoms into war ; for dull monarchs generally make their repartees through the cannon 's mouth . The biting jests of Frederick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrumental in bringing down upon his dominions the armies of Russia and France . The downfall of the French monarchy was occasioned primarily by its becoming contemptible through its vices . No government , whether evil or good , can long exist after it has ceased to excite respect and begun to excite hilarity . Ministers of state have been repeatedly laughed out of office . Where Scorn points its scoffing finger , Servility itself may well be ashamed to fawn . In this connection , I trust no one will consider me capable of making a political allusion , or to be wanting in respect for the dead , if I refer in illustration to a late administration of our own government , - I mean that which retired on the fourth of March , 1845 . Now , during that administration measures of the utmost importance were commenced or consummated ; the country was more generally pros . perous than it had been for years ; there were no spectacles of gentlemen taking passage for France or Texas , with bags of the public gold in their valises ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land ; and yet the whole thing was hailed with a shout of laughter , ringing to the remotest villages of the east and the west . Everybody laughed , and the only difference between its nominal supporters and its adversaries was , that whereas one party laughed outright , the other laughed in their sleeves . Nothing could have saved such an administration from downfall , for whatever may have been its intrinsic merits , it was still considered not so much a government as a gigantic joke .
