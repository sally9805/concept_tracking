txt LOGICAL RESULTS OP REPUBLICANISM . THE opposition throughout the country are speculating on the result of the recent elections in several of the eastern , middle , and western States , and some of the more violent presses of the Republican party assume that the nominal success attending their efforts in these States , proves the strength of the principles enunciated in the sectional platform of 1856 , as recently elaborated and extended in the extreme views of Senator Seward of New York , Mr. Lincoln of Illinois , and others , who are presumed to speak for the Republican party at the present time . If the two systems , free and bond labor , which have respectively characterized the northern and southern States for a long period , and under which both have prospered in a degree unparalleled in the history of nations , are now to commence a relentless war on each other , until one or the other shall be exterminated , then , as a consequence , the confederation is at an end ,  --  the United States no longer exists  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founders have labored in vain . This we do not believe , although the country is not free from danger , and it is well to remind politicians that one of the ancient prophets administered a severe rebuke to the head of an Ishmaelitish tribe for proclaiming peace ! peace ! when there was no peace . A proclamation of war was issued acrainst the institution of this country in the Republican conve*tion of 1856 , which nominated Col. Fremont as its chieftain , and although his defeat caused a truce , the war is now renewed in a more formidable manner , and the 14 // head of the column placed in the hands of a more able , skilful , and determined leader , Senator Seward . No one can fail to admire the boldness ot this leader in marking out the lines of his campaign foi ' 1860 , however much we may deprecate the recklessness of his course , or view with apprehension the hazard to which his policy exposes the interest of the country . In this renewed crusade against the peace of the Union the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is clearly indicated by the result of the recent elections , and we can not fail to regard without apprehension the course now being pursued by these parties . The mission of the American party seems to consist in its ability to excite unkindly sentiments between persons from different countries and professing dissimilar religions opinions , while the aim of the Republican party appears to resolve itself into an effort to sever the bonds of brotherhood existing between different sections of one common country . That two parties thus engaged in creating and promoting contention between , members of the same confederacy , instead of aspiring to advance the interest and promote the honor and prosperity of all , can easily fuse , is obvious , and therefore few men of discernment are surprised at their amalgaination , and the absorption of the American faction by the Republicans . That both of these political cabals are capable of doing any act , however treasonable , against the State , is natural and inevitable . It is a mystery how any conscientious man can countenance the course pursued by the Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great truth , that the Almighty has pronounced a blessing on the peacemaker , and a curse upon him who stirreth up strife , neither of these parties would derive much encouragement from the better class of citizens , for they both undoubtedly occupy the position of the latter character , while the Democratic party sustains that of the former . The result of the recent elections clearly demonstrates the fact , that the opposition are becoming more and more a mere local organization , and while this conibination may succeed in keeping from us some of the State Governments for a limited period , it can never again aspire to the dignity of a national party , or by any possibility obtain control of the national government upon the strength of its own merits or the popularity of its principles . The principles and sentiments of a party can only be determined by its official acts , and the concurrent opinions of its leading umemnbers . J. C. Frernont received the nomination of the Republicans at the Philadelphia Convention , and of the North Americans at New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " second Declaration of American Independence . " Both branches of this Republican American party glory in the appellation of opposition , and we shall so regard them . Their Philadelphia and New York platforms , and the leaders who represent them , all breathe the same turbulent , bigoted , sectional spirit of opposition , not only to the Democratic party , but also to the Constitution of the country , the institutions of the States , and the sovereignty of the people of the Territories . They deny to the American citizen the right of self-government in the Territories , under the pretence that its exercise would interfere with the privileges of negroes ! They denounce the Government of the country as accessory to murders , robberies , and arson , without the shadow of proof , while they themselves are guilty of every crime known in the blackest catalogue of infamy and treason ; under the guise of humanity , they perpetrate the most heartless cruelties , and beneath the cloak of religion they blaspheme the name of the Almighty . They outlaw one half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not succumb , on the pretence that they love the Union , asserting at the same time , that the North has the right to govern the country ; affect horror of polygamy and slavery as twin relics of barbarism , while they tax the State for the support of their own lust and traffic in the blood of human beings . They preach abolitionism and practise amalgamation , and attempt to conceal their infamy under the cry of " freedom ! " They denounce the repeal of the Missouri Compromise , and have not the manliness to ask its restoration . They proclaim the right of Americans to rule America , and persecute citizens for their religious opinions , and ostracise them on account of the place of their birth , and in the face of this conduct , they invoke foreign aid in subverting the institutions of the country ! They call on the venerated names of Washington and Jefferson to sustain their untenable dogmas , when it is a historical truth that not one of the Revolutionary patriots ever sustained sectionalism or religious bigotry . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they employ obscene , licentious , and treasonable language , stimulate immorality , rapine , and war , instead of inculcating the Divine precept of peace and good will to men . If these charges seem harsh toward the Republican party , it is to be regret ted that it has given occasion for them , and that they are too true . The proof may be found in its own record , written by the hand of its members . The Philadelphia Convention of 1856 , which inaugurated the Republican party , adopted , among other resolutions , the following " That we deny the aitthority of Uongress , of a territorial // legislature , of any individual or association of individuals , to give legal existence to slavery in any territory of the United States while the present Constitution shall be maintained . " " That the Constitution confers upon *iJongres8 8overeign power over the territories of the United States for their government , and that in the exercise of this power it is both the right and the duty of Congress to prohibit in the territories those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution denies the right of Congress to the absolute government of Territories , and the second asserts its supreme power in the premises . It is difficult to explain the inconsistency manifest in these resolutions on any other hypothesis than that the men who framed them were willing to concede the right of Congress , under the Constitution , to perform any act that might be agreeable to their views , but deny the power to do any other act of which they should disapprove . Whatever may be the meaning of these incongruous resolutions , it is an indisputable fact that they are opposed to the admission of any more States into the Union , with southern institutions , and that they deny the right of the people to adopt their own form of government in conformity with the Constitution , which provides " That the power not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , is reserved to the States respectively or to the people . " The section on which the opposition depend to justify their position is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme governmental power in Territories , when in truth it does nothing of the kind . It reads as follows : - " Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the Territories or other property belonging to the United States . " The construction placed on this section of the Constitution by the Republican party would give to Congress the same right to dispose of a civil comm unity that it possesses in regard to the disposal of mere property belonging to the United States , such as the public lands , buildings , arsenals , dock-yards , &amp;c . This Constitutional language admits of no doubtful or two-fold rendering-Congress may dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations " respecting the land , " but not the 8overeignty of the Territories when once peopled . The founders of the Republic had no such design , nor have they by any word in the Constitution vested in Congress or given to any other department of the Federal Government , an arbitrary power over the local and domestic affairs of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied a similar position in their relations to the Crown of Great Britain // that the organized Territories of the Union to-day sustain to the government under our Federal Constitution . In fact the great cause of revolution was the arrogant presumption of the royal Governors and Officers of the Crown , in regard to the internal and domestic concerns of the Colonies . No gigantic central power or imperial dynasty can rise on the will of this Republic while these memories of oppression and despotism last . The remainder of this platform relative to Kansas and slavery , consists of unfounded attacks against the Democratic party , clothed in objectionable terms , unbecoming any public body of American citizens , especially those clalining exclusively the title of freemen . The quotations already made connecting the abhorrent practice of polygamy with an institution that prevailed in every State of the American Union except one , when the Constitution was framed , is an insult to the memory of the founders of the Republic , and a foul attempt to disgrace the people of the South , whose patriotic devotion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its history . In all this exciting controversy the South has maintained the defensive . The pretence for the lawful and unlawful action of the Republicans is particularly found in the apprehension entertained by Northern demagogues that the South intend to re-establish the African slave trade . If this should be effected , the disunionists will be entitled to the honor of the measure , as they are guilty of having perpetuated slavery in several States , which would have renounced it long since , had there been no attempt from abroad to create insurrection . The Charleston Standard , which originated this proposition , re-marks " The sentiment of opposition to our institutions has led to further acts of political aggression . The entrenchment of our position has been no impediment to legislative and territorial circumscription . Yielding ground before our adversaries , we have come at last to points beyond which we can yield no further , and the alternatives of surrender or reaction have been forced upon us . " There is no danger of this inhuman traffic being renewed by the South : the only fear is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change our humane policy , as they endeavored to defeat its adoption in the Convention of 1787 . In opposition to Mr. Madison and his Southern associates , the delegates from Massachusetts and other Northern States succeeded in postponing its abolition , ftom 1800 to 1808 , and urged a continuation until the year 1820 , assigning as a reason that their ships were largely engaged in the trade . The course pursued by these Eastern philanthropists at that early // day , is consistent with the character of abolitionism ever since , for more slavers have been fitted out in the port . of Boston during fifty years past , than at all others in the country . The next issue raised by the opposition to the policy of the Deinocratic party was its resistance to the repeal of the sectional act of 1820 , misnamed the Missouri Compromise . This law , far from being a mutual compromise , partook more of an act of force , and was merely acquiesced in for the sake of temporary peace . It was so regarded by Jefferson and other eminent statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1820 , Jefferson wrote as follows : " The old schism of Federal and Republican threatened nothing , because it existed in every State and united them together by the fraternalisin of ) arty . But the coincidence of a marked principle , moral and political , with a geographical line , once conceived , I fear never more would be obliterated from the mind : That it would be recurring on every occasion , and renewing irritations , until it would kindle such mutual moral hatred as to render separation preferable to eternal discord . " Again on the 22d , he said : " I had for a long time ceased to read newspapers , or pay any attention to public affairs , confident they were in good hands , and content to be a passenger in our bark to the shore from which I am not far distant . But this momentous question , like the firebell in the night , awakened and filled me with terror . I considered it at once the knell of the Union . " The threatening aspect of national affairs predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also foreseen by Washington , who , in his farewell address , cautioned the country against geographical lines and sectional parties . There is no question that all the danger through which the country is now passing has resulted from the enactment of 1820 , which was inconsistent with the constitution and the whole policy of the government on this subject ; fbi ' , in the cession of the NorthWest territory by Virginia , in 1787 , it was received by Congress with conditions excluding slavery , because the people , who had the sole right to determine the question , had already ordained that it should not exist , the United States merely ratifying the municipal law then in force , in its act of acceptance of the territory . The compromise of 1820 was not only an evasion , but a radical violation of the Constitution  --  a reproach to the intelligence of the day , and a grave mockery of that equality and common independence of the States which the Federal Union has designed to recognize and secure . This base measure of intervention and intolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allay the bitterness of an already monstrous sectarianisin , and restore temporary tranquillity to the country , though at the sacrifice of a great principle , which should have been triumphantly and forever vindicated at the very threshold of its innovation . The same lack of courage that J ) revented the men of 1820 from settling this question upon the fhnda mental law of Non-Intervention and equality of rights as between the States , preserved the unprincipled compromise , a stigma upon our National Statute Book , until 18*4 , when an able and fearless Democratic statesman ( Senator Douglas , of Illinois ) was found to propose and carry its repeal , against a warfare of fanaticism , and in defiance of sectional terrors , to which the storms of 1820 were but as " dust in the balance . " The wisdom and patriotism of the nation has upheld the statesman , and continued in power the party that did the deed . The Democratic party occupies the same position now as it ever has , and the charge that it is in favor of extending slavery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conform to the Constitution and the esmblished policy of the government . The assertion that the Democratic party is sectional , is equally untrue . Its nominations are made by Pill representations from every State in the Union , and its platform of principles has always been as comprehensive as the Constitution , n either recognising sections nor creeds , hut looking forward to the day when the Constitution of the Republic shall extend over this whole continent . To show the concurrence of the Republican party , when first assembled in National Convention , in the " irrepressible conflict " doctrine , and the incendiary policy of the present time , we submit the following quotations from the remarks of distinguished leaders then made in the Philadelphia Convention of 1856 : In that body , Senator Henry Wilson said : " I tell you here to-night , that the agitation of this question of human slavery will continue while the foot of a slave presses the soil of time Anierican Republic . " Gen. James Watson Webb remarked : " On the action of this Convention depends the fate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot-box , we will be forced to drive back the slaveocracy with fire and sword . " Rufus P. Spaulding spoke as follows : " In case of the alternative being presented , of the continuance of slavery or a dissolution of the Union , I am for dissolution , and I care not how quick it comes . " ion . Erastus Hopkins said : " If peaceful means fail us , and we are driven to the last // extremity , where ballots are useless , then we 'll make bullets effective . " Similar sentiments were expressed by a large majority of the Convention , and , like their sectional resolutions , were responded to with " tremendous applause . " The sectional fires ignited in that Convention rapidly increased , and spread over all the Northern States . Benjamin F. Wade , Senator from Ohio , in a speech delivered in that canvass , said : " That there was but one issue before the people , and that was the question of American slavery . He said the Whig party is not only dead , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is sometimes exhibited in the dead snake 's tail , after the head and body have been burned . There is really no union now between the North and South , and he believed no two nations upon the earth entertain feelings of more bitter rancor towards each other than these two nations of the iRepublic . The only salvation of the Union , therefore , was to be found in divesting it entirely from all taint of slavery . " Nathaniel P. Banks , then Speaker of the House of Representatives , whose name was withdrawn from the candidacy of the Know-Nothing Seceders ' Convention , to make way for Fremont , also spoke as follows : " Althonoli I am not one of that class of men who cry for the perpetuation of the Union , though I am willing , in a certain state of circumstances , to let it slide , ' I have no fear for its perpetuation . " Resolutions in conformity with these sentiments were passed by most of the public meetings held in the North , to respond to the nomination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barlow , Raymond , and the conductors of other leading journals in their interest ; while the Rev. Ward Beecher , Theodore Parker , Dr. Cheever , and a host of ministers of the Gospel , left their pulpits to participate in the traitorous movement . W. Lloyd Garrison , who said , " if he had a million of votes , they should be cast for the Republican candidate , " joined other infidel agrarians in blasphemous imprecations on the country ; Fry , of the Tribune , compared Fremont to the " Saviour of the world ; " Burlingame called for an " anti-slavery Constitution , anti-slavery Bible , and an anti-slavery God . " In the midst of all this , Joshua R. Giddings , for twenty years their representative in Congress , invoked British aid as follows " I look forward to the day , when there shall be a servile insurrection in the South-when the black man , armed with British bayonets , and led on by British officers , shall assert his // freedom , and wage a war of extermination against his masterwhen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cities of the South , and blot out the last vestige of slavery ; and though I may not mock at their calamity , nor laugh when their fear cometh , yet I will hail it as the dawn of a political millennium . " To this patriotic appeal the English and French press re-sponded , " We rejoice to learn from the American newspapers that Col. Fremont 's prospects , as the Republican ' candidate for the Presidency , are daily brightening . Mass-meetings of his supporters have been held at various parts of the North , at which an amount of popular enthusiasm has been evoked , such as never l ) efore marked the progress of the cause of Freedom . " - London Star . " Our sympathies are entirely with Col. Fremont . We hope to see no extension of the Democratic principles in the United States . It is dangerous to European governments . " - Paris iifioniteur . " We should be sorry to see Mr. Buchanan elected , because he is in favor of preserving the obnoxious institutions as they exist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European monarchical government , if the progressive spirit of the Democracy of the United States is allowed to succeed . Elect Fremont , and the first blow to the separation of the States is effected . " - London Ghronicle . The Paris correspondent of the New York Times said , " Every political journal of Paris has raised the flag of Fremont , ' to quote the American style ; and if the election depended on the European States , Fremont would be elected unanimously . " The London Times advised a dissolution of the Union . It said " The time for all this mere talk is over now , and the northern must fight for his principles , if he wants his principles to prevail . He must either leave the Union , or he must rule the Union . " The spirit of opposition to Democracy and in favor of sectionalism , as a prelude to disunion and the downfall of the Republic there exhibited in the sympathy offered to the Republicans , exists still , and will ever be natural to Oligarchies and Monarchies . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1856 on sectional principles , leading to disunion ; it is now proposed to show that these principles still control the action of that party , and that they were especially brought to bear in full force in the late senatorial election in Illinois . // Senator Douglas in that contest based his claims for re-election to the Senate of the United States , upon the principles of the Democratic party , as embodied in the resolutions of the Cincinnati convention . Mr. Lincoln , a man of great strength and popularity , in conducting the cause of the IRepublicans , placed himself upon the platform of his party , adopted in the convention of 1856 , which nominated Go . Frernont for the presidency , who pledged himself , if elected , to employ the whole power of the Federal Government to prevent the spread of Southern institutions over the territories of the United States , and against the admission of new States into the Union , whose constitutions might favor these institutions . In pointing out the results of Republican policy , Mr. Lincoln , in accepting the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided against itself can not stand . ' I believe this Government can not endure , permanently , half slave and half free . I do not expect the Union to be dissolved . I do not expect the house to fall ; but I do expect it to cease to be divided . It will become all one thing or all the other . Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it , and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction , or its advocates will push forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States , - old as well as new-north as well as south . " The scope and bearing of the view here expressed is obvious . This Republican leader does not entertain a thought that the country will become all one thing or all the other , but he and his party intend to make it all the " other , " if they possess the power . To be more explicit , they design to prohibit slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the strong arm of the Federal Government , or through insurrection . The signal honor of having been the first to encounter and beat down in a free State this formidable and incendiary doctrine of Abolitionism , in its most ample definition and development , belongs to the same indomitable statesman who wiped out the Missouri compromise and re-established th' fundamental principles of self-government . Addressing himself to the doctrines advanced by Mr. Lincoln , as given above , Senator Douglas , in his first speech at Chicago , said : -* 1 take bold and unqualified issue with him upon that l ) rinciple . I assert , that it is neither desfrable nor possible that there should be uniformity in the local laws and domestic institutions of the different States of this Union . The framers of our government never contemplated uniformity in their internal concerns . The fathers of the Revolution , and sages who made the constitution , well understood that the laws and domestic institutions which // would suit the granite hills of New Hampshire , would be utterly unfit for the rice plantations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws which would suit the agricultural districts of Pennsylvania and New York , would be utterly unfit for the lar* mining districts of the Pacific , or the lumher regions of aine . They well understood , that a great diversity of climate , soil , and pursuits in a Republic as large as this , required diffe*'ent local and domestic regulations in each locality , adapted to the wants of each separate State ; and for that reason it was provided in the Federal Constitution , that the thirteen original States should remain sovereign and supreme within their own limits in regard to all that was local , and internal , and domestic , while the Federal Government should have certain specified powers , which were general and national . The framers of the Constitution well understood , that each locality having separate and distinct interests , required separate and distinct laws , domestic institutions , hnd police regulations , adapted to its own wants and own condition ; and they acted on the presumption , also , that these laws and institutions would be as diversified and as dissimilar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two would be precisely alike because the interests of no two were precisely the same . Hence I assert , that the great fundamental principle which underlies our complex system of State and Federal Government contemplated diversity and dissimilarity in the local institutions and domestic affairs of each and every State then in the Union or thereafter to be admitted into the Confederacy . " I therefore conceive that my friend , Mr. Lincoln , has totally misapprehended the great principles upon which our government rests . Uniformity in local and domestic affairs would be destructive of State Rights , or State Sovereignty , of Personal Liberty , and Personal Freedom . Uniformity is the parent of IDespotism the world over , not only in politics but in religion . Wherever the doctrine of Uniformity is proclaimed , that all the States must be free or all slaves , that all labor must be white or all black , that all the citizens of the different States must have the same privileges or be governed by the same regulations , you have destroyed the greatest safeguard which our institutions have thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that previous to entering upon the canvass in Illinois , Mr. Lincoln held a conference with the recognised leaders of the RePublicandp arty , and they agreed on a programme which is to govern uring the approaching presidential campaign . This programme is war to the knife against Southern institutions . ft is all the party has left out of // 212 logical Pe. *ult8 of ? epublicani8rn. which to form materials for an issue with the national Democracy . The necessity for such re-assertion of the principles and policy of the party is evident in view of its stultification through the unanimous vote of the Republican members of Congress in favor of the Crittenden amendment to the Kansas bill . The position then assumed was designed to meet a temporary emergency , and for the accomplishment of a sinister purpose . It was simply to embarrass Mr. Buchanan 's administration in the adjustment of the vexed Kansas question . In evidence of the jnstness of the opinion here expressed , relative to the position of the Republican party and its treasonable purposes , it may be pertinent to refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rochester , who was privy to the agreement between Mr. Lincoln and other distinguished Republicans at the commencement of the campaign in Illinois . It should not be forgotten that Mr. Seward voted for the proposition offered by Senator Crittenden , in palpable violation of the platform of principles adopted by his party in the Philadelphia convention ; and that he , in his speech in the Senate , asserted that the " battle was over ; " there were " seventeen free and fifteen slave States ; " yet in the face of this announcement only a few months previous , he returns to his sectional starting-point with perfect coolness , and declares " that the conflict must be renewed , and continue until the United States become entirely a slave-holding nation , or entirely a free labor nation , and that either the cotton and rice fields of South Carolina , and the sugar plantations of Louisiana must be ultimately tilled by free labor , and Charleston and New York become marts for legitimate merchandise alone , or else the rye fields of Massachusetts and wheat fields of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , and to the production of slaves , and Boston and New York become once more a market for trade in the bodies and souls of men This is precisely the same train of reasoning employed by Mr. Lincoln , and leads to exactly the same results . These gentlemen speak from authority and they will push their cause to a final issue before the people . It i-s not merely to inquire whether they are sincere in considering slavery a plague-spot on American institutions , but it is necessary to meet and ward off their bold attacks on the constitutional rights of the people , and to defend the institutions of the country from the withering blast of sectional treason and incendiarism . This is the duty and the mission of the Democratic party , and to accomplish it minor differences must be forgotten and all personal considerations disregarded . Thus far the enemy have been defeated . In the Presidential // election resulting in the success of Mr. Buchanan , they were beaten , after an animated and hotly contested campaign , conducted with all the energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command . At the late election in Illinois they were also signally defeated , in the most severe and bitterly contested election that ever took place in this country ; which terminated in the triumph of Senator Douglass , who conducted the campaign alone and in person , against the combined enemies of the Democratic party and of the Constitution . In his Kansas-Nebraska bill he revived and brought to light principles vital to the efficiency of the Constitution and essential to national progress ; principles that underlie the very foundation of the American Government , but which were almost smothered by the Missouri Compromise , and remained dormant for nearly a half century , through false legislation and a timid temporizing policy . By this inauguration of sound constitutional govern mental policy were swept from the nation 's statutebook all the cobwebs and mystery that for an age misled lawmakers and deceived the people . It was thought by many that this triumph of sound and just legislation over an unconstitutional sectional policy would not be farther contested , and that an universal acquiescence in it might be expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination to resist to the last this policy has just been shown by citations from the speeches of Senator Seward and Mr. Lincoln . The latter gentleman certainly evinced great courage in attempting to win from Senator Douglass and the Democratic party , one of the very few free States that cast its vote for Mr. Bnchanan three years since , on the identical issues of that campaign , not leaving a shadow of a doubt as to the real result of the last contest . The Democracy and its bold champion , Mr. Douglass , maintain ed the time-honored principles of constitutional government , the equality of the American citizen , and the universality of our institutions . The Republicans and their fearless leader , Mr. Lincoln , on the contrary , insisted that a distinction be drawn between members of the confederacy , and a portion of them be excluded from an equal participation in the settlement of new territory , and a barrier be erected , through the influence of Northern institutions , against the extension of Southern institutions , and that a war of aggression l ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the North . The Republican party , having thus been defeated in the severe political contests of 1856 and 1858 , seeks now to fortify itself by a practical application of its principles in the government // of the country by force , and this brings us down to the late occurrence at Harper 's Ferry , which proves the time has come when this country can not be held confederated , under any other administration , than that of the Democratic party . So often have the institutions of the south been bitterly assailed by the opposition , so often have her hearthstones been desecrated , by bloodshed and riot , that she will sooner forswear her sisterhood , than submit to the offensive rule of the I*epublican party . From year to year this fhnatical organization has preserved an existence , in its abuse of southern institutions , and by false and dishonorable misrepresentation of southern slavery , has succeeded in arousing the bitterest and most dangerous sentiments in the minds of many northern men against one of the oldest institutions of our common country . The recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an offspring of that wild fanaticism which the predicted " irrepressible conflict " of Seward , and the false philosophy of Gerrit Smith , must continually engender . It is a sad fact that men , who aspire to rule our nation , should disseminate such doctrines as are calculated to sow broadcast disunion and dissension in the country . The manifesto of Gov . Seward at Rochester , anticipates the riot at Harper 's Ferry as inevitably as night follows day . The necessities of climate and long custom of time , have rendered slavery a necessity in the south , and the tirades against it may embitter its condition , but can not shorten its existence . This should be remembered by those who now rail so loudly against the institution . Who brought slavery to this country ? Not the south ; the south had no vessels for th' traffic . It was brought by Rhode Island , New York , and Massachusetts , and there was a time in our history when these states did not repudiate the institution , or consider the negro possessed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shown , when Massachusetts and South Carolina thought alike on this subject , but the cold ungenial climate of the north paralyzed the energies of the black man , and rendered him nm*profitable . Not so in the south  --  the climate there and productions there required him , and hence it is he is kept in servitude in that section and not in this . TIme distribution of property also in the north , necessarily eventuated in the abolition of slavery . The institution can only be profitable where there are vast tracts of land to cultivate , and where the burning sun of the tropics renders manual labor insufferable to the white race . When the vast south shall be as populous as the manufacturing north , when her rice , and cotton , and sugar fields shall be covered with flourishing factories , and whemi // educated labor is required instead of manual , then the system of slavery may yield to the science of machinery . The genial south was designed by God to produce from her rich soil materials for the scientific north to mould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor of the Ethiopian is as necessary as light is to day , or darkness to night . The element of greatness in our empire is the boundless productiveness of the south , and indefatigable manufacturing energy of the north . For our wealth and prosperity as a whole , it is essential that each section should develope all her resources ; and for the accomplishment of that , the labor and endurance of the negro is a necessity in the south . The condition of the African there is infinitely better than it was in his native country and his original savage state , and far better upon an average than the condition of free negroes in the north . The sum of human happiness and human comfort is as great in the south as in the north , and that hand of Providence , which chastens inevitably the vices of nations as well as of individuals , has never fallen with its blighting influence upon that portion of our land more than upon any other . When God in his providence shall see fit to scourge us for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come in the defeat of Democratic principles , and the triumph of the Republican party . Then truly shall we be delivered up to ruin and disaster . All the political fanaticism of the North , and all the bitter animosity against the South , has its birthright in the doctrines of the Republican leaders . Many a good man is made mad by their heresies , and drawn from the useful pursuits of his life into incendiarism against his happy country . The unfortunate Brown , who is justly under condemnation of laws for treason and murder , would , perhaps , be in the peaceful circle of his family , at Utica , but that the doctrines of Republicanism found their way to his quiet home , and made a deluded philanthropist of the humble farmer-destroying forever his domestic fireside , and blindly urging him on to burn down the fabric of his country .

That poor old man , who now lies incarcerated in a dungeon in Yirginia , is less responsible for the murder of his countrymen than Seward , Giddings , Phillips , and Gerrit Smith ; who , by their sophistry , inflamed the sedition in his breast , and if he is executed-as in all probability he will be-his blood will call out from the grave for vengeance upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all others who are loyal to the Constitution and the Union , trace these evils to their source , and call down the just indignation of the people upon them . In the moment of a country 's danger , the man who sees clearly its source , and boldly proclaims it to the people , without fear of the local effect upon his fortunes , is the statesman for all sections to approve , and to elevate to power , so that he may unite with his clear-sighted judgment the capability to act for the general weal . The time has come when the people can only trust such men as are known by their past record to be national statesmen ; to such men as can not , by local causes , be turned aside from the great good of the nation . The true statesman ever merges self and section into the good of his people , and awaits the inevitable moment , when he may become the servant of his grateful country . The mission of the Democratic party is now more than ever before to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and uphold firmly and fearlessly the Constitution and the Union as established by the Fathers . Every people have their periods of vicissitude and trial . Those are however but necessary in our onward and irresistible progress , to remind us of the invaluable blessings , which as a nation , we enjoy . They serve to revive the otherwise slumbering virtue and energies of the Republic-strengthening , when the danger is overcome , the bonds which connect the confederacy . The great struggle of 1860 is already at hand : the opposition have been compelled by political or party exigencies to unmask their sectional batteries . While the thunders of the conflict are gathering , let the Democratic legions rally in united column once more to confront and conquer the adversaries of the State Rights , and the enemies of our common Constitution and common country .
