ART* VJI. - Lectures on Art , and Poems . By WAS HINGTON ALLSTON . Edited by RICHARD HENRY DANA , JR . New York : Baker &amp; Scribner. 1850. l2mo. pp. 380 . IT is now seven years since the remains of Washington Aliston , the greatest artist of America , were followed by mourning friends and admirers to the old burying ground in Cambridge . It was universally felt that a man of the rarest genius and the loveliest character had been removed from a community which his presence honored and his influence exalted . The first steps were taken towards commemorating his life and works by raising a monument to his memory in the beautiful neighboring necropolis of Mount Auhurn , which should he worthy of the genius and virtues of him who slept beneath it , and fitly express the affectionate and admiring recollections of the survivors who reared it there . Such a monument was not needed for Allston 's fame ; that is forever established by the works in which his spirit yet lives , and over which the waves of oblivion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own credit , and for our own intellectual satisfaction and moral good . We should not have allowed the busy occupations of daily life so to employ our hands and fill our hearts , as to permit him whom we admired for his surpassing genius , and loved for the possession of every gentle and noble virtue , to lie down in the long sleep of death with no monumental pile to fix the eye of the traveller , and to express to the world by the silent voice of art how much we reverenced the memory of art 's most devoted worshipper . We trust this duty to the illustrious dead is not to remain forever unperformed . In - heathen times , in the earliest dawn of poetry , the pious feelings of the living made the burial rites and monumental mound contribute even to the felicity of the departed . " Such honors limo to her hero paid , And peaceful slept the mighty Hector 's shade . " Mr. Aliston 's life was entirely occupied with those pursuits which address themselves to man 's higher nature . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serenity of that elevated region in which his pure spirit moved . In the kindred arts of poetry , painting , and romance , be showed the 13 * // versatile felicity of his genius . In early life , while yet a student of painting in Rome , his works attracted the admiration of his brother artists , and an able critic , in Bunsen 's volnines on Rome , declares that the coloring of his pictures approached nearer the great Italian masters than those of any other modern painter . It was his good fortune to enjoy for many years the friendship of Coleridge , whose estimation of Allston 's poetical genius was shown by printing , accompanied with high hut well deserved praises , in a volume of his own poems , Allston 's noble lines , " America to England , " which have become classical in our literature . His romance of Monaldi was reviewed in this Journal on its first appearance . The high opinion we then expressed of its merits - the powerful conception of the principal characters - the tragic interest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purity and splendor of the style - remains unchanged , after many readings and the lapse of years . " He is not only a painter , " says the German translator of this work , in the introduction to his version , " not only a historical painter , not only a painter with the pencil and pallet , but also with the pen , and , I believe , one of the best poets in this country . He is , moreover , a very noble roan . " " In the arrangement of the whole , " ( he speaks of Monaldi , ) " in the distribution of light and shade , in the economy of the piece , there is somewhat pictorial . " Again , " The whole appears to me like a great landscape-historical picture , with fore-ground , middle-ground , and back-ground , full of life , truth , and thought . The execution of the single groups is eminently successful ; there are , perhaps , defects , but only in the completing transitions . Mr. Allston 's universally recognized position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the first in our age , will make the volume whose title is placed at the head of the present brief paper a welcome gift , not only to all the lovers of art , but to all who take an interest in elegant literature . The spirit of beauty which breathes through his poetical writings - the offspring of hours of rest from the labors of the pencil - will fill with delight the breasts of those who fly to the Muse for solace amidst the multiplying cares of life , or seek in poetry for the graceful embellishments that idealize the business of the crowded day . The // gentle dignity of Mr. Aliston 's personal character was such that in his presence all discord died away , and tbe conflict of opposing opinions softened into the richest harmony of friendly discourse . The pride of letters , the jealousies of artists , the spirit of detraction vanished before his genial smile , and the kindly urhanity of his manner . The hlandness of his evervaried conversation , uttered in a voice of singular sweetness and power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Attic purity and felicity of his wit , made his society the greatest delight to all who enjoyed the rare happiness of living in his neighborhood and of sharing in his social nights . Mr. Allston never had an enemy . One would as soon have thought of indulging in hostile feelings against a star as against him , so completely was he removed from the region of evil passions and strife . Men of the most opposite opinions , belonging to different schools upon every subject of human thought , agreed in the common sentiment of reverence and love for Allston ; and his life , with its comprehensive influences for good , and good alone , and good in its highest and most permanent forms , is a perfect refutation of the pernicious theory , that a great man must work out the purposes of his existence by a constant warfare against his fellow men . Of Mr. Allston 's position as an artist , we do not propose to speak ; nor is it necessary to enlarge upon what is recognized by the best judges both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited in a few well-known pieces , has been unanimously acknowledged . The Sylphs of the Seasons , The Paint King , America to Great Britain , to which allusion has already been made , stand , and have long stood , among the most beautiful poems in American literature . Mr. Allston 's poetical style is remarkable for the careful finishing hand with which he elaborated every part of every poem . He never fell into the negligent , slip-shod , vague , and half expressed mannerism , so common in these days . His practice as an artist was carried into his writings , and applied scrupulously to every production of his pen . The exquisite purity of his language , reminding us constantly of the fine coloring of his pencil , shows how thoroughly his taste was guarded , in the atmosphere of beauty that accompanied his mind , from all touch of contemporary faults . Loving heartily every genial variety of literature , whether // belonging to the past or present , and showing , both in conversation and writing , with what a ready and versatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected his own style to a rigid self-criticism that harmonizes with the principles of an earlier and more classical age , rather than with the romantic outflow of the present . His poetical writings , therefore , will not undergo the changes of opinion incident to the fleeting popularity of temporary mannerism . They Will stand the test of time . The criticism of posterity will find in them the same qualities to praise that have commended them to the approbation of the wisest contemporary judges . The following little poem , expressing in words the spirit of one of Mr. Allston 's most admired pictures ; Rosalie , is one of the sweetest compositions that ever flowed from poet 's pen - " 0 , pour upon my soul again That sad , unearthly strain , That seems from other worlds to plain ; Thus falling , falling from afar , As if some melancholy star Had mingled with her light her sighs , And dropped them from the skies ! " No , - never came from aught below This melody of woe , That makes my heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ; that with it brings This nameless light , - if light it he ,  - -  That veils the world I see . " For all I see around me wears The hue of other spheres ; And something blent of smiles and tears Comes from the very air I breathe . 0 , nothing , sure , the stars beneath Can mould a sadness like to this , - So like angelic bliss . " So , at that dreamy hour of day When the last lingering ray Stops on the highest cloud to play , - So thought the gentle Rosalie , As on her maiden reverie First fell the strain of him who stole In music to her soul . // As a pendant to this , we quote the lines on Horatio Green-. ough 's well-known Group of the Angel and Child , both as a fine example of Allston 's power of translating into poetry the conceptions of art , and of his generous appreciation of the works of other artists . I stood alone : nor word , nor other sound , Broke the mute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her midnight sleep , Leaving the wintry stars her watch to keep , So slept she now at noon . But not alone My spirit then ; a light within me shone That was not mine ; and feelings undefined , And thoughts , flowed in upon me not my own . T was that deep mystery , - for aye unknown , - The living presence of another 's mind . Another mind was there , - the gift of few , - That by its own strong will can all that 's true In its own nature unto others give , And , mingling life with life , seem there to live . I felt it then in mine : and , 0 , how fair , How beautiful , the thoughts that met me there , Visions of Love and Purity and Truth ! Though form distinct had each , they seemed as t were Embodied all of one celestial air , To beam for ever in coequal youth . And thus I learned , as in the mind they moved , These Stranger Thoughts the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t was true , And Truth , because t was pure , the first did woo ; While Love , as pure and true , did love the twain ; Thea Love was loved of them , for that sweet chain That bound them all . Thus sure , as passionless , Their love did grow , till one harmonious strain Of melting sounds they seemed ; then , changed again , One Angel Form they took , - Self-Happiness . This Angel Form the gifted Artist saw , That held me in his spell . T was his to draw The veil of sense , and see the immortal race , The Forms spiritual that know not place . He saw it in the quarry , deep in earth , And stayed it by his will , and gave it birth E'en to the world of sense ; bidding its cell , The cold , hard marble , thus in plastic girth The shape ethereal fix , and body forth A Being of the skies , - with man to dwell . // And then another Form beside it stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warm blood Had from it passed , - exhaled as in a breath Drawn from its lips by the cold kiss of Death . Its little " dream of human life " had fled ; And yet it seemed not numbered with the dead , But one emerging to a life so bright , That , as the wondrous nature o'er it spread , Its very consciousness did seem to shed Rays from within , and clothe it all in light . Now touched the Angel Form its little hand , Turning upon it with a look so bland , And yet so full of majesty , as less Than holy natures never may impress , - And more than proudest guilt unmoved may brook . The Creature of the Earth now felt that look , And stood in blissful awe , - as one above , Who saw its name in the Eternal Book , And Him that opened it ; e'en Him that took The Little Child , and blessed it in his love . We close our extracts from this part of the volume with a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Ennuy*e . It will be remembered that Mrs. Jameson , whose works are among the most delightful books of the day , visited the United States some years ago , and during the lifetime of Mr. Allston . Her cultivated taste , and her enthusiastic love of the beautiful , led her to seek out and study all the pictures of our artist which were then accessible . She also became personally acquainted with the artist himself , being drawn to him not only by affinity of taste and genius , but doubtless somewhat by the impression made upon her , by this elegant poem , written long before her visit , and which we had ourselves the pleasure of placing in her hands . In the charming book Mrs. Jameson published on her return to England , appeared an eloquent and appreciating estimate of Mr. Allston . Sweet , gentle Sibyl ! would I had the charm , E'en while the spell upon my heart is warm , To waft my spirit to thy far.off dreams , That , giving form and melody to air , The long.sealed fountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toss their starry stream , Flushed with the living light which youth alone Sheds like the flash from heaven , - that straight is gone ! // For thou hast waked as from the sleep of years , - No , not the memory , with her hopes and fears , But e'en the breathing , bounding , present youth ; And thou hast waked him in that vision clime , Which , having seen , no eye the second time May ever see in its own glorious truth ; - As if it were not , in this world of strife , Save to the first deep consciousness of life . And yet , by thy sweet sorcery , is mine Again the same fresh heart , - e'en fresh as thine , - As when , entranced , I saw the mountain kings , The giant Alps , from their dark purple beds iRise ere the sun , * the while their crowned heads Flashed with his thousand heralds ' golden wings ; The while the courtly Borromean Isles Looked on their mirrored forms with rippling smiles . E'en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peerless Italy , thy gorgeous skies , Thy lines of harmony , thy nameless hues , - As t were by passing Angels sportive dropped From flowers of Paradise , but newly cropped , Still bathed and glittering with celestial dews ! I see thee , - and again what visions pass , Called up by thee , as in some magic glass ! Again I feel the Tuscan Zephyrs brush My youthful brow , and see them laughing rush , As if their touch another sense had given , Swift o'er the dodging grass , like living things ; In myriads glancing from their flickering wings The rose and azure of their native heaven ; - And now they mount , and through the sullen green Of the dark laurel dart a silvery sheen . 0 , now , as once , pure playmates of the soul ! Bear me , as then , where the white billows roll Of yon ethereal ocean , poised above . how touching thus from that o'erhanging sea To look upon the world ! Now , more to me Its wrongs and sorrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than where its pleasures press , And throng me r6und as one whom they would bless . // The portion of the volume which will excite the most interest and attention at the present moment , consists of the Lectures on Art , now for the first time printed . In an article published in this Journal six or seven years ago , we took occasion to allude to these discourses , which it had been our great privilege to hear read by their author . The impression we had received , and the opinion we expressed in the paper referred to , have been sustained by a careful perusal of them in print . We regard them as the most important addition to the literature of art which has been made within our memory ; and the literature of art , we need not say , is one of the most attractive to people of high intellectual culture . Our language does not abound in works of this description ; but the few we do possess are of great merit , as they are generally the recorded experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they have every other , with exhaustive erudition and profound speculation . The Italians , who live and move and have their being in an atmosphere of art , have also accomplished much . Lanzi ' s History of Painting is an elaborate but not very lively work Vasari , himself a distinguished artist of the sixteenth century , and known throughout Europe by his writings , and Benvenuto Cellini , whose autobiography was translated in so masterly a manner by Goethe , are among the most eminent who have contributed by their pens to illustrate the arts to which their lives were consecrated ; but their works make only a small portion of what Italy has done in this department . In England , the classical Flaxman , known everywhere for the severe purity of his designs , delivered a course of ten lectures on Sculpture to the pupils of the Royal Academy , which , notwithstanding some literary defects owing to his imperfect training in youth , will ever remain a standard work . Especially , the two lectures on Beauty and Composition will deserve the attention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we read these discourses , we are constantly reminded of those matchless outlines from Homer , . ZEschylus , Hesiod , and Dante , appreciated and admired among all civilized nations ; which , creating a severe but lovely style of art , have never been equalled or approached by any of their innumerable imitators . Fuseli 's lectures are valuable , though often badly written , and abounding with half devel // oped ideas . He was an able critic and an accomplished scholar , as his correspondence with Cowper upon that poet 's translation of Homer shows ; but he was an extravagant and tasteless artist , and the influence of his genius has nearly died away . His writings , however , deserve to keep their place in literature . It is hardly necessary to allude to Sir Joshua Reynolds 's Discourses , which have long since become a permanent part of the fine literature of England , on account of the quiet elegance of their style . They do not , however , handle the topics of art with much depth of philosophic insight . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they must always be read wherever English culture reaches , for they are a noble monument of a great age in the history of the land of our ancestors. * Of English works in the present day , two deserve especial mention ; " The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression as connected with the Fine Arts , " by Sir Charles Bell , and Mr. Ruskin 's brilliant volumes on the Painters . The former is a matchless treatise , whether we regard the beauty and vigor of the style , the accuracy of observation , or the profound and far-reaching science exhibited in every sentence of its elaborate pages . The latter is written with much knowledge of art , and in a style whose eloquence , generally picturesque , occasionally magnificent , always exciting , yet sometimes rises into a rarefied atmosphere of expression , where meaning first becomes gaseous and then vanishes into the empyrean . The author is a hold speculator , and runs against received opinions with the dauntless intrepidity of a mailed knight in the lists of a tournament . His vivid imagination often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendor of his sentences than rely upon his opinions , admit his premises , or understand his principles . He rushes fiercely into the two opposite extremes of the iconoclast and the idolater . He takes a weird delight in pulling down the Old Masters from their heights of fame , and in setting up far above them the wildest and most erring mannerist of the age . From this brief excursion , we return to Mr. Allston . We think it must be obvious to every reflecting reader , that in * Mr. Dana has fallen mm an accidental error in mentioning Reynolds among the personal friends of Mr. Allston . Rcynolds dicd in U92 , and Mr. Aliston did not go to England until 1801. // some respects , he was better qualified to discuss the subject of art than any of his predecessors . As we have shown , he combined the most comprehensive experience in studying the great works of the artists of all ages and nations , during his long residence abroad , and especially in the plastic period of his youth , with various study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole lay a thorough classical education , which adorned the native elegance of his mind and manners with the fairest flowers and the ripest fruits of scholarship . In this circumstance we find one of the sources of the harmonious growth of his genius . Too many of our artists - and it is to some extent the same with the artists of other countries - enter upon the career that is to occupy their lives , unfurnished with the learning and culture which an early classical education alone can give ; and they continue , to their great disadvantage and regret , to manifest a certain crudity in matters beyond their special art , and a one-sided development , materially impairing the satisfaction they would otherwise take in their pursuits and the genial influence they might exercise in their appropriate sphere . We are constantly impressed , in Mr. Allston 's writings on art , with the completeness of his intellectual view , and the freedom with which he moves through the whole compass of thought in the domain of art and through all the provinces connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius of Coleridge left unmistakable traces upon his mind , and decided the peculiar coloring of his speculative views ; but he has nowhere wandered into the obscurities which too often darkened the struggling conceptions of that great writer . Whatever of Coleridge 's philosophy retained its hold upon Mr. Allston was so blended with his independent meditations , that it served only to heighten them by the hues of a spiritual manner of thinking , harmonizing admirably with the poetical light thrown by his own genius over all the objects of thought . These discourses , four in nmhber , contain , as it were , the essence of Allston 's entire artistic life . They had grown up in his mind , not for any special occasion , but as embodying the experiences of his intellectual being . Accordingly they are , like his poems , totally free from the mannerisms of the times , and are , in the highest and best sense of the word , onginal. // They have their root in his inmost nature , and they have ripened into the bright consummate flower by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the completeness of his works of art , while the fresh vitality of the most intense intellectual life flows through every part of them . As we read them , we are in the presence of the very soul of Allston ; and whether we agree or not with all of his philosophical statements , we are drawn into perfect sympathy with the lofty spirit of their author ; we feel that the mighty magic of genius , sanctified by purity of purpose , and raised almost to prophetic grandeur by the inspiration of religion , is swaying our spirits at will . The charm of Mr. Allstori*s exquisite style is here displayed in its highest perfection . Polished to that point where the fullest vigor and the nicest finish meet , it is moulded into forms of expression fitly adapted to the depth , completeness , and elegance of the thought . It is richly wrought , where the subject naturally lifts itself into the stately sweep of harmonious expression , and again falls into an unadorned simplicity , and sometimes even a rigid precision of phrase , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vivid flow of the composition ; and it passes through all these changes with such an equable and gentle movement , that we seem listening , as it were , to the rising and falling of an . ZEolian harp . Mr. Allston did not live to complete his plan , nor did he ever deliver these discourses , as he had hoped to do , before an audience of artists and scholars in Boston . But each discourse , as we have said , forms almost a treatise by itself . We lament that we have not the series , as he intended to carry it out ; but those we have lose little of their value , and none of their interest , by their isolation from the rest . In a preliminary note , Mr. Allston gives a philosophical explanation of the term idea , as he uses it through his Lectures . This note should be carefully studied , and the substance of it accurately remembered by the reader . It is not only a good illustration of Mr. Allston 's power of metaphysical analysis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discourses that follow ; indeed , it may be said to lay the foundation for his theory of art . The principal topic discussed in the introductory discourse is Beauty ; and it would be interesting to compare what Mr Allston says , with the views of Flaxman , who devotes a lec // ture to it , and of Bell , who handles the subject briefly , but with consummate ability . Connected with this by an admirable chain of associations , are analyses of Truth , and Goodness , and the Ideas which their manifestations in form and action represent . We quote a few paragraphs . " We do not say that these eternal Ideas of Beauty , Truth , and Goodness will , strictly speaking , always act . Though indestructible , they may be banished for a time by the perverted Will , and mockeries of the brain , like the fume.born phantoms from the witches ' caldron in Macbeth , take their places , and assume their functions . We have examples of this in every age , and perhaps in none more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can not be forgotten : nay , they are but too often recalled with unwelcome distinctness . Could we read the annals which must needs be scored on every heart , - could we look upon those of the aged reprobate , - who will doubt that their darkest passages are those made visible by the distant gleams from these angelic Forms , that , like the Three which stood before the tent of Abraham , once looked upon his youth ? " And we doubt not that the truest witness to the common source of these inborn Ideas would readily be acknowledged by all , could they return to it now with their matured power of introspection , which is , at least , one of the few advantages of advancing years . But , though we can not bring back youth , we may still recover much of its purer revelations of our nature from what has been left in the memory . From the dim present , then , we would appeal to that fresher time , crc the young spirit had shrunk from the overbearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emotions we then felt from the Beautiful , the True , and the Good , did not seem in some way to refer to a common origin . And we would also ask , if it was then frequent that the influence from one was singly felt , - if it did not rather bring with it , however remotely , a sense of something , though widely differing , yet still akin to it . When we have basked in the beauty of a summer sunset , was there nothing in the sky that spoke to the soul of Truth and Goodness ? And when the opening intellect first received the truth of the great law of gravitation , or felt itself mounting through the profound of space , to travel with the planets in their unerring rounds , did never then the kindred Ideas of Goodness and Beauty chime in , as it were , with the fabled music , - not fabled to the soul , - which led you on like one entranced ? " And again , when , in the passive quiet of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genial , you have looked abroad on this marvellous , ever teeming Earth , - ever teeming alike for mind and body , - and have felt upon you flow , as from // ten thousand springs of Goodness , Truth , and Beauty , ten thousand streams of innocent enjoyment ; did you not then almost hear them shout in confluence , and almost see them gushing upwards , as if they would prove their unity , in one harmonious fountain ? " We should like to quote several passages from the same lecture , on the Sublime ; but we must hurry forward to other topics , after one more paragraph on Beauty . " It would seem , then , that , in relation to man , Beauty is the extreme point , or last summit , of the natural world , since it is in that that we recognize the highest emotion of which we are susceptible from the purely physical . If we ascend thence into the moral , we shall find its influence diminish in the same ratio with our upward progress . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the link above it where the moral modification begins seems scarcely changed , yet the difference , though slight , demands another name , and the nomenclator within us calls it Elegance ; in the next connecting link , the moral adjunct becomes more predominant , and we call it Majesty ; in the next , the physical becomes still fainter , and we call the union Grandeur ; in the next , it seems almost to vanish , and a new form rises before us , so mysterious , so undefined and elusive to the senses , that we turn , as if for its more distinct image , within ourselves , and there , with wonder , amazement , awe , we see it filling , distending , stretching every faculty , till , like the Giant of Otranto , it seems almost to burst the imagination : under this strange confluence of opposite emotions , this terrible pleasure , we call the awful form Sublimity . This was the still small voice that shook the Prophet on Horeb ; - though small to his ear , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear it again and live . " The next discourse is on the general subject of Art and its characteristics , especially in relation to Painting and Sculpture . These characteristics are laid down as Originality , Human or Poetic Truth , Invention , and Unity , the synthesis of them all . They are treated with consummate eloquence and ability ; and the principles here developed apply as well to elegant literature as to the special subject of Painting or Sculpture . But instead of quoting any part of his general observations or reasonings , we will transfer to our pages a description of a Dutch painting , illustrative of Mr. Allston 's ideas of invention , followed by another in a very different style ; and we shall confess ourselves entirely mistaken if the reader does not feel that the word-pictures before him are vivid transcripts of 14* // their originals , such as never before have been committed to language . " The interior of a Dutch cottage forms the scene of Ostade 's work , presenting something between a kitchen and a stable . Its principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hung up to dry ; subordinate to which is a woman nursing an infant ; the accessories , various garments , pots , kettles , and other culinary utensils . " The bare enumeration of these coarse materials would naturally predispose the mind of one , unacquainted with the Dutch school , to expect any thing but pleasure ; indifference , not to say disgust , would seem to be the only possible impression from a picture composed of such ingredients . And such , indeed , would be their effect under the hand of any but a real Artist . Let us look into the picture , and follow Ostade 's mind , as it leaves its impress on the several objects . Observe how he spreads his principal light , from the suspended carcass to the surrounding objects , moulding it , so to speak , into agreeable shapes , here by extending it to a bit of drapery , there to an earthen pot ; then connecting it , by the flash from a brass kettle , with his second light , the woman and child ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a labyrinth of broken chairs , old baskets , roosting fowls , and bits of straw , till a glimpse of sunshine , from a halfopen window , gleams on the eye , as it were , like an echo , and sending it back to the principal object , which now seems to act on the mind as the luminous source of a11 these diverging lights . But the magical whole is not yet completed ; the mystery of color has been called in to the aid of light , and so subtly blends that we can hardly separate them ; at least , until their united effect has first been felt , and after we have begun the process of cold analysis . Yet , even then , we can not long proceed before we find the charm returning ; as we pass from the blaze of light on the carcass , where all the tints of the prism seem to be faintly subdued , we are met on its borders by the dark harslet , glowing like rubies ; then we repose awhile on the white cap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again by the flickering strife of the antagonist colors on a blue jacket and red petticoat ; then the strife is softened by the low yellow of a straw-bottomed chair ; and thus with alternating excitement and repose do we travel through the picture , till the scientific explorer loses the analyst in the unresisting pussiveness of a poetic dream . Now , all this will no doubt appear to many , if not absurd , at least exaggerated ; but not so to those who have ever felt the sorcery of color . They , we are sure , will be the last to question the character of the feeling because of the ingredients which worked the spell , and // if true to themselves , they must call it poetry . Nor will they consider it any disparagement to the all-accomplished Raphael to say of Ostade that he also was an Artist . " We turn now to a work of the great Italian , - the Death of Ananias . The scene is laid in a plain apartment , which is wholly devoid of ornament , as became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apostles ( then eleven in number ) have assembled to transact the temporal husiness of the Church , and are standing together on a slightly elevated platform , about which , in various attitudes , some standing , others kneeling , is gathered a promiscuous assemblage of their new converts , male and female . This quiet assembly ( for we still feel its quietness in the midst of the awful judgment ) is suddenly roused by the sudden fall of one of their brethren ; some of them turn and see him struggling in the agonies of death . A moment before he was in the vigor of life , - as his muscular limbs still hear evidence ; hut he had uttered a falsehood , and an instant after his frame is convulsed from head to foot . Nor do we doubt for a moment as to the awful cause ; it is almost expressed in voice by those nearest to him and , though varied by their different temperaments , hy terror , astonishment , and submissive faith , this voice has yet but one meaning , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible words , as if audible to the mind , now direct us to him who pronounced his doom , and the singly-raised finger of the Apostle marks him the judge ; yet not of himself , - for neither his attitude , air , nor expression has any thing in unison with the impetuous Peter , - he is now the simple , passive , yet awful instrument of the Almighty : while another on the right , with equal calmness , though with more severity , by his elevated arm , as beckoning to judgment , anticipates the fate of the entering Sapphira . Yet all is not done ; lest a question remain , the Apostle on the left confirms the judgment . No one can mistake what passes within him ; like one transfixed in adoration , his uplifted eyes seem to ray out his soul , as if in recognition of the divine tribunal . But the overpowering thought of Omnipotence is now tempered hy the human sympathy of his companion , whose open hands , connecting the past with the present , seem almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisite turn , we are next brought to John , the gentle almoner of the Church , who is dealing out their portions to the needy brethren . And here , as most remote from the judged Ananias , whose suffering seems not yet to have reached it , we find a spot of repose , - not to pass by , but to linger upon , till we feel its quiet influence diffusing itself over the whole mind nay , till , connecting it with the beloved Disciple , we find it leading us back through the exciting scene , modifying even our deepest emotions with a kindred tranquillity . // " This is Invention ; we have not moved a step through the picture but at the will of the Artist . He invented the chain which we have followed , link by link , through every emotion , assimilating many into one ; and this is the secret by which he prepared us , without exciting horror , to contemplate the struggle of mortal agony . " This too is Art ; and the highest art , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tempered , as it were , to our mysterious desires . In the work of Ostade , we see the same inventive power , no less effective , though acting through the medium of the humblest materials . " We add to these a magnificent passage on the Farnese Hercules , contrasted with the Apollo Belvedere , in illustration of his idea of Truth . " Of the immutable nature of this peculiar Truth , we have a like instance in the Farnese Hercules ; the work of the Grecian sculptor Glycon , - we had almost said his immortal offspring . Since the time of its birth , cities and empires , even whole nations , have disappeared , giving place to others , more or less barbarous or civilized ; yet these are as nothing to the countless revolutions which have marked the interval in the manners , habits , and opinions of men . Is it reasonable , then , to suppose that any thing not immutable in its nature could possibly have withstood such continual fluctuation ? But how have all these changes affected this visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jot ; and because what is true is independent of opinion ; it is the same to us now as it was to the men of the dust of antiquity . The unlearned spectator of the present day may not , indeed , see in it the Demigod of Greece ; but he can never mistake it for a mere exaggeration of the human form ; though of mortal mould , he can not doubt its possession of more than mortal powers ; he feels its essential life , for he feels before it as in the stirring presence of a superior being . " Perhaps the attempt to give form and substance to a pure Idea was never so perfectly accomplished as in this wonderful figure . Who has ever seen the ocean in repose , in its awful sleep , that smooths it like glass , yet can not level its unfathomed swell ? So seems to us the repose of this tremendous personification of strength : the laboring eye heaves on its slumbering sea of muscles , and trembles like a skiff as it passes over them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become audible ; the startled imagination hears it in its rage , sees it in motion , and sees its resistless might in the passive wrecks that follow the uproar . And this from a piece of marble , cold , immovable , life . // less ! Surely there is that in man , which the senses can not reach , nor the plumb of the understanding sound . " Let us now turn to the Apollo called Belvedere . In this supernal being , the human form seems to have been assumed as if to make visible the harmonious confluence of the pure ideas of grace , fleetness , and majesty ; nor do we think it too fanciful to add celestial splendor ; for such , in effect , are the thoughts which crowd , or rather rush , into the mind on first beholding it . Who that saw it in what may be called the place of its glory , the Gal . lery of Napoleon , ever thought of it as a man , much less as a statue ; but did not feel rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - of one who had just lighted on the earth , and with a step so ethereal , that the next instant he would vault into the air ? If I may be permitted to recall the impression which it made as myself , I know not that I could better describe it than as a sudden intellectual flash , filling the whole mind with light - and light in motion . It seemed to the mind what the first sight of the sun is to the senses , as it emerges from the ocean ; when from a point of light the whole orb at once appears to bound from the waters , and to dart its rays , as by a visible explosion , through the profound of space . But , as the deified Sun , how completely is the conception verified in the thoughts that follow the effulgent original and its marble counterpart ! Perennial youth , perennial brightness , follow them both . Who can imagine the old age of the sun ? As soon may we think of an old Apollo . Now all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grant . ed , - yet will it not thus be explained away . For that is the very faculty addressed by every work of Genius , - whose nature is suggestive ; and only when it excites to or awakens congenial thoughts and emotions , filling the imagination with corresponding images , does it attain its proper end . The false and the com . monplace can never do this . " It were easy to multiply similar examples ; the bare mention of a single name in modern art might conjure up a host ,  --  the name of Michael Angelo , the mighty sovereign of the Ideal , than whom no one ever trod so near , yet so securely , the dizzy brink of the Impossible . " The next discourse is on the subject of Form , and upon this much disputed matter we think Mr. Allston has thrown a great deal of new light . He thus summarily and satisfactorily disposes of a very common theory , - that of an ideal or standard form . S " Let us now endeavor to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as presented by the myriads which people the // earth . But whose imagination is equal to the task , - to the setting in array before it the countless multitudes , each individual in his proper form , his proper character ? Were this possible , we should stand amazed at the interminable differences , the hideous variety ; and that , too , no less in the moral , than in the physical ; nay , so opposite and appalling in the former as hardly to be figured by a chain of animals , taking for the extremes the fierce and filthy hyena and the inoffensive lamb . This is man in the concrete , - to which , according to some , is to be applied the abstract Ideal ! " Now , let us attempt to conceive of a being that shall represent all the diversities of mind , affections , and dispositions , that fleck this heterogeneous mass of humanity , and then to conceive of a Form that shall be in such perfect affinity with it as to indicate them all . The bare statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the office of a Standard Form ; and this it must do , or it will be a falsehood . Nor should we find it easier with any given number , with twenty , fifty , nay , an hundred ( so called ) generic forms . We do not hesitate to affirm , that , were it possible , it would be quite as easy with one as with a thousand . " The empirical rules are then examined , and the ground , or rather groundlessness , of most of them , is clearly set forth ; but , in conclusion , they are admitted to be expedient fictions , - in other words , not absolute laws , but only such practical directions as may be set aside by the higher authority of the artist " in whose mind alone is the ultimate rule . " The fourth and last discourse is on Composition , of which Mr. Allston lays down the following as the required characteristics . " First , Unity of Purpose , as expressing the general sentiment or intention of the Artist . Secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shape , quantity , and line . Thirdly , Continuity , as expressed by the connection of parts with each other , and their relation to the whole . Fourthly , Harmony of Parts . " The following brief sketches will exhibit the manner in which some of these characteristics are illustrated . " In the wild and stormy scenes of Salvator Rosa , they break upon us as with the angular flash of lightning ; the eye is dashed one precipice only to be dashed down another ; then , suddenly hurried to the sky , it shoots up , almost in a direct line , to some sharp-edged rock ; whence pitched , as it were , into a sea of clouds , // bellying with circles , it partakes their motion , and seems to reel , to roll , and to plunge with them into the depths of air . " If we pass from Salvator to Claude , we shall find a system of lines totally different . Our first impression from Claude is that of perfect unity , and this we have even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , circumscribing his scenes by a magic circle , he had imposed his own mood on all who entered it . The spell then opens ere it seems to have begun , acting upon us with a vague sense of limitless expanse , yet so continuous , so gentle , so imperceptible in its remotest gradations , as scarcely to be felt , till , combining with unity , we find the feeling embodied in the complete image ' of intellectual repose , - fulness and rest . The mind thus disposed , the charmed eye glides into the scene : a soft , undulating light leads it on , from bank to bank , from shrub to shrub ; now leaping and sparkling over pebbly brooks and sunny sands ; now fainter and fainter , dying away down shady slopes , then seemingly quenched in some secluded dell ; yet only for a moment , - for a dimmer ray again carries it onward , gently winding among the boles of trees and rambling vines , that , skirting the ascent , seem to hem in the twilight ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towns , and woods and streams , when it finally dips into an ocean , so far off , so twin-like with the sky , that the doubtful horizon , unmarked by a line , leaves no point of rest : and now , as in a flickering arch , the fascinated eye seems to sail upward like a bird , wheeling its flight through a mottled labyrinth of clouds , on to the zenith ; whence , gently inflected by some shadowy mass , it slants again downward to a mass still deeper , and still to another , and another , until it falls into the darkness of some massive tree , - focused like midnight in the brightest noon : there stops the eye , instinctively closing , and giving place to the Soul , there to repose and to dream her dreams of romance and love . " The following pithy paragraph is of universal application . " We might go on thus with every great name in Art . But these examples are enough to show how much even the most original minds , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the social law of our nature applies no less to the intellect than to the affections . When applied to genius , it may be called the social inspiration , the simple statement of which seems to us of itself a solution of the oft-repeated question , Why is it that genius always appears in clusters ? ' To Nature , indeed , we must all at last recur , as to the only true and permanent foundation of real excellence . But Nature is open to all men alike , in her beauty , her majesty , her grandeur , and her sublimity . Yet who will assert that all men see , or , if they see , are impressed by these her // attributes alike ? Nay , so great is the difference , that one might almost suppose them inhabitants of different worlds . Of Claude , for instance , it is hardly a metaphor to say that he lived in two worlds during his natural life ; for Claude the pastry-cook could never have seen the same world that was made visible to Claude the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works , that gave birth to his intellect at the age of forty . There is something , perhaps , ludicrous in the thought of an infant of forty . Yet the fact is a solemn one , that thousands die whose minds have never been horn . " With these passages we must close our notice of these precious remains , - this golden legacy to the art and literature of our country . The book will sink deeply into the mind of the age , and its influence will slowly but surely extend itself through the whole domain of American culture . We rejoice to hear that the Life and Correspondence of Mr. Allston , - now , it is understood , in preparation by a distinguished relative and a kindred genius , - will soon be published . We can foresee , and we venture to predict for them , a welcome as cordial as the warmest friends of the subject and the editor can desire .
