txt ART . YII. - WILSON 'S CHURCH IDENTIFIED . The Church Identified , by a Reference to the History of its Origin , Perpetuation , and Extension into the united States . By the Rev. W. ID . WILsoI , D.D. , Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy and of History in Geneva College . New York : Stanford &amp; Swords , 137 Broadway . 1850 . THE first edition , or " giving forth , ' * of this work , as we are told in the preface of the stereotype edition , which is before us , was in a series of articles which appeared in The Churchman during the autumn and winter of 1848-9 . These articles were // so kindly received that a second edition , in a book form , was soon called for , with a specific reference to its circulation in the diocese of Western New York . This edition , of only one thousand copies , was exhausted almost at once . The present , or third edition , expanded , freed from ambiguity , guarded and stereotyped , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , of course , a Church classic . As there are those , especially among " the sects , " who may be supposed not yet to have seen this standard work on the history of " the Church , " we have thought it not superfluous or unreasonable to call the attention of such to its design and the manner of its execution . This work , entitled " The Church Identified , " claims to be a new defense , by a new plan , of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States . The author proposes-not directly or indirectly to prove Episcopacy and the apostolical succession essential to the existence of the true church and its several branches  --  but to identify the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States , exclusive of all the claimant modern sects , with the church founded by Christ and the apostles . His plan of doing this is to trace the history of the church as a visible society , from its first planting down to the present time , with " no discussion of points of external order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their importance , " and " irrespective of the . . . . doctrines which it may have taught . " In carrying out this plan of the identification of the church , he proposes to be guided by certain fundamental principles of its extension . We will first try to get a clear idea of our author 's purpose , plan , and principles , and then inquire whether he has carried out his plan , applied his principles , and proved his main conclusion . His purpose is to show the exclusive identity of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States , as a visible society , with the church founded by Christ and the apostles . What does he mean by the identity of the two ? Identity is sameness . Two distinct visible societies , though associated for the same ends , having the same plan of organization , and the same internal regulations , and one established by the other , can not , of course , be numer ' &amp;-cally identical . Two such societies , if they have the same associated design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third , although they have dissimilar organizations , and different internal regulations , and were independent , each of the other , in their origin . There can be no identity between two distinct visible things , other than a similarity in those points which make each an entity . There may be , in this sense , an identity between them , more or less real , according as the points // of similarity are more or less numerous , and the resemblance more or less marked . Two banking associations may be-not one and the same-yet each a banking association . Two Bible societies may be-not one and the same-yet each a Bible society . Two religious associations may be-not one and the same-yet each a Christian church-although each may have been independent of the other in its origin , although they may have dissimilar organizations and regulations , and bear different names . What now says our author ? " Ask any man if he considers the Presbyterian church as a part and branch of the Methodist church , and he will stare at you as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddles . " - p. 237 . To what scrutiny then is not our author himself entitled for putting the same question into his book , arguing it , answering it , and then stereotyping the whole ? " The Presbyterian church , " he says , " is no more a part of the Christian church , properly so called , than it is of the Methodist , the Baptist , or the Congregational church . " They are distinct from each other , and from the apostolical church , he argues , because " they have organizations distinct . " . . . . " No matter how similar in form i.e. , organization and in principle i.e. , doctrine they may be ; yet , historically , and in fact , they are not the same , but distinct from each other . " - p. 236 . But if a similarity in organization and doctrine does not make them identical , and if a numerical identity be an absurdity , what is the identity of which our author is in search ? " Identity of origin . " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , and the Pentecostal church , had the same origin as to time , place , and circumstances ? This were impossible . What then ? They are identical " on t'wardly and hi8toriccdly . " And what is an " outward and historical identity ? " His definite idea we must try to get from certain illustrations which he uses . He instances , for example , the institution of masonry , and the American Bible Society , to show . how they , and by analogy , how the church , may be extended , and hence identified : The first by its separate lodges , the second by its auxiliary societies , and the third by establishing branches of its communion . But to make these illustrations pertinent , he was bound to show either that the Christian church , like the institution of masonry , is a secret society , and has secret principles of its extension ; or that , like the American Bible Society , it has " established principles or provisions for extension , " " rules of organization , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was bound to show that a particular organization is necessary to constitute the Christian church ; what the primitive church organization was ; and that the church was originally extended , and can // be extended , only by establishing and perpetuating that same organization . This would not be consistent with his avowed purpose . And yet , inconsistent as it may seem , he will by no means let us conclude that he does not regard similarity in organization and doctrine essential to the identity of the church in its different branches ; nor let us be ignorant of his view of the primitive ecclesiastical constitution . In his general observations on the " primary sects , " he says , " No one of them has the ministry which our Lord instituted , continued and perpetuated , in the way which has always , in the church , been esteemed essential to its identity No one of them is based upon the creed of the primitive church . " - p. 207 . Episcopacy and the apostolical succession , and the primitive or apostolical creed , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extension , and identity of the church . That they are so , however , he does not purpose , directly or indirectly , to prove , but is simply careful not to oniit saying that from which he would have their necessity both directly and indirectly inferred ! His real purpose , therefore , according to the most definite idea which we can get of it , is to prove the exclusive historical connection and similarity in organization and doctrine , of the Protestant Episcopal church in the United States , with the primitive or apostolical church . What is the plan by which he proposes to accomplish this purpose ? It is simply to trace the history of the church as a visible society , from its first planting down to the present time , irrespective of both the points of its organization and doctrines . Is the plan either feasible or rational ? Suppose he should happen to find the first two or three centuries next the apostolic period a dark age as to historic materials . What would his chain be worth , though perfect from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack two centuries on the apostolic end ? What would it be worth if along the ages it should now and then want a century 's link ? Suppose again , one should propose to settle in his own mind the question , for example , of the identity of a community of modern Jews , so called , with the family of Abraham . Would either reason or faith bid him " take hours of prayerful thought from other labors , and bestow them on this " - namely  --  the question of " endless genealogies , " and the dry , tedious process of tracing the sons of Abraham , from the first , in all their wanderings , and through all their vicissitudes , until the community in question should be thus historically identified ? Or would the only plan which reason or conscience would suggest , be , to look for those marks which the hand of Him who hath scattered these children of Jacob among the nations hath // sealed in their hearts and foreheads ? The former course , we can not but retort upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violation of common sense , which nothing but the stringent demands of a theory could ever occasion . " Take too his illustration of tracing a vine from the root till we have identified a particular branch . Let us state a fact , and raise thereon a supposition . We have seen a vine with some of its branches trained for a distance under the ground , and then raised again to climb and cover a new trellis or espalier . Suppose , in a vineyard of different plants , this process to be indefinitely multiplied . Now , could any one save the vine-dresser , identify these particular branches with their parent stalk , in any other way than by the rule laid down by Him who called himself the true Vine , and his Father the husbandman  --  the rule of common sense- " ye shall know them by theirfruits ? " Take also his illustration of tracing the stream seen from the mountain . Premising that the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States is confessedly not the main church stream , but a tributary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen where it and its sister streams- " these sects " - at last empty ? To say that the Protestant Episcopal Church is one of the mouths by which the main river is emptying itself into the ocean of eternity , would look like seeking to identify the church by the distinctive doctrine of the very newest of the " autothentic sects . " What are the principles by which our author proposes to be guided in carrying out his plan ? He lays down three principles of the extension of the church , by which to be guided in executing his plan for its identification . " ( 1 ) The church must be extended by living members , ( 2 ) going into a place where the church was not previously established , ( 3 ) for the purpose of preaching the true faith , and establishing the communion of the church there . " By the " true faith ' * he means the doctrines of Christianity ; and by " establishing the communion of the church , " he must mean organizing a visible society . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would trace the history of the church , more or less respect to both the points of organization and doctrine  --  and of the particular organization , and the particular doctrines of the branch he is to identify . But his plan precludes all respect to either of these points . How then can he apply his principles ? But read his own words . " The application of the foregoing principles would require an extensive investigation of church history , and it is possible " - ( it ought not to be , surely , if he can do what he purposes , and by the plan and principles which he proposes to follow and apply ) " that in many cases there are no documents extant , from which the precise // state of the facts can be ascertained . " He lays down , therefore , " two other tests , " which he considers as satisfactory , where they can be applied , as a careful examination of the historical facts . They " can be applied , " he says , " with a less minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . " They are to be used , therefore , simply to avoid being tedions to his readers , and to facilitate his pnrpose. " ( it ) Does the society in question claim to be a part of the church that has always existed from the apostles ' days , and to be now in communion with it , or any part of it ? ( 2 ) Does that which is claimed to be the parent church acknowledge the one in question to have been only founded as a branch of herself ? " Apply these tests . A member of the Protestant Episcopal Chnrch of the United States , and a member of the Chnrch of England , meet . " Our church , " says the former , " claims to be a part of yonrs does yonr church acknowledge ours as her offspring ? " " Yes , " is the prompt reply : " the two are mother and daughter . " " But " - interposes a blnnt sectariau - " how is it with the Church of England ? " " The Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established probably by St. Paul himself ! " As the vanqnished sectary can not appeal to Paul-he beats a precipitate retreat ! Seriously , since these tests do not require a minnte " research into history , " it is not easy to see their consistency with our author 's proposed plan . Noticing next our author 's remark , that " the full execution of my plan would require me to go over the whole history of the planting and extension of the church from the day of Pentecost up to the present time , " . . . . which " would require a great deal of dry detail "  --  and bearing in mind his admission concerning the application of his principles-it will not be strange if we find , on inquiry , that he has not carried out his plan - applied his principles  --  or proved his main conclusion . Has he carried out his plan ? The first two chapters and the last two of his book being in no sense historical , have of course no direct relation to his plan . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter , for in this he discusses the point of the importance of those elements of organization which constitute the believers a church or society by themselves . ( Compare , ch. 1 , with p. 57 . ) Not the second chapter , for he devotes this to the discussion of principles inconsistent , as we have seen , with his plan . Not the ninth chapter , for in this the design of the discussion is to show that the identity of the church must be that of spirit . Not the tenth chapter , for in this the end of the discussion is to prove that the identity must be that of moral design . The historical chapters are from the third to the eighth // inclusive . In the third chapter , he barely asserts that in accordance with the principles which he has discussed , " the communion of the church was extended from its first establishment up to the time of the Reformation , with a progressive growth from century to century , until it covered the whole of Europe , the western part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - p. 82 . The next paragraph is a virtual iteration of the same assertion , with several specifications . This is all our author has done in his book by way of trading the history of the church from its first establishment to the Reformation ! Has he applied his principles to the extension of " the Church " by the establishment of branch.communions , through the centuries from the age of the apostles down ? Not in a solitary case , in any age , or in any land , between the apostolic period and the establishment of a branch of the Church of England in America ! He passes , in the paragraph referred to above , over the first two centuries without a comment . He tells us who was consecrated , in the fourth century , the first bishop of Ethiopia  --  but not a word about the Ethiopian church . That in the same century the gospel was preached in Armenia , &amp;c. , but not whether branches of the church were there leo'itimately organized . That in the seventh century ( again passing over two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ireland , and the other from England , planted the church in many parts of Germany , " &amp;c. , but not in accordance with what principles . That in the eighth century Nestorian missionaries converted the Tartars  --  but not whether they inclosed these wild wanderers in Christ 's fold . That in the ninth century the church made its way into Austria , &amp;c. , but not the history of this movement . That in the tenth century it became established in Poland , &amp;c. , but not how . That in the days of the apostles , aLnd probably by an apostle 's own labors , St. Paul 's , the church of England was planted in that island : but he gives no historical account of its planting , and of course has not applied to its planting his principles of church extension and identification . Has he then proved his main conclusion  --  and by the plan and principles which he proposed to follow and apply ? That conclusion is as follows : " 1f now , we can fix our attention upon the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foregoing sections , long enough to see their full force and bearing , I think that we can not fail to see , that it is as certain that the Protestant Episcopal church in these United States is the church of Christ for the people of this Union , throughout its whole extent , and in all its parts , as if no ages of darkness and corruption had intervened between us and the apostles , and no // sects had arisen claiming the Christian name ! " p. 309 . This , our author himself calls the main and all-involving conclusion of his work . The second adjective is by no means a mere redundant epithet . It is fitly chosen and well applied . We should fail to do full justice to our author , did we omit to state the prin* principal positions which his main conclusion involves . ( 1 . ) It involves the position that all the " sectarian " denominations in the United States are guilty of a worse sin than that of schism-the presumptuous sin of being " mere intruders into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the Protestant Episcopal church ! This position is involved in our author 's reasoning against the English Papists , and in his argument on " the nationality of churches . " By " the nationality of churches " - he means- " the fact , that the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the church are commensurate with those of the nation in which it is situated . " And by- " the nationality of an independent branch of the church " - he means - " that the branch of the church which has the right to existence and jurisdiction in any nation at all , has a right to jurisdiction in any and every part of it , and throughout the whole extent of its domain . " The " sectarian " denominations in our country , therefore , according to our author , sustain to the Protestant Episcopal church the relation which we have stated . Let prayer then be made , without ceasing , of " the Church " unto God for " these sects , " for-they know not what they do . ( 2 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communion of the Protestant Episcopal church we can not perform the duties , appropriate the promises , or enjoy the privileges of the gospel . In other words , " sectarian " denominations , however orthodox and sincere , are dupes of a supposition ! Alas ! then , for our departed kindred and friends who " supposed " that in these communions they were walking in the commandments and ordinances of the Lord : who " supposed that they enjoyed the promised presence of the Savior , and the promised comfort of the Holy Ghost ; who fell asleep in Jesus-as they and we " supposed " - " supposing " that when they should awake it would be in his likeness , to be filled with the promised fullness of his joy ! ( 3 . ) The main conclusion involves the position that other denominations have , each of them , a test of conversion not only different from that of the Protestant Episcopal church , that is , from the true test , but distinctively its own . We would like to be informed which of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctive denominational feature or features the test of conversion ? or which of them makes its denominational appellative the synonym of " Christian ? " ( 4 . ) The main conclusion // involves the position , that there is a fundamental difference between the piety of the sects , and the piety of the Protestant Episcopal church . Here , we fear it would be our duty to plead " guilty " - were we to regard our anthor as holding np before us the standard of piety in the Protestant Episcopal church . " The spirit of the church " and " genuine piety " he makes convertible expressions . This " church-spirit , " or " piety , " is said to show itself by a variety of manifestations . The featnres of this manifestation which our author selects as serving to distinguish the " Protestant sects " from the " Protestant Episcopal Church , " and thus as serving to identify the latter exclusive of the former with the primitive church of Christ ,  --  are-not " observance of the moral precepts  --  the duties of good citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperance , sobriety and truth " - these , he says , " may all be regarded as fruits of the Spirit ; and hence these things , or at least a tendency to them , and an approval of them , must be found in all the branches of the church . " But he is liable to find not simply " an approval of them " and " a tendency to them , " but- " these things " themselves , in some of the " Protestant sects . " It will not do , therefore , to make " these things " distinctive tests , or the highest manifestations of genuine piety ! Hence , the test-manifestations which he specifies , and in the order of their announcement , are-charity for the errors , faults and corruptions of the churchregard to the decisions and canons of the early councils concerning the holy days-regard to the divine institutions-regard for litnrgical worship-regard to the festivals of the church ! We simply call for the chapters and verses where Christ and the apostles set forth as secondary tests of piety  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise to the rank of primary or distinctive tests the features which he has brought forward and illustrated . ( 5 . ) The main conclusion involves the position , that the sacraments , and the preaching of the gospel among the sects , are utterly without efficacy ! To expect in any other communion than the Protestant Episcopal church the divinely ordained benefits of baptism , the Lord 's Supper and the ministry , involves the same illogical error , in our author 's view , as the application of what the Scriptures say of the house and worship of God , to the temple and rites of Yishnu ! ( p. 384 . ) This explains why , among " the sects , " baptism never " sanctifies , " " cleanses , " " regenerates , " " closely and intimately unites with Christ , " whatever " very great and very important spiritual effect " these expressions denote ! Explains why the Lord 's Supper is never attended with " a communication or impartation of the body or blood of Christ " to its recipients ; whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language precisely does mean I " Explains why the preaching of the gospel is never accompanied with " the powers of absolution , " whatever we are " disposed to understand the words as implying ! " ( 6 . ) The main conclusion involves the position , that sectarianism*or the disposition of other denominations to maintain their several communions , is the great modern manifestation of the spirit of Antichrist ; that its chief moral causes are pride and self-will ; that it is the principal cause of the infidelity , practical and speculative , which abounds in our land , and of the irreligion of our age and nation , and that , cost what self-denial or struggle it may , it must be abandoned ! That is , the various religious denorninations in the United States must abandon their several communions and unite with the Protestant Episcopal church , before infidelity and irreligion-evils for which all who belong to these sectarian societies or churches are more or less responsible-will cease ! We have no reply to make to such arrogant and absurd assumptions . We rather put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself has so aptly denominated " the main and all-involving conclusion " of his work ? Has he proved this conclusion by the plan which he proposed to follow , and by the principles which he proposed to apply ? Is there , in his book , any continuous process of historical research such as we were led to anticipate , and such as can be likened to the tracing either of a branching vine or of a winding stream ? We have already anticipated , and sufficiently answered these questions in the negative . Indeed , nothing that we have dwelt upon thus far has any direct or indirect historical relation to the main conclusion , excepting the single unsupported statement that St. Paul , probably , introduced the gospel into England ! We should feel , therefore , that some apology were due our readers for having dwelt so long on the irrelevant portions of this book , had we not felt bound to follow the leadings of our author , and had not our purpose been to furnish a key to the beauties of his work as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant Episcopal church of the United States with the primitive or apostolical church , our author professes to have made visible through the church of England . The historical fact which he must have shown is the apostolical origin of the Church of England . And in bringing this fact to light he must have made us see two points : ( 1 . ) That " the church " which Angustin is said to have found in Britain at the close of the sixth century , was planted by the apostles ; ( 2. ) that the visible ecclesiastical institution , known in our day as the Church of England , is identical , as an outward ecclesiastical association , with " the // church " which Augustin is said to have found in Britain . If he has not made us see the first point , after fixing our attention upon the facts and principles that have been brought before our minds long enough to see anything which is not positively invisible-no matter how luminous he may have made , or may not have made , the second point-his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What , then , is his historical proof of the first point in question ? " It is not perfectly certain who first introduced the gospel into England ! " " In the first century , Clement says : St. Paul published righteousness through the whole world , and in so doing , went to the utmost bounds of the west . " ' " Stillin*fieet has shown that this expression was very generally used to include England ! " " In the second century , Iremeus said that the apostles propagated Christianity among the Celtic nations , ' that is , Germans , Gauls and Britons I " " But perhaps the best and most explicit testimony is that of Eusebius He says , that some of the apostles passed over the ocean to the British Islands ! ' " " Jerome , in the fourth century , says that St. Paul having been in Spain , preached the gospel in the western parts . " ' " This is but a small part of the testimony , more or less direct , to this point . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore " it is sufficient , I apprehend , to establish the point that the gospel was established in Britain in the apostolic age , and probably by St. Paul himself ! " With no more explicit or reliable information concerning the first introduction of Christianity into Great Britain , and with no definite knowledge of its history in England , for the first five or six centuries , he professesafter " hours of assiduous toil and prayerful thought . . . . taken from other labors to bestow on this "  --  to have produced an original historical defense of the Protestant Episcopal church in the United States ! We are inclined to think that he has . And we not only further concede " that the novelty of the plan will attract and interest readers ; " but we venture to predict that the execution , for attractive interest , will totally eclipse the novelty ! We have quoted every word of the historical testimony which our author has cited to establish the first point , namely , that the apostles planted " the Church " in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Church of England " is identical , as an outward organized institution , with the church in England , before the visit of Augustin , is set aside from our present examination by our author 's failing to prove the first . But there // is still a point-on the point of the apostolical origin of the Church of England-which our author 's " preface to the stereotype edition " of " The Church Identified , " constrains us to mark and mention . It is this : That the previous edition wholly lacked the historical testimony cited in this to show that the " Church of England " was planted in Britain in the apostolic age , and probably by St. Paul himself . Truly , the previous edition of " The Church Identified " must have been a literary and logical curiosity ! A book professing to identify historically , a single denomination in the United States with the primitive and exclusively apostolical church , through the Church of England , yet giving no historical testimony to show the apostolical origin of the Church of England ! Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits that this point " is not perfectly certain , " and gives no historical facts to define and corroborate the ambiguous legendary statements quoted from the ancient writers ! More than this : Our author has given us no definite history of the Church of England for the first six hundred years ! It is possible that this may be one of the " many cases " in which , as he forewarned us , " there are no documents extant from which the precise state of the facts can be ascertained . " We now propose to give , in a catechetical form , a summary of the results of our examination thus far of this remarkable work . Question 1 . What is the chief object of the work entitled " The Church Identified ? " Answer . The chief object of the work entitled " The Church Identified , " is to enable one with certainty to identify " the Church , " here in these United States , from amidst so many claiming sects . Q. 2 . What is the definite idea of the identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a visible society , having the same organization , order , and doctrines with the primitive or apostolical church is the definite idea of the identity of the church. - p. 207 . Q. 3 . What rule is given to direct us how we may thus certainly and exclusively identify the church ? - ( p. 207 . ) A. Go back to the first planting of the church , and trace its existence down the current of time , in its spread over the face of the earth , until we find it extending itself into our own countrythis is the only sure rule given to direct us how we may certainly and exclusively identify the church. - p. 31 . Q. 4 . What is taught concerning the application of this rule ? A. It is taught that the principles for the application of this rule are those by which the church was extended and expanded by the Apostles. - ( p. 38. ) // Q. 6 . Does the rule given to direct us , how we may with certainty identify " the Church " from amidst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of external order and organization , or respect to the doctrines of the church ? A. The rule given allows of no discussion of points of external order and organization , either as it regards their nature or their importance , and is irrespective of the doctrines of the church. - ( p. 7 , 29 . ) Q. 6 . Do the principles laid down for the application of this rule allow of respect to the points of organization and doctrine ? A. The principles laid down do require that we have respect to both the points of organization and doctrine. - ( pp. 41 , 42 . ) Q. 7 . Is the rule given departed from in any of the chapters of the work entitled " The Church Identified " ? A. The rule given , is departed from throughout chapters 1 , 2 , 9 , 10 , of the work entitled , " The Church Identified . " Q. 8 . Are we led to expect an application of the principles laid down for the application of the rule given to direct us how we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from amidst so many claiming sects ? A. We are led not to expect an application of the principles laid down , &amp;c. , since this would require an extensive investigation of church history ; and it is possible that in many cases there are no documents extant from which the precise state of the facts can be ascertained ! - ( p. 53 . ) Q. 9 . Is any expedient suggested whereby we may dispense with such an extensive and minute research into church history ; meet this possible contingency of a want , in many cases , of the necessary historical documents ; and yet be brought to the same result ? A. Two other tests are suggested , which require not a moment 's research into history , and which , if we but a**ume the apostolical origin of the older church , will settle in our minds the question of the apostolical origin of the younger , as fully as though we had carefully examined into all the facts of the early history of each ! - ( p. 54 . ) Q. 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan proposed for the identification of the church ? A. We are led not to expect the full execution of the plan , &amp;c. , since this would require the author to go over the whole history of the planting and extension of the church , from the day of Pentecost to the present time , and show the application of the principles laid down . . . . throughout . This , as will be seen at once , would require a great deal of " dry detail " which would have // 5,77 no immediate bearing upon the immediate practical result at which the author is aiming ! - ( p. 64 . ) Q. 11 . In what sense does the author of the work entitled " The Church Identified , " permit us to expect the execution of the plan proposed ? A. In the sense of a selection of those portions only of the history of " the church , " which have an immediate connection with the immediate practical object before him. - ( p. 64 . ) Q. 12 . Is such the obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such is not the obvious ground of selection , &amp;c. , since the selected portions of the history of " the church , " in this chapter , have no immediate bearing on the immediate practical result , which the author has set before him. - ( p. 82 . ) Q. 13 . Is such the ground of selection in the second historical chapter ? A. In the first section only of that chapter , the author barely quotes four unsupported or ambiguous statements from as many ancient writers , to prove the apostolical origin of the Church of England : but gives 110 historical facts of its planting , and no selected portions of its history for the first five centuries ! This omission sets aside the claim of chapters 4 , 6 , 7 , to any immediate connection with the immediate practical result to which the author would bring us . Q. 14 . Is such the ground of the selected portions of the history of " the church , " in chapter 5 ? A. Such is not the ground , inasmuch as " the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of " the church . " Q. 15 . What is the immediate connection with the immediate practical object of this work , of the last historical chapter , entitled " The IRomish claim to Jurisdiction in the United States " ? A. The immediate connection is , that it furnishes the key-stone for the author 's historical arch , wrought out of the beautiful and durable material of " the Church " divided against itself ! * Q. 16 . To what selected portions of the history of " the church " has the author applied the principles laid down for its identification ? A. To no selected portions of the history of " the church " between the age of the apostles and the planting of the Protestant Episcopal church in these United States has the author applied * Our author admits the Romish church to be a branch of the church of Christ .

" pp. 112 , 309 . We refrain from comments . But if our author himself indeed thinks that he has proved to a certainty " the main and allinvolving " conclusion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true charity , what does lie mean by that gratuitous attempt , on page 241 , to distinguish between " these sects " as " societies " or " churches , " and " the persons composing them " ? We owe our sincerity , zeal , and piety-such as they are-under God  --  to our connection with these sectarian societies , or churches . And now hear our author- " Their sincerity and their zeal I do not call in question . And thongh it is an undeniable fact , that their piety is of a different character from that which we find in the church . . . yet nothing that I have said must be understood to deny that theirs is sincere he does not say genuine and may be accepted in the day of judgment ! This is a point on which I wish to form no judgment  --  to express no opinion ! " But what judgment and what opinion must not the individual members of these sectarian societies , or churches , form and express of such charity as this ? Yet we are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work are coincident with what has been generally held and taught by Episcopalians in this country ! " If such be the fact , " these sects " ought to know it . If the fact be otherwise , as in our heart we believe , let those thus misrepresented disown the imputation . Our p resent controversy is not with the Protestant Episcopalian church . It has not been in our heart to say a word in disparagement of that communion . We have not seldom been a privileged worshiper and auditor in its assemblies : joining-though we " prefer worship with an extemporaneous prayer " - in the responses of its liturgy ; and stirred and edified by the eloquence of its clergy . We have // written simply to expose the unfounded and unbounded assumptions of the book before us . We believe that by such works as that the body of Christ is hurt , and His Spirit itself wounded in the house of his friends . We believi that the special tendency of this book is to fulfill our Lord 's prophetic declaration : " III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , and the daughter against her mother ; and the daughter-in-law against her motherin-law . And a man 's foes shall be they of his household ! " In opposition therefore to the narrow and arrogant dogmatism of this book , we hold that , on the day of Pentecost , there was undeniably in existence at Jerusalem a visible society called the church , which was simply the company of penitent believers in Jesus , who met daily in the temple and from house to house , for religious worship , the hearing of the word of God , and the observance of the Lord 's Supper ; with no plan of ecclesiastical organization , and no office save the apostolic . Repentance , faith , and baptism in the name of Jesus admitted new members to its communion ; and the characteristics of its membership were simply - " steadfast continuance in the apostles ' doctrine and fellowship ; and in breaking of bread , and in prayers . " We hold it to be equally undeniable , that there was in Antioch a visible society of Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or organizing instrumentality of apostle , presbyter , or deacon . IMlen of Cyprus and Cyrene , members of the church which was at Jerusalem , who were among the number scattered abroad by the persecution that arose about Stephen , came to Antioch and spake unto the Grecians , preaching the Lord Jesus . The hand of the Lord was with them , and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord . There is no scriptural intimation that this visible society of Christians was not as essentially a church before the visit of Barnabas , as during the year of his and Paul 's ministry among them . It can no more be shown that Christ or the apostles instituted a plan of ecclesiastical order and organization as essential to the existence of the church , and of all its branches , in every country , and through all time ,  --  than that he or they elaborated a system of civil polity for every people , in every land , in every age . The Scriptures do not make a particular ecclesiastical constitutiion essential either to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To assert the contrary is not only to assert what has never been , and can not be proved-but it is to exalt the form above the principle , the body above the spirit , the instrument above the end to be promoted . It is to confound the extension of a particular ecclesiastical organization with the dissemination of Christianity . This is the great error of our author . Everywhere in the pages of this book we read of extend- // 580 Wd8on ' 8 Church Ideutifled. ing " the Church " - of identifying " the Church " as an ontward visible society . And the idea , as we have shown and might show yet more fully , unquestionably is that of extending " the church " and identit*ing " the church " as an organized institution-the plan of whose polity and order were clearly defined and unchangeably settled by Christ and the apostles . Neither this idea nor language was ever in the mind or mouth of Paul . His idea was simply that of extending the power of " the faith " over the hearts and lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel . " We assert , therefore , " without fear of i*ista*e , " that any visible society of Christian men and women , whose associated design is their mutual growth in the knowledge of our Lord and in grace , through the stated preaching of the gospel , and the observance of its ordinances , and the addition to their number of such as shall be saved , is essentially a Christian church ; like the visible society called " the church which was at Jerusalem ; " like the visible society called " the church " that was at Antioch ; like the visible societies called " the churches throughout all Judea , and Galilee , and Samaria ; " like the visible societies called " the churches of the Gentiles .

We assert , " without fear of mistake , " that there is an invisible general assembly or church to which all true believers in Jesus belong . It includes all the loyal subjects of God 's government in heaven , and all who have believed with the heart in God or in Christ on earth . Its members , before the advent of the Savior , were all who believed in Jehovah as the living God , and the rewarder of them that diligently seek Hun . Its members since are all who have believed with the heart in Jesus , and been steadfast followers of them who , through faith and patience , have inherited the promises . This general assembly of believers , this invisible church , is independent of geographical , civil , or ecclesiastical divisions ; is above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denominational lines . Nor is this a modern theory . Abraham believed in a promised seed to be gathered from all the nations and all the families of the earth . The psalmist sung of the same , and the echo of his strain still // lingers to inspire hope for the heathen and for the uttermost parts of the earth . Isaiah looked forward to Paul 's time , and onward still afar , arid with a prophet 's ken he saw the Gentile converts from every continent and from every isle flying as a cloud , and as the doves to their windows . Paul looked backward to the ages of the prophets aud the patriarchs , to Abel 's day , and upward to the heavens ; and by faith , which to him was the evidence of things not seen , he saw the holy ones of the past , all those who had been remarkable for their faith in God , and who had finished their course , compassing the skies as a great cloud of witnesses , and looking to see how he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ninetyfonr qnotations our author has " taken the pains " to lay before us- " all the passages in the Testament in which the word church ' occurs "  --  to show that the expression " a church " is unscriptural ; that the form- " the church " - forbids either the supposition of more than one denomination of Christians , or the " modern theory " of an invisible church ! Once , however , it must be admitted , a and the are used interchangeably of the invisible general ass erubly of the redeemed . In twenty-seven of these ninety-four quotations , the word is not " church " but " churches . " And the definite article is used for the simple and sufficient rea*on that in all these cases , as the context shows , either a definite Christian society is spoken of , or definite societies , or the invisible aggregate of believers are denoted ; these facts show that the " modern sectarian " mode of speaking , in the premises , is not unlike the primitive , and sets aside , as idle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the article the instead of a . The only quotation which gives our author any uneasiness , as seeming to favor the " modern theory " of an invisible church , is the passage in which the expression occurs , " the church of the first-born , which are written in heaven . " He relies " chiefly upon the connection in which the expression occurs , " for concluding that it denotes not " persons living on the earth , " but the " orders of beings extending upward , in the scale of creation , from angels to the Deity . " But why not apply the same principle of interpretation to the whole passage , and relying " chiefly upon the connection in which the expression occurs , " also conclude that the clause- " the spirits of just men make perfect " - denotes " the orders of beings , in the scale of creation , " from God the Judge , to Jesus the Mediator ? The truth is , if we would understand , or enter into the spirit of the great-hearted apostle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all Roman fame , " - this passage , in which he identifle8 the church of the new dispensation with the church of the old , we // must get upon a higher and broader platform than the dogma of only one national or one denominational church . We must mark where the apostle stands , in what presence , and to whom he speaks and what he says . He had stood , wrongly yet honestly , on the narrow and exclusive dogma named . From that Christ had struck him down with the flash of his glorious gospel . The scene on the plain of Damascus was but a symbol of the more marvelous light which opened the eyes of his understanding , to see not only the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ , but the glorious truth , that all who have " put on the new man " belong " where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free , but Christ is all , and in all . " He now stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform that all the regenerate are in Christ , and that Christ is in all of them ; that they are his , and he is theirs ; that they are members of his body , which is the church ! He speaks in the presence of that great cloud of witnesses , invisible to mortal vision , whom yet faith had opened his eyes to see as they com passed the stadium whose bounds are the extremes of the Christian life , and the runners , from all the nations ; in the presence of an innumerable company of angels ; in the presence of God the Judge , and of Jesus the Mediator . He speaks not simply to one national or one denominational church , but directly to his fellow-Hebrew believers in Jesus ; virtually to the Gentile converts of his time , likewise ; and to all who have since finished , are now running , or shall hereafter enter , the Christian course . When we mark that he does not tell us who these Hebrews were , farther than that they were true believers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much-abused phrase , " the church , " but once , we are almost constrained to think he was divinely instructed as to the omission . He must , however , use it once . And then he puts it where no one denomination of Christians can get to pull it down . They must first break through the army of the angels , and then confront the Omnipotent God , and then they shall descry , between God the Judge and Jesus the Mediator , still another detachment of the invisible host of the elect . In the presence of this vast invisible assembly , now seen by faith on the Mount Zion , in the heavenly Jerusalem , surrounding the throne of God and the Lamb , the saints nearer than the angels , and speaking to all the regenerate of his time , and to all who were to be born again ,  --  what does Paul literally and virtually say ? " To this innumerable company of angels ; this general assembly and church of the first-born , who are enrolled in heaven ; and these spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ! To this innumerable and invisible company of angels and of the redeemed , ye already as truly belong , as though on your heads , as on theirs , the crowns of gold were now glittering , and your voices , like theirs , were singing the conqueror 's song ! " And now , in conclusion , with our author 's leave , we will compare the church of God to a vine . Planted by the hand of the Lord God in the Garden of Eden , removed into the land of Canaan , carried into , and brought out of , Egypt , and planted again in the goodly laud of promise , where it covered with its shadow , for a time , simply Canaan 's hills and waters , we see it sending out its boughs unto the utmost bound of earth 's ancient mountains , and unto the farthest sea . And when at last it shall be transplanted by God the husbandman , to the " better country-that is , " the heavenly " - every branch which bore fruit here , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beautify the one true vine forever ! We will compare the church likewise to a river . Having its source in Eden , and flowing , for a time , within the bounds of a single kingdom ; ive see it on its winding way receiving tributaries from all lands . And when it shall enter its golden channel in the heavenly Jerusalem , the voices of its myriad streams shall mingle , and make the one voice of its many waters !
