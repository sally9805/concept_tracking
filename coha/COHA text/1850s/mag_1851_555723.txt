ART . X. Notes on North America , Agricultural , Economical , and Social . By JAMES F. W. JOHNSTON , M. A. , F. R. S. , &amp;c. &amp;c . Boston : Little &amp; Brown . 1851. 2 vols. l2mo . MR . JOHNSTON has a high reputation , we understand , as a lecturer and a writer on physical geography and the application of chemical and geological science to agriculture ; hut he is not likely to increase his fame by publishing books of travels . He has not Sir Charles LycIl 's pleasant manner of blending the details and comprehensive speculations of science with lively and good-humored observations on men and manners , and with instructive disquisitions on the points of resemblance and contrast between the social organizations of different countries . As a writer and a thinker he is decidedly inferior to the eminent geologist , with whose work his own volumes naturally invite comparison , from their great similarity of plan . Apparently dissatisfied with the results of his visit to this country , or unfortunate in meeting with but few persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Johnston 's comments on American institutions and the tone of American society are subacid in character , and indicate that his nerves were much jarred by what he saw and heard , and by the salient differences between the state of things on this side of the Atlantic and that with which he was famihar in Scotland and the north of England . It might have been well for him to remember that , *either from the shortness of his stay or from other causes , he saw but little of the best portions of our society , and that remarks casually made by such persons as he happened to meet in railroad cars and steamboats were not a fair index of the tone of public opinion here iii America . He complains of our national propensity to " brag and swagger , " and that we misuse the king 's English shamefully . He asserts that " Europe , not America , is the cause of the rapid growth of the United States ,  --  European capital , European hands , and European energy ; " and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable than that of Glasgow , inasmuch as " it proves nothing in regard to the native energy " of the people who were born on the soil which they inhabit . He // thinks that the best wheat-lands in this country are either already exhausted or rapidly tending towards exhaustion ; that 1n order to obtain a surplus for exportation , we are obliged constantly to go farther and farther west in quest of virgin and highly productive soils , which soon deteriorate under our scourging processes " of cultivation ; that the State of New York already does not produce wheat enough for its own consumption ; and he even adduces ( Vol . II . p. 193 ) some very astounding statistics to prove , that , in the British province of New Brunswick , the average produce per acre of all the cereal grains , and of turnips and potatoes , is actually much larger than in New York , Ohio , or Michigan . He believes that the produce of our Northwestern States can be carried down the St. Lawrence at less cost both of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether its destination be the Hudson river or a European port ; and " therefore , it appears certain that the river St. Lawrence is destined ere long to become a most important medium of intercourse between the various sections of the New World , as well as between the Old World and the New , and to give to the province of Canada a far more extensive and commanding influence over the commercial operations of North America than any State east of Louisiana can ever aspire to . " He maintains , in spite of the fancied cheapness of a republican form of government , and the pressure of an enormous national debt in Great Britain , that property is taxed more heavily in the United States than in England ; and he consequently advises those of his own countrymen who have thought of emigrating , if they are in easy circumstances , to remain at home ; - advice which seems to us more just than necessary . There may be good cause for some of these complaints and forebodings ; though it may he doubted whether so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if his mind had not been preoccupied by feelings of national jealousy and soreness , which prevented him from looking on more than one side of the question . Such feelings have now wellnigh died out of the minds of intelligent and reflecting persons on both sides of the Atlantic . It is not considered so unjust , as it is silly , to entertain or express them . They are left to the least reputable portion of the newspaper press , to // the haranguers of petty assemblages , and to political aspirants and agitators of the lowest denomination , for whom the utterance of them may gain a feeble cry of applause from the unthinking mob . The time has gone by in which abuse or satire of America was popular in England . Books of travels like those of Hall and Hamilton , Trollope and Martineau , are obsolete . Since the passage of the Reform bill , the abolition of the corn laws , and the rapid growth in numbers and influence of the commercial classes in England , the institutions of the two countries are approximating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either nation to decry those of the other . In the times of Bute and Wilkes , abuse of the Scotch was a favorite topic in London ; Junius appealed to this contemptible popular prejudice when he made an onslaught both on Wedderburn and Mansfield . But the feeling itself soon died out when a North Briton was no longer the prime minister of England or the secret adviser of the throne . In like manner , till within fifteen or twenty years , detraction of America was the cue of one of the great political parties in the mother land , the cause being , of course , not so much a dislike of what was An*ierican , as hate or fear of a democratic form of government . But this feeling , also , has now happily passed away , so that any decided manifestation of it seems almost as ludicrous as it would be to raise an outcry against a member of the English cabinet because be happened to be born north of the Tweed . The latest indication of it which has fallen under our notice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes of Mr. Johnston ; and we suspect it would not have colored so many of his pages if his home had been in the metropolis of England , or in one of her great seaports , instead of being somewhere in the vicinity of the Scottish border . National prejudice lurks in provincial obscurity some time after it has been banished from the centres of intelligence and refinement . We would not by any means be understood to say , that our traveller has deliberately undertaken " to write down " America , or that every portion of his work shows an atrabilious or sarcastic spirit . But his mind was evidently occupied , all the while that he was in this country , with a comparison between England and America , which should turn as far as possible to the advantage of the former . Now , the // first object of a philosophical and fair observer should be to rid himself entirely of such a preconceived notion and false standard , and to attempt to see things as they are , not as they appear when measured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foreign pattern . There must be an absolute standard , peculiar to each country , of what is right or wrong , useful or injurious , true or mistaken , - wholly apart from British example or American practice . Let things be seen and judged according to this criterion , and without the slightest reference to the circumstances or the practice of another country which is three thousand miles off . We would not substitute an English House of Lords for our American Senate , nor have the members of the British peerage chosen by popular vote , to hold their honors for only six years ; for we believe that each institution is good in its place , and would be very much out of phwe if transported bodily across the broad Atlantic . There are many other things in the two countries which are to be judged only by their local fitness , and any reference of them to a foreign standard must lead to an improper and unjust estimate of their intrinsic worth . Let the traveller put all idea of comparison out of his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are , and judge them as they ought to be judged . The chief source of the dissatisfaction expressed by Mr. Johnston is , that he was constantly thinking of his native country , and was grieved not to find Great Britain here in America . Thus , he asserts that " there are certain broad lines of national progress in which we have gone in advance of the United States , - as in the abolition of slavery , the adoption of the principles of Free Trade as a basis of national polity , and in the recognition of the rights of humanity , and a regard to the advancement of the human race as a modifying influence in all international concerns . " The last of these three specifications is rather sweeping and indefinite . It is certainly a grave charge against us , that , in the management of our national concerns , we have shown ourselves unmindful of " the rights of humanity and the advancement of the human race . " But this is not the precise form of Mr. Johnston 's allegation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in manifesting a nice regard for these high interests . We are not sure that this is not an aggravation of the charge , - to // place us lower in the scale even than England , whose foreign policy during the last half century appears to many to have been eminently aggressive , imperious , and selfish . She has usually dictated her treaties at the cannon 's mouth ; and we are not aware that , in arranging the terms of any one of them , she has shown herself unmindful of the preservation of British interests . We have never heard that any ministry ventured to stand up in the House of Commons and vindicate a costly and hloody war , which had just been waged for the sole purpose of establishing the general rights of humanity , and at the evident sacrifice of the country 's own commercial and political advantages . Not certainly in the quarrel with the Argentine republic , or in the opium war with China , or in the sanguinary contests with the Affghans and the Sikhs , or in the struggle recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tremenclou* honibarclment of Acre for the purpose of giving the Holy Land hack to the Turks , can England claim to have been actuated hy motives so unselfish , pacificatory , and high-minded . She negotiated the famous Quintuple Treaty , it is true , with a view to the general abolition of the slave trade ; . hut as the clamor was then loud in England ahout the introduction of slave-grown sugar without discriminating duties , it is no breach of candor and charity to presume , that the wish to cut off from the Spanish West Indies and from Brazil a portion of the means by which they were enabled to produce sugar cheaper than it could he produced in the British West Indies was at least one of the causes of the anxiety of British statesmen to put an end to the transportation of slaves from Africa . What act or what omission on the part of this country has shown that we are less regardful than Great Britain has been of " the rights of humanity and the general advancement of the human race ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , constantly looking to its own aggrandizement , in all the four quarters of the globe , as England has done . Our relations with Asia , Africa , South America , and the isles of the Pacific and Indian oceans have been uniformly amicable and productive of mutual advantage and good-will . We have sent them ships laden with missionaries and Yankee notions , and they have generally received both with courtesy , and given us in return a fair proportion of // their own merchandise . Arnon g the powers of Europe , Great Britain is the only one with whom we have come into serious collision for half a century ; and even in our contests with her , we fancied that we were contending against the arbitrary power of impressing seamen , and in favor of neutral commerce and the sanctity and independence of every nation 's flag at sea . Was it a pure and disinterested regard for " the ri0hts of humanity and the general advancement of the human race " which caused Great Britain to put forward the pretensions which we then resisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nearest neighbors have a right to complain of our selfish and encroaching conduct . We have had some boundary questions with England ; hut these are . now all hap* ) ily adjusted , and during the negotiations which ended in this settlement , we are not aware that any appeal was made to " the rights of humanity " on either side . But we have made war on Mexico , and " annexed " Texas , New Mexico , and California ; and as these measures were vehemently disapproved by a large number , perhaps a majority , of our own people , we can well submit with meekness to any censure on this account which it may suit those to bestow who have conquered and annexed to the British empire the richest portion of Asia , the whole southern extremity of Africa , and all Australia . But thus much may fairly he alleged in mitigation of our fault ; that when our troops were in actual possession of the capital and of every important stronghold in Mexico , and the whole country was virtually in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her most insignificant provinces , and even for these we paid , in hard cash , much more than they were worth . So far , also , as the condition of the people themselves , in respect to education , contentment , order , and the general diffusion of the means of comfort and happiness , is an index of the regard paid by their government to the rights and higher interests of humanity , so far , we presume , the United States need not fear comparison with the country to which they once owned allegiance . On what particular grounds Mr. Johnston rests his assertion that Great Britain has " gone in advance " of us in this respect , he has not informed us . The point of comparison itself is so ill defined that we are // half inclined to suspect that it was introduced only for the purpose of rounding off a sentence . It is much as if he had claimed for his countrymen a general superiority over the other nations of the earth in the practice of all Christian virtues . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in the abolition of slavery . " If the two cases were similar , if the corn petitors started from the same point in the race , there would be some reason in claiming superiority for the one who came out ahead . But a tortoise could heat a hare if you gave him start enough . To suppose a case entirely parallel , we must imagine that slavery was established in Scotland and Ireland , instead of the British West Indies ; that the slaves numbered three millions , instead of little over one fourth of that number ; that by the articles of union between the three kingdoms , the control of the institution of slavery was taken entirely out of the hands of the Imperial Parliament , and reserved to the countries in which the institution existed ; that the slaveholders were directly represented in parliament , numbering more than one third of both houses , instead of being the unrepresented inhabitants of distant colonies , wholly dependent upon the British crown , and without any stipulation or guaranty of their rights in the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that emancipation would have let loose , at England 's own doors , three millions of uneducated blacks , quite incapable of taking care of themselves , to swell immediately , to an almost incalculable extent , the amount of the poor rates , and iii every economical and social respect to weigh like an incubus upon the prosperity of the land . We leave even our English readers to decide , whether , if this supposition were fulfilled in all its parts , the bill for the abolition of slavery in the British dominions would have passed in 1834 , or whether there would be a reasonable prospect of its speedy enactment even at the present day . We are no apologists for the institution of slavery ; but Englishmen are the last persons in the world who should taunt us with its existence in this country . Of the three millions of slaves now in the United States , at least two and a half millions are the direct descendants of those who were brought hither from Africa in British ships , by British capital , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the reclamations often made by the Colonists . One of the first uses made by the Colonies of their newly declared independence was to prohibit the further introduction of slaves from abroad into their territories ; even before the close of the Revolutionary war , eight or nine out of the original Thirteen had thus shut their gates against the increase of an institution which they both feared and disliked . When the Constitution was formed in 1789 , a clause was adopted having reference to the future entire abolition of the slave trade ; and the traffic was at last declared illegal only a year or two after a similar step was taken by Great Britain . Nor is this all ; under English law , slavery had been established in all the American Colonies ; it was a legal institution in New England , New York , and Pennsylvania , as well as in the Colonies farther south . At the breaking out of the Revolution , there were over thirty thousand slaves in what are now the Free States , New York alone having more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ruptured the tie that hound them to England have also broken the chains of the slave ; and every man , woman , or child , who is brought within their boundaries without his or her consent , becomes from that moment free . Thus the example was set on this side of the Atlantic , which was tardily followed by Ene , land in 1834 . Under these circumstances , we repeat it , Englishmen are the last persons in the world who ought to profit by their own late repentance in order to cast reproach upon the people of this country because the Southern States still allow the existence of slavery . As well might the parent upbraid the child for suffering under the constitutional maladies brought upon him by the father 's own vices . That England 's recent adoption of the principles of Free Trade is a great step taken in advance of the other nations of the earth , indicating a more intelligent appreciation of the true laws of commerce , and a more disinterested regard for the welfare of the whole human race , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mr. Johnston 's self-complacent remark , * is a very remarkable assumption . In order to judge of its correctness , we need not undertake to settle the much-disputed question between the Free Traders and the Protectionists ; though it shows some cool dogmatism on the part of our // author to quietly assume that there is no question yet remaining in the case , and to ignore the fact that a large portion of his own countrymen , having among them many distinguished statesmen and economists , still adhere to the doctrines of Protection , and maintain that England has made a needless sacrifice by the recent change . But we will not enter into their argument for the present ; we will admit , for the nonce , that the Protectionists are unenlightened barbarians , blinded by ancient customs and immemorial prejudices , and ignorant of the first principles of political economy . The only question then will be , whether England is entitled to take great credit to herself for extraordinary liberality or foresight in adoptin0 the principles of Free Trade at this late day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictate , this sudden shift of policy . English manufactures had profited for centuries by the largest and most rigid system of protection which the wit of man could devise . The vast colonial empire of Great Britain was acquired and governed chiefly with a view to enlarging the market for home productions , the principle followed being that expressed by the Earl of Chatham , when he declared that the colonists should not be allowed to manufacture a nail or a horseshoe for themselves . Thus protected and encouraged , the manufacturers of Great Britain acquired a degree of skill and amassed an amount of capital , which , conjoined with their native industry and enterprise , enabled them to defy competition in the home market , and to take the lead in all foreign markets which were open to their products . Then , indeed , their period of apprenticeship being completed , and protection no longer needed , the barriers were thrown down , and Free Trade proclaimed , in the hope that foreigners would imitate the specious example , and open their ports to enable Englishirien to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crush their infant attempts to manufacture for themselves . Under present circumstances , no doubt , Free Trade is the safest and best policy for England ; competition , not protection , is what she wants . English manufacturers protect themselves through the skill and capital acquired under a protective system which has lasted for centuries . But it would be suicidal for other nations to adopt the terminating point of British policy when they have // not followed its antecedent steps . Defensive armor is needed for the weak , not for the strong . It is sheer arrogance on the part of British economists to put forward the theory of Free Trade as the latest product of the superior wisdom of the nineteenth century , and to take praIse to themselves for discovering it and reducing it to practice . It was discovered , if such a word be applicable , and advocated by the founder of the science almost a century ago ; but it is only within a few years that their countrymen found themselves prepared for its adoption . Foreigners will doubtless copy the example when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , they are less willing to adopt British theory than to follow British practice . This statement of the case applies with peculiar force to the United States . Our natural period of apprenticeship in the arts of manufacture was curtailed or postponed by our colonial vassalage . While we were not permitted to make a nail or a horseshoe for ourselves , in order that England might have the monopoly in our markets , we lost the opportunity of profiting at the earliest moment by our political independence . For many years after the close of the Revolutionary war , and , in fact , till after the peace of 1815 , we were too feeble and nuskilful even to make an attempt to manufacture for ourselves ; and during this long period , duties were imposed on our imports with a view only to revenue , not to protection . For the last thirty-five years we have had protecting duties , which , though fluctuating and insufficient , have yet enabled us to make such progress that , on several of the coarser products of art , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century more , should protection be continued , we shall doubtless be able to open our harbors to all competitors , in whatever department of industry they may provoke the trial . But to let down the barriers at present would be to oppose an insurmountable obstacle to our farther advancement . Mr. Johnston is swift to discover and censure in others the same uneasy national pride and self-glorification of which so many pages in his own book afford striking examples . In the following passages , for instance , the traveller throws more light on the prevailing disposition of his own mind than on the peculiarities of the people whom he was visiting , even // supposing that the physician and the worthy hutcher with whom he talked afforded a fair idea of the general tone of thinking here in America . " At seven in the morning I was at the railway station to take my departure for Buffalo . I here encountered one of those embarrassing mes-entendres which are unavoidable when travelling among people who will use old words in new senses . I was introduced to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked the country , with the question , Do n't you find us a very clever people ? ' This was a thrust so decidedly home that I could not believe he meant what he asked . He looked also perfectly innocent , but evidently expecting an answer . As I could not , conscientiously say yes , I hesitatingly said what had more than once occurred to me in passing through the States , - At least you think yourselves so . ' But the instant the words had escaped me , I apologized for my rude speech , recollecting that , only two or three days before , an American lady had remarked to me that this word , in the States , is often used in the sense of good-natured , or ready to oblige . ' That the people of the United States , wherever I have been , are clever in this sense , I can honestly say . I added , therefore , avec empressement , I understood your question wrongly ; in your sense of the word , you are a clever people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I did , and explained his question as a bit of local slang . A stranger ought not willingly to give offence to a people among whom he is travelling , nor to say what is likely to hurt their feelings ; but this was a case where the fault was on the side of those who are not careful to maintain the fountains of speech in their primitive puyity . ' Vol. i. pp. 192 , 193 . " After I had asked my questions of the butcher , and he in return had found out , by questioning me , first , how many years , and then how many months , I had been in America , Well , sir , ' says he , we live in a great country here-we are a great people . ' I evaded what was meant as a question , and spoke pleasantly to his everyday ideas , by remarking that I had certainly seen at Syracuse the very largest oxen I had ever beheld . ' So we parted very good friends , and he invited me to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stranger to be always called upon to admire and praise what he sees in a foreign country ; and it is a part of the perversity of human nature to withhold , upon urgent request , what , if unasked , would be freely and spontaneously given . But highly to esteem , and value , and prefer one 's native // or adopted country , is a virtue which is to he commended and encouraged . It is the basis of individual mental contentment , and of that general patriotism which has in so many countries led to great and noble actions , and which has always ranked the first among political virtues . If a man does not think the country he lives in the best in the world , he had better leave it . But this does not justify or excuse either unfounded arrogance or selfesteem in a people , or the tendency to brag and swagger which one does occasionally see among individuals in the United States . " Vol. i . P. 244 . Mr. Johnston evidently did not understand the quiet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We suspect that both the " gentlemanly-looking physician " and the honest butcher were amusing themselves with one whose answers showed that he was sufficiently testy , by bantering him on the very point on which a choleric John Bull , when travelling in the United States , is most apt to be sensitive . He lost the pleasant twinkle of the eye which marked their satisfaction when the snappish reply , in both cases , evinced that John had fallen into the trap that was set for him . The physician was evidently too clever to adopt unwittingly " a bit of local slang , " which an educated American is no more apt to use than an educated Londoner is to misplace the aspirate . Even the butcher seems to have taken the impatient answer to his quaint remark with great good humor , and asked his visitor to call again when he was inclined to have a little sparring about the respective merits of England and America . We must not omit our tourist s remarkable explanation of the rapid growth of the United States in population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who land at New York , Boston , Philadelphia , or New Orleans , bring with them some money - the greater number enough to pay the travelling expenses of their families , to buy a piece of land , and to maintain them for a year The fare alone from New York to Chicago , in Wisconsin , is fifteen dollars a.head , which is about *f 10 for , a man and his wife and two children . The English and Scotch and German emigrants appear to be better and more thoughtfully provided for than the Irish ; but Pat 's ragged coat , as the captains of steamers know well , often conceals more gold than the decenter garments of the emigrants from other countries . 19* // " Taking rich and poor together , it is a very moderate assumption that the emigrants , on an average , carry out ? 10 a-head , which , for the 200,000 who land at New York alone , makes the sum of ? 2,000,000 sterling added at once to the money capital of the districts through which they pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's labor of this 200,000 , in agricultural operations upon new land , must add at least ? 5 a-head , or another ? 1,000,000 to the capital of the new States ; while the increased consumption of imported articles , by the added population , augments the Federal revenue which is derived from the duties levied upon imports . " It is Europe , not America , therefore , that is the cause of the rapid growth of the United States - European capital , European hands , and European energy . If all the native-horn Americans - not being the sons or grandsons of Europeans - were to sit down and fold their hands , and go to sleep , the progress of the country would scarcely bea whit less rapid , so long as peace between America and Europe is maintained . " Vol. i. pp* 245 , 246 . If the qualifying clause which we have here printed in Italics had been extended two or three generations farther , Mr. Johnston 's theory would he a very safe one . The progress of this country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th*y were taken away , the whole population would consist of blacks and Indians ; and even our oldest settlements have not attained so great an age but that every white man who traces out his genealogical tree is obliged , before passing over many generations , to cross the ocean . But the effects of a European training , we suppose , are manifested only by the actual emigrants ; while their descendants , whether of near or remote degree , horn on American soil , are true children of the country which gave them birth , and to which belongs both their glory and their shame . When Mr. Johnston attributes so much to the number of the immigrants , and to the wealth they bring with them , as to assert that " if all the native born Americans with the qualification aforesaid were to sit down and fold their hands , and go to sleep , the progress of the country would scarcely be a whit less rapid , " he only shows how far national prejudice can blind the eyes and distort the judgment even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made so little use of his opportunities for gaining // information while in this country , that the remainder of his observations can not he trusted . Had he even looked at the statistics of pauperism and crime in any of our larger States he could not have risked so absurd a statement . These would have told him , that one of the most striking indications of the prosperity of this country is , that it is able to support the immense burden which is annually thrown upon it by the stream of immigration which brings so large a portion of the poverty , disease , and crime of Europe to our doors . So many of these immigrants people our hospitals , almshouses , and prisons , and so many even of those who are able to earn their own livelihood are employed only on the rudest and least productive forms of labor , that the trifling addition made to the national resources by the few who bring a little capital along with them can defray but a fraction of the cost of supporting their helpless brethren . Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all the other countries of Europe taken together ; and what is the condition of the Irish poor who come hither Mr. Johnston might have learned by a little inquiry at home almost as well as in this country . The Irish absentee landlords send them off by the ship load , in order to clear their own estates of such heavy incumbrances , and to lighten the otherwise insupportable burden of the poor rates . They send them in so diseased a condition , and so poorly provided with the necessaries of life , that death often nearly decimates them while yet on shipboard . The newspapers recently contained an account of such a cargo , shipped , we are sorry to say , by the Marquis of Lansdowne , from his immense estates in Ireland , who were landed on the wharves of New York in so miserable and destitute a pli* , ht , that the immigrants already established in that city published an account of the affair for the express purpose of directing . public censure throughout England and America against the inhumanity and covetousness evinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York have been compelled to erect and support vast hospitals and almshouses at the quarantine grounds in their respective harbors , for the sole purpose of preventing these poor beings , immediately after they are landed , from dying in the streets and introducing contagion into the cities . Yet these wretched victims of the heartlessness of an Irish // landlord , Mr. Johnston thinks , are the sole cause of the prosperity of America , which would he continued through their exertions and the capital which they bring with them , even if all native-horn Americans should fold their hands and go to sleep ! We pity both the heart and the intellect of a man who could arrive at such a conclusion . A few statistics will throw farther light upon the correctness of our tourist* s observation . Of the twenty-three millions who form the population of this country , not more than two millions and a half , or one tenth part of the whole number , at the largest estimate , were horn under another government . It is not very probable , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under any circumstances , can be exclusively attributable to the exertions of one tenth part of the people . But let us see whether the foreigners make up only a tenth part of the pauperism and the crime which tax the energies of the country . We will adopt in each case the latest returns which happen to be at hand ; for it will be found , after examining the returns for several years , that the proportions do not vary materially from year to year . In October , 1849 , there were 349 inmates of the state prison of Massachusetts , of whom 111 , or very nearly one third , were foreigners . In the same State and same year ; the number of persons relieved or supported as paupers was 24,892 , of whom 10,253 were foreigners ; and of these , 9,128 were natives of England or Ireland . In the city and county of New York , in 1844 , the number of paupers natives of the United States was 14,435 ; and the number from other countries was 15,169 , of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons brought before Mr. Justice Taylor , of the upper police in the city of New York , for various offences , between the 6th of February , 1845 , and the 6th of the next August , was 1,492 , of whom only 454 were born in the United States , while 844 were from Ireland . Of 7,549 persons in the poor-houses of other counties in the State of New York , in December , 1844 , the foreigners were 2,775 . During the six years from 1840 to 1845 inclusive , 8,626 persons were convicted of crime in the various courts of record in the State of New York , and 3,546 of them were born in foreign countries , 1,587 being from Ireland . We need not carry these statistical citations any farther , // though their number might be increased to an indefinite extent . The conclusion to which they lead us is , not that all the foreigners who come hither are a burden upon the resources of the nation , but that so many of them are , as to neutralize or absorb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , capacity , and capital of a few of the more fortunate immigrants . A true statement of the case , then , would differ materially from Mr. Johnston 's proposition ; it would be , that if our harbors were closed and our frontiers guarded , so that not another foreigner could be. - come a resident in the United States , the growth of the country in opulence and all the means of civilization would be not a whit less rapid than it has been ; in all probability , its speed would be greatly increased . We do not propose to examine very closely the confused statements and calculations by which Mr. Johnston makes it appear that property is taxed more heavily in the United States than it is in Great Britain . He admits that , if the whole taxation , or total expenditure of the national , the state , and the local governments , be compared with the whole population , so as to show the average expense per head for all the inhabitants , the cost of government is much less here than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very great . According to a very careful computation that was made in the American Almanac for 1847 , ( p. 152 , ) the aggregate of government expenditure is but $2.39 for each inhabitant of the United States , while the average in England rises to $12.33 per head , which is more than five times as large ; and *n France , it is $7.50 , or more than three times as much as in this country . These results agree so nearly with those of two other independent computations , made in 1832 and 1838 , by Mr. Livingston , then Secretary of State , and Mr. H. C. Carey of Philadelphia , as to leave no doubt that they are near approximations to the truth . The weight of taxation can be properly estimated , it is true , only by its relation to the wealth , not to the population , of the country ; for the same burden becomes light or heavy in proportion to the ability of the people to bear it . But the aggregate of national wealth escapes all calculation or probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a plausible con* jecture on this point . Mr. Johnston takes the official valua .. // tion of all real and per*onal property in the State of New York , which gives an aggregate of 666 millions of dollars . The state , county , and township taxes , taken together , amounted to five millions and a half in 1849 , which is little more than four fifths of a per cent . on the property . This would be equal , Mr. Johnston says , " to paying in England 16s. 8d. for every ? 100 of property , or to an income tax of 13* per cent . - supposing the property to yield six per cent. , or be worth 16* years ' purchase on the whole . " He then capitalizes the total income of Great Britain hy supposing that both real and personal property yield only three per cent. , or are worth thirty-three years ' purchase ; and calculates very reasonably , that a tax of four fifths of a per cent . on the total capital thus ascertained would pay all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagance of these results ought to have convinced our author that his data and mode of computation were inaccurate . No person in the United States pays l3* per cent . of his total income in direct taxation ; the average certainly does not equal five per cent . The present English income tax is not quite three per cent. , and produces less than six millions sterling , or hardly one eighth of the total government expenditure . Yet the profits of trade are reckoned as taxable incomes ; to capitalize these at thirty-three years purchase would be very extravagant . Trade could not continue if the profits did not amount to at least six per cent . on the capital . In the United States , ten per cent . would be a low estimate . The United States collect but thirty millions of dollars in duties upon imports the total annual value of which is one hundred and fifty millions ; this gives an average of only 20 per cent . Great Britain collects twenty millions sterling , or nearly one hundred millions of dollars , on imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterling ; this is over twenty-five per cent . Now , the customs-duties in this country defray about one half of the total government expenditure , including the cost of the national , state , and local establishments . In England , the total expenditure , as reckoned by McCulloch , is more than thrice the amount of the customs-duties . If we admit , what is *probably near the truth , that the annual imports into two such countries as England and the United States bear about the same ratio to // each other as the total capitals , or aggregate wealth , of those two countries , the conclusion is obvious that property is far more heavily taxed there than in America . Reckoned by their proportion to the population , or by the head , as we have seen , the taxes are five times as great . Compared with property , the proportion is at least as three to one . Mr. Johnston 's error arises chiefly from assuming that the official valuation of property assessed for taxation in the State of New York is a near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuations here is to give only an approximation to the relative wealth of individuals , towns , and counties . No one supposes that they give the true amount of absolute wealth . Many kinds of property are excluded from them altogether ; others are adniitted at a rate known to be far below their real value . In different States , also , they are formed on different principles , so that they do not enable us to compare one State with another . We gladly pass to those portions of Mr. Johnston 's book in which his strong national prejudices either do not appear at all , or do not manifest themselves so offensively as in the passages which we have thus far considered . His remarks on the exhausting system of cultivation too commonly practised by American farmers are instructive , though he exaggerates the evil , and does not clearly point out its origin and probable limits . The want of capital and the cheapness of land are the great obstacles to improvement in the modes of American agriculture . The prospect of quick and large gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessarily tilled , for the most part , by persons of small means ; for if the landholder acquires active ca*pital , he either quits farming and engages in trade , or he has a passion for acquiring more land , and enlarges the size of his farm instead of improving its tillage . There is not here , as in England , a factitious dignity and social importance attached to the ownership of land over the possession of any other form of wealth . Consequently , the prospect of larger returns , having nothing to counterbalance it , is continually drawing away capital from the rural districts ; the land does not profit so much as commerce and manufactures from the rapid increase of national wealth . The English capitalist gladly buys land which will afford him only two or three per // cent . income on the investment , while he might gain six or eight by emharking in trade . A much smaller difference than this will tempt the American to sell his land and remove to the metropolis , or to a manufacturing district . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase of the population in the neighborhood , that the possible addition to its value from improvements made on the land itself or from merely " keeping it in heart , " as the farmers say , seems comparatively insignificant . Hence , even the capital which is slowly amassed from year to year , by the fanner 's annual savings from income , is more frequently applied to the purchase of more land than to the improvement of the old homestead . lie who farms with little capital is constantly obliged to sacrifice greater ultimate advantages for immediate profit or quick returns . He gives the land neither rest nor manure , and thus exhausts the richness even of the most fertile soils . It matters not to him , according to his mode of calculation at least , that the ground under such treatment will ultimately be reduced to comparative barrenness . The process of deterioration is slow , not being easily observed from year to year ; and the American farmer is not attached to one spot by so strong a tie as to cause him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hence . He is ready at any time to sell the farm , and seek a new home and more fertile land farther west ; or he hopes that , before another generation has passed away , the growth of the population , the erection of manufactories , or the building of a railroad , will have converted his farming land into building lots , so that what he has purchased hy the acre he will he enabled to sell by the square foot . In such a country as this , there are always glorious contingencies enough in the future to reconcile any one to the sight of a very tardy depreciation in one particular , hardly appreciable at the moment . When , as is the case with several of our newly formed States , the population doubles in about ten years , the most rapid deterioration of the soil which is possible will not prevent the land from steadily advancing in value , and advancing at a rate , too , which renders the slightly diminished fertility of the ground a matter of little moment . Mr. Johnston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a statement that the average produce per acre , for the whole of New York , is only 14 bushels of xTheat , and for the most fertile or most productive county in the State , it is less than 19 hushels . " For a highly lauded , fertile , wheat-growing district , " he remarks , with his usual feeling , " the pride of the State of New York , the happy home to which the longing eyes of British and Irish Agriculturists have long been directed , these are but low averages . " They are low , when compared with the results of English agriculture ; for McCulloch estimates the average productiveness of land in England to be from 22 to 32 bushels of wheat per acre . But the comparison proves nothing if the circumstances in the two cases be not similar . If the same amount of labor and capital were expended upon every acre of cultivated ground in New York as are given to English farming land , this one State might stock half the wheat markets of Europe . Otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and paying a much higher price for labor , the American farmer can yet undersell his English competitor in the wheat market ? How came it that , in the famine year of 1847 , breadstuffs were exported from the United States to the value of more than sixty-seven millions of dollars ? Mr. Johnston heard frequent complaints in western New York , that farming is not now a remunerative occupation there ; and he draws the conclusion that it has ceased to be profitable because the soil is exhausted by improvident cultivation . Yet he alludes to the circumstance which supplies a far more obvious and probable reason for the reduction of the farmer 's profits ; namely , the competition of the new grain-growing States farther west , whose produce is now brought to market by the increased facilities of transportation . The conclusion which our author seeks to establish by his multiplied observations on the want of skill displayed in American agriculture and on the rapid deterioration of American soil is , that British farmers have nothing to fear from competition with the producers of grain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not large , and is every year becoming less . He estimates the present annual Vroduct of wheat in New York at only fifteen millions of bushels , which is not enough for the consumption of her three mil // lions of inhabitants , if we admit the correctness of the English calculation , that an imperial quarter , or about nine American bushels , are needed for each member of the population . This calculation , however , is quite inapplicable in this country , where so much more meat , Indian corn , and other articles of provision are consumed than in Great Britain , that four bushels of wheat a-head would be an ample supply for our people . Thus much , however , may be conceded to our author , that so long as the price of wheat in Liverpool does not exceed forty shillings a quarter , no great supply of it will be sent thither from the United States . But let the price rise , as it often has done , to seventy or eighty shillings , and there is hardly any limit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be attracted into agriculture , nor will farmers test the utmost capacity of their lands for producing wheat , till an enhancement of the price in the foreign market offers them a sufficient remuneration for their labor . The high rates of profit obtained in trade and manufactures in this country offer the true explanation of those facts which our tourist would fain attribute to worn out lands and unskilful farming . Mr. Johnston 's visit to America occupied only eight months , as he left England on the 28th of July , 1849 , and sailed from Boston on his return on the 3d of April following . More than half of this short time was given to travelling in New Brunswick for the purpose of drawing up a report on the " agricultural capabilities* ' of the Province , a service for which he was employed by the Provincial government . Six or seven weeks more were spent in Boston , delivering a course of lectures before the Lowell Institute . Less than two months , then , remained for travelling as far south as Alexandria in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While in the United States , he travelled chiefly by steam conveyances , or he could not have . passed over so much ground ; and one would think that he must have written by steam also , or he could not have made so big a book out of so brief a visit , especially as a large portion of it is devoted to agriculture , and with the exception of a fortnight in Shptember , his stay here was in the depth of winter . The greater part of it might have been written , where it doubtless . was written , in the author 's comfortable study at Dur // ham . Mr. Johnston has not the sharp eye of the practised and sagacious observer , which quickly detects the little peculiarities of national character and habits that indicate the effects of a peculiar fcrm of government and a novel situation , as straws show which way the wind blows . He seldom notices any thing more than what lies immediately in his path as a scientific agriculturist , or what serves as food for national prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England than of the Middle States or the South , which is perhaps sufficiently explained by the circumstance that he spent most of his time here . If he would stay away from old England for a few years , till the fervor of his patriotism had a little cooled down , and a cosmopolite feeling supervened , we doubt not he could write a good book of travels . We copy the following , without venturing to admit , or yet to controvert , the sage remark upon proverbial sayings with which it concludes . " In this rapid run through New England , only three things made a permane , pt impression on my mind . These were , first , that the general rudeness of the people which travellers speak of is not perceptible in New England generally . It may be more striking in the Western States ; but if , on our home railways , all classes were indiscriminately mixed up in large carriages - cars , as they call them here - containing fifty or sixty people , I doubt if Old England passengers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England do . The second thing was the numerous country boxes or cottages , of all fashions and sizes , with their white painted walls and green jalousies , which skirted the railway during the last twenty miles of our ride to Boston . This is a peculiarly English feature , and indicates the existence among our trans.Atlantic kindred of that love of green fields , and of a quiet country life , which characterizes so much our island.home . By the operation of this feeling , as is the case around our own great cities , the wealth of the growing commercial city of Boston is carried out to the country residences of its merchants , and is on a thousand spots in course of being expended in clearing and improving the stony and in fertilizing the gravelly and sandy soils of which a large portion of the surface of Massachusetts consists . And my third observation was , that though the drought of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had extended into Maine , its effects became less perceptible as I advanced westward into the other New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beautifully green as I had seen them last at the mouth of the Mersey ; and the after.grass was abundant . // " Along the Connecticut River , which runs through the centre of this State , there is much good land , and tobacco in considerable quantity is grown upon it . The produce per acre is from 1500 to 2500 pouI*ls of marketable tobacco . This is a very exhausting crop , as all leaf crops are ; and land must be generously used which is to continue long to yield crops such as these . " The farming of Connecticut is said to have greatly improved during the last fifteen years , and this is ascribed in part , and probably with some truth , to the extensive circulation and perusal of agricultural papers . In the small country town of Farmington , ( of two thousand inhabitants , ) for example , a friend of mine assured me that not less than fifty agricultural papers were taken in by the inhabitants . And most of these papers - the American Agriculturist and American Cultivator , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and filled with valuable information . " A similar improving character is ascribed to the farming of Massachusetts , but less is said in favor of New Hampshire and other parts of New England . Of the first settlers in Connecticut and Massachusetts , many were from the west and southwest of England , from which places they naturally brought some parts of their old home husbandry , as that of apple-growing and cidermaking . The quantity of cider formerly made and drunk in this State is said to have been immense . It is , I suppose , from this beipg a staple branch of husbandry , that our home saying , " Great cry and little wool , " originating in the noise made at the scraping of a pig , has here assumed the form of " More cry than cider . " Vol. i. pp. 132- 134 . There is some truth in the observations that follow , though the writer does not reach the bottom of the subject . " A circumstance which early strikes the European traveller in the United States , is the comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small salaries they in general receive . The former may be supposed to arise from the more universal diffusion of a certain amount of instruction than is the case in most European countries - and this is no doubt in part the cause . But it is partly due also to the theoretical and practical political equality of all citizens , which appears to induce , among the masses of ordinarily educated men , an impression that higher intellectual gifts or attainments are , generally speaking , no sufficient reasons for social distinctions or higher consideration . Every man you meet thinks himself capable of giving an opinion upon questions of the most difficult kind ; and , for the most part , the masses seem , by their choice at public // elections , to prefer to be guided by the less , rather than by the more , educated of their fellow-citizens . " In the country districts , five to eight hundred dollars are considered a fair salary for a clergyman . In the cities , from eight to twelve hundred are given , and in rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of professional men , the lawyers succeed best , as the same theoretical equality which makes a man think his own opinion as good as his neighbor 's naturally promotes litigation , and makes the lawyer necessary , and the clever lawyer sought after and honored . " Medical men are perhaps the worst off , as , in most of the States , the educated physician has no defence against the quack . In only six out of the thirty-three States are there any laws making licenses necessary to the practice of medicine , or which place the educated physician in any respect in a better position than the pretender ; these are New Jersey , Delaware , the District of Columbia , Georgia , Louisiana , and Michigan . In the other States , any man may call himself a doctor , may practise , and may sue for his fees ; and , in many cases , a discerning public prefers the self-taught genius to the man of education . " In the United States there are at present thirty-five medical schools , with 4566 students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is calculated that , to supply fully the demand of the growing country , 2500 graduates should leave these schools every year . Under such circumstances , quackery must abound , unless the schools of Europe aid largely in adding to the stock of home-made surgeons and physicians . " The salaries paid to the clergy may be taken as a fair measure of their status among a Protestant people . Hence , if ? 100 to ? 160 a-year be the usual stipends paid to the clergy as a body , in a country where the laboring man and the mechanic obtains a considerably higher wage than with us , the estimation in which he is held must also be less elevated above that of the working classes than it is in the Old Country . But things will probably alter as age creeps upon the young States , and as men of leisure arise , who shall really have time , not merely to skim the surface of the various departments of knowledge , but to sound their depths , and bring up from below some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secures , but which even unintellectual men can admire , and are willing both to praise and purchase . " Vol. i. pp. 135- 137 . The following is characteristic , and is about the only good story in the book . " There are wandering teachers , who supply with knowledge 20* // the thirsty cultivators in the humblest villages . Notices are stuck up in the inns , or are printed in the newspapers ; or are spread in the form of handbills , such as two I met with to-dayMr . Humphreys intends to lecture in this village , during the current week , on electricity and the electric telegraph .

When on his way to Boston , on one occasion , with a friend , who had also been with him in Georgia , they dined at a hotel , where they saw opposite to them at table two New Englanders , whom they had last seen peddling in Georgia . Well , ' says his friend to one of them , ' when did you quit your peddling in Georgia ? ' The questioned made no reply , but swallowing his dinner expeditiously , as a New Englander can , he went out of the room , and , waiting for my friend and his companion , accosted them with , For heaven 's sake , say nothing about the peddling . We have been up to Maine , and as our wares were out , we took to the lecturing . It s not a bad trade ; we have made sixteen dollars a-day since we began .

Now , you wo n't say any thing about the peddling . ' " Vol. i. pp. 58-59 . The writer naturally feels more at home in the British Provinces , his observations on which would be really judicious and entertaining , if the pestilent idea of drawing comparisons between them and the United States , to the advantage of the former , did not so frequently come into his head . While in New Brunswick , he is frequently led to notice and complain of the passion of the people for the lumber business , which induced them to quit their farms , often to mortgage them deeply , to acquire roving and unsettled habits , and to despise the plodding industry which is content with slow but sure gains . A lumberer seems to be a cross between an Indian and a land speculator , having the habits of one , and the feverish // and greedy spirit of the other . A dim prospect of immense gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the woods , that a serious check was given to the progress of agriculture ; and when the lumber bubble burst , so many farms were found to have been mortgaged , or were thrust into the market for forced sale , that the Province was greatly impoverished . Many of the luckless adventurers , ashamed to show their heads at home again , found their way to " the States , " and are even now chopping pine trees in North Carolina and Georgia . Very short-sighted they were , in Mr. Johnston 's opinion , to leave such excellent farms behind them , for the sake of chasing a will-o ' - the- wisp in the forests . According to his estimate , the average produce of New Brunswick is 18 bushels of wheat to the acre , exceeding that of the great grain-growing State of New York by 25 or 30 per cent . As the Province lies north of the 45th parallel of latitude , and has been reported to have a cold and foggy climate , and a soil better suited for potatoes than the cereal grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its agricultural capacities . It will take the New Brunswickers themselves by surprise ; for our author notices the opinion as " very prevalent in the colony , that New Brunswick was barely able to produce food enough for its existing population , and could of itself sustain no increase of inhabitants . " Its present population is but little over 200,000 ; but he bravely calculates that it is capable of supporting over four millions of people ; and if fossil fuel should be discovered , the number may be raised nearly to six millions . This estimate , if it be correct , does not redound much to the honor of the inhabitants ; for the settlements in the Province are now of old date , and their progress has been lamentably slow , while it should have been as rapid as in the most favored region of America . Possibly some peculiarities in the machinery of government in New Brunswick have not materially contributed to its growth . Contrasted with the simplicity and cheapness of our own State systems , the bureaucracy which is established there appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population about half as large as that of Connecticut , it has a number of departments and a list of officials which // might suffice for the empire State of ' New York . The salaries were once very liberal ; but now that the Province has the honor of appointing the incumbents of office , and the burden of supporting them , they have been reduced to the lowest point which is compatible with a faithful and intelligent performance of the duties . Thus the field which is open for ambitious talent is very limited , and the highest honors which are attainable seem hardly worthy of an effort . Really able men feel their circumscribed position , and peevishly foster the spirit of dis. - content and complaint , though there is actually no grievance to be redressed . How can they be quiet ? If they were in England , parliamentary honors would be attainable ; if in this country , the post of president of the republic would be a prize to dream about , if not an object within their grasp . Even those whose abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any circumstances are at liberty to fancy that the sole obstacle to their gaining distinction is their provincialism . Thus the discontent which is created is great , out of all proportion to the cause in which it originates . Along the Miramichi River , Mr. Johnston found large tracts of country whose bleak and desolate appearance is a memorial of the terrible conflagration of the woods which happened there a quarter of a century ago . He met with one person in whose mind the horrors of the scene were still fresh , and who gave him a vivid account of this disaster . " It was an excessively hot summer , and fires were burning in numerous places upon the Miramichi and St. John Rivers and their tributaries ; and the air was everywhere hot , and obscured with smoke . But on the 7th of October , it began to blow from the southwest , and the fire to spread over the country in the same direction . The wind increased gradually to a hurricane , and the fire advanced with proportionate rapidity . At one o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river ; and in the evening , it was at Douglastown . It travelled eighty-five miles in nine hours , so that scarcely on a fleet horse could a man have escaped from it . Lumberers already in the woods were caught , and solitary settlers with their families ; and while all their property was destroyed , some saved their lives by rolling themselves in the rivers , till the scorching blast had passed over them . Instances of miraculous escape he told us - of parental devotion , and of selfish desertion ; but the most striking things he mentioned were , that the flame , as it advanced , was twenty-five miles // in breadth ; that , coming from the west , it rushed past the towns of Newcastle and Douglastown , leaving a green margin of some miles in breadth between its southern edge and the river ; and that when , in its easterly course , it reached Burnt-church River , the wind lulled , turned round , and drove the fire up the river again . It then came back along the green fringe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way licked up the towns of Douglastown and Newcastle - of their 254 houses leaving only 14 . It was doubtless the rushing of the sea-wind from the Gulf of St. Lawrence , into the huge fiery vortex , that drove back the flame when it had reached the open mouth of the Miramichi River . " At these towns , men and cattle rushed into the river ; and though a hurricane was raging on its surface , people hurried into vessels and boats and scows , and eagerly thrust off from the land . The lesser dread was forgotten in the presence of the greater . But although so huge a flame was raging , there was no light . Showers of ashes and burned twigs , and still burning brands , and thick smoke , filled the air ; and for two days afterwards , amid a perfect calm , the darkness on the river was such that a bell was kept tolling on each bank to indicate the site of the ferry , that people might know where to steer to . " The town of Chatham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great measure escaped ; but the Nassau Settlement , six miles behind it , was burned to the ground - the settlers only saving their lives by rolling themselves in the river till the flame had passed away . In many streams , where the native woods still overhung them , the water proved insufficient to preserve human life ; and the thousands of salmon and other fish found floating on their surfaces showed how intense and penetrating the heat must have been . " Over many other parts of the Province , great fires raged on the same day ; and the loss to the Province , not only in private property , but in the public forests consumed , was immense . The loss of private property at Miramichi alone was estimated at ? 228,000 . Nor , in such burnings , is the public injury confined to the old forest trees consumed , which it will take many years to replace , but the soil itself is permanently injured by every such visitation . The clouds of ashes borne away by the wind are an actual robbery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in this way , no doubt , among others , that land is destroyed , as the provincials term it , by frequent burnings . " On this occasion , cinders and smoke were observed at Quebec , on the banks of Newfoundland , and even as far off as the Bermudas . " Vol. ii . pp. 35-36. // with no unfriendly feeling . It is because we attach so much value to the preservation of amity and good-will between the people of England and of this country that we feel called upon to rebuke even with sternness those who would cast the seeds of dissension and jealousy between them . The extension of commerce is daily multiplying and strengthening the ties which bind them to each other ; and certainly literature and science ought to do nothing to rupture these grateful bonds .
