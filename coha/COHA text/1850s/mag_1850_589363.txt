NATURAL HISTORY OF MAN . * THE work at the head of this article , has been many years before the public , and has been , so far as we know , universally commended . It appears , however , from Dr. Prichard 's own showing , that his labors have been more highly esteemed by the Germans , than by his own " utilitariaa countrymen , "  --  a fact which should have made him suspect its value , and examine it with severe scrutiny . We fancy that no people judge more correctly of the substantial merit of literary or scientific labor , than the English ; and most certainly none are more abundantly gifted with the desire , or the means , to patronize home genius , as none are more exclusively national . The whole work , too , was evidently constructedmoulded , to harmonize with popular opinion ; and the second section , on the " Bearings of the Question , " is an artful appeal to public sympathy for support . But , although he might complain of the patronage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberality of the press and learned bodies , which strove to confer upon him praise and honor . It is no pleasant task to arraign at the public bar a work so extensively known , and received as a standard authority . Nor would we attempt it for anything less than a capital error , in which the public has a very deep interest . We do not regard the numerous judgments he has received from courts of concurrent jurisdictions , as a bar to our proceedings ; for nothing is more common and notorious , than for judges in this court , contemporary with authors , to discharge their high functions under influences not very creditable to the ermine . Many of them are , no doubt , very honest , and most of them flippant on the subjects that come before them ; but it is , unquestionably , a matter of first importance to suitors in these courts , to bring with them , in general , as many other recommendations as they can procure , especially if the work to be judged is the first appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , who , by reason of merit or influence , should obtain a favorable judgment from a Jerrold or a Macaulay , as the whole pack will give consentaneous tongue , as though the scent of the game actually reached their own noses ; and unfortunate is he , whatever may be his merit , whose time has passed in obscurity , and encounters the severity of the judges in defenceless nakedness . Poor soul ! he shrinks back to his obscurity and his books , and appeals to another generation for justice , when he and his successful contemporaries will be weighed with a just balance . We have now in our eye several authors moving among us in " all the pride and circumstance " of factitious glory and wealth , whose fee-simple of reputation in the next generation would be dear at half an hour 's purchase . We do not say that Dr. Prichard 's reputation is of this character , because he has some-. thing more to depend on than his " Natural History of Man . " Besides , it appears to be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Natural History of Man ; comprising inquiries into the modifying influences of physical and moral agencies on the different tribes of the human family . By James Cowles Prichard , M.D. , F.RS. , M.R.I.A. , &amp;c. // should precede the appearance of truth , just as the dawn precedes the coming of " the glorious orb of day ; " and although the dawn is forgotten in the splendor of the day , and the season of speculation is lost in the blaze of truth , by people gen*rally , yet there are a few who retain the knowledge of the necessary progress of events . The very lively interest which has succeeded to a hitherto profound apathy in the public mind , in regard to the natural history of man , can not all be attributed to the higher perfection of the science . Political agitations have produced much of it ; and although it is unquestionably true that a scientific natural history of man can not become a partisan for or against slavery , yet it must present most of the natural facts upon which the arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must divest the subject of much of the passion with which it has been conducted . But if the public interest were principally founded on these , political agitations , and not on real progress made in the science , we should have no hope of any permanent advantage to be gained by it . On the contrary , the science has progressed ; has been taken from the custody and control of mere anatomists , who exhibited only its skeleton , and has been given to the public clothed with its flesh , and endowed with its vitality . We do not pretend to say that it is perfect in all its parts , and exhibits the beauty of maturity . Time is required for these developments , as it is for others . But one man and one woman came into the world as adults ; all others have been infants , requiring constant attention to raise and improve them . It is instructing to follow the progress of some of the most important sciences from their first rude beginnings to their present advanced conditions . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishes nothing when it abandons observation and induction , and attempts to rely on speculation for advance in knowledge . It will teach us , that , after proceeding a certain length by observation and induction , there is a constant tendency of the human mind to rely on speculations  --  to assume premises , and to make them the foundations of systems . It will inform us , that the human mind has a greater tendency to error than to truth ; and that in every science , but mathematics , such speculations have prevailed , and postponed progress , until the mind is again brought back to the point of departure ,  --  observation and induction . It will tell us that there are two great principles of the human mind concerned in the formation of science-genius and reason-which are so seldom combined in one individual , that but few Aristotles and Bacons are found dotted among the generations of men ; while men with genius without a proper proportion of reason , and the reverse , are not rare . It will teach us , that the departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first made by one whose genius predominates , and that it is continued and maintained by those in whom reason predominates , almost to the exclusion of intuitive perception . It will tell us , that the whole time is not lost during which genius has usurped the throne of observation and induction ; for although systematic science is not advanced , and many errors are propagated , yet a number of useful facts are often collected , and the errors became pointers , to a well-balanced mind , for the discovery of truth . These , and many other valuable lessons , will be taught to him who closely follows the progress of the sciences from their beginnings to their // present conditions . We might easily illiustrate the above remarks by the example of chemistry , astronomy , medicine , &amp;c. ; but as our special subject , the natural history of man , will be sufficient for our purpose , we propose to follow it as closely as our limits will permit . Unlike most other branches , the natural history of man has been emphatically a creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other branches have their origins in the necessities and wants of mankind , which begat the arts , and which supplied the numerous facts and induced the observations from which the principles of science can only be inferred . From the first rude conceptions of the Greeks , to the last labored and artificial system of the Blumenbachian school of philosophers , the natural history of man has only been a series of speculations , unaccompanied by any of those sound logical arguments which we most generally find in the supporters of speculations in other branches of science . Nor is it very surprising that such has been the case ; for although the natural history of other animals had its origin from observation of , and induction from , the great store of facts gathered during ages , no such store had been collected in respect to man . Civil , political and religious histories , together with the arts , sciences and polite literature of the world , contain innumerable facts illustrating the nature of man , as perfectly as the facts relating to the honey-bee , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social animals , illustrate the nature of the animal described . But , unfortunately , the condition of man has never been regarded as the product of his nature , but as an artificial state ; as if he had the power , by art , something extrinsic and superior to nature , to rise superior to the condition to which the Creator destined him , by other aids than his natural endowments . Under such circumstances , what facts were left upon which to found observation , and to make the necessary inductions preparatory to the formation of a science l None . The beaver , the bee , the ant , the spider , and many other animals , exhibit powers as strange in comparison with many other animals , as the extraordinary powers of man are strange in comparison with the whole organic kingdom ; but these animals are exterior and inferior to us , and we can observe their natures without prejudice or passion . Besides , our capacities , without being severely taxed , enable us to comprehend the whole monotonous routine of the powers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly ascribe them to natural operations ; just as a race of beings equally superior in capacity to man would comprehend and describe human powers ; " and show a Newton as we show an ape . " But man , investigating himself , is another and a very different affair . He encounters not only his pride , his prejudices , his passions and the accumulated errors of ages , but , if he should entertain a correct view of his subject , it is equal to , if not beyond his highest intellectual capacity , whatever may be his estimate of it . It embraces all his relations , sexual , social , political and religious , just as , when describing the ant , we tell of the arrangements and economy of the hill ; or the honey-bee , we speak of the regulations and economy of the hive . It embraces his poetry , his literature , his science , his eloquence , for the same reason that , in describing the mocking-bird , we must not omit his inimitable powers of song ; nor in describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harangues to his congregations , which are , no doubt , very ed ifying. // We proceed to show that the natural history of man , until very recently , has been only a series of speculations , unsupported by any of those sound arguments which we most generally find used by the supporters of speculations in other branches of science . To do this we must give a short history of the rise of general natural history , ( or that of the lower animal kingdom , ) to show that the value of the principles obtained in this science is subordinate to long and laborious observation of the animal world , grew out of ; and would have no value without such o , bservation ; consequently , as the principles thus obtained are applied with equal authority to the natural history of man , without any previous observation of his nature , and are attempted to be supported and confirmed in their entire control of the science exclusively from analogy , with the lower orders of animals , that the whole fabric is an assumption , a speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be proper before we proceed , to define the terms " observation , " " induction , " and speculation , " as they are philosophically understood , because some readers may be at a loss respecting them . Observation , is a close and critical attention to , and examination of the phenomena of nature . Induction , is the process by which , from the natural phenomena collected by observation , we arrive at the general principle or natural law , indicated by a kindred class of phenomena . Induction , is the opposite to reduction ; for as induction is the synthesis or combination of all kindred phenomena into one general principle or law , so reduction is the analysis , or resolution of a principle , or law , into its elements , or individual phenomena . But the powers required for the successful practical operation of the two are vastly different ; as different as between the power of one individual to invent a chronometer , and the power of another only to take it to pieces , and lay each piece by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chastened by reason ; but reduction is a simple act of reason , the mere act of the logician . The proper exercise of the first power belongs only to the prophets , the seers of the scientific world ; while the proper exercise of the last , belongs , in a great or less degree , somewhat in proportion to cultivation to mankind in general . This is the reason why Aristotles , Bacons , Newtons and Cuviers , are so few and far between , in the generations of men ; while professors , philosophers , critics and scholars , are so numerous . We , lastly , proceed to the definition of speculation , which is an assumption of general principle or law , without observation and induction . It is not pretended that a speculation would become a generally received proposition without having some pausibility ; some appearance of truth by being in harmony with some known facts ; for willing as most learned men are to take first principles ,  --  premises-for granted , because of the difficulty , and often , the incapacity to expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated men , to believe they would be long led astray by a speculation which leads directly to an absurd conclusion . Thousands possess good logical powers for one gifted with a genius for correct induction ; consequently , thousands are more willing to take premises from some authority , some great name , that they may with becoming vanity , exhibit their logical skill , than to question premises , and grope in a region in which there is no Pisgah 's top to which they can // climb to behold the promised land . But then they want a speculation , they want premises , which they honestly believe to be true , either from the force of education , or from great authority , and which will afford fair play for the exercise of their logical powers and skill , and a reasonable hope for victory , not a certainty of defeat . Having disposed of the definitions , we now proceed with a short history of the rise and progress of zoology , with the view of showing that every important principle in the science has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occupy time with an examination of what the ancients knew of the animal world , before the time of Aristotle . Every reader knows that the Bible , Homer , Herodotus , &amp;c. , show conclusively that the ancients were familiar with everything relating to the nature of animals which could be gleaned from observation and experience . From a necessity growing out of the circumstances of patriarchal life , this knowledge must have been the first acquired . Then , animals were more emphatically than at any subsequent period , either man 's natural enemies , his natural friends , or the store from whence was supplied his food and raiment . Surrounded by predaceous beasts , his brave and trusty friend and ally , the dog , enabled him to conquer them . Notwithstanding the progress of later periods in sciences , arts , and civilization , the addition to the stock of domestic animals ( and vegetables ) has been comparatively nothing since those reclaimed , bred , and cultivated , at the period of which we are speaking . If they did not exhaust the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their accurate knowledge of animal nature , and exceedingly judicious selection , have made it unnecessary for future generations to desire to make additions . It was from the store of facts thus collected that the great Stagyrite clearly saw how a beautiful and valuable science could be framed ; and although he did not attempt to construct it by a serial classification of subordinate characteristics , he generalized the facts of all previous observation , by an enumeration of characteristics , by which classes were grouped in genera , or families . All his distinctive characteristics were of equal value ; that is , his design was to exhibit identity and separation , not affinity and proximity ; and consequently , every division was called a genos or genus , and not separated subordinately into classes , orders , families , genera and species , which imply affinity and proximity , as well as identity and separation . The enumeration of his characteristics will show the amazing power of Aristotle to generalize the chaos of facts obtained from long observation , and to create a science immediately from its rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , the actions , manners , and natures of animals ; the mode of producing their young ; their feet , whether biped , or quadruped , &amp;c. ; and whether solid hoofed , cloven , or many cloven hoofed , or clawed ; their blood , sanguineous or exsanguineous ; their lungs , or absence of them ; their habitations on land , in water , or in the air ; their teeth , front and back , marking the difference between carnivora and others ; their wings , &amp;c . From Aristotle to Ray , about two thousand years , systematic zoology received no improvement . Ray introduced a classification of subordination of characters and of groups , by which the natural affinities of families , or groups , became engrafted on Aristotle 's separated or // isolated divisions . This was a most important improvement of Aristotle 's system . It enabled the great Linmeus , about a century afterwards , to obtain a glimpse of the circular relations of affinities which prevails throughout nature , which is evident from his foundation of the orders of mammalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions of Aristotle , yet the introduction of a system of subordinate characteristics was a valuable step in the science of zoology . The great Linmeus not only improved and extended the classification introduced by Ray , but regained part of what he had lost by confining himself so closely to external characteristics . But , although he founded his system in part on anatomical characteristics , it is evident that external characters were the guiding principles which governed him . It was something - nay , it was much , to have three great divisions of the animal kingdom , characterised by their hearts , besides several anatomical details , which occur in his classification , because it was an advance in the right direction ; but neither Ray nor Linnams covered the ground indicated by their great predecessor . These two great naturalists , especially Linmeus , carried the science of zoology to a very high degree of perfection on characteristics derived from external observation . Their details were not always correct ; as , for example , in their systems , the elephant is classed as an unguiculate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : but errors of this kind are easily corrected , as they do not affect any principle . Up to this period no kindred or collateral science contributed to the formation or progress of zoology . Observation of animals , and induction from the facts thus gathered , were the instruments . Aristotle , in the true spirit of prophetic vision , rather than by means of scientific knowledge , saw the value of anatomy and physiology to this science , but framed no system to enforce it . Ray lost sight of it , and Linnams , though he partly recognised it , adopted external character as the guiding principle of his system . But the time now arrived when a kindred science was to be pressed into the service of zoology ; when the vision of Aristotle was to be realised ; when the Linna*an principles of classification were to be superseded ; - when the Enaima and Anaima of Aristotle were not only proved to be fallacious , but , if true , were actually subordinate to a higher principle  --  the nervous systems . But the illustrious Cuvier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place anatomy and physiology in their seats , but to elevate them to higher seats , and greater power , and thus enable observation to discover that she had stopped short of the invariable harmony of external animal nature , and internal animal organization , and that induction had , consequently , rested on a subordinate , instead of a primary principle . Should we industriously search for an example to show clearly the immense extent of close observation required to frame a natural system of science , and to eliminate prevailing errors , we know of none to answer the purpose so effectually as zoology . Here we have a most minute observation of the animal kingdom , extended over a period of nearly 4,000 years , during which it was man 's interest , as well for profit as security , to study the external characters of all the animals which then so numerously surrounded him , before an attempt was made to generalize the characteristics indicated by such observation : and , after Aristotle indicated the // characteristics , another 2,000 years elapsed before Ray arose to devise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved and extended by Linnaus-which , in another century , was discovered by Cuvier to be inadequate to the object , because it was not on a natural basis . Nor were investigations in this deeply interesting and important subject , confined to the four great names we have selected to designate epochs in the science ; for Pliny , Buffon , Blumenbach , Lamark , and many other eminent men , filled up the intervals with their labors . But no part of this extensive observation related to man . It was confined exclusively to the inferior animal kingdom . Linna*us , in his splendid effort to perfect the system began by Ray , found it necessary to class man somewhere ; and finding him to be a mammal , with four incisive , and two laniary , teeth in each jaw , in which he agreed with Simke , Lemurs , and Bats , he placed man at the head of his Order of Primates , which included these animals ; consequently , he was indebted to his mamm*e and dentition for his position in classification , unless we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble order , in compliment to his higher powers . Here Cuvier and Blumenbach found him . Cuvier , not admiring his fellowship with monkeys , Lemurs and Bats , made an order expressly for man in his system , founded on his anterior limbs-bimana , or two banded-which contained a single species , consisting of three varieties , which he called Caucassian , Mongolian and Ethiopian , to which Blumenbach added the Malayan and American . Where these great naturalists left him , he stands yet , or , at least , he stood until very recently . We have thus seen that the classificatory characteristics of inferior animals were obtained after long-continued and close observation and research of some of the highest intellects of every age ; but that man , the spirit animal , was forced into the ranks with them , not from observation of his nature , of his relations to the external world , but because he had mamm*e , and the dentition of monkeys , or only two hands instead of the four possessed by monkeys . But this is by no means all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit , with at least a show of grace , if he were only indebted for his positio*i in classification to his agreement or disagreement with monkeys ; but when they describe man , define his nature , his powers , and give their reasons why he is only of one species , though of several varieties , and depart from every process of observation and induction by means of which they arrived at the history of every other animal , we confess it to be a severe tax on our patience . Monkeys furnished the place for him in **25;313;TOOLONG him into the animal kingdom ; and then every animal and every vegetable became his analogue for some one trait of character by which to describe him . We contend that this process is unphilosophical , the reverse of what it should be , and a method by which no hope of progress in the natural history of man can be entertained .. We contend that analogies are only hypotheses , from which no induction can be made for the foundation of a science . We contend that , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a selection of a property , or properties from every animal and vegetable in the organic kingdom , were made by the most competent judges , and could be combined in one new creature , it would not be the analogue of man , because the moral and intellectual powers would be absent-his spiritual nature would not be represented . The celebrated Dr. William Hunter , // in a lecture on the digestive organs , referring to similar analogies , then abundantly used by physiologists to illustrate the nature of the stomach , said , " Physiologists will have it that the stomach is a mill ; others , that it is a fermenting vat ; others again , that it is a stew-pan ; but in my view of the matter it is neither a mill , a fermenting vat , nor a stew-pan-but a stomach , gentlemen , a stomach . " in the like spirit , we say to our readers , that some naturalists will have it that man is a horse ; others , that he is an ass ; others again , that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog ; some that he is any animal , and every vegetable ; but in our view of the matter , he is neither a horse , an ass , ( ? ) a dog , a hog , nor any other animal , or vegetable , but a man , gentlemen , a man ; a being whose nature , whose relations to the external world , and whose capability of altering , amending , and extending them , must be observed in himselg-in what he has done and is capable of doing , by any naturalist who would correctly classify and describe him . The frequent use of such analogies as are now in vogue by grave philosophers , and the use of which has conferred on some of them a degree of reputation . which , ordinarily , can be gained only by men of real genius , prevailed in ancient times . The mandrake , for its fancied analogy to the human form , was esteemed a remedy for barrenness ; and the eagle-stone , being pregnant with a little nodule stone , which rattles when agitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed the virtue , if tied to the arm of such a woman , to prevent abortion ; but if tied to the thigh , to facilitate delivery . The lungs of a fox were a specific for the asthma , because he is proverbially long-winded ; and hard was the heart of the youth who could resist the maiden 's eyes who had borrowed the splendor of eye-bright . Absurd as the old doctrine of signatures appears now to be , we contend that it is not a whit more absurd than the same doctrine under the new name of analogy , as applied to the Natural History of Man ; and we confidently predict , that ten years will not have elapsed before it will be regarded with equal contempt . But let us illustrate the fallacies of analogies by a few examples , in which conclusions drawn from them , so far from being absurd , are highly probable , and often convincing . Very few of the numerous fungi are esculent ; the others are active poisons . A stranger to their properties would infer , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisonous , according as he happened to be first informed respecting them . Besides , analogy would tell us , that all the fungi poisonous to man , are also poisonous to domestic animals ; but a single cow will eat , with impunity , as many as would kill a hundred nen . Because pepper is an agreeable and wholesome condiment for man , analogy would lead us to believe it to be equally so to the hog , to which animal it is a poison . Analogy has never done more mischief than when the opinion prevailed with medical men , that the mysteries of gastero-ehemistry could be explained by , or were identical with , labor6-chemistry . Two-thirds of the population of the city of Leyden , by a fever which prevailed in 1099 , were consigned to the grave by the mistake of Professor Sylvids de la Boe , who attributed the disease to a prevailing acid , which could only be cured by the administration of alkalies . We might fill pages with examples to prove that laboro-chemistry and gastric-chemistry are not analogous , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anatomy would also furnish many examples of the fallacy of analogy ; // for during the period that a knowledge of the human system was obtained from the dissection of inferior animals , instead of the human subject , errors abounded , and a knowledge of human structure was very imperfect . But we forbear , because we scarcely know with what science to stop . All of them have been more pestered than benefited by this universal instrument of medium minds to arrive circuitously at a result which they could never hope to reach by a direct route ,  --  this floating cork upon the ocean of human knowledge , which enables a few choice spirits , who know how and when to trust to it , to reach a haven of safety ; but deceitfully entices the many to certain destruction and oblivion . We say , that a few choice spirits , who know how and when , to trust to analogy , arrive at truth by it , which would otherwise be inaccessible to them ; but it never receives their confidence , without being predicated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty nearly amounting to absolute demonstration . They never attempt to ascertain general principles of analogy ; but having obtained a general law , or principle , they may arrive at a knowledge of a particular property of a substance subject to that law , or principle , by analogy , with another substance subject to the same law . Thus Newton discovered the law that the refractive power of transparent bodies is equal to their density ; and that when of equal density those which refracted the most were inflammable . Hence , from analogy , he predicted that water contained a combustible principle . This speculation was verified after the discovery that the elements of water were oxygen and hydrogen . Here no general principle is attempted to be established by the analogy of individuals but the general principle being known , a property in an individual , subject to the general principle , but not known to possess the property , is inferred from analogy , and , as might be expected , subsequently proved to be true . How vastly different from the process invariably pursued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by individual analogies , not individual analogies from general principles . But it is now time to come directly to the point at which the preceding remarks are aimed . We have arraigned at the bar of the highest earthly tribunal some of the master-spirits of the age . It is necessary , therefore , after having opened the case by our preceding remarks , that we should proceed in this our summing up , with an examination of the evidence by which we expect to convict them . Linmeus , Blumenbach and Cuvier , ( particularly the first and last , ) whose solid and enduring reputations have grown out of the great revolutions they effected , and the valuable systems they established , rather than on any item in their systems , we pass with the reverence and deference due to transcendant genius . We do this , not because we approve of what they have said and done in relation to the natural history of man ; not because we servilely submit to the authority of great names , but because we can find another great man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of natural history , and by devoting a great part of a long life to maintaining , defending , and extending their dicta , has not only contrived to become clothed with the authority of their great names , but has earned for himself no mean reputation . A few persons may imagine that we have arraigned Dr. Prichard , instead of Mr. Lawrence , because he is the weaker antagonist ; but let it be remembered that the principles of both are the same , the difference being in the mode of execution . Lawrence keeps his // eyes open , and evidently sees many of the difficulties which surround him in his journey ; while Prichard , regarding only the object to be reached , at every leap shuts his eyes , to avoid injury from the thicket through which he breaks . But we prefer Prichard on account of the higher reputation he enjoys , for the same reason that the boy pursues the butterfly ; and , perhaps , for a better reason , that he is generally regarded as the standard author on the subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " Natural History of Man , " page 4 , his own statement of the principles upon which his natural history is constructed . " How different a being is the Esquimaux , who , in his burrow amid northern ices , gorges himself with the blubber of whales , from the lean and hungry Numidian , who pursues the lion under a vertical sun ! And how different , whether compared with the skin-clad and oily fisher of the icebergs , or with the naked hunter of the Sahara , are the luxurious inmates of Eastern harems , or the energetic and intellectual inhabitants of the cities of Europe ! That so great differences in external conditions , by the double influence of their physical and moral agency , should have effected during a long series of ages remarkable changes in the tribes of human beings subjected to their operationchanges which have rendered these several tribes fitted in a peculiar manner for their respective abodes ,  --  is by no means an improbable conjecture ; and it becomes something more than a conjecture , when we extend our view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domesticated , and have transferred with themselves from one climate to another . Considered in this point of view , it acquires , perhaps , the character of a legitimate theory , supported by adequate evidence , and by an extensive series of analogous facts . " Let us not be mistaken in the foundation he has laid for his " Natural History of Man . " First , a not " improbable conjecture " that the physical agency of the elements , and the moral agency of man , have produced all differences observable in the races of men ; second , that this " becomes something more than a conjecture , " by analogy with domestic animals ; and , third , by . some process , which we confess we do not understand , ( by pausing a moment and considering the power of such analogies , ) it immediately becomes " a legitimate theory , supported by adequate evidence . " That is , that what is not an improbable guess in the first instance , becomes something more than a guess by another guess ;  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition of circumstance , becomes " a legitimate theory , supported by adequate evidence , " as or derly as the conclusion follows the two premises in a categorical syllogism . Shades of Aristotle and Bacon ! what a foundation for a natural science ! Two guesses , being reguessed , produce an axiom , make all the guesse*s certainties , substantial realities , capable of supporting the most massive and splendid structure in the regions of natural science ! If he designed to write the natural history of the man in the moon , it is probable conjecture and analogy might furnish him with the materials ; but the man of this earth he could see and feel ; his nature was accessible to him through his condition , religious , social , and political , and through his works , in the arts , sciences , literature , &amp;c. , of all nations and people . This , the natural method of investigation , came recommended to him by the highest authority  --  the experience of at least 6,000 rears , fortified in natural history by Aristotle , Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his law , Blumenbach and Cuvier , in everything they attempted , but the history of man ; - and , in general philosophy , by the perpetual president of philosophers , the immortal Bacon . But we deny the probability of the conjecture . Van Amringe , in his Natural History of Man , pp. 3234 , says : " We also make an assertion , and defy proof to the contrary ; that there is not upon record a single instance of a physical change of any people , ancient or modern , which can be detected by the anatomist , and which we have good reason to believe has been produced by civilization . We prove it , first , by the admission of the authors in question ; for they have unhesitatingly classed very ancient nations by their skulls , and told whether they were of the Caucassian , Mangolian , or Ethiopian variety ; which would be absurd if they had no confidence in the permanence of peculiar characteristics . We prove it , secondly , by the uniform testimony of history , from Herodotus down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men are always described with the same characteristics . We prove it , thirdly , by the figures adorning the tombs of the ancient kings of Egypt , in which the physiognomy and color of the different races of men are preserved , and exhibit them to have been , nearly four thousand years ago , identically the same as they are now . " Supported by such an array of facts , we deny , not only the probability of the conjecture , but also that the analogy of domesticated animals is " adequate evidence " that the conjecture becomes " a legitimate theory ; " for if domestic animals have changed , they are not the analogues of man , as he has not changed ; and if they have not changed , they prove nothing to the purpose . To show conclusively that this assertion by Dr. Prichard , that the analogy of domesticated animals " is adequate evidence " of " legitimate theory , " for the natural history of man is an assumption founded only on a remote probability , and consequently very weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amringe 's Natural History of Man , p. 219 , et seq. : " Domestic animals are constantly relied on as the analogues of man in this as well as all other respects , by the advocates of the unity of the species . As analogues they should migrate to the respective regions voluntarily , and provide their own food and comforts . No instance of the kind has ever been known . Of the very few wild animals which have an indefinite range  --  the fox , for instance-we think it highly probable that , upon a close investigation , it will be found that the limits of particular species are more circumscribed than is generally believed . But these widely-spread animals are not those which are selected for analogues . From necessity , domestic animals must be resorted to . And yet we know not a single domestic animal , but the turkey , the wild type of which is known to zoologists . Who can tell the wild type of sheep ? Who can tell what change domestication has made on them ? " Abel was a keeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our domestic breed was not appropriated to man , at his expulsion from Eden , most assuredly the remainder can not be discovered , by the most elaborate researches . One circumstance makes it highly probable that the whole race was so appropriated ; for it is remarkable that this animal will not live in any climate , without the protection of man . In America the horse , the ox , and the hog , have run wild , have multiplied , and have resumed uniform colors and habits ; but who has , at any time , or anywhere , heard of sheep running wild and // propagating ? This is a remarkable fact , and an important item , to prove the Divine origin of the Mosaic history . If he did not write from inspiration , it is a most unaccountable circumstance , that the only animal he mentions to have been the associate of Adam and family , is the only one which , to this day , clings to his posterity for support , protection , and existence . " " Profane history gives no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ass , and the camel , were domesticated . It is fair , therefore , to presume that they were all in a state of domestication long before the commencement of such history ; and as we have no mention in any history , that any of them have undergone any constitutional changes , it is also a fair presumption , that they had all arrived at their present permanent characters long before the era of history : consequently , that domestication has produced no change in them for at least 2,500 years . Sacred history informs us , not positively , but negatively , that sheep , oxen , camels and asses , were domesticated long before horses . All the other animals are mentioned by Moses , as common objects of property , during the lives of Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , Esau , and Joseph ; but the horse is not mentioned until the 9th Exodus , v. 3 , after which he is frequently introduced . It is thus proved , negatively , that the horse was domesticated at least 500 years after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheep is mentioned long before any of the others , and is always enumerated with them . But although the horse does not appear to have been domesticated much longer than about 1500 years , A.C. , his type in a wild state is entirely lost , and his native country is unknown. ** " An important circumstance is mentioned by the sacred historian , in the history of Jacob . It is that cattle and sheep of Laban 's herds and flocks , had the same constitutional facility to change color , or even a greater facility , than they now possess . This fact leans strongly against the supposition that their constitutional tendency to change was induced by domestication . It makes it more probable that it was originally inherent in the animals . However this may be , the facts contained in this early history prove positively that there is a marked difference in different kinds of animals , in regard to the tendency to change color ; and , therefore , that no animal is an analogue for another in this respect . The sheep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in color only from white to black , or rather dark brown . The ass and the camel , although domesticated simultaneously , or nearly so , with the ox , never assume the variety of colors of this animal ; and the horse , the last domesticated , is more variable than any of them . On the theory contended for by writers , that " the state of domestication " produces these variations , the sheep should be the most variable of all our domestic animals , whereas it is the least . " " Among some other domestic animals , equally as long domesticated as the horse at least  --  the mouse , for instance-no disposition to change , in color , or form , is known to have taken place . The brown rat of Persia , although only a domestic in Europe short of 300 years , and from thence imported into America , has been , from the earliest period , a constant associate and pest of man in Central Asia , without undergoing any known change ; and since his wide dispersion over Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has invariably preserved his original color and type . Thus it appears , when we take a comprehensive // view of all domestic animals , the associates of man , that there is a vast difference between them in respect to changes , even granting , what by no means follows as a matter of course , that domestication produces all the known changes . Hence , it is apparent that it should not to be taken for granted that domestic animals are the analogues of man , in regard to organic and functional changes . " " There is yet another difficulty equally insurmountable . We know absolutely nothing of the wild types of the sheep , the ox , the horse , the camel , and the dog ; therefore , as we have said , we can not say how much , or from what they have changed constitutionally  --  or if they have changed at all . Animals of the ox and horse kinds , which have run wild in our southern prairies and savannahs , generally assume a uniform color and shape ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a universal rule . Many of them have , and retain , a variety of colors . Therefore , they prove nothing absolutely , although they afford a reasonable presumption that a large ma of the wild stock was of one color ; but the variety of color prevailing among them is equally conclusive that there was , originally , the same diversity in the wild , as the domestic state . It is well known to importers and dealers in hides brought from California and South America , both of the ox and the horse , that although there is a general tendency to one color , yet there are many of the ordinary colors of our domestic breeds . " " It is apparent , from what we have said , that the advocates for the unity of the human species , by reason of analogies with domestic animals , do so by two assumptions : - First , that these animals actually become constitutionally changed , anatomically and functionally , by domestication ; - and , secondly , that man is constitutionally similar to any and every domestic animal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' them agree with one anothcr . " The design of this article is to exhibit the truth of our assertion- " that the natural history of man , until very recently , has been only a series of speculations , unsupported by any of those sound arguments which we most generally find used by the supporters of speculations in other branches of science . " We now appeal to our readers for judgment . We know that our judges are prepossessed in favor of the party on trial . Dr. Prichard , supported by Cuvier , Blumenbach , Lawrence , and many philosophers of less weight of chai acter , and hacked by the great body of clergymen who regard him as the champion of orthodoxy , because he advoc*ates the unity of the human species , is not to be convicted on slight grounds of accusation and proof . We ask , therefore , are the grounds of accusation slight ? Is the proof slight or full ? The accusation is-that he has founded his Natural History of ! tlian on a series of speculationsand the proof is from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not " improbable conjecture , " which " becomes something more than a conjecture when we extend our view to the diversified breeds of those animals which men have domesticated , " which , when " considered in this point of view , acquires , perhaps , the character of a legitimate theory , supported by adequate evidence , and by an extensive series of analagous facts . " If these items do not constitute " a series of speculations , " he must be acquitted ; but if they do , he can not escape conviction , not**ithstanding his own lofty character , supported by some of the most eminent men of the age . The second count in our indictment is , that this series of speculations // 146 The Loved One Fo*r Away . is " unsupported by any of those sound arguments which we most generally find used by the supporters of speculations in other branches of science . " We have already said that good logical powers are very common with educated men , compared with genius , which is a rare possession . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is true , be founded on good common sense to become distinguished , but which may be respectable if engrafted on ordinary minds ; while the last is a gift , which art can only prune , chasten , or direct , but never bestow . It is for this reason we find so many sound arguments predicated on false premises , in the superstructure of which not a gap can be discovered , while the whole fabric will fall in ruins by the slightest touch of its foundation . The middle age abounds with authors and disputants of this description , and " The Vestiges of Creation* , is no bad modern example . We wish we could say the same of Dr. Prichard 's Natural History of Man . Our present limits will not permit us to discuss this branch of the subject as fully as we intended . We therefore postpone it to a future paper , when , in conjunction with it , we expect to show , that the doctrine of the unity of the human species is , in the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the conclusions to which it necessarily leads , anti.scriptural . We then exp*ct to show that Lawrence has been severely censured , anathematized , for avowing openly , the same things for which Dr. Prichard receives unqualified praise for avowing covertly . In the meantime , however , we refer the reader to the extracts in this article from Van Amringe 's history , which prove that the alleged changes produced by domestication in ani / mals , are supposititious , mere speculations , incapable of proof ; and that if true , these animals are not analogues for each other , much less for man , who has suffered no change in color or structure , since the period of sacred , civil , and monumental history .
