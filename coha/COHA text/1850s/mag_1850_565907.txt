ART . LV. - THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN LAND . Speeches of Messrs . Hayne and Webster in the United States Senate , on the resolution of Mr. Foote , January , 1830 . New Haven : J. H. Benham. 1850 . ONE of the great questions in our national legislation , is that of the public lands  --  a question constantly returning and never settled . " Mr. Foote 's resolution , " twenty years ago , gave occasion for a long and excursive debate , of which the most memorable part is republished in the pamphlet named at the head of this article , in 1830 , it was charged upon the statesmen of the Northeastern states , that they were designing to obstruct the growth of the west by obstructing the sale of the public lands . In 1850 , Mr. Webster of Massachusetts , moves in the Senate a resolution which at the former date would have been considered almost revolutionary . " Resolved , That provision ought to be made by law that every male citizen of the United States , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen according to the provisions of law , of twenty-one years of age or upwards , shall be entitled to enter upon and take any one-quarter section of the public lands which may be open to entry at private sale , for the purposes of residence and cultivation ; and that when such citizen shall have resided on the same land for three years , and cultivated the same , or if dying in the mean time , the residence and cultivation shall be held and carried on by his widow or his heirs , or devisees , for the space of full three years from and after making entry of such land , such residence and cultivation for the said three years to be completed within four years from the time of such entry , then a patent to issue for the same to the person making entry , if living , or otherwise to his heirs or devisees , as the case may require : Provided , nevertheless , That such person so entering and taking the quarter section as aforesaid shall not have , nor shall his devisee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor create any title thereto in law or equity , by deed , transfer , lease , or any other conveyance except by devise by will . " Other resolutions of a similar character have been recently offered in the Senate . Some , as that of Mr. Seward of New York , ask the gratuitous bestowment of portions of the public domain upon the exiles from Hungary and from other lands of op .. pression and poverty . Others , like that of Mr. Houston of Texas , require the same generosity to be extended to all actual settlers , whether foreigners or Americans . Some measures of this nature are likely to attract the marked attention of our leading statesmen . And such attention their importance imperatively demands . The surface of the earth constitutes the greatest portion of the wealth of its inhabitants . The disposition to be made of two millions of square miles of virgin soil , involves , therefore , momentous interests . Lu these lands , will inhere , in the course of a century , no small proportion of the wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section to every actual settler , must also have an immediate and powerful effect upon the // economical interests of this country . It will naturally withdraw great numbers from other forms of industry , to enter into possession of estates so generously bestowed , and thus , by relieving many occupations from excessive competition , will contribute to the success of such , as continue to pursue them . By a rapid expansion of agricpltural enterprise , it will more abundantly supply the means of subsistence , and doubtless at a cheaper rate . It must occasion a depreciation in the value of real estate , especially in the less settled portions of the country ; for who will be disposed to purchase a farm when he can have one at any hour , without money and without price . It will also hasten the concentration of population and power in the heart of the great valley , and thus speed onward the nation 's destiny . Such a project is manifestly worthy of the profound attention of our ablest politicians . We leave it for them to discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an inquiry which that measure suggests- On what foundation is based the right of property in the soil . On what principle is it right that this broad and beautiful field should be esteemed the property of my neighbor , while 1 have not a foot of soil on the whole face of the earth , that I am allowed to call my own ? What sanction is there for this inequality , which , from the bosom of our common mother , fills his store-houses to overflowing , while I am daily hurried onwards before the footsteps of hunger ? These are becoming the deep toned inquiries of thousands of earnest minds . With them it is a subject of practical import , and one in which their own hold on existence is involved . Such men may be reasoned with , but they must not be denounced . They literally ask for bread , and we must not give them a stone . Gerrit Smith 's princely distribution of a part of his domains , will stir the spirit of many a homeless brother , to demand who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not , then , be a mistimed labor if we offer some thoughts touching the foundation and the limits of the right of property in the soil . It is a topic , a definite discussion of which is greatly needed at the present time . The deed which an individual receives on the purchase of real estate , can convey to him such right and only such , as inhered in the giver of that deed . We demand then , the title of the original owner . His claim can be justified only upon one or more than one , of the following grounds , viz. : actual possession , the sanction of the law , his own creation , or the gift of God . Let us consider to what extent either of these will substantiate his title . No right of possession can be stronger than his who enters upon a portion of the soil untenanted and unclaimed by any other man . Such was Robinson Crusoe 's title to his desert island , while he clambered over its hoary ledges , singing , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right there is none to dispute . " But if ; while he was thus singing , a ship had been stranded on his majesty 's shore , and ten men escaping from the wreck had begun to dispute his exclusive right , and had asked to share with him in all the natural resources of his solitary domains , would they thus have violated his rights ? If they ventured to drink from his spring , and to fish in his coves , and to sow half his island with wheat for their own future consumption , could he with truth have upbraided them as robbers ? Had he such an ownership in that island , that he could , in justice , exclude them from all participation in its products and forbid their entrance upon it beyond high-water mark ? If not , then the mere right of possession is so weak as to be at once invalidated , by the plea of urgent necessity on the part of a fellow creature . In any case it is only a claim , to be respected until abrogated by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soil . And the same assertion may be made in respect to the sanction of the law . The design of civil government in reference to property , is not to create rights , but to define and protect rights already existing . If the sanction of the law could originate rights , then obviously , every claim of property that could be maintained under the statute , would be a righteous claim ; and , whoever taking advantage of the ignorance , or the helplessness , or the confidence of his fellow-men , could succeed , under some form of law , in gaining possession of their property , might then hold it rightfully and with a good conscience . Without a woe he might devour widows ' houses , and consume the substance of the fatherless , and the legislation not of a hundred years , or perhaps even one year , but of an hour , would be sufficient to sanction and sanctify the most monstrous acts of extortion . Nor can this conclusion be evaded , by replying , that such cases are perversions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of the statute , which creates the right of property ; for the very intention of the statute , sanctioned by venal or rapacious legislators , may be to screen the perpetrators of the most outrageous injustice . The instance is at this moment recollected of an individual , boasting that he had surreptitiously procured the passage of a law for the very purpose of enabling him to maintain an inequitable claim against the estates of several of his unsuspecting neighbors . We must test then , even the intention of the civil law by a higher rule of right . The enactments of ten thousand legislators , and the decrees of ten thousand judges , can not effect a transmutation of robbery into right . And what are called " vested rights , " so far as they depend , as to their rightfulness , on the mere sanction of legislation , are shadows . Our obligation to respect the sanctions of the law rests , in the first place , on the // 223 general presumption , that those sanctions are actually founded in justice ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the duty of submitting to suffer wrong , rather than seek an unlawful and unwise remedy . By the principles of justice , therefore , a man 's title under the law , gives him a right of property in that portion of the soil which he holds , only so far as it is rightfully his by a pre*ixisting and higher title . Such a pr&amp;xisting title may be substantiated by the possessor of the soil , to some extent at least , when he is able to alledge with truth , that such soil is his own creation . Here , unquestionably , is the highest right of property any being can have . This is God 's title to the universe . " The sea is his , and he made it , and his hands formed the dry land . " The principal value pertaining to the soil in the cultivated portions of the earth , has been given to it by the hand of industry . The command of the Creator to man , to subdue the earth and replenish it , is to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fruit of his own labor on that soil . Accordingly he who cultivates the spot of earth he holds to the highest degree , has the firmest title to it . The right of a Nimrod in the soil is inappreciable in comparison with the right of a Cincinnatus . When we question our thriving neighbor 's title to those Eden-like fields over which he walks in his pride and conscious independence , and receive for answer that his own skill and industry have changed the wilderness to a fruitful field , our envy is rebuked and ought to be stifled . rrhe agrarianism which scowls at his prosperity and would bring him down to our level , is of close kindred with that spiritual agrarianism , which , seeking to equalize the condition of man with that of fallen spirits , withered the flowers and blasted the fruits of the primeval paradise . And still , the man whose labors have added the greatest value to the soil has not established an absolute and exclusive right therein . The material upon which his labors have been employed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , an original right , which may conflict with the right that he has acquired  --  the right of the community . If the public welfare requires his land for a highway , or a public building , or an aqueduct , his title is immediately invalidated ; and his right becomes nothing more than a right to remuneration , that is , a right to receive payment for the value which his labor has communicated to that portion of the earth. * It gives us great satisfaction to be able to substantiate our chief positions in this article , by quoting from the recent work of an author who is of the highest authority on Political Economy , John Stuart Mill . " Nothing is implied in property but the right of each to his own faculties , to what lie can produce by them , and to whatever he can get for them in a fair // Thus far then , we do not find any man possessed of an al*-solute right of property in the soil in any case whatever . No human power can bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the property of any created being . All human rights must be traced to a grant from the Creator . The earth is man 's only by the gift of God . It can be rightfully held , appropriated , enjoyed only in accordance with the manifested intention of the giver . All valid claims must be justified , by reference to a charter given under the seal of heaven . The substance of that charter is , " The earth hath he given to the children of men . " For what purpose has he given it , if not this , that the children of men , universally , may share in the bounties of nature which it yields ? Men are created and placed on the earth with wants , which the earth , in reward of diligent labor , is fitted to supply ; and thus is revealed the intention of the Creator , that the earth should be so distributed and so cultivated , as to furnish the supply required . This is the identical tirgument which proves the existence of the Deity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer . We find the eye curiously constructed for the purpose of receiving the rays of light , and the laws of light exactly adapted to the structure of the eye , and we unhesitatingly infer the Creator 's benevolent intention in the fact , that " truly the light is sweet , and a very pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun . " But the correlative adaptation of the eye and the ligl*t , is not more manifest than the correspondence between the necessities of the children of men , and the fitness of the earth under cultivation , to meet those necessities . He who made the earth capable of yielding its increase , made hands also to till it , and teeth with which to eat bread gained by the sweat of the brow . They are all parts of one design , and they demonstrate that design to be , that the earth shall actually feed the hungry ones , whom he has placed on its bosom . If by any imaginable process , one half of the human family could rightfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth 's surface , then it would be seen that the remaining half , created in his image , and fitted to derive a happy and virtuous existence from the earth , had been cast by him who made them , into a world where they have no provision for their necessities , no opportunity to answer the end of their creation , no right even market : together with his right to give this to another person if he chooses , and the right of that other to receive and enjoy it . " - Principles of Political Economy , J. S. Mill . Vol . I , B. 2 , ch. 2 , sec. 3 . " The essential principle of property being to assure to all persons what they have produced by their labor and accumulated by their abstinence , this principle can not apply to what is not the produce of labor , the raw material of the earth . " - Ib . Vol . I , B. 2 , ch. 2 , sec. 5. // to set foot on the soil for an hour . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intention of God then is , that the earth shall be so appro .. priated , as to sustain all its inhabitants . And every man on earth who does not forfeit his birth-right by crime , improvidence , or indolence , has a right to draw subsistence from the earth , as long as it is capable of yielding it . Any appropriation of the soil under whatever claim , which hinders its yielding subsistence to those who actually need to derive subsistence from it , is an encroachment on the rights of God , and a violation of the charter , signed by his own hand , by which he has given the earth to the children of men . The title-deed of one 's estate from the king , is only a lease from God , under this condition , that the management of it shall be such , as shall , in one way or another , give bread to the hungry and shelter to the homeless . This conclusion is sanctioned not by reason only , but by very significant intimations in the Scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human family to subdue the earth and replenish it . These two great purposes were to go on together to their fulfillment . As population increased the earth was to be subdued and made more productive , so as to sustain that increased population . Each of Noah 's sons had a continent for his plantation , with as perfect a title as the beneficed Hungarian will have to his quarter section ; and if the law of primogeniture had been then established , and had been perpetuated , only three men would have possessed to-day any land in the then known world . And remaining in the state it was then in , it would have afforded these three but a scanty and a sorry subsistence . Abraham came near to starvation on his great farm of fifteen millions of acres , though many a family having subdued a portion of the earth , can now furnish a bounteous table from a garden of half an acre . The design of God was that the earth should be so distributed and so improved from age to age , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . And every man 's title to any portion of the soil , must be held in subordination to this grand design . He must use it to subserve this end , or yield it up to those who will so use it . And then , where virtuous habits prevail , population will never outrun the means of subsistence . That doctrine of political economy , which supposes the necessity of repressing the increase of population , by the terrors of prospective poverty and starvation , is an open libel on the character of the Creator . It charges him with placing millions of sensitive , rational , responsible creatures in a world where he has provided no means for their subsistence . The day has never been when the soil , if equitably distributed among men , and properly managed , would not fully supply the wants of all its inhabitants ; and , while God reigns , never will be . It is therefore , a // pre*rninent duty of the human family to fulfill God 's original commission . " Be fruitful and multiply and replenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , but the duty of the race to overthrow and annihilate every obstacle which the ignorance , or folly , or cupidity of any portion of mankind , has opposed to the consummation of God 's benevolent purpose . No human being can either give or receive a title to a foot of soil , strong enough to stand in contravention of this original charter from the throne of God . Our argument conducts us therefore , to this conclusion , that an unqualified right of property in the soil , is impossible . When a portion of the earth is assigned to any individual , it is to secure a greater degree of productiveness for the general good ; and if he fails of accomplishing this purpose , and the necessities of mankind require such a measure , they may reclaim that part of the common inheritance ; and if he receives a compensation for the value his labor has given it , his title will then be extinguished. * On the same principle , the public domains are to be appropriated in such a manner as shall promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a vast trust committed to this nation by the Creator , to be so executed , as rapidly to overspread the continent with myriads of thriving and virtuous fami * " To me it seems almost an axiom that property in land should be interpreted strictly , and that the balance in all cases of doubt should incline against the proprietor . The reverse is the case with property in movables , and in all things the product of labor : over these the owner 's power both of use and of exclusion should be absolute , except where positive evil to society would result from it ; but in the case of land , no exclusive right should be permitted in any individual , which can not be shown to be productive of positive good . To be allowed any exclusive right at all , over a portion of the common inheritance , while there are others who have no portion , is already a privilege . No quantity of movable goods which a person can acquire by his labor , prevents others from acquiring the like by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , whoever owns land keeps it from somebody else . The privilege , or monopoly , is only defensible as a necessary evil : it becomes an injustice when carried to any point to which the compensating good does not follow it . * * * " When the sacredness of property ' is talked of , it should always be remembered , that this sacredness does not belong in the same degree to landed property . No man made the land . It is the original inheritance of the whole species . Public reasons exist for its being appropriated . But if those reasons lost their force , the thing would be unjust . It is no hardship to any one , to be excluded from what others have produced . They were not bound to produce it for his use , and he loses nothing by not sharing in what otherwise would not have existed at all . But it is some hardship to be born into the world and to find all nature 's gifts previously engrossed , and no place left for the ' new coIner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once admitted into their minds the idea that any moral rights belong to them as human beings , it will always be necessary to convince them that the exclusive appropriation is good for mankind on the whole themselves included .

J. S. Mill . Vol . I , B. 2 , ch. 2 , sec. 6. // lies . That a vast augmentation of human happiness wilt result from such an appropriation of a continent which , from the creation , had been an unreclaimed wilderness , is sufficiently evident . If the reasoning we have offered is conclusive , it will aid us in forming a just judgment , in respect to the right of organized and industrious human society to spread itself over those portions of the earth which are wholly uncultivated . Civilized man is everywhere extending his dominion over regions hitherto possessed by barbarians . Is this an unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless and ignorant ? The question refers not to the fraud or violence that may have been committed in taking possession ; but is the act of civilized man in appropriating to himself for the purpose of cultivation , vast regions which have been the haunts of savages for ages , justifiable , or is it censurable ? We think it can be shown to be justifiable , whether done with or without the consent of those savages . And we are very willing to test the doctrine by reference to the example of the settlement of New England by our forefathers . When the Mayflower anchored opposite Plymouth rock , there was before them a territory , of some fifty thousand square miles , east of Hudson river . Over that territory were sprinkled perhaps a hundred thousand human beings , which would allow half a square mile to each individual , or three square miles to each family . Here then the question is to be decided , whether the Indian father has such a title to these three square miles that he may hold them a perpetual wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the earth that God made for the habitation of man on which he may set his foot , who , exiled from his native land , has no country or home except the cabin of the Mayflower , has a right to take possession of a portion of that wilderness , and there provide bread for his children . Compare the claims to that territory , which these two men bring forward . The Indian rests in the right of possession . He has shot a deer on that hill . He has caught a fish in that stream . He has held a war dance behind that great rock . And his fathers have done the same before him . These are the seals of his title-deed . But the civilized man opens the Bible , and reads , that the earth is the Lord 's who made it , and who has given it to the children of men , commanding them to subdue and replenish it . He builds his title on the great constitutional principle of God 's kingdom , which ordains , that the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to those for whom he made it the greatest amount of comfort and improvement possible ; and alledges that , if his red brother were to hold three square miles in the condition of an unproductive wilderness , and he should thereby be imprisoned on the deck of his bark , and excluded from any inheritance in the earth , it would be an infraction of the rights of God , // to whom the world belongs . Which now of these claims is in equity the strongest ? Does the shooting of a deer , or the buirding of a camp-fire , constitute a title strong enough to nullify the charter God has given , distributing the earth among all nations , and all men according to their necessities ? Our conclusion then is this , that the civilized man has a right directly from God , whenever his necessities actually require it , to enter upon , and appropriate any portion of the earth that he chooses , which he finds a wilderness . The title of the savage , or the hunter , or the explorer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to him of as much value as his own imperfect right of possession , is sufficient to extinguish that right . God never designed that half a million of savages should possess the right to hold this continent as a perpetual wilderness , when he had created it capable under cultivation , of sustaining half the human race . The right of the Indian , beyond his own cornfield , was only the right to receive an equivalent for the advantages he had derived from a portion of the common property of mankind . Whatever value beyond this pertained to the soil , was the property of God alone , and rightfully became the inheritance of the first occupier who knew how to use it . When our fairest and richest fields were purchased of the Indians , for a bundle of blankets , or a case of hunting knives , it was no act of extortion , or of fraud . To them , these articles were of as great value as the lands they exchanged for them . Was it robbery , when the richest farms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shillings per acre ? This same principle is applicable , universally , to the settlement by civilized nations of the uncultivated portions of the earth . The savage tribes , that roam over them , have a limited right in them , and so far as it extends , that right is to be held sacred . To deprive them of any of the resources by which they subsist , wantonly , or without a compensation , is robbery . And herein has consisted the sin of civilized nations . The warrant , under which they have taken possession , has been drawn from the sword , and not from the Bible . Bullets and not blankets have been the price paid to the poor natives , for the lands demanded of them . Were it not for this there would be no injustice in the encroachments of civilized man . The great law of the expansion of civilized society over the domains of barbarous tribes , is a righteous and benevolent law , and is to fulfill the purpose of God , that the wilderness shall bud and blossom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . God has never given to man any right to perpetuate a wilderness in any portion of the earth , and thus to prevent its yielding its increase for the sustenance of his creatures . The British landlord who changes the fruitful field into a park of wild beasts , and the chief of the Camanches , // who requires vast regions of wilderness for his hunting grounds , these are the spoilers , who invade the rights of men , or to speak more truly , who invade the rights of God , dooming to perpetual sterility that earth which God created to yield its increase for the supply of his great family . These are the robbers , and it is the right and the duty of mankind to reclaim its inheritance , and change the wilderness into a fruitful field . The effect of Christian civilization is the multiplication of the race , while wasting and depopulation accompany the savage state . Hence of necessity and of right , a wave must roll onward from the former encroaching on the domains of the latter , until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth increases , and requires , for its support , the resources hid in the soil of territories now unproductive , the barbarous tribes , spread over those territories , must become civilized , so as to be able to subdue the earth , and exact its annual tribute , or they must retire before the more enlightened nations , who are capable of thus carrying out the purpose , for which God created the earth . It is not fate , but the righteous providence of God , which presents to them the alternative of civilization and Christianization on the one hand , or , on the other , of inevitable annihilation . " For the nation and kingdom , that will not serve thee , shall perish , yea , those nations shall be utterly wasted . " If our pages could attract the notice of our kindred on the other side of the Atlantic , we would be glad to apply the doctrine here propounded , to their manorial system , especially in its modern development in the eviction of tenants . The Irish or Scotch landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the inhabitants from a district , where their fathers sleep , the only spot of God 's creation which they can call home , or perhaps have ever set their eyes on , and justifies the deed by alledging that this is his property . How came it his property ? It descended to him from his ancestors . So may the tenant of that cottage alledge , that his right here , as a tenant , has descended from his ancestors . Here their ashes lie , and therefore his right here , as tenant , is as good as the other 's right , as proprietor . But whence did that proprietor 's ancestor derive his right ? " In a remote and barbarous age , my forefather , a great land pirate , succeeded by deception or violence or perfidy in overpowering your forefather , and having hewed him in pieces on some battle-field , or perhaps assassinated him at some revel-rout , seized his lands , and doomed his children to a perpetual serfdom on the soil of their birth . Therefore I have the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of the bayonet from this my property . this is my title . And more than this , the laws of the realm pronounce this estate to be mine , and give me unqualified dominion over it . " // Undoubtedly such are the facts . But who enacted these laws ? A hundred men assemble , and pass a solemn decree , irrevocabl'e as the laws of the Medes and Persians , that the soil of Great Britain shall belong to them and their eldest sons , and so continue in hereditary succession to the end of time ; and that those to whom God shall give existence on that soil to keep it , and to till it , shall forever be mere tenants at will . Can such a statute confer such prerogatives ? But waiving all objection to the titles of these men , and allowing their right of property in these estates to have been righteously obtained , and to be of indisputable validity , the great question now is , how far does that right extend ? There is a right beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , who made the earth , and made it to furnish abodes and bread and water to the inhabitants thereof . The first and highest right of property in the soil , is God 's right to feed his children from it . And any attempt by imperial charters , or parliamentary statutes to subvert this right , is merely an audacious attempt to legislate away the property of the Almighty . No lord of a great estate can possess , and no government on earth can give him , an absolute and exclusive property in the soil . His right as proprietor is limited by the rights of those who dwell on that soil . If he is entitled to rent , they are equally entitled to occupation . And it is no more an invasion of his rights , when his tenants market their produce on Sunday , and so deprive him of income , than it is an invasion of their rights , when he drives them into the highways , and so deprives them of bread . And it is the right of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ied and cultivated , as to furnish the greatest possible supply for the necessities of his creatures . We are prepared now to characterize these evictions , which are furnishing so many tales of woe , as something more than evidences of inhumanity on the part of their authors . It would be inhuman to shut your door against a sick and homeless stranger , on a chill December 's evening , though he has no other claim on you than that which suffering creates . But these expulsions of families from their homes and their father 's graves , are more than inhuman . They are , in the most unqualified and explicit sense , acts of robbery . King Boatswain sends his warriors to surround an African village , and drag off its inhabitants and sell them to a slave-trader , while he takes possession of their home . The Duke of Sutherland sends his myrmidons to drive off the inhabitants of a wide territory to the sea beach , to die of a slow starvation . King Boatswain has as much sanction from African law , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law is as good a justification of the one act , as British law is of the other . King Boatswain is a barbarian , a robber , a monster . // 231 By what epithet are we to designate his grace of Sutherland ? When we think of such men , we remember the words of the prophet . " Woe unto them that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth . " Yes , woe unto them . We have read some official lamentations of British statesmen over these things coupled with the declaration , that there is no legal remedy , because the rights of property must be maintained inviolate ; as if a title-deed from some old Plantagenet , or Red Rose conqueror , to a favorite follower , or an importunate mistress , could possess potency and sanctity sufficient to nullify all the rights of man , and of God , in respect to that particular locality through all coming time ! * But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit of a direct application to the several propositions recently made in the United States Senate , for the distribution of our public lands . These lands are the gift of God , to be distributed as may best answer his design of replenishing the earth . To create a vast . indepeudent , virtuous population , is ever to be the leading purpose , dictated alike by good policy and the manifest will of God . Will the gratuitous bestowment of a quarter section on every settler , most effectually accomplish this end ? Every poor man among Senator Douglas 's constituents , may secure a homestead by it , a portion of the unappropriated lands being at his own door . * " These are the reasons which form the justification , in an economical point of view , of property in land . It is seen , that they are only valid , in so far as the proprietor of land is its improver . Whenever , in any country , the proprietor , generally speaking , ceases to be the improver , political economy has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In no sound theory of private property was it ever contemplated that the proprietor of land should be merely a sinecurist quartered on it . In Great Britain , the landed proprietor is not unfrequently an improver . But it can not be said that he is generally so . And in the majority of cases lie grants the liberty of cultivation on such terms , as to prevent improvements from being made by any one else . * * * Landed property in England is thus very far from completely fulfilling the conditions which render its existence economically justifiable . But if insufficiently realized even in England , in Ireland those conditions are not complied with at all . With individual exceptions ( some of them very honorable ones ) , the owners of Irish estates do nothing for the land but drain it of its produce . What has been epigrammatically said in the discussions on peculiar burthens , ' is literally true when applied to them ; that the greatest burthen on land ' is the landlords . Returning nothing to the soil , they consume its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants from dying of famine : and when they have any notion of improvement , it usually consists in not leaving even this pittance , but turning out the people to beggary if not to starvation . When landed property has placed itself upon this footing it ceases to be defensible , and the time has come for making some new arrangement of the matter . " - Principles of Political Economy . J. S.

When a man has been taught to vote himself a farm from the property of the nation , will he not be likely to vote himself many other perquisites , from the property either of the nation or of individuals , and even then to be not less poor and far less virtuous , than when accustomed to rely on his own resources ? Instead of such an indis-. criminate geuerosity , ought not gratuitous grants to be limited to cases having special claims ? Among such special cases , we should *unhesitatingly include that of the Hungarian exiles . Their circumstances demand , and their character as lovers of liberty merits , generous assistarice , and their promise of becoming worthy American citizens gives assurance that our country will be doubly repaid for whatever may be bestowed upon them . But whatever the wisdom of Congress may determine respecting the questions now at issue , happily every discussion only proclaims in clearer terms the great fundamental principle of American economy , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it . And to those who have never contemplated the bearings of this great principle , we offer the remark , that it affords a stable guaranty to our country of national security and prosperity . It is one of the brightest rays in our rainbow of promise . Its advantages are numerous . Ownership in the soil , by its inhabitants , is of great value in elevating and invigorating their character . It is a familiar observation , that the destiny of men is , in a great degree , decided by their circumstances . The men who fill a place in history , afford numberless examples of this fact . There are energies in every man 's soul , that never manifest themselves unless electrified into action by the contact of some stirring emergency . The cold steel has fire in it , but the flint must strike it , or it will never send out the first spark . The crisis that demands great men rarely fails of producing great men . When Hungary requires a Kossuth , the young advocate and letter-writer is suddenly transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel have met . If Martin Luther had been brought in contact only with the more decent features of popery , he would doubtless have passed through life , // a sincere and devout friar . Oliver Cromwell , in an age of peace and under a righteous government , would have been only a generous and thriving farmer . Instead of uttering his awful menaces as Lord Protector , in the ears of persecuting prelates and cowardly kings , he would only have exhorted his neighbors to repentance in conventicles and prayer meetings . It was only an acute angle in the path of many a man 's life , which decided for him between the career of a hero and that of a buccanier , which made him a Nelson or a Kidd . A grant of extra pay at the critical moment , would have saved Arnold from the infamy of a traitor . A victory over the Russians , would have made Gorgey an incorruptible patriot . And if circumstances form , in so great a measure , the character of men of the strongest original energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of the more pliant mass . There must be a sphere in which their energies may be exercised , and a stimulant to awaken their activity , or they will lie forever dormant , and like a rose bud without sunlight die in their envelope . Make a man a beggar , and he loses his self-respect . Shut up a family through hopeless poverty in a smoky cabin , and they will be without refinement . Make them dependent for even that mean shelter on the good will of an arrogant landlord , and they will be obsequious and craven-hearted . The great battle between hunger and a virtuous self-respect , among ordinary men admits of no doubtful issue . Construct a community so as to place the great body of it in abject dependence , and it will inevitably be unmanned and debased . Self-respect , magnanimity , ingenuousness and social refinement will be as rare , almost , as truth in a Jesuit , or honesty in a slave . Now no feature in one 's circumstances , bears more directly and powerfully upon his character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which he holds his abode . A mere tenant at will , that is , a vagabond by compulsion , can not love his country , for he has no country . One of the happy results of the associations recently formed in England , for the purchase of small freeholds , is said to be an immediate and striking improvement in the social character of the purchasers . It could not have been otherwise . He who holds a title to the soil on which he dwells , acquires a feeling of independence . There is rest for the sole of his foot . No dread of a capricious or supercilious landlord chokes his stirring spirit . No dream of eviction or of the exaction of double rent disturbs his slumbers . No obtrusive factor interferes with his plans . In his own domains he has scope for the exercise of his own wisdom and the execution of his own will . Here he can plant , and build , can pluck up , or pull down , at his own discretion . Self-reliance becomes his characteristic . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope for healthful exercise . His various mental en // ergies are daily challenged into action . Instead of a canal digger trained merely to ply his shovel where you bid him , the nhtive energies of whose hopeless soul lie dormant and stupid , you have now a man with the spirit of a man training himself constantly to the exercise of shrewdness , ingenuity , self-reliance , and manly independence . The transformation of a serf into a citizen , wakes the energies of the soul , like a resurrection from the dead . In this a man is like a tree , the more firmly he is planted in the soil , the more vigorous will be his growth . The owner of a rough hillside , under the glaciers of Switzerland , has more of manhood in him , than the tenant of the richest vineyard in Italy . Property in the soil promotes also refinement and elevation of social character . Among the very strong instinctive sentiments of the human mind , is an attachment to our native spot . After many long years of wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the borne of our childhood , and opens the most sacred fountains of feeling among the memories of our birth-place . From the stern strife of the wide bustling world often has the man of mature years returned to his paternal dwelling-place-has stood , lost in the recollection of the scenes , the events , the labors , the sports , the endearments , the loves , the griefs , the joys of his childhood and youth in that ancestral abode ; and then , when he awoke from these musings of memory to realize that the old home , so hallowed in his heart , had passed into the possession of strangers , he has felt himself a child again , and wept , even as when he wept upon his mother 's lap . There is this sacredness about the feeling of ho me , our own childhood 's home . And it tends to humanize and refine the heart that is able to comprehend it . It keeps alive a thousand associations of thought , that reflect a most genial influence on our social nature . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and not a hired home . Our hearts kindle with this hallowed family interest only in the trees which our fathers planted , and the fields which our fathers subdued , and the firesides where our fathers taught us to thank God for a goodly heritage which we felt to be our own . There are generous hearth-stone sympathies of the heart , which require a " certain dwelling place , " in which they may take deep root , and that dwelling-place made sacred by the expressive title of home . Hence also arises in a community the spirit of public improvement with its various elevating effects . The population , who own the soil on which they live , have an immediate interest in all institutions , that are fitted to promote their social and moral elevation . The schools and churches , the library and the lyceum , are their own property , enhancing the value of their estates , and conferring permanent benefit , intellectual and moral , upon their fainilies. // There is , accordingly , the strongest inducement to sustain , generously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevation of society . Voluntary taxation for such purposes , is only a combined effort of those who are taxed , to promote more effectually their own interests . It is , as if a fa-. ther and his sons , should agree to tax their own homestead to an amount sufficient to enrich an old field , or to build a new granary . It is only a wise investment , made with a view to their own permanent advantage . Thus every institution , having a benign aspect toward the social condition of mankind , finds its most genial atmosphere , among a people who are in established possession of the soil which they occupy , and which yields to them and their children , its most wholesome and most abuwjant fruit . Ownership in the soil by its inhabitants , has , therefore , a clearly traced , and essential influence in promoting the elevation and virtuous refinement , as well as the energy and independence of their character . There is another advantage of the American system . It generates the deepest and most incorruptible patriotism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , has given his country the strongest pledge of his true love . The defense of his country is indispensable to the peaceful possession of his own patrimony . An Arab encampment may be broken up by a hostile party , and the next valley may afford them a pasturage equally green , and a spring equally clear . A nation of tenants may be overcome , and their country subdued , and what will they be but tenants still ? Even if expatriated , they only leave lands that were not their own , and they lose comparatively little by the change . But a country where every man is an owner in the soil , has in every man a defender , whose own private interest unites with his public spirit , to insure his fidelity and stimulate his bravery . Men are rarely cowards in defending their own firesides . Set a serf fighting for his landlord 's domains , against a freeholder fighting for his own homstead , and no doubtful issue can await the conflict . A nation of landowners will be absolutely unconquerable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful means of hastening our country onward , to the front rank among nations . The land of freeholders must speedily outstrip the land of lords and servants . The emigration , which the contrast of these two systems is bringing to our shores , will quicken our progress . The families there displaced to make room for deer parks and sheep pastures , will here assume the rank of men , and increase the preponderance *f America in the scale of nations . What then has our country to fear from immigration ? Immigration has created America . What is the native American but the descendant of an immigrant ? And it is not the immigration of this age alone , // which has brought in its stream a mixture of evil . The very fir , st generation even in New England had its proportion both of roysterers and Romanists . Georgia was avowedly colonized , in no small part , with vagabonds and criminals . The maternal ancestor of many a proud Virginian was bought at her full value with a barrel of tobacco . Yet even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our country was not ruined , but has been constantly advancing , not only in respect to the wealth , civilization and civil privileges of its population , but also in knowledge , morality and religion , a larger proportion of the present generation* being intelligent members of evangelical churches than of any generation that has preceded this . It is true , that many of these novices are very awkward in their first attempt to enact the part of freemen . They have many lessons to learn in the hitherto forbidden science of selfgovernment . But they can be indoctrinated . Even the wildest Irish and the most plodding Germans , when they have found themselves in cottages of their own , and on plots of ground nublasted by a landlord 's charter , and unrobbed by a tither 's visit , have often been rapidly transformed . into the image of freemen , and have developed a sagacity and an ambition to rise in the scale of humanity , of which they had previously been quite unconscious . And their children will be native Americans . In numberless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American soil , the worthy and patriotic fellow-countrymen of our own children , the enlightened friends of freedom , the shields of our republic . Our occasion for fear in respect to our foreign population appears still less , when we consider the desirable character of a great proportion of the immigrants of the present period . Europe , by its vehement convulsions and reactionary barbarities , is sending to our country its sinews and its soul . Her most sagacious minds perceive most clearly , where are the old reverend abuses , or ironlinked fetters , that enthrall her starving millions ; her noblest hearts throb with warmest longings to break the galling chains ; and her firrl*iest nerves dare first to strike a blow for freedom . And when treachery and reaction defeat the great resolve , these are the men to throng our welcoming shores , pouring the best lifeblood of Europe into the veins of our republic . If those old empires were annually to equip an army of three hundred thousand men , and land them on our shores , to be annually conquered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hewing down forests , amid constructing railroads , should we not extilt in the rising power of our country ? They are doing better for us than that . They are not only sending us armies of their subjects , but they are first teaching those subjects , in the most effectual manner , to love our country , and to abhor the remorseless // governments and despotic institutions they have left behind . Will men like Waldeck and Smith O'Brien ever aid in crowning an American emperor ? Will men like Achilli and Pilatte and James Shore advocate a state religion ? Will men like Klapka and Garibaldi draw the sword here in behalf of popery ? Who in the next generation will be animated by a more fervent patriotism , as Americans , than the children of these Hungarians , to whom we are giving a refuge from the butcher-like ferocity that drove them from their native land ? Thus the most efficient instrurnents in hastening our country to its destined preeminence are those despotic rulers of European countries and their agents . Their tyrants and traitors , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their Bonapartes and Gorgeys and Philpotts , are steadily transferring the best staple of a nation from their shores to ours , and aiding our yet stripling land to suck the breast of kings . Let them continue to send us the victims of misgovernment and oppression , their Emmets and their Kossuths , with the tens of thousands of unnamed hearts that reflect the same image . We have homes to give them , homes that shall be their own , without rent , or tithe , or poor rates ; and they in return , will give us the power , all the sooner , to dictate a policy to all the governments of the civilized world .
