ThOMAS JEFFERSON . ( Continued . ) AMONG all the men of the Revolutionary era , Jefferson is solitary and alone in the propagation of the pernicious doctrine of armed resistance to constituted authorities . They are doctrines , however , not greatly to be wondered at in a disciple of Jacobinism , who thought that a rebellion , once in every twenty years , was a political blessing , and treated such as nothing more than a natural exuberance of patriotism , a rekindling of the smouldering fires of liberty . But the evil influence of such teachings , in connexion with one yet so revered as the father of progressive democracy , is felt and seen to this day . It was exhibited clearly in the conduct of one , who , in long after years , was folded in the mantle of Jefferson , and almost adored as his representative and worthy successor . The known contempt of the great Apostle of democracy for the dignity of constituted authorities , and especially for that of judicial tribunals , *was a carte blanche to all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many distinguished instances , have since been practised by his partizans . Andrew Jackson had need to appeal to no higher authority than the opinion of Jefferson , when , with the boldness of a Cromwell , at the head of a devoted soldiery , he imprisoned a judge in the midst of a great city , for daring to sustain the right of Habeas Corpus . And again , in 1834 , when , as the sceptred dictator of the White House , he sent his famous Protest Message to the Senate , claiming that he was the direct representative of the American People , and imposing silence on Congress as regards the acts of the Executive , he had found enough , in the teachings of Jefferson , to sanction his haughty usurpations . By these teachings the Constitution had been reduced to a mere charter of expediency , to be *et aside in certain emergencies , and of this expediency and these emergencies the President was to be the sole judge . And here we may pause to say , that the great constitutional speech of Daniel Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tation of these nefarious pretensions , should be stereotyped on tables of gold , and blazoned in lasting characters on the official record-book of the Republic . The power and political influence of the federal party terminated , along with the federal administrations , in March , 1801 . It has never since been resuscitated . But the truth of history must extort the admission , that federal men oiiginated , framed , and carried into successful practice , the Constitution of 1789 , the first genuine republican experiment ever ventured . But this is not all . The period during which the federalists held the ascendency in the administration of the national government , was one of no ordinary trial . The system itself was a novelty , founded in the midst of dissentient opinions , and established in the face of powerful opposition . Its parts were to be adjusted and arranged , its proper attributes and limits settled and defined , the relations of the individual members with the whole to be harmonized , and the great and complicated machine to be set in motion . Bcsides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framework of society itself ; of devising a system of finance by which , from a family of states hitherto unused to any general and common system , revenues should be raised , bearing equally upon all , and capable of meeting debts of extraordinary magnitude for a people whose numbers were limited , whose resources had not becm // developed , and who were already exhausted by a long and expensive war ; of adopting plans of State policy under novel circumstances and relations , expansive as the growth of the nation , and to be permanent as its existence ; of embodying laws ; of rebuilding commerce from its wrecks , and calling forth arts and manufactures where they had been unknown ; besides all these , there were still other obstacles in their path . Almost coeval with the birth of the American government , commenced a series of wars which , in extent , magnitude , objects , and in impressions on the political world , were the most gigantic in the history of bloodshed . Institutions , hoary with age and venerable from their sanctity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man ; despotisms , whose iron grasp had for centuries stifled the very breathings of liberty ; laws , and usages stronger than laws , which , for good or evil , had moulded men after their own fashion ; priestcrafts and castes , obeyed by prescription , were at once swept away before the whirlwind of revolutioi* . The effects of this convulsion had not been confined to the shores of Europe or the East . They had extended to America , also . Here , meanwhile , the same opposition which had exerted itself against the formation of a government , was continued against its operation . It was with mutiny in the crew that the federalists had to steer the ship of state through the dangers of an unexplored ocean , in this the most tremendous storm which ever devastated the civilized world . Every measure which might tend to a development of the power of the general government , was resisted . Every embarrassment was thrown in the way of its action . The impatience which naturally arises from new burdens , was taken advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedon itself . Sedition was stirred up to resist them . Falsehood and misrepresentation were employed ; distrust excited against tried and firm patriots . And yet , through all these shoals and quicksands the two federal administrations had been fortunate enough to keep their course harmlessly , and the government was sustained in all its oric , inal purity . The Constitution remained intact and unmutilated in a single feature No emergency had been so pressing , even through storms of insurrection and the most difficult diplomatic negotiations , to create , in the opinion of Washington or of Adams , any necessity to overstep the prescribed limits of the law . It remained for the democrats , under the advice of their anti-federal leader , to find out that occasions might arise to justify the President in actingindependentof the Constitution , as we shall soon see . Indeed , it is a fact in the history of the democratic party , no less true than remarkable , that , notwithstanding they have ever claimed to be , par excellence , the party of strict construction , it has so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been elected from their ranks , ( Van Buren , perhaps , excepted , ) have violated leading features of the Constitution , and grasped powers which can belong only to despots . This charge has never been made against either the two federal , the two whig administrations of Madison and John Quincy Adams , or the noparty administrations of Monroe and Tyler , if we except the alien and sedition laws of 1798 . It may be remarked , however , that these laws , if unconstitutional and odious , must be laid at the door of the Congress which passed , as well as of the President who approved them . The Executive assuined nothing . It only put in execution a law of the people 's representatives . But the history of republics does not furnish three bolder innovators on written constitutions , than Jefferson , Jackson , and James K. Polk . The great achievement of Jefferson 's first four years of dominion was the purchase of Louisiana . This transaction is connected with many incidents of singular political history , to which , as illustrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be inappropriate or unseasonable to advert . When Jefferson ascended the Presidental steps , he was regarded with strongly contrasted feelings by the two great parties of the country . By his own , he was represented as the advocate of religious freedom , and of the rights of man ; the great apostle of liberty ; the friend of our revolutionary ally , France ; the foe of British influence ; a reformer , philosopher , sage , and genuine republican . The federalists looked on him in a far different light . They charged him with being a re** volutionist and Jacobin ; with being blindly devoted to France , and perversely op- // posed to England ; with being hostile to the Constitution , and the promoter of partyism ; with being a free-thinker in politics and religion , whose learning was used to pervert , rather than to uphold the landmarks of virtue and liberty . They argued that his messages and his writings prove him to have bad in view , through his entire political and administrative career , only three great purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their accomplishment . These were , say they , the aggrandizement of France , the humiliation of England , and the demolition of federalists as a party , and the expatriation of all who held that faith . There can be very little doubt that Jefferson was liable to all three of these charges . But it is not for us rashly to say that the aggrandizement of Frt*nce , or the humiliation of England , were the sole objects of his foreign policy , or that the annihilation of federalism was his chief object at home . The purchase of Louisiana , or rather the circumstances attending that purchase , have been cited as evidence of the first proposition , and , collaterally , of the second . The same may be said , reversely , of the embargo and non-intercourse laws . It is with the first of these that we have now to do , and the facts premised will enable the reader to understand more clearly , and to apply as he may deem proper , the historical incidents belonging to that transaction . But we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of those violent shocks which the Constitution has since repeatedly sustained under democratic administrations . The blows have been sedulously followed up since , and all the agitation which ever distracted the country , or seriously threatened its peace , has grown out of this democratic principle and practice of territorial aggrandizement . Louisiana , Texas , California and New Mexico have come to us for weal or for woe , through democratic agency , and as on them must rest the responsibility and consequences of their annexation , so , likewise , let them have the credit for what benefits have ensued or may yet ensue . But the Constitution is not healed , its infractions are not extenuated by pointing out and pleading the benefits commercially and politically , that have followed from the purchase of Louisiana . The wound has been inflicted , and the gap fairly and widely opened for future aggressions of a similar chaincter . The sanctity of the instrument has been repeatedly and roughly violated , and no one is able to tell or to foresee where the mischief will end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts . History too truly teaches that the illegal or unconstitutional exercise of power in the best of times , for the real benefit of the people and with their silent acquiescence , has hardly ever failed to be resorted to , as a precedent , in the worst of times and often for the worst party or selfish purposes . Recent political events , under the administration of President Polk , afford , to our own eyes , a most striking confirmation of the truth of the lesson . The years 176*-63 were marked by fierce struggles on the American continent between England , France , and Spain . During the first year France ceded to Spain the island of New Orleans and all her possessions west of the Mississippi river , and the name of Louisiana was thus limited to that part of . the valley . After the close of the revolutionary war , in settling the boundaries of the United States , some contentions arose between our own and the Spanish government , especially as regarded the free navigation of the Mississippi. - These differences were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , his Catholic Majesty agreed by the treaty of San Lorenzo , that " the citizens of the United States shall be permitted , for the space of three years from this time , the navigation of the Mississippi , with a right to deposit their merchandise and effects in the port of New Orleans . " From several causes , however , this treaty was not fulfilled until 1798 , and , most probably , but for a change of administration here , a war between Spain and the United States would have been the consequence . In 1796 Spain and the French Republic formed an alliance , offensive and defensive ; and at that time France began a series of negotiations with a view to the recovery of her ancient province of Louisiana . This was not effected till 1800 , under the consulate of Napoleon , when , by the treaty of St. Ildefonso , Spain retroceded to France the colony of Louisiana , with the boundaries it had when given up to Spain in 1763 . Spain , // however , still continued to exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and in 1802 the Intendant of the province gave notice that American citizens would no longer be permitted to deposit their goods at New Orleans , and this too , without assigning , as by the terms of the treaty of San Lorenzo , " any equivalent establishment at any other place on the river . " This extraordinary violation of national faith was followed up by acts of the most offensive nature . The Spaniards captured and carried into their ports numbers of American vessels , destroyed or confiscated American property , and imprisoned the American Consul . This conduct , very justly , excited the most wide-spread indignation among our western citizens , and many threatened to march down the country , and take forcible possession of New Orleans . These outrages occurred long anterior to the assembly of Congress , in December 1802 , and yet , strange to say , the executive message was entirely silent on the subject . In January , 1803 , the house promptly called for information concerning so delicate a matter , and this brought the fact of treaty violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message was debated with closed doors , which , as Jefferson must certainly have known of the outrages before the session began , leaves us to deduce questionable and unfavorable opinions of his conduct . It certainly was strange and unaccountable , indicative of but little spirit , and shrouded with a politic caution and forbearance that would have done honor to Louis the Eleventh . When redress for these wrongs and a compliance with treaty stipulations were demanded of Spain , the American minister was informed that Louisiana had been ceded to France . Jefferson then asked for two million of dollars , and set on foot a negotiation for the purchase of " New Orleans and the provinces of East and West Florida . " Mr. Monroe and Mr. Livingston were joined in the mission , and set out immediately for Paris . About the time of the arrival of the American Envoys , Great Britain began to manifest symptoms of alarm at the ambitious projects and growing power of Napoleon , and particularly in his acquisition of Louisiana , and her contemplated possession of that extensive country with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops under General Victor , destined for that country , were kept so long blockaded that they were finally disembarked , and turned to a different service . The inventive genius of Napoleon suggested an immediate remedy . He found that it would be impossible for him to occupy Louisiana , and he therefore resolved to exchange it for money , which France needed far more than she needed transatlantic territory . The fitful peace of Amiens was drawing to its close , and the bad faith of England was about to plunge Europe into a war that laid low all the Continent , that crippled her own power and nearly exhausted her means and her credit , and that carried death and devastation in its track through a long series of well nigh fifteen years . So soon as the French Emperor had resolved on his course , he convoked his council , and announced to them the approaching rupture . This was early in March , and Mr. Monroe had not then joined Mr. Livingston our Minister resident in France . The designs of the Emperor are unfolded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem strikingly to comport with the subsequent testimony of John Randolph , " that France wanted money , and must have it . " " I will not , " said Napoleon , " keep a possession which would not be safe ii our hands , which would perhaps embroil me with the Americans , or produce a coldness between us . I will make use of it , on the contrary , to attach them to me , to embroil them with the English , and to raise up against the latter , enemies who will one day avenge us , if we should not succeed in avenging ourselves . My resolution is taken ; I will give Louisiana to the United States . But as they have no territory to cede to us in exchange , I will demand a sum of money towards defraying the expenses of the extraordinary armament which I am projecting against England . " This declaration was made in March , only a few days after the memorable scene with Lord Whitworth , the English Ambassador to France . With his usual impetuosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions to open negotiations , forthwith , concerning the purchase . Accordingly , when Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris , he found the business to his hands , // and that , instead of the island of New Orleans and the small territory of East and West Florida , alone , Napoleon was offering to cede the whole extensive territory west of the Mississippi . This was a most startling proposition . The American negotiators were confined by certain minute instructions , and limited as to the amount to be expended . But Napoleon , bent on war and eager for the strife , urged them to a speedy conclusion of preliminaries ; and on the 30th of April the bargain was struck , and for a consideration of fifteen millions of dollars Louisiana was transferred from the dominion of France to that of the United States . Early in May the peace of Amiens was terminated , and Napoleon , having thus supplied his chests , opened the scene of those bloody wars which shook Europe to its deepest foundations , blasted the commercial prosperity of the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his own life was wasted away on the friendless shores of St. Helena . The acquisition of this territory was a perilous and most extraordinary assumption of undelegated power by one who claimed to be a model democrat and a strict constructionist . It was seriously condemned , on principle , by all the opponents of the administration , among whom John Randolph of Roanoke , already dissatisfied with the Jeffersonian policy , now took the most prominent position . The main grounds of their opposition were , that the French title was contingent only , that the undefined boundaries would furnish a cause of future contentions , that a fraudulent title had been obtained from Spain through the Godoy ministry which might subsequently be disavowed and repudiated ; that Louisiana was not then in the actual possession of France but of Spain , which latter objected to the arrangement , and that the increase of Executive patronage consequent on so vast an acquisition would render the President almost a despot . But there were higher grounds of opposition than these , and they are grounds which still exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are founded in the Constitution of the United States . When the treaty was submitted to the House of Representatives for the purpose of having it carried into effect , the question as to the constitutionality of that part of it which stipulated for the admission of the country into the Union , was made and warmly debated . It was conceded that foreign territory might be acquired either by conquest or by purchase , and then retained as a colony or province ; but could not be admitted as a State without an amendment of the Constitution . It was argued that the government of this country was formed by a union of States , and the people had declared in the preamble that the Constitution was established " to form a more perfect union " of the " United States . " The United States here mentioned could not be mistaken . They were the States then in existence , or such other new States as should be formed within the limits of the Union , conformable to the provision of the Constitution . Every measure , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union of the States here described , was a clear violation of the very first sentiment expressed in the Constitution . The incorporation of a foreign territory into the Union , so far from tending to preserve the Union , was a direct inroad upon it ; because it destroyed the " perfect union " contemplated betwixt the original parties by interposing an alien and a str*inger to share the powers of government alike with them . Pressed by arguments of this kind and by the opinions of Jefferson himself , those who advocated the treaty , took medium grounds , contending that the treaty merely stipulated that the inhabitants of the ceded territory should be hereafter admitted into the Union , according to the principles of the Constitution ; that by taking possession of the territory it did not necessarily follow that it must be admitted into the Union ; that this would be an after question ; that the territory would not be admitted into the Union unless warranted by the przncsples of the Constitution . But they were met by the answer that there was no difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipulation that such incorporation should take place ; because , as the national faith was pledged in the latter case , the incorporation must take place ; that it was of no consequence whether the treaty itself gave such incorporation , or produced the laws which gave it ; and that the question still returned whether there exists , under the Constitution , a power to incorporate a foreign nation or people into the // 295 qwq has been subdued and pillaged , Cuba has become the centre of this dangerous attraction , and sooner or later must share the fate of the two former . The public taste of both sections seeks gratification only in this species of furor . We are constrained to say that all this is justly chargeable to the example of Jefferson , and whether it bring weal or woe his fame must answer to that posterity to which he appeals . The great mass of the people , however , were agreed as to the importance of this acquisition of Louisiana , and all must acJ*nowledge that , bating the wounds inflicted on the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , thus Jefferson was so fortunate as to find , that an act which might have called for impeachment under some circumstances , has been regarded as the most meritorious of his public career . So much , we perceive , is the world governed in its public conduct , by considerations , rather of interest and policy , than of conformity to established rules of law . But it is not to be disguised that in his haste either to accommodate France , or to avoid a collision with Spain , Jefferson suffered the purchase to be , in some sense , unwisely concluded . In the first place , the sum of fifteen millions was probably thrice as much as needed to have been given , because Napoleon knew , at the time of the purchase , that on the renewal of war in Europe the whole country of Louisiana would be taken possession of by the British , and consequently be lost both to France and to Spain . In the next place , the treaty was glaringly imperfect from the fact that no definable or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territory transferred . Consequently , Spain being exasperated any way , a state of hostility betwixt her own and the cabinet at Washington soon sprung up in relation to the legitimate boundaries of Louisiana . The United States claimed to the river Perdido east of the Mississippi and to the Rio Bravo on the west . But the negotiations under this mission entirely failed . The Spanish court not only denied the right of the United States to any portion of territory east of the Mississippi ; but , in the most peremptory manner , declared their claim to the Rio Bravo to be totally unfounded . A long and angry correspondence took place between the Spanish negotiator , Don Pedro Cevallos , then Secretary of Foreign Affairs , and the American Ministers . In the negotiations with France respecting the purchase of Louisiana , Mr. Monroe and Mr. Livingston had been given to understand that the territory extended as far east as the Perdido , and that the town of Mobile would fall within the limits of the cession . And we may also here observe that at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States desire to purchase the Floridas , his aid towards effecting that object would be readily afforded at some future suitable time . In consequen*e of this intimation , Mr. Monroe while at Paris , in 1804 , made known the object of his mission in a note to Talleyrand , and requested aid of Bonaparte agreeable to his former assurances . But , in the meantime , a change had come over the spirit of the French Emperor 's policy . The means acquired in 1803 by the sale of Louisiana had been totally exhausted by his subsequent wars , and he was now again pressingly in need of money . He therefore made a convenience of short memory , and not only professed total forgetfulness of all such assurances , but gave unmistakeable signs of a favorable disposition towards Spain . This , however , was one of those artful demonstrations , or feints , so often and so consummately practised by Napoleon , in the accomplishment of his ambitious designs . Spain was indebted to France . France was in need of money , and Spain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore once again resolved to make the United States subsidiary towards raising means for the prosecution of his European conquest . With this view , during the negotiation between Spain and the United States respecting the boundaries of Louisiana , a certain paper in the handwriting of Talleyrand , but not signed by him , was put *into the hands of the American Minister at Paris . It required but little acquaintance with French diplomacy to gather a full clue to the designs of the Emperor from this paper . It set forth that the present was a favorable time for the United States to purchase the Floridas of Spain ; that the same could probably be obtained ; and that Napoleon // would assist the United States by using his influence with Spain to induce her to part with them . It was also suggested , in the same indirect way , that in order to insure a favorable res*t , the United States must assume a hostile attitude towards Spain , and put on the appearance of enforcing their claims . These singular and indirect communications , were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jefferson , with unaccountable deference to such questionable advice , embodied the same in his message to Congress . After going through with a concise preliminary statement of the matter in dispute , and with divers hints as regarded the probable dispositions of France in case of hostilities with Spain , he adopts almost the precise language of the anonymous paper when he says , " Formal war is not necessary , and will not probably follow ; but the protection of our citizens , the spirit and honor of our country require that force should be interposed to a certain degree . It will probably contribute to advance the object of peace . But the course to be pursued will require the command of means , which it belongs to Congress exclusively to yield or deny . " It will be perceived that this message covers every design , and answers the whole purposes of Napoleon . His advice was scrupulously followed , though given quite exceptionably ; hostilities were threatened and Spain was bullied . The were what the Emperor wanted , and he resolved to coax and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the first might furnish to the last money enough to extinguish her indebtedness to France , and thus enable him to prosecute his series of conquests . In consequence of this message Congress voted two millions of dollars that Jefferson might purchase the Floridas . But the appropriation was not made in quiet . It met with the most resolute opposition . John Randolph openly denounced it as subserviency on the part of Jefferson to the Emperor of France , and then made public , for the first time , that , on his arrival at Washington , the Secretary of State had told him , " that France wanted money , and that we must give it to her , or have a Spanish and French war . " Randolph was the Chairman of the Committee to whom this message was referred . He opposed the two million appropriation on several grounds , all , as we think , equally cogent and reasonable . The money had not been explicitly asked for in the message ; - that , after the failure of negotiations based on right , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus encourag-* ed , would never cease meddling with our affairs , so long as she could extort money from us ; and , that the Floridas , as thought , and as France had at. /Irst admitted , were regularly ceded to us at the time of the Louisiana purchase , and , therefore , France was bound to make good her word and our title . But opposition availed nothing . The money was appropriated , and it is certain that the same never reached Spain . On the contrary , it is a fact of history , that it was carried to Paris on board the United States ship Hornet , and passed into the coffers of Napoleon . Not a foot of territory , as the facts of the case will clearly demonstrate , was acquired by this appropriation . In fact , it may be safely inferred that , having stopped it in Paris on a claim that Spain owed France , Napoleon used it to subjugate the very power to whom it was justly due , if due at all , and to whom it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidency , the Constitution of the United States , administered by those who aided in its compilation had been found to answer its purpose without being subjected to violent constructions , or rather to flagitious misconstructions . It was founded in genuine republican principles , and one of the greatest errors of republics was sought to be avoided . * The treaty of the cession of the Floridas , concluded at Washington 22 February , 1819 , between Spain and the United States , having been ratified on the one part by the King of Spain , and by the President of the United States on the otherpart , possession was taken of these provinces , according to treaty . On the 1st of July General Andrew Jackson , who had been appointed Governor of the provinces of the Floridas , issued a Proclamation , declaring " that the government herotofore exercised over the said provinces , under the authority of Spain , has ceased , and that of the United States of America is established over the same , that the inhabitants thereof will be incorporated in the union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the principles of the federal constitution , and admitted to the enjoyment of all the privileges , rights , and immunities of the citizens of the United States ..... - Holmes ' Annals , vol. 2d , p. 495. // This was territorial acquisitions and extension . If other than the original limits of the original Thirteen States had been contemplated in its provisions for territorial governments , a line added would have closed the question and settled the point forever . This was not done , and the obvious inference is , as Jefferson himself argued , that no foreign territorial acquisition was ever anticipated , or provided for by the framers of the Constitution . The only clause which the radical and progressive democracy can claim , on which to rest their policy of territorial extension , is the clause which declares that Congress may admit new States . We have even thought this a strained interpretation , and a bad argument . All the rules for construing language with which we are acquainted , lay down , as the first principle , that a sentence must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmonious whole , if we would seek its true meaning . We can not arrive at its meaning by construing only detached portions , or clauses of a clause . The postulate in this instance is destroyed by applying the rule to which we have referred ; for the latter portion of the clause relied on by the democracy affords a key by which the first may be fully understood . " New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union ; but no new State shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State nor any State be formed by the junction of two or more States or parts of States without the consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned , as well as of the Congress . " * The first part of this sentence , granting the power , is governed by the latter clauses , defining the manner in which State3 are to be formed , if it is governed at all ; and if it was not intended to be thus governed , the two parts of the whole clause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-colon . Nor is it reasonable to suppose that the " Legislatures " spoken of were foreign Legislatures ; for this government can not prescribe for foreign Legislatures . Immediately succeeding this is the clause giving to Congress the care and regulation of the " territory " and " other property belong- * Const . U. S. ing to the United States , " which concludes by declaring " that nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States , or of any particular State . " This can refer only to negotiations for territory between the United States and *Lparticular** States of " this Union . " Neither , of these , could well have conflicting " claims " to the " territory or other property , " of any other country than this . We shall not dwell longer on this branch of the subject . These are briefly our views of Constitutional construction . It will be seen that Jefferson himself had previously urged the same doctrine , though his conduct clearly belied his inculcations , and this , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example so pernicious , traced to a person so revered as a Constitutional expounder by a great and powerful party who profess to own his principles , can not be too severely or too unqualifiedly condemned . A life of action , it is true to some extent at least , must be a life of compromise , if it is to be useful . A public man is often under the necessity of consenting to measures which he disapproves , lest he should endanger the success of other measures which he thinks of vital importance . But the historiographer lies under no such necessity , and we feel it to be a sacred duty to point out the errors and to condemn the malfeasances of one who yet exercises a baneful influence on the mind of the country . Nor do we conceive that Thomas Jefferson is entitled to the charity of this rule when adjudging his public conduct . From 1792 until his election to the Presidency , he had been particularly addicted to inveighing against the slightest Constitutional departures in others . He had thus well nigh succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration , and had stirred up against that of the elder Adams such a storm of popular indignation as was satisfied only with the overthrow of federalism , and which even yet exists in connexion with his name and his party . This is , as we have remarked , only the first of those glaring infractions of the Constitution which marked the dawn of the democratic administrations , and which have since continued to aistinguish the deniocra. // tic successors of the great Apostle . We have yet before us the task of narrating others of a similar character , which must , in the minds of some at least , diminish the hitherto overshadowing and undisputed claims of one distinguished by the superior reverence of his countrymen . This must be reserved for a future number . The effects of a change from good government to bad government , says a great essayist , are not fully felt for some time after the change takes place . The talents and virtues which a good Constitution generates may , for a time , survive that Constitution . Thus the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitution and its approximation to the calm of despotism , is generally regarded as the golden age of genuine democratic government . Thus , also , do the reigns of princes who have established despotisms by means of their personal popularity , and supposed subserviency to the popular will , shine in history with a peculiar brilliancy . During the first years of tyranny is reaped the harvest sown during the last years of liberty . The Augustan age was rich in great minds formed in the generation of Cicero and Cm*esar . And yet , says Macaulay most aptly , the fruits of the policy of Augustus were reserved for posterity . So , also , to bring the matter bome , the age of Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , and John Quincy Adams , was rich in minds formed in the generation of Washington . The fruits of this reign of liberty were fully reaped during the dictatorship of Andrew Jackson. - In the time of Jefferson , such was the prestige of his name in connexion with democracy , the masses of the people could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be seriously endangered by his example . The effects of this example were effectively checked by the conservative administrations of Madison , Monroe , and the younger Adams , two of whom were recognized as prominent leaders of a great party , which was fast rising on the ruins of federalism to oppose the anarchial tendencies of the radical Jeffersonian democracy . But under the iron dominion of Andrew Jackson , on whom , as we have said , the mantle of thegreat Apostle had fallen , the whirlwind of Jacobinism rose to its height , and for eight years the country bowed submissively beneath the rule of a fierce spirit , whose pernicious impulses were never controlled by considerations of prudence or of consequences . In our next we shall enter on a period of the Jefferson administration if not more important at least more entertaining in point of historical incident , and which serves to illustrate , equally with the acts just narrated , the deliterious influences of Jefferson 's example in politics and in his administration of the federal government .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
