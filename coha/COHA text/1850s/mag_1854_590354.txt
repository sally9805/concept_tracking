THE MISSOURI PROHIBITION . WERE the numerous resolutions , memorials , petitions and indignant protestations against the repeal of the Missouri Prohibition with which for a few months past both houses of Congress have been flooded , and the holy horror with which some good men lift up their hands at the very mention of the act , our sole criterion of its character , we should be likely to infer that never had there been devised a more iniquitous or heaven daring measure , and that nothing to palliate , much less to justify it could possibly be suggested . Unable however to think with the opponents of repeal , indeed believing that Congress never had before it a measure , so far at least as the repeal of this Prohibition is concerned , involving more truly republican principles or more deserving to become a law , and impressed too with the idea , that , while this uproar we hear is honest with some , with most it is merely th' noise made by that inveterate rider of hobbys ,  --  the whig party-in scrambling upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article why the Missouri Prohibition should be repealed . In the first place , with all deference to the great names arrayed in the opposition , we must express the belief that the passage of the Prohibition was merely an unauthorized assumption of power by Congress and therefore that it was void in its inception . In the people composing a State , by which we mean " a body politic or independent society of men united together for the purpose of promoting their mutual safety and advantage by their combined strength , " in their collective capacity , as a natural society , a political individuality , the sovereignty or supreme governing power , without limit or restriction , is inherent , and the State is said to be sovereign . - This sovereignty is to its fullest extent represented and exercised by the government of the State , which , the only visible and tangible embodiment of the supreme power , may do any act which that power might do , except as prohibited in manner or extent by that same high authority . Such is the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , for their greater security and the im 3 // provement of their condition , instead of leaving certain sovereign powers in which they all had a common interest to b exercised by their local government , have entrusted their exercise to a common agent of all the States  --  the general government-created by th' instrument delegating such powers Within the limits of the powers so entrusted , the general government represents the sovereignty of the States as completely as do the State governments , and in the exercise of these powers may do any act which the sovereignty of the State might do . The State government is the natural and residuary representative of the entire sovereignty of the State , and exercises all its sovereign powers except those prohibited by the Constitution of the St*tte or cutrusted to the general government . But the general government , having been jointly created by and made the common agent of all the States , is rather the artificial and specific representative of the sovereignty of the State and only as to those powers specially entrusted . One has merely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exereis* the other all those not taken away . With the State government , it is the rule that it possesses the right to exercise any sovereign power of the State , and the exception that its exercise is restricted by the constitution of the State or has been entrusted to the general government ; but with the gcneral goverment , the rule that it was not entrusted , and the exception that it was , with the exercise of any sovereign power . The office of the federal constitution is to delegate powers not before possessed to the agent which it has created ; of the State constitution to prehibit or direct as to the manner of the exercise of powers already possessed . If an ambiguity exists as to the meauin0 of either , and it is doubtful whether any power is prohibited by the one , or delegated by the oTher , the presumption being that the natural order of things has not been disturbed , unless the intention to disturb be clearly expressed , the construction must be against the prohibition in one case , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general government , it is important that what has been said regarding the character and construction of its constitution should be borne in mind . The Missouri Prohibition prohibits slavery in that part of the territory purchased from France north of 36 deg. 30 mm . It is an act regulating , and implies a power in Congress to regulate , the personal rights and relations of the people of the territories , as least so far as to prohibit slavery . Not only this power however , but every other sovereign power , the op-4 // pon6nts of repeal claim for Congress over the territories , contending that the general government holds the same relation to the people of the territories , that a State government does to the people of a State . But the territories being the joint property of all the*tates , if the right to govern them be inherent anywhere except in the peo*de of the territories themselves , it must be in the States ; and if it be in the States , the general government can not , as we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the States have created it , or legislate in regard to their , personal rights and relations , even to prohibit slavery , unless the States have delegated the power by the constitution . Where then in the constitution is this relation created or this power delegated ? The only sources whence it is claimed that Congress obtains the power to govern the territories are , as an incident of the power of acquiring territory , the war and treaty making power and the second clause of the third section of the fourth article of the constitution . A ceordino ' to Vattel and other writers on international law , a State , in acquiring territory , acquires with it of necessity the right of empire or sovereignty over it . From a misconception of the nature of the general government , it is hence supposed to follow , that , because under the constitution it has power to acquire territory , it acquires with the territory a right of empire over it . Now the general government is , as we have seen , merely a common agent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign powers . Among them is the power to acquire territory . When then the government acquires territory , it is the States in fact that makes the acquisition , but through their . agent . By the law of nations just referred to then , the States in making such acquisition through their agent acquire also the right of empire orjurisdiction , and this right invests in them as one of their reserved sovereign rights and not in their agent , unless otherwise delegated . Being merely a government of delegated powers , while it represents the States as to the powers entrusted and those necessary for their execution , it by no means follows that it also would represent them as to this different , and for the purposes of acquisition wholly unnecessary , power of governing a territory , because the States have acquired it through its act in the exercise of its delegated power of acquiring territory . So far only as the general government represents the state sovereignties does it gain any jurisdiction vver the acquired territory . To represent them as to the go-3* // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is evident must be sought for at some other source than as an incident of the power of acquiring territory . It might be inferred from the argument that any of the rights so acquired over ' *4uch territories , not granted to the general government , might be exercised by the state governments , representing as they do the States as to all their residuary powers . But it will be seen in th' course of the argument that this empire of the State over the territories is of limited extent , and that perhaps all the power which the States rightfully possessed has been already granted to the general goverment . In what manner a right of jurisdiction over the territories flows from the second source claimed , the war and treaty making power , it is not easy to see . A government created by the States for certain specific purposes can certainly by no act of its own , add to , or detract from the pQwers entrusted to it , whatever it might do did it represent the entire sovereignty of a State ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislate over the territory the treaty might cede , the general government could not exercise that power , as we have seen , unless otherwise authorized by the constitution . But the source most relied on for deriving anthonity for the Missouri Prohibition , is the provision of the constitution before referred to , which reads , " the Congress shall have power to dispose of , and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States . " But how , by any ordinary use of language , can this clause be made to confer upon Congress complete legislative power over the territories , or even to such an extent as to warrant it in prohibiting slavery ? Taking the word " territory " with its connection " or other property , " it is evident that it is used in its material sense , as an organized community , and so the Supreme Court has decided . It will be remarked , too , that the word is used in the singular , and not in the plural , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as favors their construction ; and also that the " regulations " are " respecting " the territory , implying something passive , as property , in regard to which they are made , and not " for " the territory , which would imply something active , as inhabitants , for whom they are made , to be lived under and used by them . The natural construction of the clause seems only to give Congress power to dispose of* and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the land belonging to the United States . // The language of the constitution is that of great clearness and precision , and those terms are always used most appropriate to convey the exact meaning of its framers . It is free from tautology . It contains n*useless , indefinite phrases or loose expression . In granting Congress power over the territory of the United States , had it been intended to grant the complete sovereignty claimed , we should certainly have expected , front the character of the instrument , the terms of the grant to have been more clearly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and regulations respecting the territory . " And inded where such extensive powers are intended to be granted , its language is quite unmistakable . In the enumeration of the powers of Congress in the eighth section of the first article of the constitution , the sixteenth clause reads as follows : - " To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such district ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may by cession &amp;c. , become the seat of go*rnment of the United States ; and to exercise the like authority over all places purchased &amp;c. , for the erection of forts , magazines , arsenals , dockyards and other needful buildings . The power here conferred is complete , sovereign and exclusive , extending to every conceivable subject of legislation , and language is employed which clearly expresses the intention . Now if it was intended to convey the same power over the territories , why was not the same precise language used , instead of the very extraordinary phraseology for such a purpose , " needful rules and regulations respecting the territory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is claimed to do , why was it not used in granting complete political power over the District , and places purchased for forts and other purposes , instead of " exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever . " The difference in phraseology argues an intention to convey different powers , and , by the clause under consideration , to confer upon Congress merely the supervision and control of the public lands and other property of the United States . Any other conclusion must be in violation of all rules of the use and construction of language , derogatory to the character of the Constitution as an instrument of great literary ability , and in face of the fact that where power over persons as well as property is , as all admit , granted , the terms of the grant are clear , precise and unequivocal . Congress having confessedly supreme control over the public lands , it may be contended however that it practically has the power claimed , in that it must necessarily have the right // to dispose of them subject to any conditions it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry slaves thither , and that the Missouri Prohibition , antecedent as it is to all grants of land in the territory*amounts to such a condition . The answer to this is , that Congress holds the territories in trust equally for the people of all the States , and therefore that it has no right itself to impose any conditions , by law or otherwise , which shall in effe*t prevent certain classes of the people from emigrating thither . But then such institutions may be established there , it may be said , as would prevent the emigration of some other equally numerous class . The failnrc to impose conditions could not be a violation of this trust , because , while it is certain that such conditions must prevent the emigration of some , it is quite uncertain that , in their absence , such institutions would be established as to prevent the emigration of others . In case they should be established however , would Congress , out of this trust , have a right to abolish them ? This brings up4he whole question whether Congress has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down shivery , polygamy or even a despotism , if established by the people of a territory . We say no , and accept it as a legitimate deduction from our doctrines . As we shall hereafter show , the United States , as the mother country , have a right to interfere with their colonies in the territories , only so far as necessary to protect the rights of its citizens . Their sole right affecting this question is to eniigrate thither . Hence , ordinarily , if the territorial government should attempt to exclude emigration , Congress might secure the right by force . But these institutions , however objectionable they may be , do not necessarily exclude emigration , and no ground of interference therefore exists . Moreover should Congress undertake the removal of all objections to emigration on account of the character of the laws of the territories , it could not stop short of assuming the entire supervision of Their legislation , and thereby creating the still greater objection than any , of living where the people have no decisive voice in the laws by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon the character and phraseology of the Constitution . But now we contend that it was not the intention of the framers of the Constitution to confer upon Congress legislative powers over the territories to the extent claimed , because the States themselves , though completely sovereign , never had such powers to confer , and in this connection shall endeavor to make it appear , which is the second reasen why it should be repealed , that // the Missouri Prohibition is in violation of the right of the territories to self gov*rnment . Men are by nature endo*ved with equal rights , and entitled to the utmost freedom of individual action consistent with the enjoyment of an equal degree*f freedom by all . It is therefore the right of any person to interfere with and restrain the freedom of his neighbor , who in its use exceeds this limit which nature has imposed , and thereby hinders him in the free enjoyment*f his rights , so far as may be necessary to prevent such excess . It is moreover his duty so to do , if the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equal freedom of all , is the condition most favorable for that highest mental and moral development of which man is capable and for which he was placed on earth . As it is the right and duty of any man to restrain his neighbor who thus abuses his freedom , so also , because society is man 's necessary state of existence , it is , on the same grounds , the right and duty of any number of men , in their collective capacity , as a political body or state , to impose restrictions on those whose acts are inconsistent with the enjoyment of equal rights by all . This may be done by laws through the constituted government . The right of the State to impose restraint on individual freedom is derived then from this source , and as the State is but a concourse of individuals politically organized , its rights are an aggregation of individual rights from this source only . It is evident however , as the natural rights of all are equal , that by no majority however great , has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to secure equal freedom to all , and can not do it without oppression ; and that , as this right of restraint is but the sum of individual rights , it can not , more than the individual , rightfully exercise it except as to those from whom danger to equal freedom exists or is to be apprehended , as its own lawless members . And therefore , as citizens of a foreign country , or colonists domiciled in a distant province , could by no conceivable license of action at home deprive any citizen of the mother State of the least right he is entitled to enjoy , the mother State , that is the concourse of individuals who compose it , exercising through the government the aggregate of their right to restrain any whose conduct deprives them of equal freedom , can have no right to legislate over or to impose upon them any degree of restraint . She can not interfere to regulate their personal rights and relations . She can not prohibit them even from violating natural rights by enslaving // one another . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among her own citizens , and to protect their rights abroad . Her commercial interests , her conceit or her honest solicitude for the Xuture of the incipient State , might urge , but could not autho*ze such interference . Having as individuals the same equal rights , and being entitled by nature to the same equal freedom of individual action , and to exercise the consequent right of forcibly preserving that equality , as the citizens of the mother State , the right of legi*lation regarding all matters affecting their personal liberty , that is the right of self government , an inhere in none but the colonists themselves . This'right may be exercised through such government as they may constitute , and no earthly power can rightfully exercise it for them without their consent . But though colonies have exclusive sovereignty over themselves , they are far from independent . The eminent , and generally to a great extent the absolute domain of the soil which they occupy , which must be added to sovereignty to constitute complete independence , belongs to the mother State . She has therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other State , the right to defend it against her enemies , or to prevent the annexation of it by her colonies to another State . She has also a right to dispose of the soil , and make all needful " rules and regulations respecting " it . Her nationality too covers her colonies until they acquire an independent national existence of their own . Now the relation which exists between the States of this Union and their territories , is precisely that of the mother country and colonies . The people of the territories are settled upon the domain of the States , beyond the limits of all of them , in separate distinct communities , with no nationality but that of the United States , and no license , in which they may indulge at home , can diminish in any degree the fullest freedom to which the people of the States are entitled in the enjoyment of their rights . Hence , as we have seen , the States can have no right to legislate over the people of the territories , even to prohibit slavery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty . Is it not absurd therefore to claim that the States delegated such right to Congress by the Constitution , or that it warrants the Missouri Prohibition ? The power really delegated , to dispose of and regulate the public lands , over which in the territories their right of domain , as we have seen , extends , is the sole power over the territories which the States possessed , and all they could confer . And when a territory is admitted into the Union // as a State , it really receives no accession to its rightful powers but the eminent , and so far as the rest of the world is concerned , the absolute domain over the private property of its citizens , while Congress still retains , under the Constitution , the power to dispose of , *d make all rules necessary to regulate the use or occupation of the public lands , and to exempt them from taxation . To revert a moment to the constitutional argument , if it be still claimed that the States could confer upon Congress power over slavery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some matters as to which the States had no right to interfere . If anything was insisted on or settled in our revolution , it was that as to some things at least Great Britain had no right to legislate over us ; and the relation which she held to us being precisely that which the States held to the people of the territories , the mutual rights in both cases must be the same . But if the clause in the Constitution , empowering Congress to make " all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory " of the United States , grants power to prohibit slavery , its phraseology is such that it must also grant every other sovereign power ; and the framers of the instrument are put in the ridiculous position of granting a power which the States never possessed . We have now shown , as we believe , that Congress has no powers except those granted by the Constitution , together with those necessary for their exercise , and that no power to legislate over the people of the territories , even to prohibit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their rights of self-government , granted by that instrument . By what authority then does Congress claim to represent the sovereignty of the people of the territories , and whence has it the power to interfere with them as to those matters in which the States felt they had not a common interest , and reserved to their local legislatures ? The conclusion seems irresistible that the passage of the Missouri Prohibition was merely an unauthorized and unjustifiable assumption of power by Congress . A third reason for the repeal of the Missouri Prohibition is , that it does not consist with the theory on which our institutions are founded , and in that respect endangers our liberties and the Union . This theory , which is the only theory of government which secures the most perfect possible liberty , allows to the individual the utmost freedom of action consistent with the enjoyment of equal freedom by all , admitting neither variation on the one side to license , nor on the other // to oppression . It forbids to one political division a voice in the government of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conflicting or in which it is required for their mutual safety . It supposes the general government to legislate only as to the matters in which the interests of the States are identical , and which could not as advantageously be cared for by their local governments , and those which could not be left to them consistently with the interests of all the States . And so the State Governments with reference to the different parts of the State , and so the governments of counties with reference to towns . This distribution of political power , giving as it does to each government jurisdiction only over those matters in which the interests of the entire constituency united under it harmonize , precludes the bitter controversies and fierce struggles for supremacy between two sections , which must follow every attempt to legislate on any of their conflicting interests , and which , if persisted in , renders the government oppressive and threatens revolution . The greatest dangers to which our Union has ever been exposed , have arisen from Congress transcending the limit which this theory imposes upon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense of vast interests in another . Had labor been left to seek its natural channels , we should not have heard of nullification . Had it been from the first the policy of the government to neither legalize nor prohibit slavery in the territories , but to leave the whole question to the decision of the people residing therein , and to admit them at the proper time as States of the Union , without regard to whether slavery be permitted within their limits or not , the dangers which threatened in 1820 and 1850 , and the agitation which has attended the acquisition or organization of every new territory , would never have been encountered . The general government confined strictly within this limit , the Union would be only a source of benefit ; but permitted to transcend it , even though allowed by the constitution , its disadvantages must be increased , and its strength so tar diminished ; and the tendency must be , if the States insist on their rights , to ultimate dissolution , or if not , to the gradual building up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency of government is ever strong to centralize power . The difficulty in all ages has been , too much goverment and too little individualism ; too much centralization , but never too great diffusion of power . It is against this tendency that patriots have ever struggled , and to oppose which the checks amid balances in constitutions of // government have been devised . It is because the Missouri Prohibition is a step in this direction , and should therefQre be receded from , and not because it is of any possible consequence in itself , that it shoul* be repealed . The opponents of the repe* of the Prohibition , entirely oblivions , however , to these considerations , as well as its being an act in violation of the Constitution and the territorial rights of self-government , accept with acclamation , and are entirelv carried away with the doctrine , that the people of the territories are in the position of minors , and that Congress is their natural guardian , and assume therefore for it the power to interfere with their domestic affairs to any extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation seems completely to have captivated their senses , and such is their overflowing love and tender solicitude for the welfare of these poor children , that they would kindly deprive them of the power of governing themselves as to some matters , lest they might unwittingly wield it to their injury . How fortunate for the people of the territories that they have a guardian so much wiser , so much more capable , so much better versed in the principles of self-government than themselves , and above all , so much more intimately acquainted with their condition and necessities . Great Britain , when we were colonies , in the fullness of her love , attempted to exercise the same paternal authority over us . The Czar of Russia , the Emperors of Austria and France , tilled with the same emotions , are now exercising the same paternal authority over their subjects . And the same irresponsible power is gravely claimed over the territor*s for the Congress of the United States . The doctrine is certainly a strange one for the nineteenth century . It has no affinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It involves legislation without adequate representation . It asserts the right of one people to rule over another . It is stamped with the image of the toryisin of the revolution . It bears about it the rankest federalism of the days of Adams . It is in principle , if not in practice , merely unmitigated , irresponsible despotism-despotism exercised for a benevolent purpose perhaps-yet , nevertheless , essentially despotism . It is objected that the Missouri Prohibition is a part of a solemn compact between the North aimd South , and irrepealable because clothed therefore with the sacred character of a treaty . But in no proper sense certainly , can it be considered a conipact . Congress is not empowered to make treaties between two sections of the country , but only to niake laws // which shall be binding on both . The Missouri Prohibition differ , s from any ordinary law of Congress only in the circumstances attending its passage . The South were anxious for the success of the act aut*orizing Missouri to frame a constitution preparatory to her admission into the Union , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of votes . Accordingly this prohibition *ias tacked on , in order to draw to it enough support from the North to secure its passage . In appropriation bills , this management is known merely as log-rolling . In the Missouri bill it is designated by the more high sounding term , compact . But if the Missouri Prohibition is invested with a higher or more permanent character , as it undoubtedly is , than the ordinary legislation of Cono'ress , it is not because it is a compact , or has even the moral force of a compact , but because it was a satisfactory settlement of a difficult and dangerous question , after protracted and angry discussion , while a bitter and hostile feeling existed between the two sections of the country threatening the safety of the Union itself , and because to disturb such a settlement there must be a natural reluctance lest the same difficulties and dangers be again encountered , and a readjustment be rendered impossible . It is in this sense only that the compromises of 1850 are irrepealable . It is objected , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will extend into the territories . But the Prohibition is merely an affirmation by Congress of that natural law which forbids slavery , and which will be in force in the territory when the Prohibition shall have been repealed . The doctrine that southern statesmen have advanced , that to constitution secures the right to carry slaves as property info all the territories of the United States , involves too many absurdities , and is too plainly untenable , to require serious argument . The property intended can only be that which is recognized as property by natural law , and not the exceptions which the statutes of a particular State may create . Slavery is merely the creature of long custom or express law . When man was created , lie was given " dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowls of the air , and over every living thing which moves upon earth . " And in these things all nations recognize a right of property . But no dominion was given by one class of men over aiXother* nor is any admitted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held in the territory without the sanction of express law , which could never probably be obtained . The foreign emigration thither must be immense , and of course hostile to slave labor . The // emigration from the free States , as the more vigorous , enterprising and populous , must not only anticipate , but greatly exceed that from the slave States . In the early stages of the settlement moreover , slaves could not probably be carried there in any number with pro*t . Hence a strong anti-slavery sentiment must prevail throughout the territory , and must speedly induce a prohibition of slavery by the territorial legislature . But if , after all , danger of a contrary result be apprehended , and it be important to preserve the territory from slavery , it becomes the free States to urge such emigration thither as may be necessary to secure this result . The battle between slavery and freedom in the territories is to be fought somewhere . Let it be rather in the locality and among the people who must suffer from the infliction of the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be disturbed . Then no complaint could be made of rights disregarded , as the contest resolves itself into one of activity and enterprise between the free and slave States . If we have shown now , as we trust we have , that the Missouri Prohibition is unconstitutional , in violation of the territorial rights of self government , and inconsistent with the theory on which our institutions are founded , and that it is no irrepealable compact , nor will necessarily throw the territories open to slavery , what ground is there for the violent opposition made to its repeal ? It does not establish slavery in the territories , as the opponents of repeal seem determined we shall believe . The image of poor Nebraska , manacled and bleeding beneath the lash , as depicted with such fearful emphasis by the opposition , is only the conjuring of political wizards , or the dream of fevered imaginations . The horrors with which they surrounded her future , are only bug-bears which whiggery employs to frighten us - harmless windmills , on which is wasted much Quixotic chivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of the government , non-intervention by Congress in the domestic affairs of the people of the territories , and the constitutional principle , t*iat Congress has only the same powers over the people in the territories , that it has over the people in the States . That done , the constitution and the rights of the territories will be preserved inviolate , and a great and most frequent source of danger to the Union be removed.
