ART . VJIL. - CHURCHES AND PARSONAGES . A Book of Plans for Churches and Parsonage* . Published under the direction of the Central Committee appointed by the General Congregational Convention , Oct. , 1852 . Comprising designs by UPJOHN , DOWNING , IRENWICK , WHEELER , WELLS , AUSTIN , STONE , CLEVELAND , BACKUS , and IREEvE . New York : Daniel Burgess &amp; Co. , No. 60 John St. , 1853 . " BETTER late than never . " This work , which appeared just as our last number was issued , and conid therefore be only named among o1ur notices , has been long waited for , and often inqnired after . It is one of the good fruits of the Congregational Convention at Albany , in Oct. , 1852 . In matnring the project , which was afterward so successfully executed , for raising a fund to aid feeble Western churches in erecting houses of worship , care was taken to foster and direct , as far as possible , a spirit of improvement in this kind of architecture . The Central Committee were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons engaged in such undertakings ; and the several State Committees , before disbursing the sums that should come into their hands , were authorized to inquire into the plans adopted by congregations seeking aid , and to require such modifications as they should think expedient . It was hardly expected that the resolution adopted to this effect would lead to a compilation so valuable and costly as the one now before us . A glance at it will convince our readers that it could not have been prepared as soon as it was called for , and that , so far as lasting utility is concerned , more has been gained than lost by the delay . In the meantime , we fear that here and there , in the Great West , premature or ill-shapen architectural productions , in the likeness of many at the East , have been advanced too far to be affected by the sight of these models . But the West is a great country , they say , and new edifices will be multiplied yet faster than they have been ; while at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are becoming new . There can not fail to be permanent demand for such a work as this . It may be of as much service , also , to the Presbyterian churches of the New School Assembly , in the distribution of the fund which they have more recently begun to raise , as to those for whom it was especially intended ; and we hope they will avail themselves of the facility thus afforded for guiding the judgment of the congregations in the use of the aid bestowed . // We invite our readers generally to take the first opportunity - and , of course , the best way of doing it is by purchase-of looking into the mechanical execution of this book . The fair , substantial paper , the beauty of the type and press-work , the carefi*l delineation and Line coloring of the designs , and , in general , the solidity and elegance of the volume , are creditable to the enterprise , as well as the taste , of the gentlemen who have had it in charge . The Central Committee , we understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expediture which was required for this purpose . We have said to ourselves , This is the way in which a New York and Brooklyn Conunittee do their work ! In other places , it would not have been attempted without guaranty against loss ; for where there is wealth enough there is not public spirit enough to incur such a responsibility . It has been often said , and , we believe , truly , that if there is more atrocious wickedness in large cities than in smaller communities , there is more active goodness also ; certainly more liberality , and , we think , more beneficence of every kind . Christian people in New York and Brooklyn excel those in the country as much in spending money as in making it . There is more life among them , and life is faster and stronger in its movements . The book before us is an example . Whatever may come of it in the form of advantage or convenience to the churches , it could not have been issued in this style as a profitable speculation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly say that the publication of such a work on this subject , and in this style , is creditable also to our time and country . As the advance ' of civilization tends in general to " the division of labor , " so , with the increase of cultivation , the several departments of science and art are more clearly distinguished from one another ; each is more zealously explored and described , both in its relations to the others and in its own principles and history ; its sphere is enlarged and its materials are multiplied , till alone it seems enough to occnpy a student 's exclusive attention , and the successful pursuit of it may require , and perhaps reward also , the labor of his life . Thus , music is itself only one of the fine arts , yet a performer despairs of attaining equal proficiency in all kinds of music , and there is so much to be done with one instrument , and so much to be known about it , that it may well be the subject of a whole treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember once putting a question or two to a bagpiper at the head of a Scotch reg:ment , upon which there came forth a stream of information , with all the gust of highland fervor and brogue , about // some of his most eminent predecessors on that instrument , and the number of airs they had composed , which satisfied us that a reputation and a book might be built up even on the pipes . Thus architecture , in the most comprehensive view of it , is a department both of science and art ; and then , consid*ed as one of the arts of design , it is readily distingnished as of various kinds , each of which has its own laws ; and in the progress of national refinement , each kind is studied by itself more and more with reference to its own uses , principles , and capabilities . The old Greek builders made their several " orders* ' the subject of minute prescription , and have been followed with servile exactness , while in later times other styles have been wrought out with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and books have been multiplied on this , as on other subjects , till on this alone a respectable library might be collected . We can not fail to see improvement in our own country within the past few years in this department of art , both in buildings constructed and in published designs . Downing 's Cottage IResidences , and other works from the same hand , we regard as both a sign and a cause of refinement , diffusing itself first among the educated readers , and then through the respectable masses of our people ; and , in view of the kind of influence and eminence which he had attained , it is pleasing to observe how much deeper and more general was the sense of loss occasioned in our country by his untimely death , than could possibly be felt if any or most of the conceited , brawling politicians , who figure in Congress as well as out of it , were swept off to their " own place . " Thus , too , the publication before us , in a very different deparl*uent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public mind , and will serve to further and to guide it . There must have been a preparation and a call for so costly a work , at least among the Congregational churches and ministers in our country , or it would not have been undertaken . We are gratified to learn , also , from competent testimony , that though some , who were concerned in preparing it , " feared it would be thought somewhat ahead of time and taste , " yet it already finds favor , and a sale also , in some of those communities which might not have been expected at once to appreciate its quality . With the lapse of time , the spread of education , the extension of business , and the accumulation of wealth , the people have advanced also , if not at an equal pace , in the finer interests of society , in the culture of art and the appreciation of beauty . There have been times which could not warrant a separate book even on architecture at large in all its branches ; and such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , so far as we know , the present volume is the first that has appeared in our country , or the first so ample and elaborate in the province of ecclesiastical architecture alone. * And in this view , we reckon it so much the more significant and valuable , because in its design and uses it is essentially popular . This , too , was a principal merit of Downing 's works . He aimed to make the people at large familiar with simple , unexpensive models of beauty , which might be tbllowed in cottage residences , and even farmhouses , throughout the land ; and thus the land would be adorned , and the people themselves refined , far more than by stimulating a rich man here and there to erect a splendid palace . Thus , too , it is of far more consequence in respect to the advantage of the people , the aspect of our country , and indeed the general cause of art , that proper examples and instructions be furnished to ordinary congregations , for erectiiig such houses of worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plethoric corporation , calling itself a church , be taught how to copy some foreign cathedral . Architectural beauty could better be dispensed with in the crowded streets of a city than amidst the congenial airs and foliage of a village . In church-building , as in other things , it is as wise as it is republican-to care mainly for the masses . Let our cheap rural edifices be in good taste , whatever becomes of costlier , more pretending structures . The compilation before us offers examples mostly , though not exclusively , of that class ; and hence it reflects the more credit on our country , and promises to be of the more advantage . But we pass to the contents of this volume , of which , however , we can here only give some such brief account , beyond what is contained in the title-page , as may lead the reader to examine it for himself . The plans for par*onaqes are but a secondary or incidental part of the work , and not , indeed , originally any part of the task assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one of these is from Downing 's " Residences . " More abundant and various materials of this kind are of course furnished in his popular works , and may be expected also in Mr. Wheeler 's forthcoming volume , under the genial title of " Homes for the People , " from which the third of these plans is anticipated . Parsonages do not properly differ from other dwellings , as churches differ from other public edifices ; and * Mr. Upjohn published , in 1S52 , a work in similar form , which , however contained only one example of a wooden church , chapel , parsonage , and schoolhouse ; but included the drawings and specifications for workmen . // hence may be comprehended in the provision made by such artists for the middle class of residences . It is well , however , that these examples have a place here , because congregations will thus be reminded of their duty in that direction . It is a fact which deserves to be more generally understood , that no part of the support given to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , as his use of a dwelling which is their property . Even a poor congregation-as long as they are able to build a church-can build a parsonage , by taking advantage of a common earnest impulse , without more than a wholesome effort , and , when it is once built , the rent pays itself out annually without a word of solicitation , while yet the amount that must be raised by the people for the minister 's support , is really to the same extent reduced , since , whatever he may dispense with , he must have a house to live in ; and moreover , all question is obviated as to what house he shall select , or whether a suitable one can b* had on any terms . Then it is to be considered that the support which he receives in this form , insensibly adjusts itself to the fluctuations of the times ; for he is paid " in kind , " and not in a varying quantity , which may or may not be an equivalent ; and if the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belive it might be , by a " sliding scale , " - if the stipulation were described not only in part by the rent of a house , but in part also by the price of provisions-it would but do him justice , while it increased his comfort . This is a branch of political economy which all salaried men are brought to understand sooner or later , especially " at this present , " when high prices are illustrating it by experiment . There is indeed one drawback on the desirableness of parsonages , and it is the more likely to be relieved , at least in some congregations , by being set forth rather than overlooked in this connection . Committees or Trustees , as such , are not the most accommodating landlords in the world , when parsonages need repairs ; for , while in their private or individual capacity they may attend to the reasonable complaints of their tenants , if only through a wise care of their own property , yet , as representing corporations , which have been said to " have no soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be reckoned exceptions , ) they seldom feel the requisite personal responsibility or interest ; and parish-property , the parsonage even more than the church , is apt to suffer accordingly . Hence it is expedient , whenever practicable , as it often is , in building a parsonage , to lay aside a small fund , the income o which shall be expended from time to time on the premises . Even trifling sums , thus seasonably employed , will avoid the // necessity of heavier expenditures to be incurred by neglect . We have been told of at least one town in Connecticut where a distinguished gentleman bequeathed his own mansion to the Congregational Society , as a parsonage , and along with it such a sum as would yield enough annually to keep it in a condition suitable both to their dignity and his own . Our friend , the pastor , will no doubt bear testimony to the wisdom of that measure . But notwithstanding this acknowledged drawback , and though there may be no prospect of obviating it in most places by the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true interests of congregations and of pastors will be wisely consulted by securing a parsonage in the neighborhood of every house of worship . We would not have the two side by side , for the former is thus made too " handy " for Sundaynoon-visitors ; but both should be included by every parish in the permanent provision made for sustaining the institutions of the gospel . And we recommend the remarks on this subject on the seventeenth page of the volume before us to the atteution of all who for any purpose have occasion to consult it . The Plans of Churches here presented we understand to have been originally intended ( with perhaps one or two exceptions ) as well as recently prepared , for the use of the committee , and of course make the most attractive and valuable , as well as the most expensive , portion of their work . They are eighteen in number , from ten different artists , and shaded and colored , as well as drawn , in such a manner as to give even unprofessional observers the best notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when executed . Each Design is shown in front and side elevations , and in the groundplan , and also in a section , when this is needed to exhibit the structure of the roof or other interior parts . Some of the plates exhibit also the nearest accompaniments of foliage and background , in proper harmony or contrast with the outline and tint of the building . Every drawing is attended with brief explanations , indicating the materials , dimensions , and probable expensiveness of the edifice , and such peculiarities in the structure or arrangement of the parts , or in the artist 's conception , as can not be plainly shown on the plate . It will be understood that these delineations and descriptions are not meant to comprise all the working-drawings and the mechanical details which must be required for their execution , and which could not be attempted here , but must be left to the care of the builders whenever and wherever they shall be needed* Nor could the artists go into any such precise estimates of cost as in a contract , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our country . Enough information is given to enable readers to make their own intelligent selection among so many models , and then to enable such builders as must of course be employed , to understand the work to be performed . But since so much care has been expended in preparing and explaining these Plans , we think it no more than justice here to bestow on them individually a passing notice . Design No. 1 . A small , cheap edifice , only forty feet by twenty-five , seating less than two hundred persons , costing only $1,000 in the city of New Haven , and of course much less in many other places . A good example , for this reason , that it is certainly more agreeable , to any instructed or practised eye , than many a church far more costly and ambitious . Though represented here as of wood , yet it would look as well in stone , or brick , and much enlarged too . The explanation suggests that if necessary the cost might be " further diminished by making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would thus be lost than gained . In so simple a design , this single feature is a principal thing . As well , for the same reason , give up all peculiarities . In the present dimensions , it would make a pleasant lecture-room or chapel , for a congregation that want more room in their church . We must complain of the ground-plan , however , for a common fault in the distribution of the space . The pews should be shorter , and have two passages . No. 2 . Less striking than some of the others , because in a style already common in our country , and meant , as the explanation indicates , rather to show an amendment or correction of familiar examples , than to supersede them . We much prefer the front elevation to the side . The latter is disturbed by the small windows that light the vestibule . Does the porch justify itself , in addition to the room in the tower ? We recommend the interior arrangement , the four blocks of pews , and middle and wall aisles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . No. 3 . Properly colored , as here , and on a corner as intended by the artist , the front , and especially the tower , must have a very good effect . The side elevation makes a different kind of impression , yet perhaps is not the less pleasing of the two , and unlike any other in the collection . As a whole certainly * We use the word aisle , of course , in the common acceptation , for a passage among pews . As an architectural term , employed before pews were in vogue , it designates that part of a church which is divided on either hand from the naive or main body by the pillars that support what is called the " clere story . " Hence " the long-drawn aisle " in Gray 's Elegy . // one of the best . The projecting room in the rear is conveniently arranged , and may be made still larger . No. 4 . A IRomanesque church , or chapel , for the country , but little larger than No. 1 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertically and battened  --  a style of finish which has found favor in our conntry of late years with the rapidity of a " taking " fashion . The small railroad stations have adopted and some what vnlgarized it . Still it must not be resigned fo them . It has a real fitness in iRoinanesque and Gothic wood-work , on account of its vertical lines , as compared with horizontal boards lapping one another . * The whole structure in a proper situation is picturesque , as similar designs already executed show . We call attention to the bell-turret , not only as a characteristic feature , but to remind the reader that because it is a mere turret it may properly rest on the roof , and indeed can have no separate support ; while we strenuously object to such an arrangement of a heavy spire or cupola , though it has become common . A tower , properly so called , ought to rest in appearance , as well as in fact , on the ground , though a turret may be perched securely anywhere . It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be accommodated in such quarters . We know of a nice church almost new , that has the belfry on the roof , where every revolution of the bell , which yet is not larger than is desirable , shakes the whole house , so as to be sensibly felt in the farthest pew . Such a liability is to be considered . We like the arrangement of the pews here , as in No. 2 , but by our measurement they can be only four feet and a half long , each seating three persons , and hence should be only so divided between the aisles ( if divided at all ) that two in a line can be thrown into one . No. 5 . A more costly structure , but still within the reach of an ordinary congregation , though it ought to be larger for the number that may be supposed to want accommodation wherever such an outlay is afforded . A building of this class should seat more than three hundred persons . But enlarging the scale more or less , we place this Design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the most satisfactory in the execution-especially the tower , which rises solidly from the ground , and stands out wholly from the body of the building , as we choose to see it . The interior of the roof also , as here drawn , is effective . No. 6 . A bold picturesque Design drawn in perspective , the // front and side shown in one view ; the tower on the corner , surmounted by a tall graceful spire , and the peak of the roof rising to nearly three times the height of the side walls . From the coloring of the landscape , heightened by the tints of the edifice itself ; this plate , as also No. 9 , has a fresh mossy look , as if just after rain on a summer Sunday morning in the country . We desire the reader to mark the effect here , ( and somewhat also in No. 15 , ) in this style of building , of the spire springing from the midst of turrets or smaller peaks , instead of a straight base ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or slanting lines , whenever they can be had , rather than to horizontal . The very steep roof will be observed as the principal feature of this Plan , and we call attention to what is said on this point in the accompaning explanation from the editor . Certainly it has the advantage of lasting well in our climate , and also of a churchy look . Low side-walls are not the most favorable however to galleries , of which we may speak again. - As a picture , this is perhaps more pleasing than any other in the volume . No. * . With all due deference to the reputation of the artist , it strikes us that if this Design had come from one of us unprofessional wights-from the pulpit instead of the pew-it would have been reckoned an adventurous experiment . Perhaps , however , as the lad said , of his new school-house , we " have n't got the hang of it yet . " No. 8 . The front better than the side , which , though well enough proportioned , is disturbed rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material is meant to be wood , it would look better in stone , as indeed may be said of most Designs . As a model too it rather confirms than discountenances many structures already in use which we would not choose to multiply , though certainly better shaped than most of them . The belfry is neat , but unless it is to be a massive structure , we prefer a spire above it. - By the way we would open the windows of belfries ( only making the floor weather-proof ) so as to show the bell turning over  --  and also to allow the " swallow " or the pigeon " a nest for herself where she may lay her young , " - like some kindly old belfries we used to climb into many years ago . No. 9 exhibits , in common with some of the other designs , a bell-turret which projects from the building , supported by braces , for which we believe the only motive is that it is an old fashion , a medieval affair , and as much might be said of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact to support a bell of decent size , it has not the look of strength , // and suggests no reason why it should stand out with its naked limbs , instead of resting on the roof . The windows , it will be seen , differ from the other examples . In the ground-plan , the pews are made of unequal lengths , but so regularly unequal as not to answer the purpose intended , as if one out of two families were of half size . The convenience sought is best secured by making all the pews short-seven and a half feet , or even six  --  and constructing the partitions so that a large family may appropriate two as one . iNo. 10 is especially noticeable as an edifice first constructed with a view to subsequent enlargement . As completed , the view is certainly striking , notwithstanding the plainnes&amp;'of the details ; and as convenient as any cruciform building . But we are glad to find that some of the congregations that have adopted that form in the original construction , and especially their ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to future enlargement , it is better to leave the small church to be a chapel or lecture-room , instead of making it the nave of the larger . But where the space does not allow of the two , the plan here given strikes us favorably. - 13y the way , we observe the side elevations of the original building is ascribed in our copy to one artist , and the other drawings to another . No. 11 , as to general use and effect , may be classed with No. 9 . We can not say we like the window-heads in either . Here moreover the bell-turret not only projects but ventures to a-8pire . It is none the better for becoming a " young steeple , " though in this instance well tapered. - The parsonage at the side is appropriate and pleasing . No. 12 , in the principal features is unlike any thing we have seen . The interior arrangement , in the body and rear , is good ; but we do not at once reconcile ourselves to any part of the exterior ,  --  except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not peculiar . We know there are examples to be cited for it , but is there any real beauty in breaking such a spire midway ? Nor do we see any sufficient reason , in use or looks , for shutting up a central tower in front , and arranging the entrances as here . No. 13 . One of the best front elevations in the book , or among our existing edifices . The passage through the tower would have a good effect to the eye , und often really accommodate those who drive to church . Whatever with or without that feature , the tower is too good to be omitted , wherever the expense can be borne ; but even alone , the main front would look exceedingly well , as the editor suggests . The cost of the whole is not given , but as one of the larger edifices here de // scribed , if built at once , and as it should be , of brick or stone , it would scarcely come within the means of many congregations who might yet need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they can afterwards build a tower when they are " able to finish it . " We are not so well pleased , however , with the other principal feature in this plan  --  the disposition of the smaller rooms between the entrance and the main audienceroom . Miore space is occnpied than can be needed for such rooms ; especially the hall , forty feet by fourteen , is too much for such a purpose , besides making too many steps " back and forth " to the room above ; and as no side elevation is here given , we are left uncertain as to the exterior effect of the arrangement . Moreover , if the congregation would be thus removed from the noise of the street on the Sabbath , when the noise is least , yet they would be the more exposed to it in lecture-room services at other times . On the whole we would choose to see the audience-room and front , in this Design , brought together , and the other rooms " sent to the rear . " And with this qualification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Plan . No. 14 . " The plainest , " says the editor , " of all our designs . " To be classed , as to use and costliness , with No. 1 , though in a different style , somewhat larger , seating more persons according to the computation given , and the pews more conveniently distributed . The two plans ought to be favorites at the West . And we recommend both to the largest congregations , as chapels . No. 15 . A church of medium size and cost , as compared with the others , comprising all the smaller rooms that can be wanted , and designed to allow the whole to be thrown into one audience-room whenever the growth of the congregation shall require . The interior is ingeniously arranged . We like the front well enough , excepting the double door ; and the side , excepting the door and little window which seem to have been pushed out of place for the convenience of the interior . The mullions and heads of the windows give the whole a different air from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w* can not say precisely what-in the face of the battened planks ,  --  perhaps their breadth as here drawn . This is one of the few designs showing the pointed arch , of which we would see other examples , and shall say more in another place . No. 16 . The largest and most expensive of all these models , measuring sixty-two feet by eighty-five inside , yet not estimated at more than thirty thousand dollars in the vicinity of New // York . * The front is solid and stately , and the porch , besides looking well , with the wheel-window above , is economical as to room , and convenient , though being open it requires the mildest exposure to the weather in that direction . The sideview here given in perspective with the front , seems to leave the window-sills too high from the fonndation . The two towers might be carried higher and surmounted with spires , or may well remain as here drawn , but we wonld not have them altered to any intervening fashion . Where there are two towers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted it may have a steadier station in the other . After all , unless in some vast edifice , are they not inevitably suggestive of superfluity ? No. 17 . Especially noticeable as being the only specimen in the volume which is characterized by that kind of Gothic or pointed arch which , from the obvious resemblance suggested , is called here , and in most books on the subject , the Lancet arch . We own a partiality for this among all the varieties of Gothic architecture . They all agree in the pointed arch as distingnished from the round , but this , as sharper than the commonest forms , has a more airy aspiring expression , and is capable of more lightness and grace . It is recommended also in the editor 's remarks as " a style particularly adapted to country or village chnrches , from the simplicity of its details , and the ease with which its mouldings and lines in their most simple forms can be worked and laid out . " t But , observing the dimensions of the building here given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should complain of the front , especially the middle part of the turret , as too much crowded with openings and mouldings , and hence in danger of seeming finical when executed. - The ground-plan has the fault of distribution noticed in some of the other designs  --  the length of the pews . No. 18 . A larger edifice than the last mentioned , yet it should be still larger , we think , to warrant the amount of decorative work on the front , however plain the surface of the wall . The material contemplated here is brick , but it will probably be oftenest imitated in wood , in which we find the most frequent attempts at show in ornamented gables , finials and tracery , and which gives these things an air of cheap ostenta * It has been already executed , we understand , in Brooklyn , N. Y. j If the reader will amuse himself with drawing two circles of equal diameter , the circumference of each passing through the centre of the other , the space enclosed by the intersection will show him two Gothic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye as any others , each enclosing an equilateral triangle . // tion . This design , however , on a larger scale , and executed in brick or stone , is one of the most pleasing in th' collection . It is especially noticeable for the airy elegance of the tower as completed in the spire . As shown in this example , the iRomanesque style favors loftiness in design , a certain buoyancy of aspect , perhaps scarcely less than the Lancet form of the Gothic . The reader will observe also here-as we might have indicated in some of the other plates  --  the beauty of the interior as seen in the section accompanying the ground-plan . We have thus briefly commented on these Designs , of course not as presuming to sit in judgment on the artists-whose reputation is already estabished ,  --  but because we have been interested in examining them , and in order the better to engage , for them and for the subject , the discriminating attention of our readers . On such topics a mere amateur , though not claiming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to express them ; and the choice of congregations , as to what houses of worship they will build , so far as they can be said to make a choice for themselves , must be determined mainly by the preferences of those few persons who , without being architects , yet with ordinary intelligence have bestowed the most attention on these things . As public opinion concerning physicians and their practice must be formed , not by their judgment of one another , but by unprofessional observers standing between them and the mass of those who are helped or hurt , scarcely knowing which , and certainly not knowing how or why ; so architecture is more or less successful , as it does or does not commend itself , in the long run , to those who take pleasure in it and direct their thoughts to it , as a department both of utility and of art , without claiming a scientific mastery of the subject . And hence we would draw the attention of such persons to the work before us . They will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , as they are conversant with various examples such as architects only can furnish . They can find such only by traveling far and wide , and then must compare too many at a disadvantage-or else in a collection like this . The want of models , selected and gathered for the purpose , has led to the most injudicious imitations and . perpetuated many unhappy experiments . The people in Carborough build something like what some of them have seen in Coaltown , as a little the " smartest** of the " modern fashions , " because they have no materials for a choice except in their neighborhood . A big stone toy ir Gotham is reproduced in wooden miniature in Puttyville , because the few in Puttyville who would really like a better // thing have not seen a better thing to like . But the judges in every congregation , such as they are , without going out of their own town , can command at least one copy of these " eighteen plans , " study them deliberately , understand their differences and resemblances , compare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a probability of not going far astray . The book is fitted thus to supply an existing want . But in order that it may answer this purpose we must join to our recommendation a single caution to committee-men , and all the " active " members of congregations . Such a book . as this , as is properly said in the preface , is not meant to supercede the employment of an architect ; for the specifications and workingdrawings not furnished here require some experience and skill in the builder ; and we would have him employed for this reason as well as others , to p reserve in constructing the edifice , the integrity of a Design which his business should qualify him to appreciate . No doubt every committee-mah has a right to his own opinions about any ofth ese Plans , but when one has been adopted , and he and others are entrusted with the execution , he ought to beware of spoiling the expression of the artist 's thought by interpolations of his own . The artist himself would not insist on a servile adherence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he has a right to ask that the building for which he is to be held in part responsible , shall not sacrifice his principal idea , and contravene the very effect he intended to produce . Now the builder , if qualified for his place , should hold a conservative check here upon his employers , with a proper professional jealously in behalf of the work which he is employed , not to originate nor to mend , but to execute . Many a story could be told of the changes undergone by an architect 's design in the hands of a committee  --  a story often painful to him , however amusing to us-resulting sometimes like the operations on an old clergyman 's wig , when his parishioners pulled out such hairs as did not suit their several tastes for color , till at last he said " they might lawfully worship it , since it was no longer in the likeness of anything in heaven above or the earth beneath or the water under the earth . " There is need of caution here . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village before mentioned , Puttyville , may adopt almost any one of these Designs , and if that thrifty man of business , G. W. Mannikin , Esq. , is put on their committee , he will probably choose to raise the whole edifice as here drawn , upon a basement that shall contain the lecture-room and other conveniences , and thus save the cost that would be incurred in foundation and roofing by putting these things outside on // the level of the main building . Now we protest beforehand against such a desecration of any Plan in this volume . Neither let that committee nor any other select the sixth Design , and begin their experiments by lowering the roof to the pitch common among the carpenters in their neighborbood , to make it " better proportioned , " or to " save the stuff , " and substituting for that spire what they call " a sort o'cnpolo " - when these things are the life-blood of the artist 's production . Nor let the characteristic mouldings on these plates be left out in the building , as so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' In a word let the pattern be rejected outright , or adopted in good faith and followed accordingly . Besides the plates and their accompanying explanations , this volume contains nearly thirty large pages of preliminary matter : an essay , or rather a series of essays somewhat informal and fragmentary , setting forth the principles that ought to govern the construction of houses of worship , as works both of utility and sacred art , with particular suggestions and directions on subordinate points in their arrangements . We need not say that we approve of the views exhibited in these articles , which appear to have been carefully prepared by one or more editors under the sanction of the Central Committee , and may serve to introduce the general reader to a more appreciating examination of the following examples . We might choose now to pursue many of the topics thus suggested , but our own views have been formerly given at some length in the pages of this Journal , * in agreement with the general and particular aims of the work under review . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of what we then attempted , in distinct and pointed condemnation of some of the fashions that have prevailed in the church-building of our time and country . Without going over that ground again , we will yet avail ourselves of this occasion for some forth er miscellaneous hints . In preparing these Plans , the Central Committee have done their work , as we said , on a more ample and liberal scale than was originally expected , and hence it is not by way of complaint if we suggest additions that seem to us desirable . Besides the original designs here given , we would have liked to see notices of some of the churches erected within a few years past which may deserve to be studied and imitated , with such delineations also as might be obtained at little or no expense . In most instances the people who build a fine edifice are willing to receive credit for it , and , if requested , would furnish the requisite information , with at least a lithograph which they * New Englauder , Vol . VI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some discriminating account , in a form to be circulated and preserved , of what may be reckoned a " model church , " already built , seems to be only a proper memorial of the congregation who have thus done what they could ' and perhaps lavishly expended the cost of precious spikenard ; ' besides serving to stimulate and guide other congregations . Two or three buildings are thus represented in the first volume of the Congregational Year-Book , and others we understand are to follow . With a little care , this will make an attractive feature of that work. * In a note to our former article , and in these comments , we have recommended short pews in preference to such as are generally found in our churches , and we reckon the matter of considerable consequence among the in echanical arrangements for public worship . In an edifice where all the room is wanted , it is not well that a pew nine or ten feet long must be appropriated to a family which does not occupy more than half of it , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family can not have a pew to themselves without a waste of room . The worshipers should be set in families , ' for the encouragement of wholesome associations between domestic and ecclesiastical ties , and hence most of the pews should be adjusted to the average number of persons in a family , which is generally reckoned five , with the common allowance of eighteen inches to each . The remaining space should be so distributed that those persons , of either sex , who are not in families , may hold their several seats of the congregation , instead of being tenants under pew-holders , or dependent on free seats up stairs . ' It is exceedingly desirable that every clerk , journeyman , seamstress , or domestic , should have an opportunity ( which many now seek in vain ) of individually owning a place in the house of God and contributing to its pecuniary income . The English dissenting congregations , we are told , are before us in this provision , republican as it is ; and we wish some traveler would describe their method with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are speaking of this part of a church , we take the opportunity to recommend the change adopted in some of the most costly and beautiful edifices lately erected , of dispensing with pew-doors . If not contrivances of that spirit of * We can at once recall suitable subjects for such notice in the Congregational churches last erected in New London , Hartford , New Haven , Fairfield , Norwalk , and Bridgeport , and , as a still more distinct and striking variety , the new one ( Dr. Todd 's ) in Pittsfield . We remember a small Reformed Dutch church in Syracuse , New York , which , though wooden , is a gem in its way ; and the first Presbyterian church in that city , as any traveler may see , is one of the finest in the State . // exclusiveness which is even more odious in the house of God than elsewhere , they are at best clumsy appendages serving no purpose but to exclude the cool air in summer , and annoy the worshiper with their click at all seasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ways , for these doors were an innovation on the primitive pews . ' We remember at least one house of worship , in which an illustrious American divine had ministered , where no such obstructions had yet been tolerated . We hope they will be discarded from every new edifice . Most of the Plans here given are too small to admit of galleries on the sides , as well as at the end ; and a new congregation , building on a larger scale , so as to get all the groundroom they will want for several years , may well enough dispense with them at first ; yet a large edifice should be built with a view to erecting them whenever the y shall be wanted . Only small or wealthy congregations can afford to do without them , or to adopt any style of architecture to which they can not be adjusted . They give the advantage of immense economy of seating-room , accommodating within the same external inclosure half as many persons as the whole ground-floor , at a comparatively trifling cost , and furnishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As beauty itself in a building stands closely related to the use for which it is designed , and a house of worship is designed to be filled by a hearihg and seeing congregation , who must be seen by the minister also , the proper architectural effect of the interior is not marred but enhanced when the faces of the assembly are presented most compactly and distinctly to his eye , in masses , rank above rank , as when galleries are properly constructed and filled . Nor is there any valid objection to them as interfering with speaking and hearing . Yery few of our churches are large enough to be hard to speak in , ' from any cause ; nor are the largest , as far as we know , the more difficult for having galleries . So far as our own observation goes  --  and we have several times made the comparison-those churches , and other public rooms , that are without them , require the more effort of the speaker . In our populous or growing communities , therefore , we would have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will allow them to - be put in afterwards . The work before us properly encourages the use of brick , or stone , where it can be had , instead of wood , for church-building , and we ask attention to the preliminary remarks on Materials ' and * We would go further , and insist that wherever other edifices are found of the more enduring mate- // 293 rials , a people who can build any sort of church ought to make this not less substantial . They can do it if they will but think so , and have no right to the plea of poverty as an apology for not attempting it . For such a purpose , a congregation need not fall behind its individual members in resources or in enterprise . Especially if they have building-stone in their neighborhood , they should not think of any other material . Wherever bricks can be made , or easily obtained , of some mild neutral color , like those now brought from iMlilwaukie or Toronto , they are recommended both for utility and effect . If the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it softened to the eye by painting or some other process , but the same expense must be incurred with wood . And we take the liberty of repeating here a suggestion we have made before , that when the funds are not provided for completing the steeple of a stone or brick church in the same material , it is better to stop at the floor of the belfry , leaving the bell to swing in the open air , till the people shall have recruited their resources , than to carry up for the present a wooden substitute which will answer the purpose too well to be replaced by anything better . Let us have substantial edifices , consistent in all their parts from the corner-stone to the weather-cock , even if they are built precemeal , rather than hybrid structures done up ' in haste , and in haste to decay . In architecture , as in other departments of taste , we would jealously guard against the excessive tendencies that prevail in the public mind , each takiiig its turn as the fashion for a course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved and hallowed . We should have liked to see a greater variety in the styles represented in this book . It must not be taken for granted that the old Greek forms , if not in vogue just now , are forever discarded from ecclesiastical architecture , especially since they may be seen renewed in the most costly modern church in Paris . One IDoric example might have been given here , with its straight lintel , columns , entablature , and pediment . The later styles , however , must always have an advantage in their endless variety . Yet even among these the fashion just now tends too exclusively towards the IRomanesque , though the Gothic may be still more diversified , the round arch being only repeated in the one , while the pointed arch admits of every curve in the other. * Thus in this collection we find the former * We speak of our own denomination . Our Episcopal friends ( they mu8t be reached by one limb or anotber of the Christian salutation , Brethren and friends ' ) are perhaps as exclusively partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George 's church , X. Y. ( Dr. Tyng 's ) one of the best examples of the Romanesque ( especially its interior ) in the country . // style predominating , with but one specimen of the most graceful pointed architecture . There is a tendency also to the adoption of some striking feature in an admired example , without inquiring whether there may be like reasons to justify it in the imitation . Thus it has become a fashion to put the tower of a church on the corner , of which we find here as many as six examples . Now such a position we conceive to be suitable wherever that is the point chiefly exposed or most readily approached ; but it is properly an exceptional arrangement , dictated by the site or some other peculiarity . In general , the most suitable place is neither on the corner nor on the side , but midway at the end ; yet of this arrangement we find here but four examples . For reasons before suggested , in structures of ordinary dimensions we would have one tower rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest , it is most effective if made to stand out in its integrity from the main building , as is shown in No. * and if the extent or shape of the ground , or other local consideration , prescribes some deviation from this general type , with a picturesque or otherwise pleasing effect , the instance may be admired without being forthwith imitated . Because the upright ridges of a wall vertically planked and battened agree well with the general character of some designs , this feature , as we observed , has become a fashion , and like every fashion is in danger of being overdone . Let us remernber that a good thing is only good in its place . The latest passion , in certain quarters , for old architectural devices , according to the law by which , in these things as in dress , fashion travels the whole circle of change till it seizes on a relative novelty in anti nit itself . Hence we see here and there a medieval whim that has been exhumed and canonized among the idols of these times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as excess of riot . ' Let us avail ourselves of what is old and what is new , without being victims of either . Let us " prove all things , " and " hold fast that which is good . " Most of the larger churches delineated in this volume include in their plans the rooms required for the use of a congregation in other services besides public worship on the Sabbath . We have before suggested that a smaller edifice in the style of some of these , being all that is needed for a time by a new congregation , may be afterwards applied to these uses , either detached , or connected with a larger church , if the site and position are chosen with this view ; but the changes taking place in growing towns are apt to disturb such prospective arrangements . For economy , convenience , and beauty also , the other apartments wanted should be parts or appendages of the church itself . // Besides a chapel , which is now generally felt to be a necessity for evening lectures and Sunday-schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , near the pulpit , and in large con*regations a room of intermediate size for a prayer-meeting , or bible-class , which might be properly called the prayer-room , or the class-rooni . With these , wherever space can be had , there should be a waiting-room or sitting-room , such as is found in some of the English dissenting chapels both in the country and in cities , where the people who come from a distance may tarry in the intervals of the Sabbath ; which may serve also for the industrial and social gatherings that find their patron-saint in Dorcas and knit the bands of good fellowship among parishioners . And these apartments may be so connected with the main audience-room of the church , ( as in the Designs before us , and other similar arrangements , ) as to give the more effect to the whole edifice , especially in the iRomanesque and the Gothic styles , which are more favorable than the rigorous Greek orders to broken outlines and such projections as convenience may suggest .  --  but we allude to the subject here partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in a name . ' The principal room used for religious services , besides the church , we choose to call by its ancient rightful name , the ekapel ; and we go for reforming present provincial usages to the contrary . It is the proper name because it is a specific term appropriated , in old English use , to such a place rather than to any other . The place is not a vestry , ' as some of our Boston neighbors call it , which means , as the word itself shows , a minister 's robing-room , and hence by association may designate his separate apartment even when he dresses only like a gentleman . It is not a session-room , ' as it is called in many Presbyterian congregations , and still more oddly in some others ; for that should be some smaller apartment where the ruling elders most do congregate , ' whereas this is meant for the whole brotherhood . It was known in some parts of New England , when first used , as the conference-room , ' which was better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a lecture-room , ' to be sure , and so is the church itself ; but both are places for lectures of a religious character , and not only for lectures , but for worship also ; and hence should not be confounded , even in name , with the apartments so called in a College or a Lyceum . It is to be described as a place of public worship , and this is the meaning of the term chapel , which also denotes especially a smaller place of this kind adjoinino* a larger , ' and thus distinguishes it from a church . Besides being the old name , it is retained to this day in some of the principal congregations // in New England , as well as generally in the mothercountry , where indeed it is the legal term for a dissenting ' house of worship . The disnse of it , in many places , we ascribe chiefly to a wretched innovation in the thing itself  --  the employment of basenients for evening services , giving them literally an inferior place ; a fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Designs purporting to be models , and which has been before condemned in our pages as at war with health , and indeed contrary to whatsoever things in architecture are pure , lovely , or of good report . A cellar could not be constrned into a chapel ; and this is but one instance of the bearing of things on names , and of names on things . Moreover , the title we contend for has the advantage of being at once familiar and beautiful , being more frequent in the dialect of poetry than the word church . When most of the Puritans scrupled to apply the latter word to the material house of worship , because in our version of the New Testament it belongs to the assembled worshipers , a spiritual house ; ' if they had substituted for it this kindred English term , rather than meeting-house , ( which is not specific enough , ) their practice in this particular , as in others of graver moment , might have kept its ground among us to this day-though the word could not then have served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we have given reasons enough for the restoration , which may be soon brought about wherever there is a building to merit it , as it has been in some places , if pastors , in giving their public notices , ' will only take care to call things by their right names . Having spoken of belfries , we are reminded of bells , of which we have a word or two to say here , as one of the accessories of church building . With all the noise they make in the world , some of our readers may not be aware of the improvements made in them in our days , as to the composition of the metal , the adjustment of the tone to any note in the musical scale , the mode of hanging them so as to make the heaviest of them manageable , and especially the cheapness of their production . We remember several years ago some bells brought to New York , that were said to have come out of a convent in Spain , and on account of their age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one of them was hung on the City Hall , if we remember right , for trial ; but they proved to be clumsy , thick-toned affairs after all , as might have been expected . American manufacturers can do all that is wanted in this department . The name " Meneely " has come to have a Sunday vibration in one 's fancy of not in the sound , and th' establishment under that name in Troy , N. Y. , rewards a visit . // An ordinary congregation can make more noise now than they could have afforded in old times . And the more noise the better , if it is only of the right quality ; that is to say , a heavy deep-toned bell will make itself heard far and wide without Yexing the vicinity , while a light one , high-keyed as it must be , will bore the ears of the neighbors with its din which yet is lost in the distance . A stranger close at hand is scarcely startled by the sudden stroke of one of the immense alarm-bells now used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound into every nook of the suburbs . Therefore we advise a rural congregation either to go without a bell , or ( perhaps with the help of outside subscription , since it is of common interest to the town ) to put up one of weight and mark , not far from two thousand pounds at least . iNor need there be any fear for the security of the steeple , if it is built as it should be , though as often as a bell is put up some wiseacre shakes his head with the prediction that the steeple will shake also . We confess some liking for this kind of music . We listened complacently in childhood to a church bell so musical that it used to be said some silver had found its way into the sonorous metal ; ' and we have pleasant memories of Sunday mornings , when a single summons over the green fields of the country has found us in tune among the birds and leaves of summer , or when , on a bright winter day in the city , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tides of population , and we have been borne along with them to some unaccustor*ed sanctuary . The church-going bell* has its well-known place in poetry , though the phrase has been criticised . We would have chimes too , where they can be afforded , as certainly they can be now in many places . And , by the way , it would be only a becoming stroke both of liberality and taste , if some rich friend of old Yale would endow her chapel ( when she has a new one , such as she should have ) with this musical attraction . Sure we are , that many a rich man would do better with his money in that operation , than he is doing now . Yet , if this hint should be taken , we would not have our favorite psalm-tunes unpleasantly associated in the minds of the students with their " matins , " but rather , now and then , more agreeably , with " those evening bells . " Yet again , by the way , let the good old custom of casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who would lose the text from the old Independence bell in Philadelphia * We have fallen upon some that we recall with pleasure ; such as , " My tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness ; " and here and there a couplet , such as // " The living to the church I call , And to the grave I summon all . " But in this article , and in the book which occasions it , one thing has been overlooked  --  the pulpit . Yet surely this is a feature not the least necessary or conspicuous in the interior of a church , and not the most likely to be constructed properly . A person who has been religiously educated does not easily lose the associations formed with that place in early life , when perhaps he sometimes sauntered into an empty silent sanctuary because the door happened to be open , stole into the pulpit , and stood before the Bible , wondering how it would seem to face a whole congregation , or how anybody could dare to do such a thing for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and survive . In its moral aspects the pulpit has been often celebrated ; the mere name recalls Cowper 's beautiful poetical tribute ; and for the same reason it should fill a considerable place in the architectural view . If treated in all its relations , even briefly , it would alone require a whole article , which however might turn out a sermon , ' and a long one too . Indeed why should it not be sometimes a topic , as well as generally a scene , for preaching ? If it should ever be prescribed by one of the Connecticut Associations as the subject of a Conejo , we suggest the text beforehand : Neh. viii , 4 : " Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood , which they had made for the purpose . " According to one approved method , the preacher may begin with inquiring what sort of a pulpit it was , in respect to materials , form , and furniture ; observing , first , negatively , that as the text shows it was not a marble pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being wheeled round by any accommodation , ' might at once be brought to bear on one of the fashions of our times-an application especially pertinent to the city honored by that annual performance . Indeed we wonder that some of the sticklers for literal prescription have not taken a stand on that example against this innovation ; and also in favor of outdoor preaching and reading , for it seems that Ezra 's pulpit was in the street , and that it was a reading-desk too . But we can not here treat of the subject ex cathedra . Considered as that part of an edifice designed for religious worship and instruction , which is occupied by the officiating minister , pulpits exhibit as many varieties in plan , as many experiments and contrivances , and as many faults , in different places and successive times , as the buildings themselves , or as the sermons  --  or the preachers . Without going so far back as the example we have referred to , or deciding whether the Jewish scribe 's accommodations were anything // 1854 . Churc*4e8 and Par8ona*ye8. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest of the fashions that are not yet quite disused and forgotten , was what has been called the tub-pulpit , ( suggesting , or suggested by , the title of Dean Swift 's satirical Tale ; ) a bbx not more than three or four feet in diameter , generally hexagonal , supported on a single shaft , or attached to one of the piilars of the edifice , with the lightest possible staircase , and surmounted by a sounding board , * which perhaps was adorned with a dove or other emblem . When occupied by the minister , it used to be likened to a pestle and mortar , ' and sometimes the mortar treinbled under the pestle ; or , as resting on its stem , it looked like a wine-glass-without giving offense in those times . After all that has been said against it , that form was not the most inconvenient , for , if the book-board was raised high enough , the shape of the sides allowed the speaker to be fairly seen , and to use the utmost freedom of gesticulation , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet it was not large enough to accommodate a helper , ' or an agent , ' along with the pastor . Next , in many or all the old churches in New England , and in some still standing , the pulpit was what might be called an elevated pew , built up two stories , having before it , below , the deacon 's seat ' with the sacramental board , and the speaker 's stand projecting above , in the form of half a hexagon , or sometimes a half circle , the whole front adorned more or less with panels , mouldings , carved work , and often with pilasters , and so high as to allow the lower story to be a little apartment sometimes enclosing the stairs and entered by a door in front or at the end ; t of which one example is still seen in the time-honored Old South , in Boston . Then came the style of a swelled or curved front , broken into three compartments , of which the middle and foremost was the standingplace ; the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former height being still retained , and reached by a large spiral staircase on each side . Our readers will remember elegant structures of this kind 3ome of them of mahogany , richly wrought , and costing more than is sometimes expended on the whole of a small rural church4 In all these examples * For a useful hint about sounding-boards , we refer the reader to a quotation in the New Englander , voL vi , p. 6 , foot-note . It reminds us of a story that may not have been printed , yet should not be lost . A waggish clergyman on one occasion being asked if the preacher ( who was speaking under a sounding board ) was a settled minister , answered , he would be , if that thing should come down . ' f There was sometimes also a closet-door at one end , which knowing ones suggested might be for ill-behaved boys . * One honored pulpit of this type , when displaced , was sent to a church in the Sandwich Islands , where it " astonished the natives . " // the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps might be said of him metaphorically in old times , or , at least , his position has since been as obviously changed in the latter sense , yet not in all its bearings for the worse . The nearest hearers were obliged to look at him , if at all , in a constrained position , which might make them stiffnecked , if they were not so before ; and many a clergyman remembers how formidable was the ascent , under the excitement and agitation of his first trials , and what a relief he found in at length getting a seat within the doors . He was placed at such a height in order to accommodate the galleries , whereas the galleries should rather have been constructed in height and pitch , as they have been since , so as to accommodate both him and the hearers below . In this respect certainly there is great improvement . The best effect of the voice requires the speaker to be raised no higher than is necessary to let him be seen from any pew on the floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four feet ; but this can occasion no inconvenience to the nearest of the audience ; nor is there any need of gradually raising the floor as it recedes-an arrangement which came in with the inconvenient and ill-looking practice , that has already had its day , of placing the desk between the doors . Ezra 's pulpit answered this purpose , when he opened the book in the sight of all the people , for he was above all the people . ' Since this reasonable change , new varieties have appeared in the structure . There was one which might be likened in front to three large paneled doors , resting on the floor of the house , the middle one in advance , and the steps at either side hidden or defended by a sort of parapet ; * but this was stiff and heavy . It is relieved , and made even graceful in some more costly examples , by curved instead of straight lines in the form , and a richer material. - The prevailing later and better mode has been to erect a solid base or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , as the platform to place the superstructure , which is diversified in form and style as the fancy of committee-men and builders ; generally meant to be something like an altar , but sometimes resembling the tomb of Scipio , ' or other monumental devices , sometimes more like a table of the money-changers , ' or even like a soda-fountain. - Perhaps nothing is better , both as to convenience and appearance , than such a platform , railed in with a very low balustrade , and // holding a simple lecturn* or reading-desk , not a mere frame however , but solid or curtained to the floor-which suffices to shield the speaker in front , and to hold the Bible , and the mannscripts wanted ; and the more simple such a desk , the better , as long as it is convenient and does not look cheap or negligent . The most common fault in pulpit-building , as it strikes us , is the appearance of too much ado or ostentation . Indeed we would *ipply to the style of construction here , Dr. Emmon 's admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more light . ' The less there is of a pulpit , the better , if there is enough of it to answer every purpose of a pulpit . The platform , if thus exposed , must be so low as not to be generally seen ; otherwise it has a bald or giddy look ; and the low rail is no more than a decent protection to the feet and legs ; t but it is enough , and clergymen ought not to complain of being too much exposed , since in such a place it is their own fault if they do any thing that will not bear to be seen . We wish some of the artists whose Designs in church-building we have studied with interest , would turn their attention more distinctly to this matter .  --  but as to the interior of a pulpit , ministers ought always to be consulted . They know what is convenient for the uses of the place , by often proving the want of it , in many a clumsy contrivance , and sometimes the absence of all contrivance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , for the accommodation of various preachers , who , whatever may be said of ministerial parity , ' are not all of the same height ; and this may be done best by raising and lowering a light bookboard , on a shaft passing through the desk , and fastened at any point below either by a rateh et-wheel or the pressure of a thumb-screw ; the book being thus raised higher than the desk itself ; and the floor left unincumbered , as it should be , especially on an open platform . But the most common arrangement has been to raise or lower the speaker , and some times to his inconvenience or even peril . We appeal to your recollections , 0 clerical reader , if ; being shorter than the pastor you aided , you have ever mounted a pile of foot-boards only wide enough to stand on , and no two of them fitting each other , and bad to discourse thence , about fonndations4 For another example , * Spelled thus , or lectern , or lettern. j Something uf this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pulpit without even putting their over-shoes from off their feet , ' however splashed with mud , besides holding on to their hats and umbrellas as if these things were ornamental or might be stolen . They travesty too badly the first line of a beautiful hymn , " How beauteous are their feet . " Besides , is it not written , " He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man * Or , in the absence of even such a provision for a short man helping you , perhaps you have put under him a light box made for some other purpose , and // the cushion that was meant to hold the Bible or your notes , * may have been worn round arid smooth , and yonr sermon may have slipped so as to have fallen literally upon the congregation if yonr hand , just then lifted in a gesture , had not clutched it with a timely swoop . Or , once upon a time , from that same cushion , when you were standing before it in the act of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy Bible slid off and fell directly on your feet , as if the adversary had taken advantage of the time , with the weight of the sacred canon itself to assail your understanding and drive your thoughts to extremities . As to the space , light , and other arrangements required for a pulpit , ministers are the best judges ; yet some of them may covet more room , as well as richer furniture , than a judicious architect would approve in such a place . If the old hexagon was too small , certainly some of the plat forms now used are too large-herein however having a precedent in Ezra 's pulpit , which may be understood to have held more than a dozen with him " on his right hand and on his left hand . " Besides occupying unnecessary space , with the effect of rich upholstery they suggest too much of a luxurious boudoir or saloon . The reason given is the occasional accommodation of many ministers , as at installations ; which itself suggests the contrast between this time , and the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of in the arrangements of the sanctuary . We would however provide for occasional assemblages of ministers by making the floor of the communion-table higher than it is now ; which is also desirable for its own ordinary uses , as the sacramental services ought to be in full view of the congregation ; and this change would reduce the further elevation required for the floor of the pulpit . In this connection we must add one criticism on some of the most costly of our new or renovated edifices . These have put the communion-table out of sight whenever the sacrament is not to be administered , in order that the pulpit may be seen to advantage . There was never yet a pulpit that merited 8Uc1* a pre*mincncc . It is reverging the IRomish and Puseyite error , that would make the most of the altar by thrusting aside the pulpit .
