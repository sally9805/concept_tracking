ART . III . - A Treatise on the Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity . By I. RAY , M. ID . Third Edition , with Additions . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1853 . THE study of Insanity in its various phases has occupied much of the attention of the medical practitioner , and taxed the acumen of the metaphysician ; and it needs but to glance back to the time when lunacy was regarded as a special manifestation of Divine wrath , and therefore as putting the victim outside the pale of human sympathy , to satisfy us that humanity , if not science , has gained by the labor of the student and the observation of the medical man . Solitary confinement and heavy chains have been supplanted by kind treatment , and by free intercourse with companions within reasonable limits . The superstition , which among some savage tribes made the madman respected as an object half of pity , half of reverence , and among more enlightened nations caused him to be regarded as an outcast from God , has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears , is but a disease , - a disease which , like most others , may be detected by the professional eye , even when its existence is unsuspected by the many who are in constant intercourse with the sufferer , and the course of which may be checked , and its power perhaps destroyed , by treatment founded on scientific principles . We have used the term Insanity to denote collectively all abnormal conditions of the mental powers . And the fact meets us on the threshold of our investigation , that the word admits of no more precise definition than this , which includes at once the idiot and the monomaniac . It is indeed impossible to discover any common element in the condition of the sufferers under the several forms of insanity , save that their minds are in an abnormal state . Mental disease , however , may be considered under two general types , the one embracing those cases whose characteristic is an incomplete or defective development of the faculties ; the other , those which are marked by a derangement of the faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place idiocy and imbecility , both which may be congenital , or the effect of some obstacle to the development of the faculties supervening in infancy . In the second class we place all the other phases in which insanity appears . These last are commonly divided into Mania , intellectual and moral , or , as the latter form is sometimes called , affective ; and Dementia , described as being sometimes the last stage or sequel of mania , and sometimes as the result of old age . The idiot is destitute of all power of reflection , is unable to comprehend the relations of things , has no sense of propriety , no ability to reason . Nor is he better gifted morally than intellectually . He has ordinarily none of the human affections , though cases occur in which he manifests an excessive religions veneration , self-esteem , or love of approbation , and this to such a degree that the trait appears to make up his whole character . His physical development is no less strongly marked , though no particular conformation can be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost invariably too large or too small , and generally misshapen , the limbs are often crooked , and the motions shambling and awkward . The imbecile man is a grade higher in mental character than the idiot . He has some intellectual capacity , but is not able to reach the degree of mental power which belongs to the mass of men subjected to like influences with himself . He may learn to read and write , and has an idea of the proprieties of life , but is always deficient either in a just perception of the relations of things , or in the moral motives which should regulate his intercourse with his fellows . He is lacking in forethought , is easily influenced , and has no fixedness of purpose . He often exhibits the same physical deficiencies with the idiot , from whose condition his differs in degree only , being the same in kind . Mania , embracing the various forms of mental disease which are popularly called insanity , consists in a derangement of the intellect or of the moral powers . It is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease seems to affect only a single intellectual faculty , the otherwise rational person whose only unsoundness // seems to be a propensity to kill , and him whose intellect and affections are so equally disordered that it would be impossible to assign the case to any one division of mania rather than to another . We have said thus much in the way of description , not with the hope of giving information on the general subject of insanity , but for the sake of bringing up before the mind the grand divisions usually made in mental disease ; and , these things premised , we proceed to consider the legal consequences of the insanity of persons charged with the commission of crimes . With regard to the idiot , there can not for a moment be any hesitation . The total absence of understanding , the utter ignorance of right and wrong , takes away from his acts all moral character . The idea of responsibleness is inseparably connected with power to discriminate ; the law claims no right to punish those whose minds are undeveloped , whether by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of idiocy is so strongly marked , and so susceptible of proof , that there is little or no room for question to arise concerning it . We shall therefore leave the idiot out of view in what we have to say further . Though the difference of opinion among physicians as to the origin of insanity is immaterial to our present purpose , we can not refrain from suggesting that the somatic theory - that which places the seat of the disease in the brain , and not in the mind - is sometimes , at least , urged with greater zeal than discretion . For example , it is said that all enlightened physiologists admit " that the mind must of necessity be put in connection with matter , and that the brain is the part of the body by means of which this connection is effected . Little as we know beyond this fact , it is enough to warrant the inference that derangement of the structure or of the vital actions of the brain must be followed by abnormal manifestations of the mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of the cause. ** Now we do not question the statement that the brain is the connecting link between mind and matter , and it seems to be a warrantable inference from this proposition , that derange // Oct. ment , either organic or functional , of the brain , will be accompanied by abnormal manifestations of the mind . But neither logic nor courtesy to the author of the extract quoted above requires us to go further , and say that such manifestations of mind can result from no other cause . It seems reasonably probable , to say the least , that a diseased mind would give abnormal manifestations of itself ; nor is there any obstacle to our believing that such is the case , in the fact that the same symptoms sometimes proceed from an inflamed brain . But to our inquiry this matters little . Whether the wild action of a frenzied mind has been the cause or the effect of cerebral irritation , in most cases where examinations have been made of those who died insane , an unnatural condition of the brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physician in his treatment of the patient , nor to the jurist in his handing of the subject , whether the seat of the disease be in the brain , or behind it , in its motive power . The plea of insanity has come to be viewed , by many men whom we are wont to regard as discreet , in the light of a ruse , by which to enable a guilty man to avail himself of the natural disinclination of juries to convict of crimes whose punishment is death . Often , no doubt , a desire to avoid the responsibility of putting an offender to death has made shadowy evidence of mental disease strong and clear to the timid juror ; and it may be that this defence has been attempted when it was known to the parties interested that there was no foundation for it , in the hope of providing a way of escape for a jury , when the commission of the act charged was clearly shown , but there was not nerve enough in the panel to subject the criminal to capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue , from the abuse of such a line of defence , that it ought never to be admitted . Even the juror who , from a morbid sympathy with the victim of the law , evades the responsibility of his position , and compromises with his conscience by a sort of half-discharge of the duty he has sworn to perform , is not more deserving of rebuke , than the man who , in the fear that the frequent escape from punishment on the ground of insanity will cause an increase of crime , would hang the irresponsible victim of disease on the same gibbet with the murder-loving assassin . // It is to be remembered that , in the vindication of the laws , the state does not aim at vengeance . It is not on the principle of " an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , " that punishment is meted out . The object sought is merely security for the citizens in person and property ; and the penalties attached to the perpetration of crime are designed as a terror to evildoers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law may stand unquestioned and unabated , it is necessary that it lay a firm grasp on those who properly come under its condemnation , and that it freely and fairly acquit those who are in no just sense amenable . An indiscriminate punishment of all who should be charged with crime , without inquiring into their guilt or innocence , would be tyranny , and would as surely bring the laws and their ministers into disgrace and contempt , as it would to allow every variety of crime to stalk the streets unchecked . And though the effect is less strongly marked and less widely conspicuous , it is of the same evil nature , when a mistaken philanthropy or a false sympathy makes the conviction of the acknowledged criminal a matter of difficulty , and his punishment , when convicted , a more uncertain matter still . The severity of punishment is of less importance in the prevention of crime than the certainty that it will ensue . If it could be an unfailing effect , sure to succeed its cause , there would be comparatively little occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as good citizens , or prudent friends of humanity , we should exert ourselves to save the felon from the penalty attached to his crime . Even when the punishment seems somewhat disproportioned to the offence , it is wiser to find the remedy in a change of the law , than to encourage evil by making the law a dead letter . Common sense , however , tells us at once that he who commits an act prohibited either by natural law or the law of the land , while bereft of power to judge of the quality of actions , ought not to be accounted guilty . And this in general terms has been recognized as a principle of jurisprudence for a long period . Formerly , however , there was but an indistinct notion among judges , as well as physicians , of the nature and characteristics of insanity . With nothing better to guide // Oct. them than the crude opinions then prevalent among the medical faculty , jurists laid down as law what is far behind the more enlightened judgment of the present time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compotes mentis into four classes - " 1 . An idiot who , from his nativity , by a perpetual infirmity , is non compos. 2 . He that , by sickness , grief ; or other accident , wholly loseth his memory and understanding . 3 . A lunatic that hath sometimes his understanding and sometimes not , aliquando gaudet lucid1* intervallis ; and therefore he is called non compos mentis so long as he hath not understanding . 4 . He that , by his own vicious act , for a time depriveth himself of his memory and understanding , as he that is drunken . " Accordingly , we find it pronounced , that one charged with an offence must appear to have been deprived , at the time of doing the act , of all memory and understanding , if he would be excused on the ground of insanity . And Lord Hale says : " Such a person as , laboring under melancholy distempers , hath yet ordinarily as great understanding as ordinarily a child of fourteen years hath , is such a person as may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to distinguish right from wrong has been given by judges as the test of criminal responsibility ; and this was recognized as correct in the trial of Arnold , in 1723 , as well as by Lord Mansfield , in Bellingham 's case , in 1812 , and is given by Sir William 0 . Russell as the law , in his work on Crimes and Misdemeanors . Now to a person familiar with the manifestations of insanity , Lord Coke 's definition is simply absurd . Rarely , if ever , has a case appeared in which there was a total loss of memory and understanding ; or , if at all , it must have been some tretne instance of dementia , following as a sequel upon longcontinued and severe mania , when the powers of mind had , as it were , burned down and burned out . Nor is Lord Hale at all nearer a correct idea of the nature of the disease , when he ascribes freedom from responsibility to those only whose understanding is less than that of a child of fourteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distortion , though a metaphor is likely to mislead , and it is safer to call it an abnormal manifestation of the mind . It relates not to the ca // pacity or power of the mind , and may attack the mightiest as well as the common intellect . Indeed , it would seem , from the instances of shrewdness and deliberate preparation for any scheme which the patient may have conceived , as if the wards of the insane asylum had gathered their inmates from among the keenest men and those most fertile in expedients . Nor yet is it safe to take the power to distinguish between right and wrong , in a general sense , as a criterion by which to frame a decision . Many an insane patient will discourse with accuracy on the baseness of ingratitude and the awful nature of crime , - and this , it may be , while he is meditating the accomplishment of some violent act , which in a sane man would be a heinous offence . Mr. Erskine , in his celebrated speech in defence of Hadfield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of delusion a sufficient excuse for committing a deed which in a sane man would be a crime , and showed conclusively the insufficiency of the rule laid down by Lord Coke . So powerful was his eloquence , and so clear his argument , that the judges on that occasion swerved from the strictness of their previous decisions , and in the opinion then expressed coincided with that of the distinguished advocate of the accused . This was the first instance , of which we have any record , wherein the English courts showed an approach , even , to a correct apprehension of the nature of insanity ; and , as we have seen , they fell back from this ground in the trial of Bellingham , in 1812 . But if we take the word delusion as meaning that the person to whom it is applied is the victim of false perceptions of the senses , the position of Mr. Erskine was not perfectly accurate ; for it often happens that a person sees incorrectly , - seems , that is , to see objects which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties clear from the deception . Ben Jonson , for example , used to spend the night in watching the battles of Turks and Christians about his great toe , and was yet able to reason himself into the belief that this sight was a delusion , He , therefore , was in no sense insane . Such an experience may well enough have given rise to the answer of some one to the question whether he believed in ghosts , - 29 // " No , I have seen too many of them ! " The delusions , in order to free the victim from responsibility to the law , must be acted on by him as realities . His mind must believe in the existence of what he sees . The difficulty in the whole matter arises , in great measure , from the impossibility of defining insanity more exactly than we have defined it above . The state of the mind , or of the organ by which the mind manifests itself , can not be described , or even known , except by the mental manifestations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions , the nature of the case precluding the possibility of our examining into the substance of the mind itself or of the brain . We can not , therefore , reason a priori , from the observed state of the mind or of the brain , to the mental manifestations which will ensue in the conduct of the patient . Our inference is of the cause from the presence of the effect . If , therefore , we suppose ourselves in possession of complete information as to the mental manifestations of an insane person in a given instance , we can not therefrom state the precise condition of the mental principle , or of the brain , in that person , nor tell how that condition differs from the state of mind or brain in another person , whose insanity shows itself in a somewhat different form . Nor , on the other hand , if we suppose ourselves perfectly acquainted with the condition of a given brain , as by means of a post mortem examination , can we state with any certainty what were the peculiar mental abnormities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insanity , for example , was intellectual or moral , whether partial or general . Physiologists tell us that the brain is not divided into compartments , each the moving power of a single faculty , but acts as a whole , its power and vigor being indicated by the convolutions of the substance of the brain . Nor are we taught to regard the mind as a bundle , or association of powers , working together , yet independent of one another . The mind is a unit possessed of certain attributes which we call faculties , but which are in no sense separate existences . It follows , therefore , that whether the seat of insanity be in the brain or in the mind itself , it is impossible , with our limited knowledge , to fix any bound to the extent of the disease // in a given case . In all the treatises on insanity , there is a degree of vagueness and generality in describing its symptoms and manifestations . And though it is divided into several classes , we find these divisions of mania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly going too far to say , that they are arbitrary , and have little scientific foundation . The partial intellectual mania differs from the general merely in that the aberration of mind has manifested itself , so far as observed , in a particular direction only ; and no practitioner would dare to say that it might not appear to-morrow in an entirely new phase , or , if this should occur , that a new condition of either mind or brain had supervened . We find , too , that the intellectual mania and the moral frequently appear at the same time in the same patient . It would be rash , to say the least of it , for a physician to predict that the intellectual maniac of to-day will not show symptoms of moral mania tomorrow ; and certainly no less rash to declare that such a manifestation , when made , showed a change in the state of the mind or brain . However proper , then , it may be to divide mania into several classes , so far as to indicate that in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in other cases in certain other ways only , it seems hardly warrantable to infer from this fact that there is a materially different state of mind or brain attendant on these several phases of the disease ; for we find that the manifestations laid down as peculiar to the several classes are often coincident in the same case , and frequently alternate with one other , without any discoverable cause for a change in the character of the disease itself , and without the concurrence of any circumstances authorizing a belief in an alteration in the disease , unless such alteration may be inferred from the change of manifestation itself . Certainly , this change of manifestation is no better ground for supposing an alteration of the disease , than we find in the different moods of an insane man who is sometimes calm , tractable , and gentle , and at others wild and unmanageable , or than we find in the alternations of high fever and prostration in the sufferer under various forms of inflammatory disease . Especially is this clear when we consider that insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before its existence is suspected , exhibiting itself only in what are regarded by his friends as mere eccentricities , till at last some decided outbreak of the disease shows beyond question to what cause the strange conduct of the man is attributable . Then , too , a multitude of instances ari*e , forming , so to speak , the debatable ground between sanity and insanity , wherein it is a matter of difficulty for the most skilful practitioners to determine whether the person in question is insane or not ; and'these are the cases in which the law is most frequently brought into requisition . In these cases , surely , if it is decided that insanity exists , it is folly to say that the man is but little insane , but half mad , because the disease has shown itself only in acts calling for careful scrutiny in order to ascertain their true character . Hoxvever difficult the dividing line between sanity and insanity may be to find in given cases , it is still certain that the states separated by that line are the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one state or the other . If , then , we have so few indications of the disease that its presence is difficult of detection , it is decidedly unsafe to assign a limit to a malady of whose character we have so slight opportunity to judge . And in this connection it should be remembered that the insane are often wonderfully adroit in concealing the symptoms and characteristics of their disease . Whether from a feeling that they are different from other men , or from the idea that the restraint put upon them is owing to the exhibition of these characteristics , their whole ingenuity seems turned towards hiding what they believe to be the cause of their being confined or watched ; and their success is so great , that in some instances they have baffled the scrutiny of the keenest minds . Behind all this is the fact , that the cases which have come under scientific treatment fall far short of the whole number ; and even these , of necessity , have gone unwatched during a large part of the time . Everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hazardous to draw strict lines between the different classes of mania , or to name the portion of the powers over which each branch extends . And until investigation has discovered // that each of the classes into which the disease is ordinarily divided is governed by fixed laws , which are never infringed , and which the discoverer has been able to reduce to language , - so that , a case being given , with its manifestations so far as hitherto observed , its future can be foretold and demonstrated , - we may assume that mania is one disease , and that the branches into which it is classified are merely a convenient arrangement of phenomena , presupposing and asserting no law and no distinct character . As well might we predict the course of a ship at sea , without rudder , spar , or canvas , and undertake to foretell the moment and direction of every lurch and plunge . And if it be objected here , that the occurrence of phenomena so utterly unlike as the manifestations of intellectual and of moral mania presupposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is incumbent on us to account for the multiform effect of a single cause , or to retire from the position we have taken , our answer is this : The sane mind presents an almost infinite variety of manifestations , and the experience of every one teaches him that the same combination of circumstances affects no two minds in precisely the same way . Though absolutely alike in essence , the minds have an inherent difference of some kind , - for want of a better name we call it a difference of attribute , - which causes the variety of feeling . The musical composition , to hear which will melt one lover of harmony to tears , will fill another with a wild glee , and soothe a third to sleep . But the sounds are the same in each instance , the acting cause is one . Now why this is , why there is such a variety of effect from a single cause , it is no part of our plan here to inquire . We are certain that the variety comes from something inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond this , human knowledge can not penetrate . It requires , however , no stretch of imagination , and does no violence to the law of probability , to believe that the variety in abnormal manifestations of the mind equally proceeds from something inherent in the mind , rather than from a variety in the causes of mental abnormities . We would not be thought to disparage physicians , or to detract from their merit , in the argument we are urging . We would not seem to say , that their investigations into the na // ture of insanity have resulted in nothing , or in little . What we know of the disease is mainly due to their industry and skill . The wide difference between its treatment now and in past times , and the frequency of its cure by the treatment now pursued , would be answer sufficient to any such imputation from any source . But no one is more ready than the intelligent physician himself to acknowledge that his profession is full of uncertainty ; nor need we go further , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the fact already alluded to , that there are two opposing theories as to the seat of the disease , both which are supported by learned and patient students . We mean only to say , that in the present state of investigation , which is yet in its infancy , there is not sufficient evidence of a radical difference in the branches of mania , as it is ordinarily divided , to override the inference to be drawn from the oneness of the mind and the oneness of the brain ; and so long as this continues to be the case , the law , in its treatment of supposed offenders , should recognize but one dividing line , the line between sanity and insanity . We are aware that this is not precisely the view of the law taken by courts of the highest authority , and of confessedly profound and extensive learning . Chief Justice Shaw , of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts , for example , laid down a rule in the case of Rogers , indicted for killing the warden of the State prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken . He says : - " A. man is not to be excused from responsibility , if he has capacity and reason sufficient to enable him to distinguish between right and wrong , as to the particular act he is then doing ; a knowledge and consciousness that the act he is doing is wrong and criminal , and will subject him to punishment . In order to be responsible , he must have sufficient power of memory to recollect the relation in which he stands to others , and in which others stand to him ; that the act he is doing is contrary to the plain dictates of justice and right , injurious to others , and a violation of the dictates of duty . " On the contrary , though he may be laboring under partial insanity , if he still understands the nature and character of his act , and its consequences , - if he has a knowledge that it is wrong and criminal , and // mental power sufficient to apply that knowledge to his own case , and to know that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receive punishment , - such partial insanity is not sufficient to exempt him from responsibility for criminal acts . " 1f then , it is proved , to the satisfaction of the jury , that the mind of the accused was in a diseased and unsound state , the question will be , whether the disease existed to so high a degree , that , for the time being , it overwhelmed the reason , conscience , and judgment , and whether the prisoner , in committing the homicide , acted from an irresistible and uncontrollabfe impulse . If so , then the act was not the act of a voluntary agent , but the involuntary act of the body , without the concurrence of a mind directing it . " Now , without stopping to comment on the inaccuracy of calling the act of an insane man " the involuntary act of the body , " when we know , from almost daily observation , that these acts are often the consummation of plans laid and pursued with wonderful sagacity and art , we see that the distinguished judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release from responsibility . And yet , in the same charge to the jury from which we have just quoted , he says that the state of delusion may indicate to an experienced person , " that the mind is in a diseased state ; that the known tendency of that diseased state of the mind is to break out into sudden paroxysms of violence ; so that , although there were no previous indications of violence , yet the subsequent act , connecting itself with the previous symptoms and indications , will enable an experienced person to say that the act was the result of the disease. ** Now this is all that we contend for ; and until it can be shown that there are distinct forms of insanity , some of which never manifest themselves in violence , it would seem that the doctrine of the passage just quoted should make it imperative on every judge to order an acquittal of the prisoner whenever the jury are satisfied of the existence of insanity . For if all the forms of mania have been known to result in acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent act sometimes to the disease , and sometimes to the wickedness of the accused ? Such an inconsistency in the adminisfration of justice leaves the lives of men at the mercy of the obtuseness // and obstinacy of juries , or to the candor of a professional man who has a favorite theory to support . Nor is it an objection to this position , that crafty criminals will find it easy to simulate insanity of some sort , and may by this means go free , though the phase of the disease assumed be the remotest possible from all connection with the act done . To say nothing of the general principle , that the possibility of its abuse is no argument against the adoption of a just rule , we have the fact that it is a. matter of extreme difficulty to simulate the disease so well as to deceive one experienced in observing its peculiarities . So difficult is it , that we may regard it as impossible for the pretended condition of mind to be successfully maintained in any case , if brought under the observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of deception , if any there be , might easily be guarded against by the adoption of suitable regulations for bringing the supposed offenders under the superintendence of men skilled in insanity , whenever there is difficulty in determining whether the disease exists or not . It remains for us now to consider the nature and sources of the evidence which is admitted in courts on the inquiry as to the sanity or insanity of persons charged with crimes . In the trial of ordinary issues , as every one knows , witnesses are allowed to testify to facts only , leaving the inferences from those facts to be drawn by the jury . Opinions formed from the knowledge of facts , however correctly and justly , can not be offered by the witness . For example , if the question be whether a party to a suit has paid an account , the witness may not say that he believes , from circumstances which came within his observation , that the account is paid . He must confine his testimony to the facts which he knows , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show payment . There are , however , many subjects which lie beyond the experience of men in general , and about which they are unqualified , without assistance , to form judicious opinions . Such are questions as to the proper management of particular branches of business , requiring peculiar experience and skill , - as , for instance , the management of a ship at sea . Such , too , are all questions of science , which are understood // only by those whose attention has been specially devoted to the subject . Where a person dies suddenly , a jury would be unable to say whether the death was caused by poison or by some disease of a vital organ , unless aided in forming their opinion by a medical man . In all cases of this description , where a peculiar experience or extraordinary acqtraintance with a particular branch of knowledge is requisite to arriving at an intelligent answer to the question raised , the law recognizes the propriety of admitting the opinions of those who are skilled in the matter , - experts , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evidence . And the question of sanity or insanity comes within this rule . As we have seen , physicians only - and , we might add , comparatively few physicians - have such experience and skill in this subject as to fit them to express an opinion in difficult cases . In a delicate matter , requiring for its full apprehension an intimate acquaintance with the action of the sane mind , and careful and extensive study of the operations and manifestations of the mind when diseased , it is clear that the ordinary physician is little better qualified to express an opinion than any other sensible and educated person . It has been the practice , however , to receive the opinions of all physicians whose testimony may be offered , and often , no doubt , to the injury of the party on trial . It is too often the case , that medical witnesses think more carefully of themselves than of the man about whom they testify . They may have a theory of their own to support , and the opportunity is too precious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally against the positions they assume . It may be , and often is the case , that the examination turns in a direction which they did not anticipate , and they answer questions at random or by guess , rather than confess their inability to reply with accuracy , - thus , to save a reputation , hazarding a life . Indeed , nothing is more common , in the examination of medical witnesses , than to see the weight of testimony destroyed , even when correct in the main , by this over-anxiety of the witness to seem to know everything connected with a subject , in the details of which the examining counsel , by preparation for the emergency , is enabled to catch // Oct. him tripping ; and so the reputation is damaged by the effort to protect it , at the same time that justice may be cheated of its due . There is another difficulty in the way of arriving at the truth . In most cases the opinion of the medical witness is founded entirely on the facts narrated by the acquaintance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come in contact with him near the time when the supposed offence was committed . From what has been already said , it is plain that the more obvious symptoms of insanity only are apt to be observed by those who have no familiarity with the subject , and are not watching for indications of the disease ; so that evidence as to the conduct and appearance of the accused , we may reasonably suppose , is in most instances very different from what would be given by a professional observer of the same acts and manifestations . Many things which the superintendent of an asylum would note as important , would pass unregarded by the casual observer ; and many things which the casual observer would ascribe to temporary passion , the professional man might find to be conclusive proof of a diseased state of mind . The very tendency which we all have to refer every act to a cause , would induce the unprofessional observer to regard particular acts as ebullitions of momentary feeling , merely because he had nothing else to refer them to ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness . And who can tell what coloring this reference to passion , already made by the witness , may give to his account of the act and the circumstances attending it ? True , there are many cases in which the indications of the diseased state of mind are so clear , that there is little danger of error . But the number is by no means small , in which the truth can be reached only by laborious and critical investigation . It would therefore seem that the ends of justice would be more efficiently served , if the supposed subject of the disease could be placed under the care of some physician or physicians competent to form a correct opinion as to his state of mind , for a period of some duration previous to the trial . Then there could be little or no danger that pretended insanity would save the guilty from punishment , or that the unhappy victim // of disease would suffer for an act done while under the prevailing influence of that disease . The law would be vindicated whenever it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law would be saved from doing injustice to the innocent . A practice somewhat of this description has obtained in France . As trials are now conducted in this country , a terrible responsibility is laid on medical witnesses called to testify as to the sanity of persons whom they have never seen before ; and , founding whatever conclusions they reach on such unsatisfactory evidence as we have above described , they pronounce an opinion with less opportunity for an accurate diagnosis than they would demand before writing a common prescription . It becomes them , therefore , to be modest in asserting the correctness of the re*ult of their inquiry , unless they are certain of having mastered the subject in their previous study . They are introduced as the only men qualified to settle the question raised . The jury have a right to be guided by the decision which they shall give , and xviii not be slow to avail themselves of the opportunity to thrust the responsibility off their own shoulders . How important , then , both to the state and to the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of all duty must he be who assumes to settle the question , while conscious that he is not rich in that experience and observation which alone can entitle his solution of the problem to respect !
