Here , too , education first assumed the form and name of a science , and the art of teaching and training children was first taught systematically in seminaries established for this special purpose . But not to Germany , or to any one people or any civil authority any where , but to the Christian Church , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather the parochial school , for the elementary education of the poor , which was the earliest form which this mighty element of modern society assumed . After the third century of the Christian era , whenever a Christian church was planted , or religious institutions established , there it was the aim of the higher ecclesiastical authorities to found , in some form , a school for the nurture of children and youth for the service of religion and duties of society . Passing by the ecclesiastical and catechetical schools , we find , as early as 529 , the council of Vaison strongly recommending the establishment of village schools . In 800 a synod at Mayence ordered that the parochial priests should have * Mr. W. E. Hickson , in his valuable pamphlet , entitled " Dutch and German School* , " published in London in 1840 , well says : " We must bear in mind that the German states , although under different governments , are not nations as distinct from , and independent of each other , as France and Spain , or as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is influenced more or less by every other ; the whole lying in close juxta-position , and being linked together by the bond of a common language and literature . The boundary line that separates Prussia from Hesse on one side , or from Saxony on another , is not more denned than that of a county or parish in England . A stone in a field , or a post painted with stripes , in a public road , informs the traveler that he is passing from one state into another , that these territorial divisions make no change in the great characteristics of the people : whatever the name of the state , or the color of the stripes , the people , with merely provincial differences , are the same : from the Baltic to the Adriatic , they are still Germans .

Let them receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through charity may voluntarily offer . " A council at Rome , in 836 , under Eugene II. , ordained that there should be three kinds of schools established throughout Christendom ; episcopal , parochial in towns and villages , and others wherever there could be found place and opportunity . In 836 , Lothaire I. promulgated a decree to establish eight public schools in some of the principal cities of- Italy . ' ; in order that opportunity may be given to all , and that there may be no excuse drawn from poverty and the difficulty of repairing to remote places . " The third council of Lateran. in 1179 , says : " Since the Church of God , as a pious mother , is bound to provide that opportunity for learning should not be withdrawn from the poor , who are without help from patrimonial riches , be it ordained , that in every cathedral there should be a master to teach both clerks and poor scholars gratis .

" * Such was the origin of the popular school , as now generally understood everywhere the offspring , and companion of the Church ; sharing with her , in large measure , the imperfections which attach to all new institutions and all human instrumentalities ; encountering peculiar difficulties from the barbarism of the age and people through which it passed , and which it was its mission to enlighten ; and every where crippled by insufficient endowments , unqualified teachers , and the absence of all text books , and necessary aids to instruction and illustration .

HISTORY OF PRIMARY EDUCATION IN GERMANY . ig from religious to educational purposes . all these causes , combined with the general progress of society , co-operated to introduce an advantageous change in the organization , administration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress actually made from year to year , and century even to century , was slow , and after three hundred years of effort , there is much yet to be done even in those states and communities which have accomplished the most toward improving the outward organization and instrumentalities of the schools , and above all its internal life in the improved qualification and position of the teachers for as is the teacher , so is the school . A brief reference to a few of the more prominent names in the history of popular education in Germany , and through Germany , of Modern Europe , is all that can be attempted at this time and in this connection . Among these names stands prominent that of Martin Luther . In a letter to the Elector of Saxony , in the year 1526 , Luther says : * " Since we are all required , and especially the magistrates , above all other things , to educate the youth who are born and are growing up among us , and to train them up in the fear of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have schools and preachers and pastors . If the parents will not reform , they must go their way to ruin , but if the young are neglected , and left without education , it is the fault of the state ; and the effect will be that the country will swarm with vile and lawless people , so that our safety , no less than the command of God requireth us to foresee and ward off the evil . " He maintains in that letter that the government , " as the natural guardian of all the young , " has the right to compel the people to support schools . " What is necessary to the well-being of a state , that should be supplied by those who enjoy the privilege of such state . Now nothing is more necessary than the training of those who are to come after us and bear rule . If the people are too poor to pay the expense , and are already burdened with taxes , then the monastic funds , which were originally given for such purposes , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The cloisters were abandoned in many cases , and the difficult question , what was to be done with their funds , Luther settled in this judicious manner . How nearly did he approach to the policy now so extensively adopted in this country , of supporting schools partly by taxation and partly by funds appropriated for that purpose . In 1524 he wrote a remarkable production , entitled " An Address to the Common Councils of all the Cities of Germany in behalf of Christian Schools , " from which a few passages may here be extracted . After some introductory remarks , he comes directly to his point , and says to his countrymen collectively /z/ " I entreat you , in God 's behalf and that of the poor youth , not to think so lightly of this matter as many do . It is a grave and serious thing , affecting the interest of the kingdom of Chris.t , and of all the world , that we apply ourselves to the work of aiding and instructing the young If so much be expended every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless other things of the sort for the safety and prosperity of a city ; why should not we expend as much for the benefit of the poor , ignorant youth , to provide them with skillful teachers 1 God hath verily visited us Germans in mercy and given us a truly golden year . For we now have accomplished and learned young men , adorned with a knowledge of literature and art , who could be of great service if employed to teach the young . . . . Even if the parents were qualified , and were also inclined to teach , they have so much else to do in their business and household affairs that they can not find the time to educate their children . Thus there is a necessity that public teach , - /z/ ers be provided . Otherwise each one would have to teach his own children , which would be for the common people too great a burden . Many a fine boy would be neglected on account of poverty ; and many an orphan would suffer from the negligence of guardians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al all about the whole matter . Therefore it becometh rulers and magistrates to use the greatest care and diligence in respect to the education of the young . The diligent and pious teacher who properly instructeth and traineth the young , can never be fully rewarded with money . If I were to leave my office as preacher , I would next chose that of schoolmaster , or teacher of boys ; for I know that , next to preaching , this is the greatest , best , and most useful vocation ; and I am not quite sure which of the two is the belter ; for it is hard to reform old sinners , with whom the preacher has to do , while the young tree can be made to bend without breaking . " In 1527. a visitation was made of the churches and schools of the electorate of Saxony , in which more than thirty men were employed a whole year . The result in respect to education was , that the - Saxon school system , " as it was called , was drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus the foundation was laid for the magnificent organization of schools to which Germany owes so much of her present fame . In a letter to Margrave George , of Bradenburg , July 18 , 1529 : " I will tell you what Melancthon and myself , upon mature consideration , think best to be done . First , we think the cloisters and foundations may continue to stand till their inmates die out Secondly , it would be exceedingly well to establish in one or two places in the principality a learned school , in which shall be taught , not only the Holy Scriptures , but law , and all the arts , from whence preachers , pastors , clerks , counselors , &c.,; may be taken for the whole principality . To this object should the income of the cloisters and other religious foundations be applied , so as to give an honorable support to learned men ; two in theology , two in law , one in medicine , one in mathematics , and four or five for grammar , logic , rhetoric , &rc; Thirdly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children should be established , from which those who are adapted to higher studies might be taken and trained up for the public . " Under these instructions and appeals a school law was adopted in Wirtemberg in 1559 , and modified in 1565 ; in Saxony in 1560. and improved in 1580 ; in Hesse in 1565 ; and in Brandenberg , still earlier ; which recognized and provided for the classification , inspection , and support of public schools on substantially the same plan which prevails to this day throughout Germany . The pedagogical work of Luther his labors to improve the method of instruction were continued by Trotzendorf , * in Goldberg , from 1530 to 1556 ; by Sturm , in Strasbourg , from 1550 to 1589 ; by Neander. in Ilefeld. fiom 1570 to 1595 , whose schools were all Normal Schools , in the original acceptation of the term , pattern or model schools , of their time . They were succeeded by Wolfgang Ratich , born at Wilster , in Holstein , in 1571 ; by Christopher Helwig , born near Frankfort , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Moravia , in 1592 ; who all labored , by their writings , and by organizing schools and courses of instruction , to disseminate improved methods of teaching . Comenius was invited by an act of parliament in 1631 , to visit England for the purpose of intro /z/ ducing his method into the public institutions of that country . But internal commotions interrupted and ultimately defeated his plans . In 1618 , the religious war known as the TJiirty Years ' war broke out in Germany , and for an entire generation swept over the land , wasting harvest fields , destroying cities , tearing fathers from the protection ot their families , scattering teachers and schools , and arresting the progress of all spiritual and educational improvement . At the close of the war , and in some of the smaller states during its progress , the civil government began to take effectual steps to secure the attendance of children at school , by making it compulsory on parents , on penalty of fine and imprisonment for neglect , to send them during a certain age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Heildesheim , in 1663 ; and in Prussia , in 1669 ; and Calemberg , in 1681 . About this period , two men appeared . Philip J. Spener. born in the Alsace in 1635 , and Augustus Herman Franke , born at Litbeck in 1663 ; who , the first by the invention of the catechetic method , and the last , a pupil of the former , by the foundation of the orphan-house at Halle in 1696 , were destined to introduce a new era in the history of education in Germany . The history of the orphan-house at Halle , is a beautiful illustration of practical Christian charity , and the ever-ext ending results of educational labor . While pastor of Glaucha , a suburb of nalle , he was in the habit of distributing bread to the poor , with whose poverty and ignorance he was equally distressed . To relieve at once their physical and spiritual destitution , he invited old and young into his house , and while he distributed alms , he at the same time gave oral and catechetical instruction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' children still more , he took a few into his family in 1694 , and to avail himself of the gifts of the charitable , he resorted to the following expedient , according to his biographer , Dr. Guerike : " He caused a box to be fastened up in the parlor of the parsonage-house , and wrote over it , ' Whoso hath this world 's goods , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him V ( 1 John iii . 17 , ) and underneath , ' Every one according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly or of necessity ; for God loveth a cheerful giver , ' ( 2 Cor. ix . 17 . ) This box , which was destined for the reception of the casual gifts of those who visited Franke , was fixed up at the commencement of 1695 ; and not in vain . The passage ( 2 Cor. tx. 8 , ) had fallen in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now occurred the incident related in his letter to Schade . ' This , ' says he , ' served to show me , how God is able to make us abound in every good work . ' ' After the poor's-box had been fixed up in my dwelling about a quarter of a year , ' relates Franke , ' a certain person put , at one time , four dollars and sixteen groschen into it . On taking this sum into my hand , I exclaimed with great liberty of faith , This is a considerable sum , with which something really good must be accomplished ; I will commence a school with it for the poor . Without conferring , therefore , with flesh and blood , and acting under the impulse of faith , I made arrangement for the purchase of books to the amount of two dollars , and engaged a poor student to instruct the poor children fora couple of hours daily , promising to give him six groschen weekly for so doing , in the hope that God would meanwhile grant more ; since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in eight weeks . ' Franke , who was ready to offer up whatever he had to the service of his neighbor , fixed upon the ante-chamber of his study , for the school-room of the /z/ poor children , who began regularly to receive instruction at Easter , 1695 . In this school-room , he caused a second box to be fixed up , with the inscription , ' For the expenses of the instruction of the children , needful books , ficc. , ' and underneath , ' He that hath pity upon the poor , lendeth to the Lord ; and that which he hath given , will he pay him again , ' ( Prov. xix. 17 . ) At Whitsuntide , Franke was visited by some friends , who were much pleased at his efforts in behalf of the poor , to which they contributed a few dollars . Others also gave small donations , from time to time , to the school-box . Soon after Whitsuntide , when some of the townspeople saw how regularly the children of the poor received instruction , they became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and offered to pay him weekly a groschen for each child ; so that the teacher now received sixteen groschen weekly for a five-hours ' daily instruction . The number of his scholars , that summer , amounted to between fifty and sixty , of which the poor , besides gratuitous instruction , also received alms , twice or thrice a-week , to incite them to attend school the more willingly . Donations in money , and linen , for shirts for the poor children , began now to arrive fiom other places . About Whitsuntide of the same year , Franke laid also the first foundation for what was subsequently called the royal school . The widow of a nobleman desired him to send her a domestic luior for her own , and one of her friend 's children . He found no one who was sufficiently far advanced in his studies , and therefore proposed to the parents , to send their children to Halle , and that he would then provide for their education , by able teachers and guardians . The parents agreed to this plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youths were sent , and thus originated the seminary above mentioned , which , in 1709 , consisted of an inspector , twenty-three teachers , and seventytwo scholars ; and in 1711 , by means of Franke 's exertions , had a building appropriated exclusively to it . In the summer of the same year , 1695 , Franke unexpectedly and unsolicitedly received a very considerable contribution ; for a person of rank wrote to him with the offer of five hundred dollars , for the purpose of distribution among the poor , and especially among the indigent students . This money was shortly afterward paid over to him . He then selected twenty poor students , whom he assisted with a weekly donation of four , eight , or twelve groschen ; ' and this , ' says he , ' was in reality the origin of the poor students ' participating to the present hour , in the benefits of the orphan-house/ In the autumn there was no longer sufficient room in the parsonage for the increasing number of scholars ; he therefore hired a school-room of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the winter . He then divided the scholars into two classes , and provided a separate teacher for the children of the townspeople , and another for the children of the poor . Each teacher gave four hours instruction daily , and received a guilder weekly , besides lodging and firing gratis . But Franke was soon made to see , that many a hopeful child was deprived , when out of school , of all the benefit he received in it . The idea therefore occurred to him , in the autumn of 1695 , to undertake the entire charge and education of a limited . number of children ; ' and this . ' says he . ' was the first incitement I felt , and the first idea of the erection of an orphan-house , even before I possessed the smallest funds for the purpose . On mentioning this plan to some of my friends , a pious individual felt induced to fund the sum of five hundred dollars for that purpose , twenty-five dollars for the interest on which were to be paid over every Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this instance of the divine bounty , I wished to seek out some poor orphan child , who might be supported by the yearly interest . On this , lour fatherless and motherless children , all of the same family , were brought to me . I ventured , in confidence upon God , to receive the whole four ; but as one of them was taken by some other good people , only three were left ; but a fourth soon appeared in the place of the one that had been taken . I took therefore these four ; placed them with religious people , and gave them weekly half a dollar for the bringing up of each . On this , it happened to me , as is generally the case , that when we venture to give a groschen to the poor in faith , we feel afterward no hesitation in venturing a dollar upon the same principle . For after having once begun in God 's name , to receive a few poor orphans without tny human prospect of certain assistance , ( for the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed and clothe a single one . ) I boldly left it to the Lord to make up lor whatever might be deficient . Hence the orphan-house was by no means commenced and founded upon any certain sum in hand , or on the assurances of persons of rank lo take upon themselves the cost and charges , or upon any thing of a similar nature , as was subsequently reported , and as some were inclined to suppose ; but solely and simply in reliance on the living God in heaven . ' The day after I had undertaken the charge of the four orphans above-mentioned , two more were added ; the next day , another ; two days afterward , a fourth , and one more after the lapse of a week . So that , on the 16th November , 1695 , there were already nine , who were placed with pious people . ' He fixed upon George Henry Neubauer , a student of divinity , to have the oversight of their education and their bringing up . ' Meanwhile , ' continues he , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to do abundantly above what we can ask or think , came so powerfully to my aid , that foolish reason could never have expected it . For he moved the hearts of those persons of rank , who had given me the five hundred dollars already mentioned , to present me with an additional sum of a thousand dollars in the beginning of the winter . And in the midtlle of the winter , another person of rank was incited to send me three hundred dollars to enable me to continue my attention to the poor . Another individual gave a hundred dollars , and others gave donations of smaller sums . ' Franke had hitherto distributed the money destined for the poor students weekly ; but in 1696 , the idea occurred to him , instead of a weekly allowance , to give them dinner gratuitously ; ' in the firm confidence in God . that he would from time to time send such supplies , as to enable this arrangement to be continued . ' By this he expected to be of greater service to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become better acquainted with them , and possess a better insight into their life and conduct ; and lastly , restrain the applications of the less needy , ' who would gladly have been more delicately fed . ' Two open tables were therefore provided each for twelve poor students ; and that one thing might assist the other , he selected the teachers of the charity-school from them . This was the origin of the teachers ' seminary , which afterward gradually arose out of it . The schools of the children of the townspeople who paid a certain sum for their instruction , though inadequate to the expense , were separated from the school for the poor , at the request of the townspeople themselves ; and in September . 1697 , another school was added for those tradesmen 's children who were instructed in the elements of superior science . About this time also , more classes were required in the orphan school , on account of the increased number of the pupils . The boys and girls received separate instruction , and when any of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and instructed in languages and the sciences by particular teachers . In May , 1699 , Franke united this class of , the orphan children with the class of the tradesmen 's children , who likewise received superior instruction . These arrangements for imparting a more learned education , show us the rudiments from whence the Latin school or Gymnasium afterward developed itself in Franke 's institutions , which in 1709 was attended by two hundred and fifty-six children , of whom sixty-four were orphans , divided into seven classes ; and in 1730 , by more than " five hundred pupils . ' At the time of his death , the Orphan House , or Hallische Waisenhaus , embraced all the institutions which now belong to it . 1 . The Orphan Asylum , established in 1694. in which over 5,000 orphans had been educated , up to 1838 , gratuitously . Such of the boys as manifest peculiar talent , are prepared for the university , and supported there . 2 . The Royal Pcedagogium. founded in 1696 , for the education of children of rich and noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated in this boarding institution . The profits of this school are paid ovr to the orphan asylum . /z/ 3 . The Latin School , established in 1697 , for pupils from abroad , of less wealthy condition than the former , and for boys of the city of Halle . 4 . The German School , for boys and girls whose parents do not wish to give them a classic education . These several schools number from 3,000 to 4,000 pupils , * of every age , and in every study . Besides these schools there are other features in the institution . 5 . The Canstein Bible Press , established in 1712 , to furnish the Bible at a cheap rate . The profits on the sale of an edition are applied to diminish the expense of the next edition . 6 . A Library , commenced by Franke by setting apart his own books for the use of his schools , and which now number 20,000 volumes . 7 . An Apothecary 's Shap , commenced by Franke as a medicine chest for the poor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orphan-house , are applied to the support of the institution . 8 . A Book Establishment , in which the classics , and school books , are published at a low price , not only for the institution , but for the trade generally . 9 . A house for widows . We have dwelt on the labors of Franke , because he proved his faith in God by his works , and because he was an educator in the largest and best sense of that designation . According to his biographer , the first teachers ' class was founded by Franke in 1697 , by providing a table or free board for such poor students as stood in need of assistance , and selecting , a few years later , out of the whole number , twelve who exhibited the right basis of piety , knowledge , Kkill and desire for teaching , and constituting them his " Seminarium Praeceptorum , " Teachers ' Seminary . These pupil teachers received separate instruction for two years , and obtained a practical knowledge of methods , in thelasses of the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach for three years In the institution after the close of their course . In 1704 , according to Raumer , this plan was matured , and the supply of teachers for all the lower classes were drawn from this seminary . But besides the teachers trained in this branch of Franke 's great establishment , hundreds of others , attracted by the success of his experiment , resorted to Halle , from all parts of Europe , to profit by the organization , spirit , and method of his various schools . Among the most distinguished of his pupils and disciples , may be named , Count Zinzendorf , the founder of the communities of United Brethren , or Moravians , in Herrnhut , in 1722 ; Steinmetz. who erected a Normal School in Klosterbergen , in 1730 ; Hecker , the founder of the first Real " It is interesting to a visitor to remark in the chief cities of Germany , during certain hours the silence of the streets , with their entire desertion by children , and the contrast of the change produced by the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with children , carrying books and stales , and returning from the studies of the morning . The most striking sight of the kind we ever witnessed was at Halle , where , as we approached a large educational establishment , called the " Hallische Waisenhaus , " the whole of its juvenile inmates , 3,000 in number , burst forth into the street , and filling up the entire roadway , formed a unbroken stream of a quarter of a mile in length . Hicksm'a Dutch and German School*. /z/ School in Berlin , to which a seminary for teachers was attached in 1748 ; Rambalt. who lectured in the Universities in Jena and Giessen in pedagogic , and reformed the schools in Hesse-Darmstadt ; Felbiger , who reorganized the schools of Silesia , and afterward those of Austria ; these , and others scarcely less distinguished , were among the most eminent and successful teachers of the day , and were known as the school of Pietists . The educational school of Franke was followed by Basedow , ( born at Hamburg , in 1723 , ) Campe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Philanthropinum. founded by the former at Dessau , in 1781 . This institution gave its name to the school of educationists , known as Philanthropinic , and which prevails at this day in some sections of Germany . Its earliest development on the continent was made by Rousseau , in his " Emile , " and by John Locke , in England , in his c : Thoughts on Education . " Its great aim was the formation of a practical character , and this was to be accomplished by following the indications of nature . The body , as well as the mind , was to be hardened and invigorated , and prepared to execute with energy the designs of the mind . The discipline of the family and school was softened by constant appeals to the best principles in the child 's nature . Particular attention was paid to instruction in language , music , and the laws and objects of nature . Many of these principles became engrafted on to the teachers of Normal Schools , and through their pupils were introduced into the common schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the track of the Philanthropinic School , and by his example and writings , diffused a new spirit among the schools of primary instruction , all over Europe . Although born in Switzerland , at Zurich , in 1746 , and although his personal labors were confined to his native country , and their immediate influence was weakened by many defects of character , still his general views of education were so sound and just , that they are now adopted by teachers who never read a word of his life or writings , and by many who never heard of his name . They have become the common property of teachers and educators all over the world . A brief notice* of the leading principles of the system , which now bears his name , and which has moulded the entire character of the schools of Germany , during the last half century , can not be deemed irrelevant . " The father of Pestalozzi , who was a physician , died when he was quite young , and his early education was left to his mother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an age to pass into the grammar school of Zurich . In consequence of such an education , corresponding entirely to his natural disposition , he retained a remarkable gentleness and simplicity of manners , which continued through his long life , and produced that agreeable mixture of manly and female excellence , which rendered him peculiarly interesting to children , to whom his person was unattractive . Oppressive treatment at school , and misapprehension of his views in riper years , gave him , however , a keen sense of justice , which roused him to vindicate the cause of the oppressed among the lower classes of the people , and often made his language as a writer , bitter and sarcastic . Abridged from an article by William C. Woodbridge , in the Annals of Education , for January , /z/ Pestalozzi first lived in the midst of the people , in order that he might understand their misery , and endeavor to discover its source . He believed that he found it in the want of an observation of nature and mankind in the absence of spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levity and disorderly conduct which were the natural results , and the distrust , and obstinate and revengeful disposition which necessarily followed toward those who profited by their weaknesses , or punished their offenses . He believed that a good education for the children of the people was the only means of remedying this evil . The ravages of war had left a multitude of destitute orphans in the small cantons of Switzerland . His first attempt to carry his benevolent plan into execution , was in collecting a number of these poor children at Stanz , devoting himself to their instruction and care in the sacrifice of most of the comforts of life , and providing for their support from his own resources , or from the charity which he solicited from others . Here , he labored to discover the true and simple means of education . He treated his pupils with uniform sympathy and tenderness , and thus attempted to awaken love and confidence in their hearts , and to sow the seed of every good feeling . He therefore assumed faith , and love as the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established a school in more regular form in Burgdorf , in the canton of Berne , to which his benevolence and talents attracted a number of fellow-laborers . Here he endeavored to ascertain the principles which should govern the development of the infant faculties , and the proper period for the commencement and completion of each course of instruction in this view . As the result of his investigations , Pestalozzi assumed as a fundamental principle , that education , in order to fit man for his destination , must proceed according to the laws of nature . To adopt the language of his followers that it must not act as an arbitrary mediator between the child and nature , between man and God , pursuing its own artificial arrangements , instead of the indications of Providence that it should assist the course of natural development , instead of doing it violence that it should watch , and follow its progress , instead of attempting to mark out a path agreeably to a preconceived system . I. In view of this principle , he . did not choose , like Basedow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely by inculcating and engrafting every thing relating to external objects , and giving mechanical skill . He sought , on the contrary , to develope , and exercise , and strengthen the faculties of the child by a steady course of excitement to self-activity , with a limited degree of assistance to his efforts . II . In opposition to the haste , and blind groping of many teachers without system , he endeavored to find the proper point for commencing , and to proceed in a slow and gradual , but uninterrupted course , from one point to another always waiting until the first should have a certain degree of distinctness in the mind of the child , before entering upon the exhibition of the second . To pursue any other course would only give superficial knowledge , which would neither afford pleasure to the child , nor promote its real progress . III . He opposed the undue cultivation of the memory and understanding , as hostile to true education . He placed the essence of education in the harmonious and uniform development of every faculty , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and that in the development of the mind , neither the physical powers , nor the affections , should be neglected ; and that skill in action should be acquired at the same time with knowledge . When this point is secured , we may know that education has really begun , and that it is not merely superficial . IV . He required close attention and constant reference to the peculiarities of every child , and of each sex , as well as to the characteristics of the people among whom he lived , in order that he might acquire the development and qualifications necessary for the situation to which the Creator destined him , when he gave him these active faculties , and be prepared to labor successfully for those among whom he was placed by his birth . V. While Basedow introduced a multitude of subjects of instruction into . the schools , without special regard to the development of the intellectual powers , Pestalozzi considered this plan as superficial . He limited the elementary subjects of instruction to Form , Number and Language , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believed that these elements should be taught with the utmost possible simplicity , comprehensiveness and mutual connection . VI . Pestalozzi , as well as Basedow , desired that instruction should commence with the intuition or simple perception of external objects and their relations . He was not , however , satisfied with this alone , but wished that the art of observing should also be acquired . He thought the things perceived of less consequence than the cultivation of the perceptive powers , which should enable the child to observe completely , to exhaust the subjects which should be brought before his mind . VII . While the Philanthropinists attached great importance to special exercises of reflection , Pestalozzi would not make this a subject of separate study . He maintained that every subject of instruction should be properly treated , and thus become an exercise of thought ; and believed , that lessons on Number , and Proportion and Size , would give the best occasion for it . VIII . Pestalozzi , as well as Basedow , attached great importance to Arithmetic , particularly to Mental Arithmetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limited view of its practical usefulness , but as an excellent means of strengthening the mind . He also introduced Geometry into the elementary schools , and the art connected with it , of modeling and drawing beautiful objects . He wished , in this way , to train the eye , the hand , and the touch , for that more advanced species of drawing which had not been thought of before . Proceeding from the simple and intuitive , to the more complicated and difficult forms , he arranged a series of exercises so gradual and complete , that the method of teaching this subject was soon brought to a good degree of perfection . IX . The Philanthropinists introduced the instruction of language into the common schools , but limited it chiefly to the writing of letters and preparation of essays . But Pestalozzi was not satisfied with a lifeless repetition of the rules of grammar , nor yet with mere exercises for common life . He aimed at a development of the laws of language from within an introduction into its internal nature and construction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also improve the affections . It is impossible to do justice to his method of instruction on this subject , in a brief sketch like the present but those who have witnessed its progress and results , are . fully aware of its practical character and value . X. Like Basedow , Rochow and others , Pestalozzi introduced vocal music into the circle of school studies , on account of its powerful influence on the heart . But he was not satisfied that the children should learn to sing a few melodies by note or by ear . He wished them to know the rules of melody and rhythm , and dynamics to pursue a regular course of instruction , descending toils very elements , and rendering the musical notes as familiar as the sounds of the letters . The extensive work of Nageli and Pfeiffer has contributed very much to give this branch of instruction a better form . XI . He opposed the abuse which was made of the Socratic method in many of the Philanthropinic and other schools ' , by attempting to draw something out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommends , on the contrary , in the early periods of instruction , the established method of dictation by the teacher and repetition by the scholar , with a proper regard to rhythm , and at a later period , especially in the mathematical and other subjects which involve reasoning , the modern method , in which the teacher merely gives out the problems in a proper order , and leaves them to be solved by the pupils , by the exertion of their own powers . XII . Pestalozzi opposes strenuously the opinion that religious instruction should be addressed exclusively to the understanding ; and shows that religion lies deep in the hearts of men , and that it should not be enstamped from without , but developed from within ; that the basis of religious feeling is to be found in the childish disposition to love , to thankfulness , to veneration , obedience and confidence toward its parents ; that these should be cultivated and strengthened and directed toward God ; and that religion should be formally treated of at a later period in connection with the feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first development of all the faculties of her child , he assigns to her especially the task of first cultivating the religious feelings . XIII . Pestalozzi agreed with Basedow , that mutual affection ought to reign between the educator and the pupil , both in the house and in the school , in or- /z/ der twrender education effectual and useful . He was , therefore , as little disposed as Basedow , to sustain school despotism ; but he did not rely on artificial excitements , such as those addressed to emulation . He preferred that the children should find their best reward in the consciousness of increased intellectual vigor ; and expected the teacher to render the instruciion so aitractive , that the delightful feeling of progress should be the strongest excitement to industry and to morality . XIV . Pestalozzi attached as much importance to the cultivation of the bodily powers , and the exercise of the senses , as the Philanthropinists , and in his publications , pointed out a graduated course for this purpose . But as Gutsmuths , Vieth , Jahn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written concerning it by his immediate followers . Such are the great principles which entitle Pestalozzi to the high praise of having given a more natural , a more comprehensive and deeper foundation for education and instruction , and of having called into being a method which is far superior to any that preceded it . But with all the excellencies of the system of education adopted by Pestalozzi , truth requires us to state that it also involves serious defects . 1 . In his zeal for the improvement of the mind itself , and for those modes of instruction which were calculated to develop and invigorate its faculties , Pestalozzi forgot too much the necessity of general positive knowledge , as the material for thought and for practical use in future life . The pupils &f; his establishment , instructed on his plan , were too often dismissed with intelleciual powers which were vigorous and acute , but without the stores of knowledge important for immediate use well qualified for mathematical and abstract reasoning , but not prepared to apply it to the business of common life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early , attached too much importance to them , and devoted a portion of time to them , which did not allow a reasonable attention to other studies , and which prevented the regular and harmonious cultivation of other powers . 3 . The method of instrucliqn was also defective in one important point . Simplification was - carried too far , and continued too long . The mind became so accustomed to receive knowledge divided into its most simple elements and smallest portions , that it was not prepared to embrace complicated ideas , or to make those rapid strides in investigation and conclusion which is one of the most important results of a sound education , and which indicates the most valuable kind of mental vigor both for scientific purposes and for practical life . 4 . He attached too little importance to testimony as one of the sources of our knowledge , and devoted too little attention to historical truth . He was accustomed to observe that history was but a ' tissue of lies ; ' and forgot that it was necessary to occupy the pupil with man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and- matter , if we wish to cultivate properly his moral powers , and elevate him above the material world . 5 . But above all , it is to be regretted , that in reference to religious education , he fell into an important error of his predecessors . His too exclusive attention to mathematical and scientific subjects , tended , like the system of Basedow , to give his pupils the habit of undervaluing historical evidence and of demanding rational demonstration for every truth , or of requiring the evidence of their senses , or something analogous to it , to which they were constantly called to appeal in their studies of Natural History . It is precisely in this way , that many men of profound scientific attainments have been led to reject the evidence of revelation , and some , even : strange as it may seem , to deny the existence of Him , whose works and laws they study . In some of the early Pestalozzian schools , feelings of this nature were particularly cherished by the habit of asserting a falsehood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pupils to contradict it or disprove it if they did not admit its truth . No improvement of the intellectual powers , can , in our view , compensate for the injury to the moral sense and the diminished respect for truth , which will naturally result from such a course . 6 . While Pestalozzi disapproved of the attempts of the Philanthropinists to draw forth from the minds of children , before they had stores of knowledge , he seemed to forget the application of his principle to moral subjects , or to imagine that this most elevated species of knowledge was innate . He attempted too much to draw from the minds of his punils those great truths of religion and the /z/ spiritual world which can only be acquired from revelation ; and thus led them to imagine they were competent to judge on this subject without external aid . It is obvious that such a course would fall in most unhappily with the tendencies produced by other parts of the plan , and that we could not hope to educate in such a mode , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced his views and methods of education on religious subjects . He was remarkably the creature of powerful impulses , which were usually of the most mild and benevolent kind ; and he preserved a child-like character in this respect even to old age . It was probably this temperament , which led him to estimate at a low rate the importance of positive religious truth in the education of children , and to maintain that the mere habit of faith and love , if cultivated toward earthly friends and benefactors , would , of course , be transferred to our Heavenly Father , whenever his character should be exhibited to the mind of the child . The fundamental error of this view was established by the unhappy experience of his OWTI institution . His own example afforded the most striking evidence that the noblest impulses , not directed by established principles , may lead to imprudence and ruin , and thus defeat their own ends . As an illustration of this , it may be mentioned that , on one of those occasions , frequently occurring , on which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplying his large family , he borrowed four hundred dollars from a friend for the purpose . In going home , he met a peasant , wringing his hands in despair for the loss of his cow . Pestalozzi put the entire bag of money into his hands , and ran off to escape his thanks . These circumstances , combined with the want of tact in reference to the affairs of common life , materially impaired his powers of usefulness as a practical instructor of youth . The rapid progress of his ideas rarely allowed him to execute his own plans ; and , in accordance with his own system , too much time was employed in the profound development of principles , to admit of much attention to their practical application . But , as one of his admirers observed , it was his province to educate ideas and not children . He combated , with unshrinking boldness and untiring perseverance , through a long life , the prejudices and abuses of the age in reference to education , both by his example and by his numerous publications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , that favorite maxim of bigotry and tyranny , that obedience and devotion are the legitimate offspring of ignorance . He denounced that degrading system , which considers it enough to enable man to procure a subsistence for himself and his offspring and in this manner , merely to place him on a level with the beast of the forest ; and which deems every thing lost whose value can not be estimated in money . He urged upon the consciences of parents and rulers , with an energy approaching that of the ancient prophets , the solemn duties which Divine Providence had imposed upon them , in committing to their charge the present and future destinies of their fellow-beings . In this way , he produced an impulse , which pervaded the continent of Europe , and which , by means of his popular and theoretical works , reached the cottages of the poor and the palaces of the great . His institution at Yverdun was crowded with men of every nation ; not merely those who were led by the same impulse which inspired him , but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who came to make themselves acquainted with his principles , in order to become his fellow-laborers in other countries . " When the Prussian Government , in 1809 , undertook systematically the work of improving the elementary schools , as a means of creating and diffusing a patriotic spirit among- the people , the fame of Pestalozzi was at its height . To him and to his school , to his method and to his disciples , the attention of the best teachers in the kingdom was turned for guidance and aid . Several enthusiastic young teachers were sent to his institution at Yverdun , ( Iferten. ) to study his methods and imbibe h'ts spirit of devotion to the children of the poor . One of his favorite pupils , C. B. Zeller , of Wirtemberg , and who shared with him in certain weak- /z/ nesses of character , which prevented his attaining the highest success as a practical educator in currying out the details of an extensive plan , was invited lo organize a Normal School at Konigsberg. in the orphanhouse ( orphanotropliy ) established by Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day on which he declared his dukedom a kingdom , and caused himself to be crowned king , under the name of Frederick the First . To this seminary , during the first year of its existence , upward of one hundred clergymen , and eighty teachers , resorted , at the expense of the government , to acquire the principles and methods of the Pestalozxian system . Through them , and the teachers who went directly to Pestalozzi , these principles and methods were transplanted not only into various parts of Prussia , but also into the schools and seminaries of other states in Germany . Not even in Switzerland is the name of this philanthropist and educator so warmly cherished as in Prussia . His centennial birthday was celebrated throughout Germany , and particularly in Prussia , on the 12th of January , 1846. with an enthusiasm usually awarded only to the successful soldier . In more than one hundred cities and villages , in upward of one thousand schools , by more than fifty thousand teachers , it is estimated in a German school journal , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the appropriate manner in which it was celebrated in Leipsic , by founding a charity for the orphans of teachers , and for poor and neglected children generally , is abridged from an extended notice in Reden 's School Gazette . " At the first school hour , the elder pupils of the city school at Leipsic , were informed by a public , address of the eminent merits of Pestalozzi as an eminent teacher , and a program , with his portrait , handed to them ; this program contained an address to the citizens of Leipsic. by the Rev. Dr. Naumann ; the plan of a public charity , to be called the Pestalozzi Foundation , ( Hiftung , ) by Director Vogel ; and a biographical sketch , by Professor Plato . At ten o'clock , the elder pupils of the l.urgher school , and delegates from all the schools , with their teachers , and the friends of education , assembled in the great hall of one of the public schools ; on the walls were portraits of Pestalozzi , adorned with garlands . Addresses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pestalozzi in It'erten , and by other gentlemen , while the intervals were enlivened by songs and music composed for the occasion . In the evening a general association of all the teachers in Leipsic was formed , for the purpose of establishing ' the Pestalozzi foundation , ' designed for the education of poor and neglected children . " In Dresden a similar charity was commenced for the benefit of all orphans of leachers from any part of Saxony . The same thing was done in nearly all the large cities of Germany . In Berlin a Pestalozzi foundation was commenced for an orphan-house , lo which contributions had been made from all provinces of Prussia , and from other states of Germany ; to the direction of this institution Dr. Diesterweg has been appointed . The schools of most of the teachers and educators , whose names have been introduced , were in reality Teachers ' Seminaries , although not BO designated by themselves or others . Their establishments were not simply schoole for children , but were conducted to test and exemplify /z/ principles and methods of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books in which they were embodied , or of pupils and disciples who transplanted them into other places . As has been already stated , on the authority of Franke 's biographer , and of Schwartz , Rauiner , and other writers on the history of education in Germany , the first regularly-organized Teachers ' Seminary , or Normal School , ( not normal in the sense in which the word was originally used , as a school of children so conducted as to be a model or pattern for teachers to imitate , but a school of young men . who had already passed through an elementary , or even a superior school , and who were preparing to be teachers , by making additional attainments , and acquiring a knowledge of the human mind , and the principles of education as a science , and of its methods as an art. ) was established in Halle , in a part of Hanover , prior to 1704 . About the same period , Steinmetz opened a class for teachers in the Abbey of Kloaterberge. near Magdeburg , and which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franke and the pietists were transplanted into the north of Germany . In 1730. lectures on philology and the best methods of teaching the Latin . Greek and German languages , were common in the principal universities and higher schools . The first regularly-organized seminary for this purpose , was established at Gottingen , in 1738. and by its success led to the institution of a similar course of study and practice in Jena , Helle . Helmstadt , Heidelberg , Berlin , Munich , &c.; In 1735 , the first seminary for primary school teachers was established in Prussia , at Stettin , in Pomerania . In 1748 , Hecker , a pupil of Franke , and the founder of burgher , or what we should call high schools , established an institution for teachers of elementary schools , in Berlin , in which the king testified an interest , and enjoined , by an ordinance in 1752. that the country schools on the crown lands'in New Mark and Pomerania should be supplied by pupil teachers from this institution who had learned the culture of silk and mulberries in Hecker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction into that section of his kingdom . In 1757 , Baron von Fiirstenberg established a seminary for teachers at Munster , in Hanover . In 1767. the Canan von Rochow opened a school on his estate in Rekane , in Bradenburg , where , by lectures and practice , he prepared schoolmasters for country schools on his own and neighboring properties . To these schools teachers were sent from all parts of Germany , to be trained in the principles and practice of primary instruction . In 1770 , Bishop Febinger , organized a Normal ( model ) School in Vienna , with a course of lectures and practice for teachers , extending through four months ; and about the same time the deacon Ferdinand Kindermann , or von Schulstein , as he was called by Maria Theresa , converted a school in Kaplitz. in Bohemia , into a Normal Institution . Between 1770 and 1800 , as will be seen by the following Table , teachers ' seminaries were introduced into nearly every German state , which , in all but three instances , were supported in whole or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good teachers exceeded the supply furnished by these seminaries , private institutions have sprung up , some of which have attained a popularity equal to the public institutions . But in no state have Biich private schools been able to sustain themselves , until the government seminaries and the public school system had created a demand for well-qualified teachers . And in no state in Europe has the experiment of making seminaries for primary school teachers an appendage to a university , or a gymnasium , or any other school of an academic character , proved successful for any considerable period of time , or on an extensive scale . At the beginning of the present century , there were about thirty teachers ' seminaries in operation . The wars growing out of the French Revolution suspended for a time the movements in behalf of popular education , until the success of the new organization of schools in Prussia , commencing in 1809 , arrested the attention of governments and individuals all over the continent , and has led , within the last quarter of a century , not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual demand for teachers , but to the more perfect organization of the whole system of public instruction . The cardinal principles of the system of Primary Public Instruction as now organized in the German states , are , First . The recognition on the part of the government of the right , duty and interest of every community , not only to co-operate with parents in the education of children , but to provide , as far as practicable , by efficient inducement and penalties , against the neglect of this first of parental obligations , in a single instance . The school obligation , the duty of parents to send their children to school , or provide for their instruction at home , was enforced by law in Saxe-Gotha , in 1643 ; in Saxony and Wirtemberg. in 1659 ; in Hildesheim in 1663 ; in Calemberg , in 1681 ; in Celle , in 1689 ; in Prussia , in 1717 ; and in every state of Germany , before the beginning of the present century . But it is only within the last thirty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habits and good will of the people on the side of duty . We must look to the generation of men now coming into active life for the fruits of this principle , universally recognized , and in most cases wisely enforced in every state , large and small , Catholic and Protestant , and having more or less of constitutional guaranties and forms . Second . The establishment of a sufficient number of permanent schools of different grades , according to the population , in every neighborhood , with a suitable outfit of buildings , furniture , appendages and apparatus . Third . The specific preparation of teachers , as far as practicable , for the particular grade of schools for which they are destined , with opportunities for professional employment and promotion through life . Fourth . Provision on the part of the government to make the schools accessible to the poorest , not , except in comparatively a few instances , /z/ and those in the most despotic governments , by making them free to the poor , but cheap to all . Fifth . A system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and responsible reaching every locality , every school , every teacher , and pervading the whole state from the central government to the remotest district . The success of the school systems of Germany is universally attributed by her own educators to the above features of her school law especially those which relate to the teacher . These provisions respecting teachers may be summed up as follows : 1 . The recognition of the true dignity and importance of the office of teacher in a system of public instruction . 2 . The establishment of a sufficient number of Teachers ' Seminaries , or Normal Schools , to educate , in a special course of instruction and practice , all persons who apply or propose to teach in any public primary school , with aids to self and professional improvement through life . 3 . A system of examination and inspection , by which incompetent persons are prevented from obtaining situations as teachers , or are excluded and degraded from the ranks of the profession , by unworthy or criminal conduct . 4 . A system of promotion , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desirable situations . 5 . Permanent employment through the year , and for life , with a social position and a compensation which compare favorably with the wages paid to educated labor in other departments of business . 6 . Preparatory schools , in which those who wish eventually to become teachers , may test their natural qualities and adaptation for school teaching before applying for admission to a Normal School . 7 . Frequent conferences and associations for mutual improvement , by an interchange of opinion and sharing the benefit of each others ' experience . 8 . Exemption from military service in time of peace , and recognition , in social and civil life , as public functionaries. 9 . A pecuniary allowance when sick , and provision for years of infirmity and old age , and for their families in case of death . 10 . Books and periodicals , by which the obscure teacher is made partaker in all the improvements of the most experienced and distinguished members of the profession in his own and other countries . With this brief and rapid survey of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now pass to a more particular description of primary schools in several states , with special reference to the organization and course of instruction of Normal Seminaries , and other means and agencies for the professional training of teachers . Before doing this , we publish a table , prepared from a variety of school documents , exhibiting the number and location of Normal Schools in Germany , with the testimony of some of our best educators as to the result of this Normal School system . /z/ tfUMBSR AND LOCATION OP NORMAL SEMINARIES IN THB DIFFERENT STATES OF GERMANY .

Calvin E. Stowe , D. D. , Professor of Biblical Literature in Lane Seminary , Cincinnati , Ohio , in a " Report on Elementary Public Instruction in Europe " submitted to the General Assembly of Ohio , December , 1839 , after describing the course of instruction pursued in the common schools of Prussia and Wirtemb'erg , thus sums up the character of the system in refer , ence particularly to the wants of Ohio : " The striking features of this system , even in the hasty and imperfect sketch which my limits allow me to give , are obvious even to superficial observation . No one can fail to observe its great completeness , both as to the number and kind of subjects embraced in it , and as to its adaptedness to develop every power of every kind , and give it a useful direction . What topic , in all that is necessary for a sound business education , is here omitted ? I can think of nothing , unless it be one or two of the modern languages , and these are introduced wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely as it exists in any one school , but have combined , from an investigation of many institutions , the features which I suppose would most fairly represent the whole system . In the Rhenish provinces of Prussia , in a considerable part of Bavaria , Baden , and Wirte.mberg , French is taught as well as German ; and in the schools of Prussian Poland , German and Polish are taught . Two languages can be taught in a school quite as easily as one , provided the teacher be perfectly familiar with both , as any one may see by visiting Mr. Solomon 's school in Cincinnati , where all the instruction is given both in German and English . What faculty of mind is there that is not developed in the scheme of instruction sketched above ? I know of none . The perceptive and reflective faculties , the memory and the judgment , the imagination and the taste , the moral and religious faculty , and even the various kinds of physical and manual dexterity , all have opportunity for development and exercise . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as nearly complete as human ingenuity and skill can make it ; though undoubtedly some of its arrangements and details admit of improvement ; and some changes will of course be n'ecessary in adapting it to the circumstances of different countries . The entirely practical character of the system is obvious throughout . It views every subject on the practical side , and in reference to its adaptedness to use . The dry , technical , abstract parts of science are not those first presented ; but the system proceeds , in the only way which nature ever pointed out , from practice to theory , from facts to demonstrations . It has often been a complaint in respect to some systems of education , that the more a man studied , the less he knew of the actual business of life . Such a complaint can not be made in reference to this system , for , being intended to educate for the actual business of life , this object is never for a moment lost sight of . Another striking feature of the system is its moral and religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion entirely removed from the narrowness of sectarian bigotry . What parent is there , loving his children , and wishing to have them respected and happy , who would not desire that they should be /z/ educated under such a kind of moral and religious influence as has been described Whether a believer in revelation or not , does he not know that without sound morals there can be no happiness , and that there is no morality like the morality of the New Testament ' ( Does he not know that without religion the human heart can never be at rest , and that there is no religion like the religion of the Bible ? Every Well-informed man knows that , as a general fact , it is impossible to impress the obligations of morality with any efficiency on the heart of a child , or even on that of an adult , without an appeal to some code which is sustained by the authority of God ; and for what code will it be possible to claim this authority , if not for the code of the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The scheme is indeed an excellent one , provided only it were practicable ; but the idea of introducing , so extensive and complete a course of study into our common schools is entirely visionary , and can never be realized . ' I answer , that it is no theory which I have been exhibiting , but a matter of fact , a copy of actual practice . The above system is no visionary scheme , emanating from the closet of a recluse , but a sketch of the course of instruction now actually pursued by thousands of schoolmasters , in the best district schools that have ever been organized . It can be done ; for it has been done it is now done : and it ought to be done . If it can be done in Europe , I believe it can be done in the United States : if it can be done in Prussia , I know it can be done in Ohio . The people have but to say the word and provide the means , and the thing is accomplished ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the word of the king there ; and the means of the people here are altogether more abundant for such an object than the means of the sovereign there . Shall this object , then , so desirable in itself , so entirely practicable , so easily within our reach , fail of accomplishment ? For the honor and welfare of our state , for the safety of our whole nation , I trust it will not fail ; but that we shall soon witness , in this commonwealth , the introduction of a system of common-school instruction , fully adequate to all the wants of our population . But the question occurs , How can this be done ? I will give a few brief hints as to some things which I suppose to be essential to the attainment of so desirable an end . 1 . Teachers must be skillful , and trained to their business . It will at once be perceived , that the plan above sketched out proceeds on the supposition that the teacher has fully and distinctly in his mind the whole course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taught , but also as to all the best modes of teaching , that he may be able readily and decidedly to vary his method according to the peculiarities of each individual mind which may come under his care . This is the only true secret of successful teaching . The old mechanical method , in which the teacher relies entirely on his text - book , and drags every mind along through the same dull routine of creeping recitation , is utterly insufficient to meet the wants of our people . It may do in Asiatic Turkey , where the whole object of the school is to learn to pronounce the words of the Koran in one dull , monotonous series of sounds ; or it may rio in China , where men must never speak or think out of the old beaten track of Chinese imbecility ; but it will never do in the United States , Avhere the object of education ought to be to make immediately available , for the highest and best purposes , every particle of real talent that exists in the nation . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ptronir and independent mind , well disciplined , and well stored with every thing pertaining to his profession , and ready to adapt his instructions to every degree of intellectual capacity , and every kind of acquired habit . But how can we expect to find such teachers , unless they are trained to their business ? A very few of extraordinary powers may occur , as we sometimes find able mechanics , and great mathematicians , who had no early training in their favorite pursuits ; but these few exceptions to a general rule will never multiply fast enough to least as careful a training as our lawyers and physicians ? 2 . Teachers , then , must have the means of acquiring the necessary qualifications ; in other words , there must be institutions in which the business of teaching /z/ is made a systematic object of attention . I am not an advocate for multiplying our instil ut inns . Ve already have more in number than we support , and it would be ; wise to give power and efficiency to those we now possess before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teaching ought to be a regular branch of study in some of our academies and high schools , that those who are looking forward to this profession may have an opportunity of studying its principles . In addition to this , in our populous towns , where there is opportunity for it , there should be large model schools , under the care of the most able and experienced teachers that can be obtained ; and the candidates for the profession who have already completed the theoretic course of the academy , should be employed in this school as monitors , or assistants thus testing all their theories by practice , and acquiring skill and dexterity under the guidance of their . head master . Thus , while learning , they would be teaching , and no time or effort would be lost . To give efficiency to the whole system , to present a general standard and a prominent point of union , there should be at least one model teachers ' seminary , at some central point as at Columbus which shall be amply provided with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it schools of every grade , for the practice of the students , under the immediate superintendence of their teachers . 3 . The teachers must be competently supported , and devoted to their business . Few men attain any great degree of excellence in a profession unless they love it , and place all their hopes in life upon it . A man can not , consistently with his duty to himself , engage in a business which does not afford him a competent support , unless he has other means of living , which is not the case with many who engage in teaching . In this country especially , where there are such vast fields of profitable employment open to every enterprising man , it is not possible that the best of teachers can be obtained , to any considerable extent , for our district schools , at the present rate of wages . We have already seen what encouragement is held out to teachers in Russia , Prussia , and other European nations , and what pledges are given of competent support to their families , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been worn out in the public service , they are no longer able to labor . In those countries , where every profession and walk of life is crowded , and where one of the most . common and oppressive evils is want of employment , men of high talents and qualifications are often glad to become teachers even of district schools ; men who in this country would aspire to the highest places in our colleges , or even our halls of legis lation and courts of justice . How much more necessary , then , here , that the profession of teaching should afford a competent support ! Indeed , such is the state of things in this country , that we can not expect to find male teachers for all our schools . The business of educating , especially young children , must fall , to a great extent , on female teachers . There is not the same variety of tempting employment for females as for men ; they can be supported cheaper , and the Creator has given them peculiar qualifications for the education of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed extensively in all our elementary schools , and they should be encouraged and aided in obtaining the qualifications necessary for this work . There is no country in the world where woman holds so high a rank , or exerts so great an influence , as here ; wherefore , her responsibilities are the greater , and she is under obligations to render herself the more actively useful . 4 . The children must be made comfortable in their school ; they must bo punctual , and attend the whole course . There can be no profitable study without personal comfort ; and the inconvenience and miserable arrangements of some of our school-houses are enough to annihilate all that can be done by the best of teachers . No instructor can teach unless the pupils are present to be taught , and no plan of systematic instruction can be carried steadily through unless the pupils attend punctually and through the whole course . 5 . The cliildren must be given up implicitly to the discipline of the school . Nothing can be done unless the teacher has the entire control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , so far as the rules of the school are concerned If the parent in any way interferes with , or overrules , the t arrangements of the teacher , he may attribute it to himself if the school is not successful . No teacher ever ought to be employed to whom the entire management of the children can- gg RESULTS OF NORMAL SCHOOL SYSTEM . not be safely intrusted ; and better at any time dismiss the teacher than counteract his discipline . Let parents but take the pains and spend the money necessary to provide a comfortable school-house and a competent teacher for their children , and they never need apprehend that the discipline of the school will be unreasonably severe . Xo inconsiderable part of the corporal punishment that has been inflicted in schools , has been made necessary by the discomfort of school-houses and the unskillfulness of teachers . A lively , sensitive boy is stuck upon a bench full of knot-holes and sharp ridges , without a support for his feet or his back , with a scorching fire on one side of him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a master , with wooden brains and iron hands , orders him to sit perfectly still , with nothing to employ his mind or his body , till it is AM turn to read . Thus Confined for hours t what can the poor little fellow do but begin to wriggle like a fish out of water , or an eel in a frying-pan ? For this irrepressible effort at relief he receives a box on the ear ; this provokes and ren* ders him still more uneasy , and next comes the merciless ferule ; and the poor child is finally burnt and frozen , cuffed and beaten , into hardened roguery or incurable stupidity , just because the avarice of his parents denied him a comfortable school-house and a competent teacher . 6 . A beginning must be made at certain ' points , and the advance toward completeness must be gradual . Every thing can not be done at once , and such a system as is needed can not le generally introduced till its benefits are first demonstrated by actual experiment . Certain great points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to make the most liberal advances , in proportion to their means , to maintain the schools , should be selected , and no pains or expense spared , till the full benefits of the best system are realized ; and as the good effects are seen , other places will very readily follow the example . All experience has shown that governmental patronage is most profitably employed , not to do the entire work , but simply as an incitement to the people to help themselves . To follow up this great object , the Legislature has wisely made choice of a Superintendent , whose untiring labors and disinterested zeal are worthy of all praise . But no great plan can be carried through in a single year ; and if the Superintendent is to have opportunity to do what is necessary , and to preserve that independence and energy of official character which are requisite to the successful discharge of his duties , he should hold his office for the same term , and on the same conditions , as the Judges of the Supreme Court . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , should receive a suitable compensation for his services . This , justice requires ; and it is the only way to secure fidelity and efficiency . There is one class of our population for whom some special provision seems necessary . The children of foreign emigrants are now very numerous among us , and it is essential that they receive a good ENGLISH EDUCATION . But they are not prepared to avail themselves of the advantages of our common English schools , their imperfect acquaintance with the language being an insuperable bar to their entering on the course of study . It is necessary , therefore , that there be some preparatory schools , in which instruction shall be communicated both in English and their native tongue . The English is , and must be , the language of this country , and the highest interests of ouf state demand it of the Legislature to require that the English language be thoroughly taught in every school which they patronize . Still , the exigencies of the case make it necessary that there should be some schools expressly fitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a knowledge of our language and institutions . A school of this kind has been established in Cincinnati , by benevolent individuals . It has been in operation about a year , and already nearly three hundred children have received its advantages . Mr. Solomon , the head teacher , was educated for his profession in one of the best institutions of Prussia , and in this school he has demonstrated the excellences of tho system . The instructions are all given both in German and English , and this use of two languages does not at all interrupt the progress of the children in their respective studies . I can not but recommend this philanthropic institution to the notice and patronage of the Legislature. * In neighborhoods where there is a mixed population , it is desirable , if possible , /z/ to employ teachers who understand both languages , and that the exercises of the school be conducted in both , with the rule , however , that all the reviews and examinations be in English only . " Alexander Dallas Bache , LL . D. , Superintendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report on Education in Europe " to the Trustees of the Girnrd College of Orphans , Philadelphia , in 1838 , remarks as follows : " When education is to be rapidly advanced , Seminaries for Teachers offer the means of securing this result . An eminent teacher is selected as Director of the Seminary ; and by the- aid of competent assistants , and while benefiting the community by the instruction given in the schools attached to the Seminary , trains , yearly , from thirty to forty youths in the enlightened practice of his methods ; these , in their turn , become teachers of schools , which they are fit at once to conduct , without the failures and mistakes usual with novices ; for though beginners in name , they have acquired , in the course of the two or three years spent at the Seminary , an experience equivalent to many years of unguided efforts . This result has been fully realized in the success of the attempts to spread the methods of Pestalozzi and others through Prussia . THe plan has been adopted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , and Saxony ; while in Austria , where the method of preparing teachers by their attendance on the primary schools is still adhered to , the schools are stationary , and behind those of Northern and Middle Germany . These Seminaries produce a strong esprit de corps among teachers , which tends powerfully to interest them in their profession , to attach them to it , to elevate it in their eyes , and to stimulate them to improve constantly upon the attainments with which they may have commenced its exercise . By their aid a standard of examination in the theory and practice of instruction is furnished , which may be fairly exacted of candidates who have chosen a different way to obtain access to the profession . " Hon. Horace Mann , in his " Seventh Annual Report as Secretary of the Board of Education in Massachusetts " in which he gives an account of an educational tour through the principal countries of Europe in the summer of 1843 , says : " Among the nations of Europe , Prussia has long enjoyed the most distinguished reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in speeches , in tracts , and even in graver works devoted to the cause of education , its schools have been exhibited as models for the imitation of the rest of Christendom . For many years , scarce a suspicion was breathed that the general plan of education in that kingdom was not sound in theory and most beneficial in practice . Recently , however , grave charges have been preferred against it by high authority . The popular traveler , Laing , has devoted several chapters of his large work on Prussia to the disparagement of its school system . An octavo volume , entitled ' The Age of Great Cities , ' has recently appeared in England , in which that system is strongly condemned ; and during the pendency of the famous ' Factories ' Bill ' before the British House of Commons , in 1843 , numerous tracts were issued from the English press , not merely calling in question , but strongly denouncing , the whole plan of education in Prussia , as being not only designed to produce , but as actually producing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things spiritual as well as temporal as being , in fine , a system of education adapted to enslave , and not to enfranchise , the human mind . And even in some parts of the United States the very nature and essence of whose institutions consist in the idea that the people are wise enough to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong even here , some have been illiberal enough to condemn , hi advance , every tiling that savors of the Prussian system , because that system is sustained by arbitrary power . /z/ But allowing all these charges against the Prussian system to be true , then were still two reasons why I was not deterred from examining it . In the first place , the evils imputed to it were easily and naturally separable /z/ from the good which it was not denied to possess . If the Prussian schoolmaster has better methods of teaching reading , writing , grammar , geography , arithmetic , fec. , so that , in half the time , he produces greater and better results , surely we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his notions of passive obedience to government , or of blind adherence to the articles of a church . By the ordinance of nature , the human faculties are substantially the same all over the world , and hence the best means for their development and growth in one place , must be substantially the best for their development and growth everywhere . The spirit which shall control the action of these faculties when matured , which shall train them to self-reliance or to abject submission , which shall lead them to refer all questions to the standard of reason or to that of authority , this spirit is wholly distinct and distinguishable from the manner in which the faculties themselves ought to be trained ; and we may avail ourselves of all improved methods in the earlier processes , without being contaminated by the abuses which may be made to follow them . The best style of teaching arithmetic or spelling has no necessary or natural connection with the doctrine of hereditary right ; and an accomplished lesson in geography or grammar commits the human intellect to no particular dogma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pervert the benign influences of education to the support of arbitrary power , we surely can employ them for the support and perpetuation of republican institutions . A national spirit of liberty can be cultivated more easily than a national spirit of bondage ; and if it rhay be made one of the great prerogatives of education to perform the unnatural and unholywork of making slaves , then surely it must be one of the noblest instrumentalities for rearing a nation of freemen . If a moral power over the understandings and affections of the people may be turned to evil , may it not also be employed for the highest good ? Besides , a generous and impartial mind does not ask whence a thing comes , but what it is . Those who , at the present day , would reject an improvement because of the place of its origin , belong to the same school of bigotry with those who inquired if any good could come out of Nazareth ; and what infinite blessings would the world have lost had that party been punished by success ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frequently exemplified than this , that wherever I have found the best institutions , educational , reformatory , charitable , penal , or otherwise , there I have always found the greatest desire to know how similar institutions were administered among ourselves ; and where I have found the worst , there I have found most of the spirit of self-complacency , and even an offensive disinclination to hear of better methods . /z/ All the subjects I have enumerated were taught in all the schools I visited , whether in city or country , for the rich or for the poor . In the lowest school in the smallest and obscurest village , or for the poorest class in overcrowded cities ; in the schools connected with pauper establishments , with houses of correction , or with prisons , in all these , there was a teacher of mature aye , of simple , unaffected , and decorous manners , benevolent in his expression , kind and genial hi his intercourse with the young , and of such attainments and resources as qualified him not only to lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , by familiar illustration and apposite example , to commend them to the attention of the children . I speak of the teachers whom I saw , and with whom I had more or less of personal intercourse ; and , after some opportunity for the observation of public assemblies or bodies of men , I do not hesitate to say , that if those teachers were brought together , in one body , I believe they would form as dignified , intelligent , benevolent-looking a company of men as could be collected from the same amount of population in any country . They were alike free from arrogant pretension and from the affectation of humility . It has been often remarked , both in England and in this country , that the nature of a school-teacher 's occupation exposes him , in some degree , to overbearing manners , and to dogmatism in the statement of his opinions . Accustomed to the exercise of supreme authority , moving among those who are so much his inferiors in point of attainment , perhaps it is proof of a very well-balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in opinion and haughtiness of demeanor . Especially are such faults or vices apt to spring up in weak or ill-furnished minds . A teacher who can not rule by love , must do so by fear . A teacher who can not supply material for the activity of . his pupils ' minds by his talent , must put down that activity by force . A teacher who can not answer all the questions and solve all the doubts of a scholar as they arise , must assume an awful and mysterious air , and must expound in oracles , which themselves need more explanation than the original difficulty . When a teacher knows much , and is master of his whole subject , he can afford to be modest and unpretending . But when the head is the only text-book , and the teacher has not been previously prepared , he must , of course , have a small library . Among all the Prussian and Saxon teachers whom I saw , there were not half a dozen instances to remind one of those unpleasant characteristics , what Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' or profession , which sometimes degrade the name and disparage the sacred calling of a teacher . Generally speaking , there seemed to be a strong love for the employment , always a devotion to duty , and a profound conviction of the importance and sacredness of the office they filled . The only striking instance of disingenuousness or attempt at deception , which I saw , was that of a teacher who looked over the manuscript books of a large class of his scholars , selected the best , and , bringing it to me , said , ' In seeing one you see all . Whence came this beneficent order of men , scattered over the whole country , molding the character of its people , and carrying them forward in a career of civilization more rapidly than any other people in the world are now advancing ? This is a question which can be answered only by giving an account of the Seminaries for Teachers . From the year 1820 to 1830 or 1835 , it was customary , in all accounts of Prussian education , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item of information has now become unimportant , as there are seminaries sufficient to supply the wants of the whole country . The stated term of residence at these seminaries is three years . Lately , and in a few places , a class of preliminary institutions has sprung up , institutions where pupils are received in order to determine whether they are fit to become candidates to be candidates . As a pupil of the seminary is liable to be set aside for incompetency , even after a three years ' course of study ; so the pupils of these preliminary institutions , after having gone through with a shorter course , are liable to be set aside for incompetency to become competent . Let us look for a moment at the guards and securities which , in that country , environ this sacred calling . In the first place , the teacher 's profession holds such a high rank in public estimation , that none who have failed in other employments or departments of business , are encouraged to look upon school-keeping as an ultimate resource . Those , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success in other departments of business or walks of life , have very slender prospects in looking forward to this . These considerations exclude at once all that inferior order of men who , in some countries , constitute the main body of the teachers . Then come , though only in some parts of Prussia , these preliminary schools , where those who wish eventually to become teachers , go , in order to have their natural qualities and adaptation for school- keeping tested ; for it must be borne in mind that a man may have the most unexceptionable character , may be capable of mastering all the branches of study , may even be able to make most brilliant recitations from day to day ; and yet , from some coldness or repulsiveness of manner , from harshness of voice , from some natural defect in his person or in one of his senses , he may be adjudged an unsuitable model or archetype for children to be conformed to , or to grow by ; and hence he may be dismissed at the end of his probationary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , which I visited , the list of subjects at the examination , a part of which I saw , was divided into two classes , as follows : 1 . Readiness in thinking , German language , including orthography and composition , history , description of the earth , knowledge of nature , thorough bass , calligraphy , drawing . *2 . Religion , knowledge of the Bible , knowledge of nature , mental arithmetic , singing , violin-playing , and readiness or facility in speaking . The examination in all the branches of the first class was conducted in writing . To test a pupil 's readiness in thinking , for instance , several topics for composition are given out , and , after the lapse of a oer- /z/ tain number of minutes , - whatever has been written must be handed in to the examiners . So questions in arithmetic are given , and the time occupied by the pupils in solving them , is a test of their quickness of thought , or power of commanding their own resources . This facility , or faculty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the second class of subjects the pupils were examined orally . Two entire days were occupied in examining a class of thirty pupils , and only twenty - one were admitted to the seminary school ; that is , only about two-thirds were considered to be eligible to become eligible , as teachers , after three years ' further study . Thus , in this first process , the chaff is winnowed out , and not a few of the lighter grains of the wheat . It is to be understood that those who enter the seminary directly , and without this preliminary trial , have already studied , under able masters in the Common Schools , at least all the branches I have above described . The first two of the three years , they expend mainly in reviewing and expanding their elementary knowledge . The German language is studied in its relations to rhetoric and logic , and as aesthetic literature ; arithmetic is carried out intoalgebra and mixed mathematics ; geography into commerce and manufactures , and into a knowledge of the various botanical and zoological productions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective and machine drawing , and the drawing from models of all kinds , and from objects in nature , to . The theory and practice , not only of vocal , but of instrumental music , occupy much time . Every pupil must plav on the violin ; most of them play on the organ , and some on other instruments . I recollect seeing a Normal class engaged in learning the principles of Harmony . The teacher first explained the principles on which they were to proceed . He then wrote a bar of music upon the blackboard , and called upon a pupil to write such notes for another part or accompaniment , as would make harmony with the first . So he would write a bar with certain intervals , and then require a pnpil to write another , with such intervals as , according to the principles of musical science , would correspond with the first . A thorough course of reading pn the subject of education is undertaken , as well as a more general course . Bible history is almost committed to memory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Experimental Schools . During the last part of the course much of the students ' tune is spent in these schools . At first they go in and look on in silence , while an accomplished teacher is instructing a class . Then they themselves commence teaching under the eye of such a teacher . At last they teach a class alone , being responsible for its proficiency , and for its condition as to order , &c.,; at the end of a week or other period . During the whole course , there . are lectures , discussions , compositions , fcc. , on the theory and practice of teaching . The essential qualifications of a candidate for the office , his attainments , and the spirit of devotion and of religious fidelity in which he should enter upon his work ; the modes of teaching the different branches ; the motive-powers to be applied to the minds of children ; dissertations upon the different natural dispositions of children , and , consequently , the different ways of addressing them , of securing their confidence and affection , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of duty ; and especially the sacredness of the teacher 's profession , the idea that he stands , for the time being , in the place of a parent , and therefore that a parent 's responsibilities rest upon him , that the most precious hopes of society are committed to his charge , and that on him depends , to a great extent , the temporal and perhaps the future well-being of hundreds of his fellow-creatures , these are the conversations , the ideas , the feelings , amid which the candidate for teaching spends his probationary years . This is the daily atmosphere he breathes . These are the sacred , elevating , invigorating influences constantly pouring in upon his soul . Hence , at the expiration of his course , he leaves the seminary to enter upon his profession , glowing with enthusiasm for the noble cause he lias espoused , and strong in his resolves to perform its manifold and momentous duties . Here , then , is the cause of the worth and standing of the teachers , whom I had the pleasure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their character is * The above described is a very common method of examining in the gymnasia and higher semirmries of Prussia . Certain sealed subjects for an exercise are given to the students ; they are then lucked up in a room , each by himself , and at the expiration of a given time , they are enlarged , and it U seen what each one baa been able to make out of his faculties . /z/ more enviable than that of either of the three , so-called , ' professions . They have more benevolence and self-sacrifice than the legal or medical , - while they have Isss of sanctimoniousness and austerity , less of indisposition to enter into all the innocent amusements and joyous feelings of childhood , than the clerical They are not unmindful of what belongs to men while they are serving God ; nor of the duties they owe to this world while preparing for another . On reviewing a period of six weeks , the greater part of which I spent in visiting schools in the north and middle of Prussia and in Saxony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going from place to place ) , entering the schools to hear the first recitation in the morning , and remaining till the last was completed at night , I call to mind three things about which I can not be mistaken . In some of my opinions and inferences I may have erred , but of the following facts there can be no doubt : 1 . During all this time , I never saw a teacher hearing a lesson of any kind ( excepting a reading or spelling lesson ) , with a book in his hand 2 . I never saw a teacher sitting while hearing a recitation . 3 . Though I saw hundreds of schools , and thousands , I think I may say , within bounds , tens of thousands of pupils , / never saw one child undergoing punishment , or arraigned for misconduct . I never saw one child in tears from having been punished , of from fear of being punished . During the above period , I witnessed exercises in geography , ancient and modern ; in the German language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disquisitions , with rules for speaking and writing ; in arithmetic , algebra , geometry , surveying , and trigonometry ; in book-keeping ; in civil history , ancient and modern ; hi natural philosophy ; in botany and zoology ; in mineralogy , - where there were hundreds of specimens ; in the endless variety of the exercises in thinking , knowledge of nature , of the world , and of society ; in Bible history and in Bible knowledge ; and , as r I before said , in no one of these cases did I see a teacher with a book in his hand . His book , his books , his library , was in his head . Promptly , without pause , without hesitation , from the rich resources of his own mind , he brought forth whatever the occasion demanded . I remember calling one morning at a country school in Saxony , where every thing about the premises , and the appearance , both of teacher and children , indicated very narrow pecuniary circumstances . As I entered , the teacher was just ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave not only the events of a particular period in the history of PVance , but mentioned , as he proceeded , all the contemporary sovereigns of neighboring nations . The ordinary time for a lesson here , as elsewhere , was an hour . This was somewhat longer , for , toward the close , the teacher entered upon a train of thought from which it was difficult to break off , and rose to a strain of eloquence which it was delightful to hear . The scholars were all absorbed in attention . They had paper , pen , and ink before them , and took brief notes of what was said . When the lesson touched upon contemporary events in other nations , which , as I suppose , had been the subject of previous lessons , the pupils were questioned concerning them . A small text-book of history was used by the pupils , which they studied at home . I ought to say further , that I generally visited schools without guide , or letter of introduction , presenting myself at the door , and asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order from the Minister of Public Instruction , commanding all schools , gymnasia , and universities in the kingdom to be opened for my inspection , yet I seldom exhibited it , or spoke of it , at least not until I was about departing . I preferred to enter as a private individual , an uncommended visitor . I have said that I saw no teacher sitting in his school . Aged or young , all stood . Nor did they stand apart and aloof in sullen dignity . They mingled with their pupils , passing rapidly from one side of the class to the other , animating , encouraging , sympathizing , breathing life into less active natures , assuring the timid , distributing encouragement and endearment to all . The looks of the Prussian teacher often have the expression and vivacity of an actor in a play . He gesticulates like an orator . His body assumes all the attitudes , and his face puts on all the variety of expression , which a public speaker would do if haranguing a large assembly on a topic vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps to some almost ludicrous , that a teacher in expounding the first rudiments of handwriting , in teaching the difference between a hair-stroke and a ground-stroke , or how an I may be turned into a 6 , or a u into a w , should be able to work himself up into an oratorical fervor ; should attitudinize , and gesticulate , and stride from one end of the class to the other , and appear in every way to be as intensely engaged as an advocate when arguing an important cause to a jury ; but , strange as it may seem , it is nevertheless true ; and before five minutes of such a lesson had elapsed , I have seen the children wrought up to an excitement proportionally intense , hanging upon the teacher 's lips , catching every word he says , and evincing great elation or depression of spirits , as they had or had not succeeded in following his instructions . So I have seen the same rhetorical vehemence on the part of the teacher , and the same interest and animation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original sounds of the letters , that is , the difference between the long and the short sound of a vowel , or the different ways of opening the mouth in sounding the consonants b and p . The zeal of the teacher enkindles the scholars . He charges them with his own electricity to the point of explosion . Such a teacher has no idle , mischievous , whispering children around him , nor any occasion for the rod . He does not make desolation of all the active and playful impulses of childhood , and call it peace ; nor , to secure stillness among his scholars , does he find it necessary to ride them with the nightmare of fear . I rarely saw a teacher put questions with his lips alone . He seems so much interested in his subject ( though he might have been teaching the same lesson for the hundredth or five hundredth time ) , that his whole body is in motion ; eyes , arms , limbs , all contributing to the impression he desires to make ; and , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils come from the work all glowing with excitement : Suppose a lawyer in one of our courts were to plead an important cause before a jury , but instead of standing and extemporizing , and showing by his gestures , and by the energy and ardor of his whole manner , that he felt an interest in his theme , instead of rising with his subject and coruscating with flashes of genius and wit , he should plant himself lazily down in a chair , read from some old book which scarcely a member of the panel could fully understand ; and , after droning away for an hour , should leave them , without having distinctly impressed their minds with one fact , or led them to form one logical conclusion ; would it be any wonder if he left half of them joking with each other , or asleep ; would it be any wonder , provided he were followed on the other side by an advocate of brilliant parts , of elegant diction and attractive manner , who should pour sunshine into the darkest recesses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the cause of his client also ? These incitements and endearments of the teacher , this personal ubiquity , as it were , among all the pupils in the class , prevailed much more , as the pupils were younger . Before the older classes , the teacher 's manner became calm and didactic . The habit of attention being once formed , nothing was left for subsequent years or teachers , but the easy task of maintaining it . Was there ever such a comment as this on the practice of hiring cheap teachers because the school is young , or incompetent ones because it is backward ! In Prussia and in Saxony , as well as in Scotland , the power of commanding and retaining the attention of a class is held to be a sine qua non in a teacher 's qualifications . If he has not talent , skill , vivacity , or resources of anecdote and wit , sufficient to arouse and retain the attention of his pupils during the accustomed period of recitation , he is deemed to have mistaken his calling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take a group of little children to a toy-shop , and witness their outbursting eagerness and delight . They need no stimulus of badges or prizes to arrest or sustain their attention ; they need no quickening of their faculties by rod or ferule . To the exclusion of food and sleep they will push their inquiries , until shape , color , quality , use , substance , both external and internal , of the objects around them , are exhausted ; and each child will want the show-man wholly to himself . But in all the boundless variety and beauty of nature 's works ; in that profusion ami prodigality of charms with which the Creator has adorned and enriched every part of his creation ; in the delights of affection ; in the ecstatic joys of benevolence ; in the absorbing interest - which an unsophisticated conscience /z/ instinctively takes in all questions of right and wrong ; in all these , is there not as much to challenge and command the attention of a little child , as in the curiosities of a toy-shop ? When as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching as upon toys , there will be less difference between the cast . - . The third circumstance I mentioned above was the beautiful relation of harmony and affection which subsisted between teacher and pupils . I can not say that the extraordinary fact I have mentioned was not the result of chance or accident . Of the probability of that , others must judge . I can only say that , during all the time mentioned , I never saw a blow struck , I never heard a sharp rebuke given , never saw a child in tears , nor arraigned at the teacher 's bar for any alleged misconduct . On the contrary , the relation seemed to be one of duty first , and then affection , on the part of the teacher , of affection first , and then duty , on the part of the scholar . The teacher 's manner was better than parental , for it had a parent 's tenderness and vigilance , without the foolish dotings or indulgences to which parental affection is prone . I heard no child ridiculed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the contrary , whenever a mistake was made , or there was a want of promptness in giving a reply , the expression of the teacher was that of grief and disappointment , as though there had been a failure , not merely to answer the question of a master , but to comply with the expectations of a friend . No child was disconcerted , disabled , or bereft of his senses , through fear . Nay , generally , at the ends of the answer ? , the teacher 's practice is to encourage him with the exclamation , ' good , ' ' right , ' wholly right , ' fcc. , or to check him , with his slowly and painfully articulated ' no ; ' and this is done with a tone of voice that marks every degree of plus and minus in the scale of approbation and regret . When a difficult question has been put to a young child , which tasks all his energies , the teacher approaches him with a mingled look of concern and encouragement ; he stands before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternately crossing " his countenance ; he lifts his arms and turns his body , as a bowler who has given a wrong direction to his bowl will writhe his person to bring the ball back upon its track ; and finally , if the little wrestler with difficulty triumphs , the teacher felicitates him upon his success , perhaps seizes and shakes him by the hand , in token of congratulation ; and , when the difficulty has been really formidable , and the effort triumphant , I have seen the teacher catch up the child in his arms and embrace him , as though he were not able to contain his joy . At another time , I have seen a teacher actually clap his hands with delight at a bright reply ; and all this has been done so naturally and so unaffectedly as to excite no other feeling in the residue of the children than a desire , by the same means , to win the same caresses . What person worthy of being called by the name , or of sustaining the sacred relation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , sacrifice any thing , to have his children , during eight or ten years of the period of their childhood , surrounded by circumstances , and breathed upon by sweet and humanizing influences , like these 1 " The Rev. Egerlon Ryerson , D. D .. Chief Superintendent of Schools , in a " Report on a System of Public Elementary Instruction for Upper Canada " after quoting the above passages from Mr. Mann 's report , remarks /z/ " In the above summary and important statements on this subject , by the able Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education , I fully concur , with two slight exceptions . In one instance I did see a boy in tears ( in Berlin ) when removed to a lower class on account of negligence in his school preparations . I did see one or two old men sitting occasionally in school . With these exceptions , my own similar inquiries and experience of nearly three months in Southern and Western , as well as Northern and Middle Germany , and I might add a longer period of like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me not only to subscribe to the statements of the Hon.

" /z/ Professor Lemuel Stephens , now of Girard College of Orphans , Philadelphia , in a " Letter addressed to Hon. F. R. Shunk , Superintendent of Common Schools in Pennsylvania , " from Berlin , in 1843 , remarks : " To determine absolutely the influence which teachers ' seminaries have had upon the state of popular education in Qermany , would be a matter of great difficulty , owing to the gradual growth of these institutions . One thing is certain , that the improvement of the schools has followed , hand in hand , the multiplication and improvement of the seminaries . Perhaps the value of these insulations can be shown in no light so advantageously , as by comparing the class of common school teachers in Germany , at the present moment , with the same class in England and America . In this country one is struck with the zeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole body . They have been for three or four years under the instruction of men practically and scientifically acquainted with the best principles of teaching ; and what is an indispensable part of their preparation , they have had the opportunity of testing the value , and of becoming familiar with the application of these principles in practice . During the latter part of their course they have been accustomed , under the eye of their teachers , to instruct a school of children , by . which means the art and the theory have kept pace with each other . Some knowledge of the human mind , and some just- conception of the great problem of education which they are engaged in solving , inspires them with self-respect , with earnestness and love of their profession . Once raised above the idea that education consists alone in drilling children in a few useful accomplishments , a sense of the dignity of the work of operating on , and forming other minds , causes them to overlook the humble outward conditions of a village school , and fortifies them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question the great immediate benefit of these seminaries in fitting teachers better to fill their office , I believe that the professional spirit , the esprit , du corps , which they create , is productive of results which are alone sufficient to recommend these institutions . It is this common spirit which secures the progress of the young teacher after he has entered into active service , aod saves him from the besetting sin of rusting into a mechanical routine , by keeping up a lively interchange of opinions , and making him acquainted with the successes and improvements of other teachers . The means for this intercourse , are conferences and periodicals of education . In every German city , in which I have made the inquiry , I have learned that the teachers from the different schools are accustomed to come together , at stated times , for the purpose of mutual improvement : even in the villages of Hesse , and the mountainous part of Saxony , I found that the teachers , from villages miles apart , held their monthly conferences for debate and lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted exclusively to education . In these all questions of interest to teachers are discussed ; the best method of instructing explained , all new school books noticed and criticised : the arrangements and organizations of distinguished schools described , and accounts given from time to time of the progress of education in other states . The Gen ? ral School Gazette , which has particularly attracted my attention , has a list of more than one hundred regular contributors . The journals are open to all teachers to make known their experience , or to ask for information . The able director of the seminary in this city , who is at the same time the conductor of one of these periodicals , informs me that one or more of them finds its way to every common school teacher . They are furnished so low that he can generally afford to take them , or if not , they are taken by the district for his benefit . By these means an active spirit of inquiry is kept up ; the improvements of individuals become the property of all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a large and respectable class , engaged in the great work of human improvement ; and love and zeal for his profession are enkindled . There is union , sympathy , generous emulation and mutual improvement . Among the members of a profession , there is a common principle of life . It is a type of organic life , which contains within itself the principle of development and growth . A valuable ordinance passed in Prussia , in 1826 , and renewed in 1846 , requires a director of a seminary to travel about once a year , and visit a certain part of the schools within his " circuit . He makes himself acquainted with the /z/ state of the school , listens to the instruction given , takes part himself in the same , and gives to the teacher such hints for improvement as his observation may suggest . The results of his yearly visits he presents in the form of a report to the school authorities of the province . This occasional visitation is very useful in clearing up the dark corners of the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time , to teachers , who might otherwise sink into apathy and neglect . To render the efficacy of the seminaries more complete , it is provided that at the end of three years after leaving the seminary , the yjut.g teachers shall return to pass a second examination . And further , by an ordinance in 18 ' 26 , it is provided , ' To the end , that the beneficial influence of the seminary may extend itself to those teachers already established , who either require further instruction , or who in their own cultivation and skill in office do not advance , perhaps even recede ; it is required that such teachers be recalled into the seminaiy for a shorter or longer time , as may be needful for them , in order , either to pass through a whole methodical course , or to practice themselves in particular departments of instruction . ' By this organization it is very easy to see that the whole system of popular instruction is brought under the influence of the most able teachers ; their skill is made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance is given that the work of education is advancing surely and consequently toward perfection . It is only by the distinct division of the objects of human industry and knowledge , into separate arts and sciences , that their advancement can be insured . The necessity for the division of labor in the mechanic arts is well enough understood . A necessity for this division , in intellectual pursuits , exists in a by no means less degree . So long as the science of education depends for its development upon the casual contributions of men of all professions , without being made the business of any , it must grope its way hither and thither by the light of occasional flashes , instead of being guided on by a steady flame . The views of certain men on education are known among us , but so far is pedagogics from being cultivated as a science , we feel ourselves as , yet hardly authorized to use the woid . I am far from denying that we have many very good teachers ; but they stand separate and alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . Their experience has furnished them with excellent practical rules for their own procedure , but these rules have perhaps never been expressed in words , much less their truth demonstrated by a reduction of the same to scientific principles . They are content to be known as possessing the mysterious talent of a skillful teacher , and their wisdom dies with them . It is owing to the isolated position in which teachers by profession find themselves , that the didactic skill they may have acquired , even when it rises above the character of a blind faculty , and is founded on the enlightened conclusions of science , still remains almost without influence on the wrong ideas in education which may be in vogue around them . To quote a remark of Dr. Harnisch : ' we have had , now and then , capable teachers without possessing seminaries : we still find such singly in states which yet have no seminaries , but it can not be denied that seminaries are most effectual levers for elevating the condition of common schools , and such they have sufficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ " How far may we avail ourselves of the German plan of popular education- ? It will be borne in mind , that the Prussian system is so far voluntary that it is left entirely to the parent where , and in what manner , his child shall be educated , only requiring that the years , from six till fourteen , shall be devoted to instruction , and that a certain amount of knowledge shall be obtained . The Swiss republics have placed their public schools on the same basis that the German stales have done , their laws are essentially the same , and teachers have therefore , there as well as in Germany , the character of public servants . The great feature of the Prussian system , which it is both suitable and highly desirable for us to imitate , is that which I have already described , namely : the provision therein made for the education of common school teachers . This . appears to me the only radical reform , and the only means of putting public education in a steady and consequent train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have already stated as flowing from this measure It will raise the employment of teaching among us to a regular profession , and introduce generally consistent and rational methods of /z/ instructing . It will create among teachers , devotion to their office , and a desire for co-operation . This desire will manifest itself in the organization of unions for conference , and in the establishment and support of many periodicals . The higher character of teachers , and the improved state of the schools , will bring them respect , and a better remuneration for their services . The higher value set upon education , the immense contrast between the efficacy of a constant , and that of a half-yearly school , and I must add , the impossibility of gell for the laJter , will gradually do away with this great evil under which our school system suffers . The permanent settlement of teachers , rendering much less the annual accession to the profession necessary to keep the is supplied , will , as I have shown , obviate all difficulty on the score of numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vitally important branch of a nation 's literature , will be developed among us , and its blessings will be richly manifested in the better cultivation of all the sciences and a us of life . fcuch is a scanty outline of the benefits which the experience of other countries , and reason , show us will follow the proper education of our teachers . I do not mean to say that Germany has ahvady realized all these benefits . It is important to observe that the reform in education in this country , goes out from the government not from the people themselves , who rather passively submit to its operation , than actively co-operate in giving it efficacy . This , with other grounds before stated , necessarily make popular education in Germany productive of less results than in our own country . * * In the establishment of teachers ' seminaries , their utility and success will depend entirely upon their appropriate and perfect organization . False economy has often attempted to provide for the education of primary teachers , by making the seminary an appendage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago this arrangement was not uncommon in Germany ; and later the experiment has been tried in the State of New York . * * If it were needed , to strengthen the evidence of the inefficiency of this system , I might easily quote the testimony of the most able teachers of Germany to this effect . Perhaps no department of education requires a more peculiar treatment , and more calls for the undivided zeal and energy of those who have the conduct of it , than the preparation of teachers . Every thing depends on making the seminaries for teachers , separate and independent establishments , wiih a careful provision for a thorough , theoretical and practical preparation for all the duties of the common school . In the experiment of introducing teachers ' seminaries into our country , there is a danger that we shall be too sparing in the number of teachers employed in conducting them . Seminaries conducted by one or two teachers can not be otherwise than imperfect ; and while but little good would come from them , there is great danger that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " IN THE PRIiMARY SCHOOLS /z/ Rev.

D. , in 1839 , while Professor of Biblical Literature in Lane Seminary , Cincinnati , Ohio , visited Europe , and on his return submitted to the General Assembly of Ohio , in December , 1839 , a " Report on Elementary Public Instruction in Europe , " in which he thus describes the course of instruction pursued in the Primary Schools of Germany , particularly of Prussia and Wirtemburg . The whole course comprises eight years , and includes children from the ages of six to fourteen ; and it is divided into four parts , of two years each . It is a first principle , that the children be well accommodated as to house and furniture . The school-room must be well constructed , the seats convenient , and the scholars made comfortable , and kept interested . The younger pupils are kept at school but four hours in the day - two in the morning and two in the evening , with a recess at the close of each hour . The older , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the school-houses have a bathing-place , a garden , and a mechanic 's shop attached to them , to promote the cleanliness and health of the children , and to aid in mechanical and agricultural instruction . It will be seen by the schedule which follows , that a vast amount of instruction is given during these eight years ; and lest it should seem that so many branches must confuse the young mind , and that they must necessarily be but partially taught , I will say , in the outset , that the industry , skill , and energy of teachers regularly trained to their business , and depending entirely upon it ; the modes of teaching ; the habit of always finishing whatever is begun ; the perfect method which is preserved ; the entire punctuality and regularity of attendance on the part of the scholars ; and other things of this kind , facilitate a rapidity and exactness of acquisition and discipline , which may well seem incredible to those who have never witnessed it . The greatest care is taken that acquisition do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind be kept entirely and clearly within the constitutional capacity of mental and physical endurance . The studies must never weary , but always interest ; the appetite for knowledge must never be cloyed , but be kept always sharp and eager . These purposes are gradually aided by the frequent interchange of topics , and by lively conversational exercises . Before the child is even permitted to learn his letters , he is under conversational instruction , frequently for six months or a year ; and then a single week is sufficient to introduce him into intelligible and accurate plain reading . Every week is systematically divided , and every hour appropriated . The scheme for the week is written on a large sheet of paper , and fixed in a prominent part of the school-room , so that every scholar knows what his business will be for every hour in the week ; and the plan thus marked out is rigidly followed . Through all the parts of the course there are frequent reviews and repetitions , that the impressions left on the mind may be distinct , lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always commenced and closed with a short prayer ; and the Bible and hymn-book are the first volumes put into the pupils ' hands ; and these books they always retain and keep in constant use during the whole progress of their education . The general outline of the eight years ' course is nearly as follows : I. First part , of two years , including children from six to eight years old ; four principal branches , namely : 1 . Logical exercises , or oral teaching in the exercise of the powers of observation and expression , including religious instruction and the singing of hymns . 2 . Elements of reading . 3 . Elements of writing . 4 . Elements of number , or arithmetic . 4 /z/ II . Second part , of two years , including children from eight to ten years old seven principal branches , namely : L Exercises in reading . 2 . Exercises in writing . 3 . Religious and moral instruction , in select Bible narratives. 4 . Language , or grammar . 5 . Numbers , or arithmetic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 7 . Singing by note , or elements of music . III . Third part , of two years , including children from ten to twelve years old eight principal branches , namely : 1 . Exercises in reading and elocution. 2 . Exercises in ornamental writing , preparatory to drawing . 3 . Religious instruction in the connected Bible history . 4 . Language , or grammar , with parsing. 5 . Real instruction , or knowledge of Nature and the external world , including the first elements of the sciences and the arts of life of geography and history . 6 . Arithmetic continued through fractions and the rules of proportion . 7 . Geometry doctrine of magnitudes and measures . 8 . Singing and science of vocal and instrumental music . IV . Fourth part , of two years , including children from ten to twelve years old six principal branches , namely : 1 . Religious instruction in the religious observation of Nature ; the life and discourses of Jesus Christ ; die history of the Christian religion , in connection with the contemporary civil history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , and of mankind , including civil society , elements of law , agriculture , mechanic arts , manufactures , &c.; 3 . Language , and exercises in composition . 4 . Application of arithmetic and the mathematics to the business of l:fe , including surveying and civil engineering . 5 . Elements of drawing . 6 . Exercises in singing , and the science of music . We subjoin a few specimens of the mode of teaching under several of the above divisions . I. First part children from six to eight years of age . 1 . Conversations between the teacher and pupils , intended to exercise the powers of observation and expression . The teacher brings the children around him , and engages them in a familiar conversation with himself . He generally addresses them all together , and they all reply simultaneously ; but , whenever necessary , he addresses an individual , and requires the individual to answer alone . He first directs their attention to the different objects in the school-room , their position , form , color , size , materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accurate descriptions . He then requires them to notice the various objects that meet their eye in the way to their respective homes ; and a description of these objects , and the circumstances under which they saw them , will form the subject of the next morning 's lesson . Then the house in which they live , the shop in which their father works , the garden in which they walk , &c.,; will be the subject of the successive lessons ; and in this way for six months or a year , the children are taught to study things , to use their own powers of observation , and speak with readiness and accuracy , before books are put into their hands at all . A few specimens will make the nature and utility of this mode of teaching perfectly obvious . In a school in Berlin , a boy has assigned him for a lesson , a description of the remarkable objects in certain directions from the school-house , which is situated in Little Cathedral street . He proceeds as follows : " When I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to the right , I soon pass on my left hand the Maria Place , the Gymnasium , and the Anklam Gate . When I come out of Little Cathedral street , I see on my left hand the White Parade Place , and within that , at a little distance , the beautiful statue of Frederick the Great , King of Prussia . It is made of white marble , and stands on a pedestal of variegated marble , and is fenced in with an iron railing . From here , I have on PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . gj my right a small place , which is a continuation of the Parade Place ; and at the end of this , near the wall , I see St. Peter 's Church , or the Wall-street Church , as it is sometimes called . This church has a green yard before it , planted with trees , which is called the Wall Church Yard . St. Peter 's Church is the oldest church in the city ; it has a little round tower , which looks green , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green by exposure to the weather . When I go out of the school-house to the lower part of Little Cathedral street , bv the Coal-market , through Shoe street and Carriage street , I come to the Castle . The Castle is a large building , with two small towers , and is built around a square yard , which is called the Castle-yard . In the Castle there are two churches , and the King and his Ministers of State , and the Judges of the Supreme Court , and the Consistory of the Church , hold their meetings there . From the Coal-market , I go through Shoe street to the Hay-market , and adjoining this is the New-market , which was formed after St. Nicholas 's Church was burnt , which formerly stood in that place . Between the Hay-market and the New-market is the City Hall , where the officers and magistrates of the city hold their meetings . " If a garden is given to a class for a lesson , they are asked the size of the garden ; its shape , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are trees in it ; what the different parts of a tree are ; what parts grow in the spring , and what parts decay in autumn , and what parts remain the same throughout the winter ; whether any of the trees are fruit trees ; what fruits they bear ; when they ripen ; how they look and taste ; whether the fruit be wholesome or otherwise ; whether it is prudent to eat much of it ; what plants and roots there are in the garden , and what use is made of them ; what flowers there are . and how they look , &c.; The teacher may then read them the description of the garden of Eden in the second chapter of Genesis sing a hymn with them , the imagery of which is taken from the fruits and blossoms of a garden , and explain to them how kind and bountiful God is , who gives us such wholesome plants and fruits , and such beautiful flowers for our nourishment and gratification . The external heavens also make an interesting lesson . The sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their color , their varying form and movements ; the sun its rising and setting , its concealment by clouds , its warming the earth and giving it life and fertility , its great heat in summer , and the danger of being exposed to it unprotected ; the moon its appearance by night , full , gibbous , horned ; its occasional absence from the heavens ; the stars their shining , difference among them , their number , distance from us , &c.; In this connection the teacher may read to them the eighteenth and nineteenth Psalms , and other passages of Scripture of that kind , sing with them a hymn celebrating the glory of God in the creation , and enforce the moral bearing of such contemplations by appropriate remarks . A very common lesson is , the family and family duties , love to parents , love to brothers and sisters , concluding with appropriate passages from Scripture , and singing a family hymn . 2 . Elements of reading . After a suitable time spent in the exercises above described , the children proceed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exercise the organs of sound till they have perfect command of their vocal powers ; and this , after the previous discipline in conversation and singing , is a task soon accomplished . They are then taught to utter distinctly all the vowel sounds . The characters or letters representing these sounds are then shown and described to them , till the form and power of each are distinctly impressed upon their memories . The same process is then gone through in respect to dipthongs and consonants . Last of all , after having acquired a definite and distinct view of the different sounds , and of the forms of the letters which respectively represent these sounds , they are taught the names of these letters , with the distinct understanding that the name of a letter and the power of a letter are two very different things . They are now prepared to commence reading . The letters are printed in large form , on square cards ; the class stands up before a sort of rack ; the teacher holds the cards in his hand , places one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes between him and his pupils : What letter is that ? H. He places another on the rack . What letter is that ? A. I now put these two letters together , thus , ( moving the cards close together , ) HA . What sound do these two letters signify 1 Ha . There is another letter . What letter is that ? ( putting it on g2 PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . the rack . ) R. I now put this third letter to the other two , thus , HAR . What sound do the three letters make ? Har . There is another letter . What is it ? D. I join this letter to the other three , thus , HARD . What do they all make ? Hard . Then he proceeds in the same way with the letters F-I-S-T ; joins these four letters to the preceding four , HARD-FIST , and the pupils pronounce , Hardfist . Then with the letters E and D , and joins these two to the preceeding eight , and the pupils pronounce , Hard-fisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any length , ( for you may easily add to the above , N-E-S-S , and make Hard-fistedness ) the longest as easily as the shortest ; and in fact they learn their letters ; they learn to read words of one syllable and of several syllables , and to read in plain reading , by the same process , at the same moment After having completed a sentence , or several sentences , with the cards and rack , they then proceed to read the same words and sentences in their spelling-books. 3 . Elements of writing . The pupils are first taught the right position of the arms and body in writing , the proper method of holding the pen , &c.; ; and are exercised on these points till their habits are formed correctly . The different marks used in writing are then exhibited to them , from the simple point or straight line , to the most complex figure . The variations of form and position which they are capable of assuming , and the different parts of which the complex figures are composed , are carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning with the most simple ; then the separate parts of the complex , then the joining of the several parts to a whole , with his pencil and slate . After having acquired facility in this exercise , he is prepared to write with his ink and paper . The copy is written upon the blackboard ; the paper is laid before each member of the class , and each has his pen ready in his hand , awaiting the word of his teacher . If the copy be the simple point , or line , the teacher repeats the syllable one , one , slowly at first , and with gradually increasing speed , and at each repetition of the sound the pupils write . In this way they learn to make the mark both correctly and rapidly . If the figure to be copied consists of two strokes , ( thus , ; , ) the teacher pronounces one , two one , two , slowly at first , and then rapidly , as before ; and the pupils make the first mark , and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . If the figure consist of three strokes , ( thus , i , ) the teacher pronounces one , two , three , and the pupils write as before . So when they come to make letters , the letter a has five strokes , thus , a . When that is the copy , the teacher says , deliberately , one , two , three , four , five , and at the sound of each syllable the different strokes composing tKe letter are made ; the speed of utterance is gradually accelerated , lill finally the a is made very quickly , and at the same time neatly . By this method of teaching , a plain , neat , and quick hand , is easily acquired . 4 . Elements of number , or arithmetic . In this branch of instruction I saw no improvements in the mode of teaching not already substantially introduced into the best schools of our own country . I need not , therefore , enter into any details respecting them , excepting so far as to say that the student is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and nature of every rule before he uses it . II . Second part children from eight to ten years of age . 1 . Exercises in reading . The object of these exercises , in this part of the course , is to acquire the habit of reading with accuracy and readiness , with due regard to punctuation , and with reference to orthography . Sometimes the whole class read together , and sometimes an individual by himself , in order to accustom them to both modes of reading , and to secure the advantages of both . The sentence is first gone through with in the class , by distinctly spelling each word as it occurs ; then by pronouncing each word distinctly without spelling it ; a third time by pronouncing the words and mentioning the punctuation points as they occur . A fourth time , the sentence is read with the proper pauses indicated by the punctuation points , without mentioning them . Finally , the same sentence is read with particular attention to the intonations of the voice . Thus one thing is taken at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it occurs , before they proceed to the next . One great benefit of th class reading together is , that each individual has the same amount -f exercise v ' f he were the only one under instruction , has attenuon /z/ can never falter , and no part of the lesson escapes him . A skillful teacher , once accustomed to this mode of reading , can as easily detect any fault , mispronunciation , or negligence , in any individual , as if that individual were reading alone . The process is sometimes shortened , and the sentence read only three times , nfiiru'ly : " according to the words , according to the punctuation , according to the life . " 2 . Exercises in writing . The pupils proceed to write copies in joining-hand , both large and small , the principles of teaching being essentially as described in the first part of the course . The great object here is , to obtain a neat , swift , business hand . Sometimes , without a copy , they write from the dictation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctuation is combined with that in penmanship . They are also taught to make and mend their own pens , and in doing this to be economical of their quills . 3 . Religious and moral instruction in select Bible narratives . In this branch of teaching the methods are various , and the teacher adopts the method best adapted , in his judgement , to the particular circumstances of his own school , or to the special objects which he may have in view with a particular class . Sometimes he calls the class around him , and relates to them in his own language , some of the simple narratives of the Bible , or reads it to them in the words of the Bible itself , or directs one of the children to read it aloud ; and then follows a friendly , familiar conversation between him and the class respecting the narrative ; their little doubts are proposed and resolved , their questions put and answered , and the teacher unfolds the moral and religious instruction to be derived from the lesson , and illustrates it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture . Sometimes he explains to the class a particular virtue or vice , a truth or a duty ; and after having clearly shown what it is , he takes some Bible narrative which strongly illustrates the point in discussion , reads it to them , and directs their attention to it , with special reference to the preceding narrative . A specimen or two of these different methods will best show what they are . ( a ) Read the narrative of the birth of Christ , as given by Luke , ii . 120 . Observe , Christ was born for the salvation of men , so also for the salvation of children . Christ is the children 's friend . Heaven rejoices in the good of men . Jesus , though so great and glorious , makes his appearance in a most humble condition . He is the teacher of the poor , as well as of the rich . With these remarks compare other texts of the Bible . Jno iii 16 . " For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but have everlasting life . " 1 . Jno. iv . 9 " In this was manifested the love of God toward us ; because that God sent bis only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him . " Mark x. 14 , 15 . " But when Jesus saw it he was much displeased , and said unto them , Suffer little children to come unto me. for of such is the kingdom of God . Verily I say unto you . whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall not enter therein . " And the lesson is concluded with singing a Christmas hymn . Jesus feeds five thousand men : Jno. vi . 1-14 . God can bless a little so that it will do great good . Economy suffers nothing to be losti other texts : Ps. cxlv. 15 , 16 . ' The eyes of all wait upon thee ; and thou givest them their meat in due season . " " Thou openest thy hand , and satisfies ! the desire of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Therefore take no thought , saying , what shall we eatl or , What shall wedrinkl or , Wherewithal shall we be clothed ? ( for after all these things do the Gentiles seek : ) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things . But seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you . " Story of Cain and Abel . Gen. iv . 1-16 . Remarks . Two men may do the same thing externally , and yet the merit of their acts be very different . God looks at the heart . Be careful not to cherish envy or ill will in the heart . You know not to what crimes they may lead you . Remorse and misery of the fratricide other texts . Matt. xv . 19 . Heb. xi . 4. 1 Jno. ' iii . 12 . Job . xxxiv. 32 . " For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornication* , theft* , t &lM; witness , blasphemies. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mofe excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he , being dead , yet speaketh . " Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . A him 1 Because his own Works were evil , and his brother 's righteous . ' Wltt - speaketh . " Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him 7 Story of Jesus in the temple . Luke ii . 41-52 . Jesus in his childhood was very fond of learning , ( he heard and asked questions* ) God 's word was his delight , he understood what he heard and read , ( men were astonished at his understanding and answers . ) He carefully obeyed his parents , ( he went with them and was subject to them . ) And as he grew up , his good conduct endeared him to God and man . Other texts . Eph. vi . 1-4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Lord fot this is right . Honor thy father and mother , ( which is the first commandment with promise. ) that it may be well with thee . and thou mayest live long on the earth . And ye fathers ! provoke not your children to wrath , but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord " ' My son , forget not my law ; but let thine heart keep my commandments : For length of days , and long life , and peace , shall they add to thee . Let not mercy and truth forsake thee : bind them about thy neck ; write them upon the table of thine heart : So shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man . ' 1 On the other mode of teaching , the teacher , for example , states the general truth , that God protects and rewards the good , and punishes the bad . In illustration of this he reads to them the narrative of Daniel in the lions ' den , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In illustration of the same truth , the escape of Peter , and the miserable death of his persecutor , Herod , may be read . Acts xii . The teacher may impress upon the mind of his class , that diligence , scrupulous fidelity , and conscientious self-control , are the surest guarantees of success in life ; and , in illustration of the statement , read the narrative of Joseph 's conduct in bis master 's house in Egypt , and in the prison , and the results of it . Gen. xxxix . So , also , various incidents in the life of JesUs may be used to great advantage in illustrating different virtues . It is recommended that the teacher employ , in his instructions , the translation of the Scriptures in general use among the people ; but that he occasionally take the original Scriptures and read to the children , in his own translation , and sometimes use simple translations from different authors , that children may early learn to notice the diversities in different faithful translations , and see what they really amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher who understands his business , and is faithful to his trust , will scrupulously abstain from sectarian peculiarities , or from casting odium on the tenets of any of the Christian denominations . A man who has not magnanimity or enlargement of mind enough for this , is not fit to be employed as a teacher , even in the humblest branches of knowledge . 4 . Language , or grammar . The knowledge of the native tongue , the ability to use it with correctness , facility , and power , is justly regarded as one of the most important branches of common school instruction . It is the principal object of the logical exercises , or , as they may be justly termed , the exercises in thinking and speaking , already described as the first subject of study in the first part of the course , before the child has begun to use his book at all . In this second part of the course , grammar is taught directly and scientifically , yet by no means in a dry and technical manner . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child has become familiar with the nature and use of the things designated by them , and he is able to use them as the names of ideas which have a definite existence in his mind , and not as awful sounds , dimly shadowing forth some mysteries of science into which he has no power to penetrate . The first object is to illustrate the different parts of speech , such as the noun , the verb , the adjective , the adverb ; and this is done by engaging the pupil in conversation , and leading him to form sentences in which the particular parts of peech to be earned shall be the most important word , and directing his attention to the nature and use of the word in the place where he uses it . For example , let us suppose the nature and use of the adverb are to be taught . The teacher PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . gg writes upon the blackboard the words " here , there , near , " &c.; He then says , " Children , we are all together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blackboard can you express this ? " Children . ' " We are all Acre . " Teacher . ' ' Now look out of the window and see the church ; what can you say of the church with the second word on the blackboard ? " Children . " The church is there . ' 1 ' 1 Teacher . " The distance between us and the church is not great ; how will you express this by a word on the blackboard ? " Children . " The church is near " The fact that these different words express the same sort of relations is then explained , and , accordingly , that they belong to the same class , or are the same part of speech . The variations of these words are next explained . " Children , you say the church is near , but there is a shop between us and the church ; what will you say of the shop ? " Children . " The shop is nearer . " Teacher . " But there is a fence between us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between us , the shop and the fence , what will you say of the fence ? " Children . " The fence is nearest . " So of other adverbs . " The lark sings well . Compare the singing of the lark with that of the canary bird . Compare the singing of the nightingale with that of the canary bird . " After all the different sorts of adverbs and their variations have in this way been illustrated , and the pupils understand that all words of this kind are called adverbs , the definition of the adverb is given as it stands in the grammar , and the book is put into their ' hands to study the chapter on this topic . In this way the pupil understands what he is doing at every step of his progress , and his memory is never burdened with mere names , to which he can attach no definite meaning . The to give particular examples . 5 . Numbers , or arithmetic . 6 . Doctrine of space and form , or geometry . 7 . Singing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching music has already been successfully introduced into our own State , and whoever visits the schools of Messrs . Mason or Solomon , in Cincinnati , will have a much better idea of what it is than any description can give ; nor will any one who visits these schools entertain a doubt that all children from six to ten years of age , who are capable of learning to read , are capable of learning to sing , and that this branch of instruction can be introduced into all our common schools with the greatest advantage , not only to the comfort and discipline of the pupils , but also to their progress in their other studies . The students are taught from the blackboard . The different sounds are represented by lines of different lengths , by letters , by figures , and by musical notes ; and the pupils are thoroughly drilled on each successive principle before proceeding to the next . III . Third part , of two years children from ten to twelve . 1 . Exercises in reading and elocution . The objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to accustom the pupils to read in a natural and impressive manner , so as to bring the full force of the sentiment on those to whom they read . They are examined in modulation , emphasis , and the various intonations , and they often jead sentences from the blackboard in which the various modulations are expressed by musical notes or curved lines . The evils of drawling and monotone are prevented in the outset by the method of teaching , particularly the practice of the whole class reading together and keeping time . Short and pithy sentences , particularly the Book of Proverbs , ar recommended as admirably adapted to exercises of this kind . 2 . Ornamental writing , introductory to drawing . The various kinds of ornamental letters are here practiced upon , giving accuracy to the eye and steadiness to the hand , preparatory to skill in drawing which Jomes into the next part of the course . The pupils also practice writing sentences and letters , with neatness , rapidity , and correctness . 3 . Religious instruction in the connected Bible history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full and connected view of the whole Bible history . For this purpose large tables are made out and hung before the students . These tables are generally arranged in four columns , the first containing the names of the distinguished men during a particular period of Bible history ; gg PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . the second , the dates ; the third , a chronological register of events ; and the fourth , the particular passages of the Bible where the history of these persons and events may be found . With these tables before the pupils , the teacher himself , in his own words , gives a brief conversational outline of the principal characters and events within a certain period , and then gives directions that the scriptural passages referred to be carefully read . After this is done , the usual recitation and examination takes place . Some of the more striking narratives , such as the finding of Moses on the banks of the Nile ; Abraham ottering his son ; the journey of the wise men to do homage to Christ ; the crucifixion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory in the words of the Bible , and the recitation accompanied with the singing of a hymn alluding to these events . The moral instruction to be derived from each historical event is carefully impressed by the teacher . The teacher also gives them a brief view of the history between the termination of the Old and the commencement of the New Testament , that nothing may be wanting to a complete and systematic view of the whole ground . Thus the whole of the historical part of the Bible is studied thoroughly , and systematically , and practically , without the least sectarian bias , and without a moment being spent on a single idea that will not be of the highest use to the scholar during all his future life . 4 . Language and grammar . There is here a continuation of the exercises in the preceding parts of the course , in a more scientific form , together with parsing of connected sentences , and writing from the dictation of the teacher , with reference to grammar , orthography , and punctuation . The same principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things represented by those terms are clearly perceived , is here carefully adhered to . A single specimen of the manner in which the modes and tenses of the verb are taught may be sufficient to illustrate my meaning . The teacher writes on the blackboard a simple sentence , as , * ' The scholars learn well ; " and asks the class what sort of a sentence it is . They reply that it is a direct statement of a fact . ( Teach . ) Put it in the form of a command . ( Class . ) Scholars , learn well 1 ( Teach . ) Put it in a question form . ( Class . ) Do the scholars learn well ? ( Teach . ) Of a wish . ( Class . ) May the scholars learn well ! ( Teach ) Of an exclamation . ( Class . ) How well the scholars learn ! ( Teach . ) The conditional form . ( Class . ) If the scholars learn well ; or , should the scholars learn well . ( Teach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must learn well . ( Teach . ) Of ability . ( Class . ) The scholars can learn well , &c.,; &c.; They are then taught that the direct statement is called the indicative mode of the verb ; the command , the imperative mode ; the conditional , the subjunctive mode ; the wish , the potential mode , &c.,; &c.; ; and after this , ' the book is put into their hands , and they study their lesson as it stands . After this the different tenses of the several modes are taught in the same way . 5 . Real instruction , or knowledge of Nature and the external world , including the first elements of the natural sciences , the arts of life , geography , and history . Instruction on this head is directed to the answering of the following questions , namely : ( a ) What is man , as it respects his corporeal and intellectual nature ? Here come anatomy and physiology , so far as the structure of the human body is concerned , and the functions of its several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this connection appropriate texts of Scripture are quoted , as Gen. ii . 7 . Ps. cxxxix. 1416 . An appropriate hymn is also sung . And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul . " continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them , ( 6 ) What does man need for the preservation and cheerful enjoyment of life , tt it respects his body and mind ? For his body he needs food : the different kinds of food , and the mode of preparing them , are here brought to view ; the unwholesomeness of some kinds of food ; injuriousness of improper food ; cooking ; PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . gy evils of gluttony . The different kinds of clothing and modes of preparing them ; what sort of dress is necessary to health ; folly and wickedness of vanity and extravagance . Dwellings , materials of which houses are constructed ; mode of constructing them ; different trades employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , the family and its duties ; the neighborhood and its duties . Intellectual , moral , and religious cultivation ; the school and its duties ; the church and its duties . For the body and mind both , he needs security of person and property ; the government ; the legislature ; the courts , &c.; ( c ) Where and how do men find the means to supply their wants , and make themselves comfortable and happy in this life ? The vegetable , the mineral , and the animal kingdoms are here brought to view , for materials ; together with agriculture and manufactures , as the means of converting these materials to our use . Geography , with special reference to the productions of countries , and their civil , literary , and religious institutions ; towns , their organization and employments . Geography is sometimes taught by blank charts , to which the students are required to affix the names of the several countries , rivers , mountains , principal towns , &c.,; and then state the productions and institutions for which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &c.,; are given , and the pupil is required to construct an outline chart of their localities . In respect to all the above points , the native country is particularly studied ; its capabilities , its productions , its laws , its institutions , its history , &c.,; are investigated , with especial reference to its ability of supplying the physical , social , and moral wants of its inhabitants . Under this head the pupils are taught to appreciate their native country , to venerate and love its institutions , to understand what is necessary to their perfection , and to imbibe a spirit of pure and generous patriotism . It is scarcely necessary to add , that all the instruction under this fifth head is confined to the fundamental and simplest principles of the several branches referred to . 6 . Arithmetic , continued through fractions and the rules of proportion . 7 . Geometry , doctrine of magnitudes and measures . 8 . Singing , and science of vocal and instrumental music . IV . Fourth part , of two years children from twelve to fourteen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature , the life and discourses of Jesus Christ , the history of the Christian religion , in connection with the cotemporary civil history , and the principal doctrines of the Christian system . The first topic of instruction mentioned under this head is one of peculiar interest and utility . The pupils are taught to observe , with care and system , the various powers and operations of Nature , and to consider them as so many illustrations of the wisdom , power , and goodness of the Creator ; and at each lesson they are directed to some appropriate passage of the Bible , which they read and commit to memory : and thus the idea is continually impressed on them , that the God of Nature and the God of . the . Bible are one and the same Being . For example , as introductory to the whole study , the first chapter of Genesis , together with some other appropriate passage of Scripture , as the 147th Psalm , or the 38th chapter of Job , may be read and committed to memory . The surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , may be taken as a lesson . Then the varieties of surface ; as mountains , valleys , oceans and rivers , continents and islands , the height of mountains , the breadth of oceans , the length of rivers , remarkable cataracts , extended caverns , volcanoes , tides , &c.,; may be taken into view , and the teacher may impress upon the class the greatness , power , and intelligence necessary for such a creation . The whole is fortified by the application of such a passage as Psalm civ. 1-13 . " Bless the Lord , O my soul ! O Lord my God ! thou art very great ; thou art clothed with honor and majesty . Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment : who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain : who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters : who maketh the clouds his chariot : who walketh upon the wings of the wind : who maketh his angels spirits ; his ministers a llaming fire . Who laid the foundations of the earth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with the deep as with a garment : the waters stood above the mountains . At thy rebuke they fled ; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away . They go up by the mountains ; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them . Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over ; that they turn not again to cover the earth . He eendeth the springs into the valleys , /z/ which run among the hills . They give drink to every beast of the field ; the wild asses quench their thirst . By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation , which sing among ( he branches , lie watereth the hills from his chambers : the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works . " " O Lord , how manifold are thy works I in wisdom hast thou made them all : the earth is full of thy riches . So is this great and wide sea , wherein are things creeping innumerable , both small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that leviathan , whom thou hast made to play therein . " The fruitfulness and beauty of the earth , as illustrating the wisdom and goodness of God , may serve as another lesson . Here may be exhibited the beauty and variety of the plants and flowers with which the . earth is adorned ; the manner of their growth and self-propagation , their utility to man and beast , their immense number and variety , their relations to each other as genera and species ; trees and their varieties , their beauty and utility , their timber and their fruit ; and , in connection with this lesson , Psalm civ. 14-34 may be committed to memory . " He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ; and wine that maketh glad the heart of man , and oil to make his face to shine , and bread which strengthened man 's heart . The trees of the Lord are full of sap ; the cedars of Lebanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their nests : as for the stork , the fir trees are her house . The high hills are -a refuge for the wild goats ; and the rocks for the conies . He appointeth the mo/n for seasons : the sun knoweth his going down . Thou maketh darkness , and it is night : wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth . The young lions roar after their prey , and seek their meat from God . The sun ariseth , they gather themselves together , and lay them down in their dens . Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labor until the evening " ' These wait all upon thee ; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season . That thou givest them they gather ; thou openest thine hand , they are filled with good . Thou hidest thy face , they are troubled : thou takest away their breath , they die . and return to their dust . Thou sendest forth thy Spirit , they are created : and thou renewest. the face of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord shall rejoice in his works lie looketh on the earth , and it trembleth : he toucheth the hills , and they smoke . I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live : 1 will sing praise to my God while I have my being . My meditation of him shall be sweet : I will be glad in the Lord . " In like manner , the creation and nourishment , the habits and instincts of various animals mav be contemplated , in connection with Proverbs vi . 68 ; Psalm civ. 17-22 ; Proverbs xxx . 24-31 ; Gen. i. 20-24 ; Psalm cxlv. 15-16 . " Go to the ant , thou sluggard ! consider her ways , and be wise : Which having no guide , overseer , or ruler , provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest . " There be four things which are little on the earth , but they are exceeding wise : the ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ; the conies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses in the rocks ; the locusts have no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ; the spider taketh hold with her hands , and is in kings ' palaces . There be three things which go well , yea , four are comely in going : a lion , which is strongest among beasts , and turneth not away for any : a grayhound ; a he-goat also ; and a king , against whom there is no rising up . " " And God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beasts of the earth after his kind : and it was so . And God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good " ' ' The eyes of all wait upon thee ; and thou givest them their meat in due season . Thou openest thine hand , and satisfies ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteous in all his ways , and holy in all his works . " The phenomena of light and color , the nature of the rainbow , $rc. , may make another interesting lesson , illustrating the unknown forms of beauty and glory which exist in the Divine Mind , and which He may yet develope in other and still more glorious worlds ; in connection with Gen. i. 3 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 14 , and other passages of . like kind . So the properties of the air , wind , and storm , Job xxviii. 25 ; xxxviii. 33 , 34 , 35 . Psalm cxlviii. 8 . " Knowest thou the ordinance of heaven 1 canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth ? Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds , that abundance of waters may cover thee ? Canst thou send lightnings , that they may go , and say unto thee , Here we are 1 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who hath given understanding to the heart ? Who can number the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven ? " Then the heavens , the sun , moon , planets , fixed stars , and comets , the whole science of astronomy , so far as it can be introduced with advantage into common schools , can be contemplated in the same way . The enlightening , elevating , and purifying moral influence of such a scheme of instruction , carried through the /z/ whole system of Nature , must be clearly obvious to every thinking mind ; and its utility , considered merely with reference to worldly good , is no less manifest . The second topic of religious instruction is more exclusively scriptural . The life of Christ , and the history of the apostles , as given in the New Testament , are chronologically arranged , and tables formed as before . ( III . 3 . ) The discourses of Christ are ' examined and explained in their chronological arrangement , and in the same way the discourses and epistles of the apostles . The history of Christianity , in connection with the cotemporary civil history , is taught in a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , a summary of the Christian doctrine is given in the form of some approved catechism . 2 . Knowledge of the world and of mankind , including civil society , constitutional law , agriculture , mechanic arts , manufactures , &c.; This is a continuation and completion , in a more systematic form , of the instruction commenced in III . 5 . The course begins with the family , and the first object is to construct a habitation . The pupil tells what materials are necessary for this purpose , where they are to be found , how brought together and fitted into the several parts of the building . The house must now be furnished . The different articles of furniture and their uses are named in systematic order , the materials of which they are made , and the various trades employed in making them are enumerated . Then comes the garden , its tools and products , and whatever else is necessary for the subsistence and physical comfort of a family . Then the family duties and virtues ; parental and filial obligation and affection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil relations of society ; the religious relations of society ; the state , the father-land , &c.; ; finally , geography , history , and travels . Books of travels are compiled expressly for the use of schools , and are found to be of the highest interest and utility . 3 . Language , and exercises in composition . The object here is to give the pupils a perfect command of their native tongue , and ability to use it oh all occasions with readiness and power . The first exercises are on simple questions , such as " Why ought children to love and obey their parents ? " or they are short descriptions of visible objects , such as a house , a room , a garden , &c.; There are also exercises on the various forms of expressing the same idea , as , " The sun enlightens the earth . " " The earth is enlightened by the sun . " " The sun gives light to the earth . " " The earth receives light from the sun . " " The sun is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sun sends out its rays to enlighten the earth . " " The earth is enlightened by rays sent out from the sun , " &c.; There are exercises also of the same sort on metaphors and other figures of speech . Familiar letters are then written , and short essays on themes such as may be furnished by texts from the Book of Proverbs , and other sentences of the kind ; and thus gradual advancement is made to all the higher and graver modes of composition . 4 . Application of arithmetic and the mathematics to the business of life , including surveying , civil engineering , &c.; The utility of this branch of instruction , and the mode of it , after what has already been said , are probably too obvious to need any further illustration . 5 . Elements of drawing . For this the pupils have already been prepared by the exercises in ornamental writing , in the previous part of the course . They have already acquired that accuracy of sight and steadiness of hand which are among the most essential requisites to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the most simple mathematical figures , such as the square , the cube , the triangle , the parallelogram ; generally from wooden models , placed at some little distance on a shelf , before the class . From this they proceed to architectural figures , such as doors , windows , columns , fagades . Then the figures of animals , such as a horse , a cow , an elephant ; first from other pictures , and then from Nature . A plant , a rose , or some flower is placed upon a shelf , and the class make a picture of it . From this they proceed to landscape painting , historical painting , and the higher branches of the art , according to their time and capacity . All learn enough of drawing to use it in the common business of life , such as plotting a field , laying out a canal , or drawing the plan of a building ; and many attain to a high degree of excellence . /z/ 6 . Exercises in singing , and the science of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as possible , and include singing and playing at sight , and the more abstruse and difficult branches of the science and art of music . The following extracts from Hon. Horace Mann 's Seventh Annual Report to the Board of Education in Massachusetts , will supply some deficiences in the foregoing sketch , and , at the same time , present the impressions of another observer . /z/ The first element of superiority in a Prussian school , and one whose influence extends throughout the whole subsequent course of instruction , consists in the proper classification of the scholars . In all places where the numbers are sufficiently large to allow it , the children are divided according to ages and attainments ; and a single teacher has the charge only of a single class , or . of as small a number of classes as is practicable . I have before adverted to the construction of the schoolhouses , by which , as far ' as possible , a room is assigned to each class . Let us suppose a teacher to have the charge of but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to engage and occupy its attention , and we suppose a perfect school . But how greatly are the teacher 's duties increased , and his difficulties multiplied , if he have four , five , or half a dozen classes , under his personal inspection . While attending to the recitation of one , his mind is constantly called off , to attend to the studies and the conduct of all the others . For this , very few teachers amongst us have the requisite capacity ; and hence the idleness and the disorder that reign in so many of our schools , excepting in cases where the debasing motive of fear puts the children in irons . All these difficulties are at once avoided by a suitable classification ; by such a classification as enables the teacher to address his instructions at the same time to all the children who are before him , and to accompany them to the play-ground , at recess or intermission , without leaving any behind who might be disposed to take advantage of his absence . All this will become more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no obstacle whatever , save prescription , and that vis inertia of mind which continues in the beaten track because it has not vigor enough to turn aside from it , to the introduction , at once , of this mode of dividing and classifying scholars , in all our large towns . /z/ In regard to this as well as other modes of teaching , I shall endeavor to describe some particular lessons that I heard . The Prussian and Saxon schools are all conducted substantially upon the same plan , and taught in the same manner . , Of course , there must be those differences to which different degrees of talent and experience give rise . About twenty years ago , teachers in Prussia made the important discovery that children have five senses , together with various muscles and mental faculties , all which , almost by a necessity of their nature , must be kept in a state of activity , and which , if not usefully , , are liable to be mischievously employed . Subsequent improvements in the art of teaching have consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for these senses , muscles , and faculties . Experience has now proved that it is much easier to furnish profitable and delightful employment for all these powers , than it is to stand over them with a rod and stifle their workings , or to assume a thousand shapes of fear to guard the thousand avenues through which the salient spirits of the young play outward . Nay , it is much easier to keep the eye , and hand , and mind at work together , than it is to employ any one of them separately from the others . A child is bound to the teacher by so many more cords , the more of his natural capacities the teacher can interest and employ . In the case I am now to describe , I entered a class-room of sixty children , of about six years of age . The children were just taking their seats , all smiles and expectation . They had been at school but a few weeks , but long enough to have contracted a love for it . The teacher took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark which excited a light litter around the room , and effectually arrested attention , he gave a signal for silence . After wating a moment , during which every countenance was composed and every noise hushed , he made a prayer consisting of a single sentence , asking that as they had come together to learn , they might be good and diligent . He then spoke to them of the beautiful day , asked what they knew about the seasons , referred to the different kinds of fruit-trees then in bearing , and questioned them upon the uses of trees in constructing houses , furniture , &c.; Frequently he threw in sportive remarks which enlivened the whole school , but without ever producing the slightest symptom of disorder . During the familiar conversation , which lasted about twenty minutes , there was nothing frivolous or trifling in the manner of the teacher ; that manner was dignified . though playful , and the little jets of laughter which he caused the children occasionally to throw out , were much more favorable to a receptive state of mind than jets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in regard to the equipments of the scholars and the furniture of the school-room . Every child has a slate and pencil , and a little reading book of letters , words , arid short sentences . Indeed , I never saw a Prussian or Saxon school , above an infant school , in which any child was unprovided with a slate and pencil . By the teacher 's desk , and in front of the school , hung a blackboard . The teacher first drew a house upon the blackboard ; and here the value of the art of drawing , a power universally possessed by Prussian teachers , became manifest . By the side of the drawing and under it , he wrote the word house in the German script hand , and printed it in the German letter . With a long pointing rod , the end being painted white to make it more visible , he ran over the form of the letters , the children , with their slates before them and their pencils in their hands , looking at the pointing rod and tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our good schools , chijdren are first taught to imitate the forms of letters on the slate before they write them on paper ; here they were first imitated on the air , then on slates , and subsequently , in older classes , on paper . The next process was to copy the ' word ' ' house , " both in script and in print , on their slates . Then followed the formation of the sounds of the letters of which the word was composed , and the spelling of the word . Here the names of the letters were not given as with us , but only their powers , or the sotmds which those letters have in combination . The letter h was first selected and set up in the reading-frame , ( the same before described as part of the apparatus of Prussian schools for young children , ) instead of articulating our alphabetic h , ( aitch , ) merely gave a hard breathing ; such a sound as the letter really has in the word " house . " Then the dipthong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house " is spelled " haus , " ) was taken and sounded by itself , in ' the same way . Then the blocks containing A , and au , were brought together , and the two sounds were combined . Lastly , the letter s was first sounded by itself , then added to the others , and then the whole word was spoken . Sometimes the last letter in a word was first taken and sounded ; after that the penultimate ; ' and so on until the word was completed . The responses of the children were sometimes individual , and sometimes simultaneous , according to a signal given by the master . In every such school , also , there are printed sheets or cards , containing the letters , dipthongs , and whole words . The children are taught to sound a dipthong , and then asked in what words that sound occurs . On some of these cards there are words enough to make several short sentences , and when the pupils are a little advanced , the teacher points to several isolated words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence , and thus he gives them an agreeable surprise , and a pleasant initiation into reading . After the word " house " was thus completely impressed upon the minds of the children , the teacher drew his pointing rod over the lines which formed the house ; and the children imitated him , first in the air , while they were looking at his motions , then on their slates . In their drawings there was of course a great variety as to taste and accuracy ; but each seemed pleased with his own , for their first attempts had never been so criticised as to produce discouragement . Several children were then called to the blackboard to draw a house with chalk . After this , the teacher entered into a conversation about houses . The first question was , what kind of a house was that on the blackboard ? Then the names of other /z/ kinds of houses were given . The materials of which houses are built were mentioned stone , brick , wood ; the different kinds of wood ; nails , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.; &c.; AVhen the teacher touched upon points with which the children were supposed to be acquainted , he asked questions ; when he passed to subjects beyond their sphere , he gave information , intermingling the whole with lively remarks and pleasant anecdotes . And here one important particular should not be omitted . In this , as well as in all other schools , a complete answer was always required . For instance , if a teacher asks , " What are houses made of ? " he does not accept the answer , " of wood " or " of stone ; " but he requires a full , complete , ( vollsta'ndig ) answer ; as , u a house may be made of wood . ' ' The answer must always contain an intelligible proposition without reference to the words of the question to complete it . And here also the greatest care is taken that the answer shall always be grammatically correct , have the right terminations of all articles , adjectives and nouns , and the right grammatical transpositions according to the idioms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , precision in the expression of ideas ; and if , as many philosophers suppose , the intellect could never carry forward its processes of argument or investigation to any great extent , without using language as its instrument , then these children , in their primary lessons , are not only led to exercise the intellect , but the instrument is put into their hands by whsch its operations are facilitated . When the hour had expired , I do not believe there was a child in the room who knew or thought that his play-time had come . No observing person can be at a loss to understand how such a teacher can arrest and retain the attention of his scholars . It must have happened to almost every one , at some time in his life , to be present as a member of a large assembly , when some speaker , in the midst of great uproar and confusion , has arisen to address it . If , in the very corfimencement of his exordium , he makes what is called a happy hit , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are near enough to hear it , the attention of the next circle will be aroused . f. then , the speaker makes another felicitous sally of wit or imagination , this circle too becomes the willing subject of his power ; until , by a succession of flashes whether of genius or of wit , he soons brings the whole audience under his command , and sways it as the sun and moon sway the tide . This is the result of talent , of attainment , and of the successful study both of men and of things ; and whoever has a sufficiency of these requisites will be able to command the attention of children , just as a powerful orator commands the attention of men . But the one no more than the other is the unbought gift of nature . They are the rewards of application and toil superadded to talent . Now it is obvious that in the single exercise above described , there were the elements of reading , spelling , writing , grammar , and drawing , interspersed with anecdotes and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive variety , nor were any incongruous subjects forcibly brought together . There was nothing to violate the rule of " one thing at a time . " Compare the above method with that of calling up a class of abecedarians ; or , what is more common , a single child , and while the teacher holds a book or a card before him , and , with a pointer in his hand , says a , he echoes a ; then 6 , and he . echoes ft ; and so on until the vertical row of lifeless and ili-favored characters is completed , and then of remanding him to his seat , to sit still and look at vacancy . If the child is bright , the time which passes during this lesson is the only part of the day when he does not think . Not a single faculty of the mind is occcupied except that of imitating sounds ; and even the number of these imitations amounts only to twenty-six . A parrot or an idiot could do the same thing . And so of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inactivity ; for tin ' child who stands most like a post is most approved ; nay , he is rebuked if he does not stand like a post . A head that does not turn to the right or left , an t-yc that lies moveless in its socket , hands hanging motionless at the side , ind feet immovable as those of a statue , are the points of excellence , while the child is echoing the senseless table of a , b , c . As a general rule , six months are spent before the twenty-six letters are mastered , though the same child would learn the names of twenty-six playmates or twenty-six playthings in one or two days . /z/ All children are pleased with the idea of a house , a hat , a top , a ball , a bird , an egg , a nest , a flower , &c.; ; and when their minds are led to see new relations or qualities in these objects , or when their former notions respecting them are out more vividly , or are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an adult would be in obtaining a new fact in science , or in having the mist of some old doubt dispelled by a ne%v discovery . Lessons on familiar objects , given by a competent teacher , never fail to command attention , and thus a habit of mind is induced of inestimable value in regard to all future study . A train , the method I have described necessarily leads to conversation , and conversation with an intelligent teacher secures several important objects . It communicates information . It brightens ideas before only dimly apprehended . It addresses itself to the various faculties of the mind , so that no one of them ever tires or is cloyed . It teaches the child to use language , to frame sentences , to select words which convey his whole meaning , to avoid those which convey either more or less than he intends to express ; in fine , it teaches him to seek for thoughts upon a subject , and then to find appropriate language in which to clothe them . A child trained in this way will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of some sense not unfrequently fall , viz. , that of mismatching their words and ideas ; of hanging as it were , the garments of a giant upon the body of a pigmy , or of forcing a pigmys 's dregs upon the huge limbs of a giant . Appropriate diction should clothe just ideas , as a tasteful and substantial garb fits a graceful and vigorous form . The above described exercise occupies the eye and the hand as well as the mind . The eye is employed in tracing visible differences between different forms , and the hand in copying whatever is presented , with as little difference as possible . And who ever saw a child that was not pleased with pictures , and an attempt to imitate them ? Thus , the two grand objects so strenuously insisted upon by writers , in regard to the later periods of education and the maturer processes of thought , are attained , viz. , the power of recognizing analogies and dissimilarities . Having given an account of the reading lesson of a primary class , just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a brief account of a lesson given to a more advanced class . The subject was a short piece of poetry describing a hunter 's life in Missouri . It was first read , the reading being accompanied , with appropriate criticisms as to pronunciation , tone , &c.; It was tnen taken up verse by verse , and the pupils were required to give equivalent expressions in prose . The teacher then entered into an explanation of every part of it , in a sort of oral lecture , accompanied with occasional questions . This was done with the greatest minuteness . Where there was a geographical reference , he entered at large into geography ; where a reference to a foreign custom , he compared it with their customs at home ; and thus he explained every part , and illustrated the illustrations themselves , until , after an entire hour spent upon six four line verses , he left them to write out the sentiment and the story in prose , to be produced in school the next morning . All this was done without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind full of the subject , and having a ready command of all its resources . An account of one more lesson will close what I have to say on the subject of reading . The class consisted of young lads , belonging to a burgher school , which they were just about leaving . They had been reading a poem of Schiller ; a sort of philosophical allegory ; and when it was completed , the teacher called upon one of them to give a popular exposition of the meaning of the piece . The lad left his seat , stepped to the teacher 's desk , and , standing in front of the school , occupied about fifteen or twenty minutes in an extemporaneous account of the poem , and what he supposed to be its meaning and moral . /z/ Children are taught to cipher , or , if need be , to count , soon after entering school . I will attempt to describe a lesson which I saw given to a very young class . Blocks of one cube , two cubes , three cubes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay upon the teacher 's desk . The cubes on each block were distinctly /z/ marked off , and differently colored , that is , if the first inch or cube was white , the next would be black . The teacher stood by his desk , and in front of the class . He set up a block of one cube , and the class simultaneously said one . A block of two cubes was then placed by the side of the first , and the class said two . This was done until the ten blocks stood by the side of each other in a row . They were then counted backward , the teacher placing his finger upon them , as- a signal that their respective numbers were to be called . The next exercise was , " two comes after one , three comes after two , " and so on to ten ; and then backward , " nine comes before ten , eight conies before nine , and so of the rest . The teacher then asked , What is three composed of ? A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else is three composed 1 A. Three is composed of three ones . Q. " What is four composed of ? A. Four is composed of four ones , of two and two , of three and one . Q. What is five composed of ? A. Five is composed of five ones , of two and three , of two twos and one , of four and one . Q. What numbers compose six ? seven ? eight ? nine ? To the latter the pupil would answer , " Three threes make nine ; two , three , and four make nine ; two , two , and five make nine ; three , four , and two make nine ; three , five , and one make nine , ' ' &c.,; &x_.; The teacher then placed similar blocks side by side , while the children added their respective numbers together " two twos make four ; " " three twos make six , " &c.; The blocks were then turned down horizontally to show that three blocks of two cubes each were equal to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many are six less than eight ? five less than seven ? &c.; Then , how many are seven and eight ? The answer was given thus : eight are one more than seven , seven and seven make fourteen , and one added makes fifteen ; therefore eight and seven make fifteen . Q. How many are six and eight ? A. Eight are two more than six , six and six make twelve , and two added make fourteen . Or it might be thus : six are two less than eight , eight and eight are sixteen , two taken from sixteen leave fourteen , therefore eight and six are fourteen . They then counted up to a hundred on the blocks . Toward the close of the lesson , such questions as these were put , and readily answered : Of what is thirty-eight composed ? A. Thirty-eight is composed of thirty and eight ones ; of seven fives and three ones ; or sometimes thus : of thirty-seven and one ; of thirty-six and two ones ; of thirty-five and three ones , &c.; Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nine tens , of fifty and forty , &c.,; &c.; Thus , with a frequent reference to the blocks , to keep up attention by presenting an object to the eye , the simple numbers were handled and transposed in a great variety of ways . In this lesson , it is obvious that counting , numeration , addition , substraction , multiplication , and division were all included , yet there was no abstract rule , or unintelligible form of words given out to be committed to memory . Nay , these little children took the first steps in the mensuration of superficies and solids , by comparing the length and contents of one block with those of others . When the pupils were a little further advanced , I usually heard lessons recited in this way : Suppose 4321 are to be multiplied by 25 . The pupil says , five times one are five ones , and he sets down 5 in the unit 's place ; five times two tens , or twenty ones , are a hundred , and sets down a cipher in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand and five hundred , and one hundred to be carried make one thousand six hundred , and sets down a 6 in the hundred 's place ; five times four thousand are twenty thousand , and one thousand to be carried make twenty-one thousand . The next figure in the multiplier is then taken , twenty times one are twenty , and a 2 is set down in the ten 's place ; twenty times two tens are four hundred , and a 4 is set down in the hundred 's place ; twenty times three hundred are six thousand , and a 6 is set down in the thousand 's place ; twenty times four thousand are eighty thousand , and an 8 is set down in the ten thousand 's place . Then come the additions to get the product . Five ones are five , two tens are twenty , and these figures are respectively set down ; four hundred and six hundred make a thousand , and a cipher is set down in the hundred 's place ; one thousand to be carried to six thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , and an 8 is set down in the thousand 's place ; eighty thousand and twenty thousand make one hundred thousand , and a cipher is set down in the ten thousand 's place , and aim the hundred /z/ thousand 's place . It is easy to sec that where the multiplier and multiplicand are large , this process soon passes beyond mere child 's play . So in division . If 32756 are to be divided by 75 , the pupil says , how many hundred times are seventy-five , or seventy-five ones , contained in thirty-two thousand and seven hundred , or in thirty-two thousand and seven hundred ones ? four hundred times , and he sets down a 4 in the hundred 's place in the quotient ; then the divisor seventy-five is multiplied ( as before ) by the four hundred , and the product is set down under the first three figures of the dividend , and there are two thousand and seven hundred remaining . This remainder is set down in the next line , because seventy-five is not contained in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so of the residue of the process . When there is danger that an advanced class will forget the value of the denominations they are handling , they are required to express the value of each figure in full , throughout the whole process , in the manner above described . J shall never forget the impression which a recitation by a higher class of girls produced upon my mind . It lasted an hour . Neither teacher nor pupil had book or slate . Questions and answers were extemporaneous . They consisted of problems in Vulgar Fractions , simple and compound ; in the Rule of Three , Practice , Interest , Discount , &c.,; &c.; A few of the first were simple , but they soon increase in complication and difficulty , and in the amount of the sums managed , until I could hardly credit the report of my own senses , so difficult were the questions , and so prompt and accurate the replies . A great many of the exercises in arithmetic consisted in reducing the coins of one State to those of another . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are States ; and the expression of the value of one coin in other denominations , is a very common exercise . It struck me that the main differences between their mode of teaching arithmetic and ours , consists in their beginning earlier , continuing the practice in the elements much longer , requiring a more thorough analysis of all questions , and in not separating the processes , or rules , so much as we do from each other . The pupils proceed less by rule , more by an understanding of the subject . It often happens to our children that while engaged in one rule , they forget a preceding . Hence , many of our best teachers have frequent reviews . But there , as I stated above , the youngest classes of children were taught addition , substruction , multiplication , and division , promiscuously , in the same lesson . And so it was in the later stages . The mind was constantly carried along , and the practice enlarged in more than one direction . It is a difference which results from teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the other from the head , In the latter case the teacher sees what each pupil most needs , and , if he finds any one halting or failing on a particular class of questions , plies him with questions of that kind until bis deficiencies are supplied . In algebra , trigonometry , surveying , geometry , &c.,; I invariably saw the teacher standing before the blackboard , drawing the diagrams and explaining all the relations between their several parts , while the pupils , in their seats , having a pen and a small manuscript book , copied the figures , and took down brief heads of the solution ; and at the next recitation they were required to go to the blackboard , draw the figures and solve the problems themselves . How different this mode of hearing a lesson from that of holding the text-book in the left hand , while the fore-finger of the right carefully follows the printed demonstration , under penalty , should the place be lost , of being obliged to recommence the solution . /z/ Great attention is paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Plan of Studies , " the German language . But I heard very little of the ding-dong and recitative of gender , number and case , of government and agreement , which make up so great a portion of the grammatical exercises in our schools ; and which the pupils are often required to repeat until they really lose all sense of the original meaning of the terms they use . Of what service is it for children to reiterate and reassert , fifty times in a single recitation , the gender and number of nouns , about which they never made a mistake even before a grammar book was pot into their hands ? If the object of grammar is to teach children to speak and /z/ go PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . write their native language with propriety , then they should be practiced upon expressing their own ideas with elegance , distinctness , and force . For this purpose , their common every day phraseology is first to be attended to . As their speech becomes more copious , they should be led to recognize those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to descriminate between the literal and the figurative ; and to frame sentences in which fhe main idea shall be brought out conspicuously and prominently , while all subordinate ones , mere matters of circumstance or qualification , shall occupy humbler or more retired positions . The sentences of some public speakers are so arranged , that what is collateral or incidental stands out boldly in the foreground , while the principal thought is almost lost in the shade ; an arrangement as preposterous as if , in the senate chamber , the forum or the parade-ground , the president , the judge or the commanding officer , were thrust into the rear , while a nameless throng of non-officials and incognitos should occupy the places of dignity and authority . Grammar should be taught in such a way as to lead out into rhetoric as it regards the form of the expression , and into logic as it regards the sequence and coherency of the thoughts . If this is so , then no person is competent to teach grammar who is not familiar at least with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by their constant habit of conversing with the pupils ; by requiring a complete answer to be given to every question ; by never allowing a mistake in termination , or in the collocation of words or clauses , to pass uncorrected , nor the sentence as corrected to pass unrepeated ; by requiring the poetry of the reading lesson to be changed into oral or written prose , and the prose to be paraphrased , or expressed in different words ; and by exacting a general account or summary of the reading lessons , are , as we may almost literally say , constantly teaching grammar ; or , as they more comprehensively call it , the German language . It is easy to see that Composition is included under this head , the writing of regular " essays " or " themes " being only a later exercise . /z/ Such excellent handwriting as I saw in the Prussian schools , I never saw before . I can hardly express myself too strongly on this point . In Great Britian , France , or in our own country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with theirs in this respect . I have befqre said that I found all children provided with a slate and penil . They write or print letters , and begin with the elements of drawing , either immediately , or very soon after they enter school . This furnishes the greater part of the explanation of their excellent handwriting . A part of it , I think , should be referred to the peculiarity of the German script , which seems to me to be easier than our own . But after all due allowance is made for this advantage , a high degree of superiority over the schools of other countries remain to be accounted for . This superiority can not be attributed in any degree to a better manner of holding the pen , for I never saw so great a proportion of cases in any schools where the pen was so awkwardly held . This excellence must be referred in a great degree to the universal practice of learning to draw , contemporaneously with learning to write . I believe a child will learn both to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will learn writing alone ; and for this reason : the figures or objects contemplated and copied in learning to draw , are larger , more marked , more distinctive one from another , and more sharply defined with projection , angle or curve , than the letters copied in writing . In drawing there is more variety , in writing more sameness . Now the objects contemplated in drawing , from their nature , attract attention more readily , impress the mind more deeply , and of course will be more accurately copied than those in writing . And when the eye has been trained to observe , to distinguish , and to imitate , in the first exercise , it applies its habits with great advantage to the second . Another reason is , that the child is taught to draw things with which he is familiar , which have some significance and give him pleasing ideas . But a child who is made , to fill page after page with rows of straight marks , that look so blank and cheerless though done ever so well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The practice of beginning with making inexpressive marks , or with writting unintelligible words , bears some reeemblane , in its lifeleesnees , to PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . gf that of learning the alphabet . Each exhales torpor and stupidity to deaden the vivacity of the worker . Again , I have found it an almost universal opinion with teachers of the art of writing , that children should commence with large hand rather than with fine . The reason for this I suppose to be , that where the letters themselves are larger , their differences and peculiarities are proportionally large ; hence they can be more easily discriminated , and discrimination must necessarily precede exact copying . So to speak , the child becomes acquainted with the physiognomy of the large letters more easily than with that of the small . Besides , the formation of the larger gives more freedom of motion to the hand . Now , in these respects , there is more difference between the objects used in drawing and the letters of a large hand , than between the latter and fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large hand , applies with still more force in favor of drawing . In the course of my tour , I passed from countries where almost every pupil in every school could draw with ease , and most of them with no inconsiderable degree of beauty and expression , to those where less and less attention was paid to the subject ; and , at last , to schools where drawing was not practiced at all ; and , after many trials , I came to the conclusion , that , with no other guide than a mere inspection of the copy books of the pupils , I could tell whether drawing were taught in the school or not ; so uniformly superior was the handwriting in those schools where drawing was taught in connection with it . On seeing this , I was reminded of that saying of Pestalozzi , somewhat too strong , that " without drawing there can be no writing . " But suppose it were otherwise , and that learning to draw retarded the acquisition of good penmanship , how richly would the learner be compensated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expressive and beautiful language . A few strokes of the pen or pencil will often represent to the eye what no amount of words , however well chosen , can communicate . For the master architect , for the engraver , the engineer , the pattern designer , the draughtsman , moulder , machine builder , or head mechanic of any kind , all acknowledge that this art is essential and indispensable . But there is no department of business or condition in life , where the accomplishment would not be of utility . Every man should be able to plot a field , to sketch a road or a river , to draw the outlines of a simple machine , a piece of household furniture , or a farming utensil , and to delineate the internal arrangement or construction of a house . But to be able to represent by lines and shadows what no words can depict , is only a minor part of the benefit of learning to draw . The study of this art develops the talent of observing , even more than that of delineating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to picture forth what he has observed , yet the power of observation should be cultivated by every rational being . The skillful delineator is not only able to describe far better what he has seen , but he sees twice as many things in the world as he would otherwise do . To one whose eyes have never been accustomed to mark the form , color or peculiarities of objects , all external nature is enveloped in a haze , which no sunshine , however bright , will ever dissipate . The light which dispels this obscurity must come from within . Teaching a child to draw , then , is the development in him of a new talent the conferring upon him , as it were , of a new sense by means of which he is not only better enabled to attend to the common duties of life , and to be more serviceable to his fellow-men , but he is more likely to appreciate the beauties and magnificence of nature , which every where reflect the glories of the Creator into his soul . " When accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this accomplishment becomes a quickener to devotion . With the inventive genius of our people , the art of drawing would be eminently useful . They would turn it to better account than any other people in the world . We now perform far the greater part of our labor by machinery . With the high wages prevalent amongst us , if such were not the case , our whole community would be impoverished . Whatever will advance the mechanic and manufacturing arts , therefore , is especially important here ; and whatever is important for men to know , as men , should be learned by children in the schools . But whatever may be said of the importance of this art , as it regards the community at large , its value to a school-teacher can hardly be estimated . /z/ If the first exercises in reading were taught as they should be ; if the squares of the multiplication table were first to be drawn on the blackboard , and then to be filled up by the pupils , as they should see on what reason the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught from the beginning , as it should be , by constant delineations upon the blackboard ; then every teacher , even of the humblest school , ought to be acquainted with the art of linear drawing , and be able toJbrm all the necessary figures and diagrams not only with correctness but with rapidity . But in teaching navigation , surveying , trigonometry , geometry , &c.; ; in describing the mechanical powers , in optics , in astronomy , in the various branches of natural philosophy , and especially in physiology , the teacher who has a command of this art , will teach incomparably better , and incomparably faster than if he were ignorant of it . I never saw a teacher in a German school make use of a ruler or any other mechanical aid , in drawing the most nice or complicated figures . I recollect no instance in which he was obliged to efface a part of a line because it was too long , or to extend it because it was too short . If squares or triangles were to be formed , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here was not only much time gained , or saved , but the pupils had constantly before their eyes these examples of celerity and perfectness , as models for imitation . No one can doubt how much more correctly , as well as more rapidly , a child 's mind will grow in view of such models of ease and accuracy , than if only slow , awkward , and clumsy movements are the patterns constantly held before it . I saw handwriting taught in various ways . The most common mode for young children was that of writing on the blackboard for their imitation . In such cases , the copy was always beautifully written , and the lesson preceded by instructions and followed by corrections . Another method which has had some currency in Germany , is this : If the mark to be copied is a simple straight line , thus , / / , the teacher says one , one , as words of command ; and at each enunciation of the word , the pupils make a mark simultaneously . The teacher accelerates or retards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has acquired . If the figure to be copied consists of an upward and downward stroke , thus , / / , the teacher says , one , two ; one , two , ( one for the upward , the other for the downward motion of the hand ; ) at first slowly , afterwards more rapidly . When the figure consists of three strokes , thus / , he pronounces one , tico , three , as before . Letters are formed in the same way . A supposed advantage of this method consists in its retarding the motions of those who would otherwise write too fast , and hastening those who would write too slow . But for these purposes , the teacher must see that all keep time , otherwise the advantage is lost . And , on the whole , there is so much difference between the natural quickness of perception and of motion in different pupils , that there can be no such thing as a universal standard . Some scholars , whose thoughts and muscles are of electric speed , would be embarrassed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep step , though the music played only common time . Neither in their physical nor in their spiritual natures , does the speed of children seem to have been graduated by any one clock : In the schools I saw , orthography , punctuation , and the use of capitals , were early connected with the exercise of writing . /z/ The practice seemed to be uniform , however , of beginning with objects perfectly familiar to the child ; the school-house with the grounds around it , the home with its yards or gardens , and the street leading from the one to the other . First of all , the children were initiated into the idea of space , without which we can know no more of geography than we can of history without ideas of time . Mr. Carl Ritter , of Berlin , probably the greatest geographer now Irving , expressed a decided opinion to me , that this was the true mode of beginning . Children , too , commence this study very early ; soon after entering school ; but no notions are giyen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduce , and express . I found geography taught almost wholly from large maps suspended against the PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . gg walls , and by delineations on the blackboard . And here , the skill of teachers and pupils in drawing did admirable service . The teacher traced the outlines of a country on the suspended map , or drew one upon the blackboard , accompanying the exhibition by an oral lecture ; and , at the next recitation , the pupils were expected to repeat what they had seen and heard . And , in regard to the natural divisions of the earth , or the politic.il boundaries of countries , a pupil was not considered as having giving any proof that he had a correct image in his mind , until he could go to the blackboard , and reproduce it from the ends of his fingers . I witnessed no lesson unaccompanied by these tests . I will describe , as exactly as I am able , a lesson which I heard given to a class a little advanced beyond the elements ; remarking that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of them were signalized by the rapidity and effect of the one I am about to describe . The teacher stood by the blackboard , with the chalk in his hand . After cast  - -  ing his eye over the class to see that all were ready , he struck at the middle of the board . With a rapidity of hand which my eye could hardly follow , he made a series of those short , divergent lines , or shadings , employed by map-engravers to represent a chain of mountains . He had scarcely turned an angle , or shot off a spur , when the scholars began to cry out , Carpathian mountains , Hungary ; Black Forest mountains , Wurtemberg ; Giant 's mountains , ( Riesen-Gebirge , ) Silesia ; Metallic mountains , ( Erz-Gebirge , ) Pine mountains , ( Fichtel-Gebirge v Central mountains , ( Mittel-Gebirge , ) Bohemia , &c.,; &c.; In less than half a minute , the ridge of that grand central elevation which separates the waters that flow north-west into the German ocean , from those that flow north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was presented to view ; executed almost as beautifully as an engraving . A dozen crinkling strokes , made in the twinkling of an eye , represented the head-waters of the great rivers which flow in different directions from that mountainous range , while the children , almost as eager and excited as though they had actually seen the torrents dashing down the mountain sides , cried out , Danube , Elbe , Vistula , Oder , &c.; The next moment I heard a succession of small strokes or taps , so rapid as to be almost indistinguishable , and hardly had my eye time to discern a large number of dots made along the margins of the rivers , when the shout of Lintz , Vienna , Prague , Dresden , Berlin , &c.,; struck my ear . At this point in the exercise , the spot which had been occupied on the blackboard was nearly a circle , of which the starting point , or place where the teacher first began , was the center ; but now a few additional strokes around the circumference of the incipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the children responding the names of the countries in which they respectively lay . With a few more flourishes the rivers flowed onwards toward their several terminations , and by another succession of dots , new cities sprang up along their banks . By this time the children had become as much excited as though they had been present at a world-making . They rose in their seats , they flung out both hands , their eyes kindled , and their voices became almost vociferous as they cried out the names of the different places , which , under the magic of the teacher 's crayon , rose into view . Within ten minutes from the commencement of the lesson , there stood upon the blackboard a beautiful map of Germany , with its mountains , principal rivers and cities , the coast of the German ocean , of the Baltic and the Black seas ; and all so accurately proportioned , that I think only slight errors would have been found had it been subjected to the test of a scale of miles . A part of this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils ; for the teacher 's mind seemed to be in his ear as well as in his hand , and notwithstanding the astonishing celerity of his movements , he detected erroneous answers and turned round to correct them . The rest of the recitation consisted in questions and answers respecting productions , climate , soil , animals , &c.,; &c.; Many of the cosmogonists suppose that after the creation of the world , and when its whole surface was as yet fluid , the solid continents rose gradually from beneath the sea : first the loftiest peak of the Andes , for instance , emerged from the deep , and as they reached a higher and a higher point of elevation , the rivers began to flow down their sides , until at last the lofty mountains having attained their height , the mighty rivers their extent and volume , and the continent it /z/ amplitude cultivation began , and cities and towns were built . The lesson I have described was &; beautiful illustration of that idea , with one advantage over the original scene itself , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epochs to see the work completed . Compare the effect of such a lesson as this , both as to the amount of the knowledge communicated , and the vividness and of course the permanence of the ideas obtained , with a lesson where the scholars look out a few names of places on a lifeless atlas , but never send their imaginations abroad over the earth ; and where the teacher sits listlessly down before them to interrogate them from a book , in which all the questions are printed at full length , to supersede on his part all necessity of knowledge . /z/ In the " Study-Plans " of all the schools in the north of Prussia , I found most , and in some of them all of the above subjects of lessons . To each was assigned its separate hour and place in the routine of exercises . For brevity 's sake , however , and because the topics naturally run into each other , I shall attempt to describe them together . These lessons consisted of familiar conversations between teacher ahd pupils , on subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter . With the youngest classes , things immediately around them ; the school-room and the materials of which it had been built ; its different parts , as foundation , floor , walls , ceiling , roof , windows , doors , fireplace ; its furniture and apparatus ; its books , slates , paper ; the clothes of the pupils , and the materials from which they were made ; their food and play-things ; the duties of children to animals , to each other , to their parents , neighbors , to the old , to their Maker ; these are specimens of a vast variety of subjects embraced under one or another of the above heads . As the children advanced in age and attainments , and had acquired full and definite notions of the visible and tangible existences around them , and also of time and space , so that they could understand descriptions of the unseen and the remote , the scope of these lessons was enlarged , so as to take in the different kingdoms of nature , the arts , trades and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . When visiting the schools in Leipsic , I remarked to the superintendent , that most accomplished educationist , Dr. Vogel , that I did not see on the " StudyPlan " of his schools , the title , " Exercises in Thinking . " His reply was , " No ; for I consider it a sin in any teacher not to lead his pupil to think , in regard to all the subjects he teaches . " He did not call it an omission or even a disqualification in a teacher , if he did not awaken thought in the minds of his pupils , but he peremptorily denounced it as a " sin . " Alas ! thought I , what expiation will be sufficient for many of us who have had charge of the young ! It is obvious from the account I have given of these primary lessons , that there is no restriction as to the choice of subjects , and no limits to the extent of information that may be engrafted upon them . What more natural than that a kind teacher should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a brisk , eager-minded boy just entering his school , by speaking to him about the domestic animals which he plays with , or tends at home ; the dog , the cat , the sheep , the horse , the cow ? Yet , without any interruption or overleaping of natural boundaries , this simple lesson may be expanded into a knowledge of all quadrupeds , their characteristics and habits of life , the uses of their flesh , skins , fur , bones , horns , or ivory , the parts of the world where they live , &c.,; &c.; So if a teacher begins to'converse with a boy about domestic fowls , there is no limit , save in his own knowledge , until he has exausted the whole subject of ornithology ; the varieties of birds , their plumage , their uses , their migratory habits , &c.,; &c.; What more natural than that a benevolent teacher should ask a blushing little girl about the flowers in her vases , or garden at home ? and yet , this having been done , the door is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers of all the seasons , and all the zones , to the trees cultivated ' by the hand of man , or the primeval forests that darken the face of continents . Few children go to school who have not seen a fish ; at least , a minnow in a pool . Begin with this , and /z/ nature opposes no barrier until the wonders of the deep are exhausted . Let the school-house , as I have said , be the first lesson , and to a mind replenished with knowledge , not only all the different kinds of edifices the dwelling-house , the church , the court-house , the piilace , the temple are at once associated ; but all the different orders of architecture , Corinthian , Ionic , Doric , Egyptian , Gothic , &c.,; rise to the view . How many different materials have been brought together for the construction of the school-house ; stone , wood , nails , glass , bricks , mortar , paints , materials used in glazing , &o.,; &c.; Each one of these belongs to a different department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set foot in any one of these provinces , he sees a thousand interesting objects around him . as it were soliciting his attention . Then each one of these materials has its artificer ; and thus all the mechanical trades may be brought under consideration 5 the house builder 's , the mason 's , the plumber 's , the glazier 's , the locksmith 's &c.; A single article may be viewed under different aspects- ; as , in speaking of a lock , one may consider the nature and properties of iron ; its cohesiveuess , malleability , &c.,; its utility , or the variety of utensils into which it may be wrought ; or the conversation may be turned to the particular object and uses of the lock , and upon these a lesson on the rights of property , the duty of honesty , the guilt of theft and robbery , &c.,; be engrafted . So in speaking of the beauties and riches and wonders of nature of the revolution of the seasons , the glory of spring , the exuberance of autumn , the grandeur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's mind may be turned to a contemplation of the power and goodness of God . I found these religious aspects of nature to be most frequently adverted to ; and was daily delighted with the reverent and loving manner in which the name of the Deity was always spoken , " Der liebe Gott , " the dear God , was the universal form of expression ; and the name of the Creator of heaven and earth was hardly ever spoken , without this epithet of endearment . It is easy also to see that a description of the grounds about the school-house or the paternal mansion , and of the road leading from one of these places to the other , is the true starting point of all geographical knowledge ; and , this once begun , there is no terminus , until all modern and ancient geography , and all travels and explorations by sea and land , are exhausted . So the boy 's nest of marbles may be the nucleus of all mineralogy ; his top , his kite , his little wind-wheel or water-wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stories he has heard about the last king or the aged king , the first chapter in universal history . I know full well that the extent and variety of subjects said to be taught to young children in the Prussian schools , have been often sneered at . In a late speech , made on a public occasion , by one of the distinguished politicians in our country , the idea of teaching the natural sciences in our common schools was made a theme for ridicule . Let it be understood in what manner an accomplished teacher may impart a great amount of useful knowledge on these subjects , and perhaps awaken minds which may hereafter adorn the age , and benefit mankind by their discoveries , and it will be easily seen to which party the ridicule most justly attaches . . " What , " says the objectors , " teach children botany , and the unintelligible and almost unspeakable names , Monandria , Diandria , Triandria , &c.; ; or zoology , with such technical terms as Mollusca , Crustacea , Vertebrata , Mammalia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not thus taught . For years , their lessons are free from all the technicalities of science . The knowledge they already possess about common things is made the nucleus around which to collect more ; and the language with which they are already familiar becomes the medium through which to communicate new ideas , and by which , whenever necessary , to explain new terms . There is no difficulty in explaining to a child , seven years of age , the distinctive marks by which nature intimates to us , at first sight , whether a plant is healthful or poisonous ; or those by which , on inspecting the skeleton of an animal that lived thousands of years ago , we know whether it lived upon grass , or grain , or flesh . It is in this way that the pupil 's mind is carried forward by an actual knowledge of things , until the time arrives for giving him classifications and nomenclatures . When a child knows a great many particular or individual things , he begins to perceive resemblances between some of them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in /z/ his mind , and arrange themselves into different groups . Then , by the aid of a teacher , he perfects a scientific classification among them , bringing into each group all that belong to it . But soon the number of individuals in each group becomes so numerous , that he wants a cord to tie them together , or a vessel in which to hold them . Then , from the nomenclature of science , he receives a name which binds all the individuals of that group into one , ever afterwards . It is now that he perceives the truth and the beauty of classification and nomenclature . An infant that has more red and white beads than it can hold in its hands , and to prevent them from rolling about the floor and being lost , collects them together , putting the white in one cup and the red in another , and sits and smiles at its work , has gone through with precisely the same description of mental process that Cuiver and Linneus did , when they summoned the vast varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and commanded the countless hosts to arrange themselves into their respective genera , orders , and species . Our notions respecting the expediency or propriety of introducing the higher branches , as they are called , into our common schools , are formed from a knowledge of our own school teachers , and of the habits that prevail in most of the schools themselves . With us , it too often happens that if a higher branch , geometry , natural philosophy , zoology , botany , is to be taught , both teacher and class must have text-books . At the beginning of these text-books , all the technical names and definitions belonging to the subject are set down . These , before the pupil has an practical idea of their meaning , must be committed to memory . The book is then studied chapter by chapter . At the bottom of each page , or at the ends of the sections , are questions printed at full length . At the recitations , the teacher holds on by these leading-strings . He Introduces no collateral knowledge . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other kindred subjects , or the actual business of men and the affairs of life . At length the day of examination comes . The pupils rehearse from memory with a suspicious fluency ; or , being asked for some useful application of their knowledge , some practical connection between that knowledge and the concerns of life , they are silent , or give some ridiculous answer , which at once disparages science and gratifies the ill-humor of some ignorant satirist . Of course , the teaching of the higher branches falls into disrepute in the minds of all sensible men , as , under such circumstances , it ought to do . But the Prussian teacher has no book . He needs none . He teaches from a full mind . He cumbers and darkens the subject with no technical phraseology . He observes what proficiency the child has made , and then adapts his instructions , both in quality and amount , to the necessity of the case . He answers all questions . He solves all doubts . It is one of his objects , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall start doubts and provoke questions . He connects the subject of each lesson with all kindred and collateral ones ; and shows its relations to the every-day duties and business of life ; and should the most ignorant man , or the most destitute vagrant in society , ask him " of what use such knowledge can be ? " he will prove to him , in a word , that some of his own pleasures or means of subsistence are dependent upon it , or have been created or improved by it . In the meantime , the children are delighted . Their preceptive powers are exercised . Their reflecting faculties are developed . Their moral sentiments are cultivated . All the attributes of the mind within , find answering qualities in the world without . Instead of any longer regarding the earth as a huge mass of dead matter , without variety and without life , its beautiful and boundless diversities of substance , its latent vitality and energies , gradually drawn forth , until , at length , they illuminate the whole soul , challenging its admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their Creator . There are other points pertaining to the qualification of teachers , which would perhaps strike a visitor or spectator more strongly than the power of giving the kind of lessons I have described ; but probably there is nothing which , at the distance of four thousand miles , would give to a reader or hearer so adequate an idea of intelligence and capacity , as a full understanding of the scope and character of this class of exercises . Suppose , on the one hand , a teacher to be introduced into a school , who is competent to address children on this great range and variety of subjects , and to address them in such a manner as to arouse their curi- /z/ osity , command their attention , and supply them not only with knowledge , bat with an inextinguishable love for it ; suppose such a teacher to be able to give one , and sometimes two such lessons a day , that is , from two hundred to four hundred lessons in a year , to the same class , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight years schooling . On the other hand , suppose a young man coming fresh from the plow , the workshop , or the anvil ; or , what is no better , from Greek and Latin classics , and suppose his knowledge on the above enumerated subjects to be divided into four hundred , or even into two hundred parts , and that only one two-hundredth portion of that stock of knowledge should be administered to the children in a day . Let us suppose all this , and we shall have some more adequate idea of the different advantages of children , at the present time , in different parts of the world . In Prussia , the theory , and the practice under it , are , not that three years ' study under the best masters qualifies a talented and devoted man to become a teacher , but that three years ' of such general preparation may qualify one for that particular and daily preparation which is to be made before meeting a class in school . And a good Prussian teacher no more thinks of meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer or clergyman amongst ourselves would think of managing a cause before court and jury , or preaching a sermon , without special reading and forethought . It is easy to see , from the above account , how such a variety of subjects can be taught simultaneously in school , without any interference with each other ; nay , that the " common bond , " which , as Cicero says , binds all sciences together , should only increase their unity as it enlarges their number . /z/ Nothing receives more attention in the Prussian schools than the Bible . It is taken up early and studied systematically . The great events recorded in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament ; the character and lives of those wonderful men , who , from age to age , were brought upon the stage of action , and through whose agency the future history and destiny of the race were to be so much modified ; and especially , those sublime views of duty and of morality which are brought to light in the Gospel , these are topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To these , in some schools , is added the history of the Christian religion , in connection with cotemporary civil history . So far as the Bible lessons are concerned , I can ratify the strong statements made by Professor Stowe , in regard to the absence of sectarian instruction , or endeavors at proselytism . The teacher being amply possessed of a knowledge of the whole chain of events , and of all biographical incidents ; and bringing to the exercise a heart glowing with love to man , and with devotion to his duty as a former of the character of children , has no necessity or occasion to fall back upon the formulas of a creed . It is when a teacher has no knowledge of the wonderful works of God , and of the benevolence of the design in which they were created ; when he has no power of explaining and applying the beautiful incidents in the lives of prophets and apostles , and especially , the perfect example which is given to men in the life of Jesus Christ ; it is then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , as it were , constrained to recur again and again to the few words or sentences of his form of faith , whatever that faith may be ; and , therefore , when giving the second lesson , it will be little more than a repetition of the first , and the two-hundredth lesson , at the end of the year , will differ from that at the beginning only in accumulated wearisomeness and monotony . There are one or two facts , however , which Professor Stowe has omitted to mention , and without a knowledge of which , one would form very erroneous ideas respecting the character of some of the religious instruction in the Prussian schools . In all the Protestant schools , Luther 's Catechism is regularly taught ; and in all the Roman Catholic schools , the Catechism of that communion . When the schools are mixed , they have combined literary with seperate religious instruction ; and here all the doctrines of the respective denominations are taught early and most assiduously . I well remember hearing a Roman Catholic priest inculcating upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He illustrated it with the miracle of the water changed to wine , at the marriage feast in Cana ; and said that he who could turn water into wine , could turn his own /z/ blood into the same element , and also his body into bread to be eaten with it Contrary , then , to the principles of our own law , sectarianism is taught in all Prussian schools ; but it is nevertheless true , as Professor Stowe says , that the Bible can be taught , and is taught , without it . All Prussian teachers are masters not only of vocal , but of instrumental music , One is as certain to see a violin as a blackboard , in every school-room . Generally speaking , the teachers whom 1 saw , played upon the organ also , and some of them upon the piano and other instruments . Music was not only taught in school as an accomplishment , but used as a recreation . It is a moral means of great efficacy . Its practice promotes health ; it disarms anger , softens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole mind , as it were , into a state of fusion , from which condition the teacher can mould it into what forms he will , as it c " is and hardens . All these subjects I have enumerated , were taught in all the schools I visited , whether in city or country , for the rich or for the poor . In the lowest school in the smallest and obscurest village , or for the poorest class in over-crowded cities ; in the schools connected with pauper establishments , with houses of correction or with prisons , in all these , there was a teacher of mature age , of simple unaffected and decorous manners , benevolent in his expression , kind and genial in his intercourse with the young , and of such attainments and resources as qualified him not only to lay down the abstract principles of the above range of studies , but , by familiar illustration and apposite example , to commend them to the attention of the children . Although the foregoing account of primary instruction in Germany , was drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is. in its main features , applicable to primary schools in the other German States . On this point . Mr. Kay bears the following emphatic testimony in his valuable contribution to our knowledge of the social and educational condition of Europe* a work , from which we shall have occasion to quote largely in giving an account of the school systems of Switzerland and the several German States . In Bavaria , Wirtemburg , the Duchy of Baden , and Nassau , as much , and in Wirtemberg and Baden perhaps even more , has been done to promote the intell ; gence , morality , and civilization of the lower orders of society , than in Prussia . In each of these countries , every village has a good school-house , and at least one learned and practically efficient teacher , who has been educated for several years at a college ; every town has several well-organized schools , sufficiently large to receive all the children of the town , who are between the ages of six and fourteen ; each of these schools contains from four to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a highly educated teacher . In each of these countries , every parent is obliged to educate his children , either at home or at some school , - the choice of means being left to himself . In none of these countries are children left to grow up in vicious ignorance or with debasing habits . In none of these countries , is there any class of children analogous to that , which swarms in the back streets , alleys , and gutters of our great cities and towns , and from which our paupers , our disaffected , and our criminals grow up , and from which our u ragged schools " are filled . All the children are intelligent , polite , clean , and neatly dressed , and grow up from their sixth to their fourteenth year under the teaching and influence of educated men . /z/ In each of these countries a sufficient number of normal colleges has been founded , to enable it to educate a sufficient supply of teachers for the parishes and towns . In each of these countries , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as public , are open to public inspection , and are visited several times every year by learned men , svhose business it is to examine both teachers and scholars , and to give the government , the chambers , and the country , a full and detailed account of the state , condition , character , and progress of every school , so that parents may know where to send their children with safety ; that good teachers may be encouraged , rewarded , and promoted ; and that unworthy teachers may not be suffered to continue long in their situations . In each of these countries , the laws prohibit any person being a teacher of any school , until he . has proved his efficiency to the committee of professors , appointed by the state to examine candidates , and until he has laid before such committee testimonials of character from his religious minister , his neighbors , and the professors of the college at which he was educated . I can give a traveler , who is desirous of comprehending at one short view the workings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better advice than to direct him to notice the state of the streets in any German or Swiss town , which he happens to visit ; no matter where it be , whether on the plains of Prussia or Bavaria , on the banks of the Rhine , in the small towns of the Black Forrest , or in the mountainous cantons of Alpine Switzerland , no matter where , let him only walk through the streets of such a town in the morning or the afternoon , and count the number of children to be found there above the age of four or five , or let him stand in the same streets , when the children are going to or returning from the schools , and let him examine their cleanly appearance , the good quality , the excellent condition , and the cleanliness of their clothing , the condition of the lesson books they are carrying , the happiness and cheerfulness , and , at the same time , the politeness and ease of their manners ; he will think he sees the children of the rich ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that many of them are the offspring of the poorest artizans and laborers of the town . If that one spectacle does not convince him of the magnitude of the educational efforts of Germany , and of the happy results which they are producing , let him go no further , for nothing he can further see will teach him . Let him then come home , and rejoice in the condition of our poor ; but , should he start at this extraordinary spectacle , as I have seen English travelers do , to whom I have pointed out this sign of advanced and advancing civilization , let him reflect , that this has been effected , spite of all the obstacles which impede ourselves . Bigotry and ignorance have cried their loudest ; Romanists have refused co-operation with Protestants , Protestants with Romanists , and yet they have co-operated . There has been the same strong jealousy of all government interference , the same undefined and illdigested love of liberty , and there has been the same selfish fear of retarding the development of physical resources . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants ; in Argovie , opposition has been raised by the manufacturers ; in Lucerne , by the religious parties , and by the political opponents of the government ; and in Baden , the difficulties have been aggravated by the numbers of Jews , whom both Romanists and Protestants hated to receive into alliance , even more than they disliked to co-operate among themselves . But in all these countries the great principle has finally triumphed ; and all parties have yielded some little of their claims , in the full conviction , that a day is dawning upon Europe , fraught with the most overwhelming evils for that country which has not prepared for its approach . Whether the methods by which any of these different countries are carrying out their great design , are in any way applicable to this country or not , I shall not stop to consider , my desire being merely to show how different countries , with different degrees of political freedom , with different political constitutions , whose people profess different religious tenets , where Protestants of different sects , Roman Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proportion , have all managed to overcome difficulties precisely similar to those which stand in our way , and have all agreed to labor together to educate their poor . For it is a great fact , however much we may be inclined to doubt it , that throughout Prussia , /z/ Saxony , Bavaria , Bohemia , Wirtemburg , Baden , Hesse Darmstadt , Hesse Caasel , Gotha , Nassau , Hanover , Denmark , Switzerland , Norway , and the Austrian Empire , ALL the children are actually , at this present time , attending school , and are receiving a careful , religious , moral , and intellectual education , from highly educated and efficient teachers . Over the vast tract of country , which I have mentioned , as well as in Holland and the greater part of France , all the children above six years of age are daily acquiring useful knowledge and good habits under the influence of moral , religious , and learned teachers . ALL the youth of the greater part of these countries , below the age of twenty-one years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible history , and the history of their own country . No children are left idle and dirty in the streets of the towns ; there is no class of children to be compared ' , in any respect , to the children who frequent our Dragged schools ; " all the children , even of the poorest parents , are , in a great part of these countries , in dress , appearance , cleanliness , and manners , as polished and civilized as the children of our middle classes ; the children of the poor in Germany are so civilized that the rich often send their children to the schools intended for the poor ; and , lastly , in a great part of Germany and Switzerland , the children of the poor are receiving a better education than that given in England to the children of the greater part of our middle classes ! These facts deserve to be well considered . And let it be remembered that these great results have been attained , notwithstanding obstacles at least as great as those which make it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which hinder us ? Look at Austria , Bavaria , and the Prussian Rhine provinces , and the Swiss cantons of Lucerne and Soleure . " Will any one say , that the religious difficulties in those countries are less than those which exist in our own ? Is the sectarianism of the Jesuits of Lucerne , or of the priests of Bavaria , of a more yielding character toward the Protestant " heretics , " than that of one Protestant party in England toward another ? And yet , in each of these countries , the difficulties arising from religious differences have been overcome , and all their children are brought under the influence of a religious education , without any religious party having been offended . But are they political causes , which prevent us proceeding in this great work , in which nearly all Europe has so long preceded us , notwithstanding that we need it more than all the European nations put together ? Are they political causes , I ask ? I answer by again referring my readers to the countries I have enumerated . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the people who rule and legislate ; under the constitutional governments of Saxony , Wirtemburg , and Baden , which were framed more or less upon the English model , and where the people have long had a direct influence upon the government ; under the constitutional governments of France and Holland , and under all the different grades of absolute rule which existed but a few months since hi Prussia , the German dukedoms , and the Austrian states , the difficulties of the question have long been overcome , and with such entire satisfaction to all parties , that among the present representatives of the people , no member has ever been heard to express a desire for the change of the laws which relate to primary education . But once again ; perhaps there are some who say , but there is no country which is troubled , as we are , by the union of both religious and political difficulties . I again refer my readers to the cases of Holland and Switzerland . They will find in these countries the same strong love of independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly . They will find also , not only strong religious feuds existing among the Protestants themselves , and pushed to the most shameful extremities , as in the case of the canton of Vaud , from which one religious party has lately been driven as exiles , but they will find the still more formidable differences of the Protestants and Catholics arrayed against each other , and seemingly preventing all union on any subject whatsoever ; and yet , in all these various countries , differing as they do in the state of their religious parties , and of their political regulations , in all of them , I say , have all parties consented to join on this one great and important question , THE EDUCATION OF THE PEOPLE . But there are some who say , that if our means of direct education are worse , yet that our means of indirect education are better than those of other countries , and that if our people have not schools and good teachers , they have long had a /z/ free press , the right of assembling together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good reports of all the debates of our Houses of Legislature , and a literature free in its spirit , suggestive in its writings , and any thing but one-sided in its views of political and social questions , %id that all this serves to stimulate the intellectual energies of the people . As far as regards the middle ( lasers , . this is all very true ; but , as regards the poor , it is ridiculously false . Most of our poor are either wholly without education , or else possess so little as to be entirely out of the sphere of such influences , as those I have enumerated . What good can one of our boorish peasants gain from cheap literature , free parliamentary debates , free discussion , and liberal journals ? What advantage is it to a starving man that there is bread in the baker 's shop , if lie has not wherewith to buy ? What good is cheap literature and free discussion to a poor peasant who can neither read nor think ? He starves in the midst of plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is utterly false to argue that the peasants would provide themselves with schools and education , if education would improve their condition in society . We can never hope to see the peasants supply themselves with schools . They never have done so in any country , they never will do so in our own . Such a step implies in them a great prior development of the intellectual and moral faculties ; a development which can only be obtained by means of education . The peasants are neither wise enough , nor rich enough , to erect or support schools for themselves , and should government refuse either to do it for them , or to oblige all classes to assist the poor to accomplish this great work , we may rest assured that another century will see no further advances than we have made at present ; our schools are for the most part totally unfitted for their purpose , and our teachers the most ignorant , ill-paid , and least respected set of men in the community . Other countries have long since recognized these truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been devoting most of our energies to the increase of our national wealth , the Germans and Swiss have been engaged in the noble undertaking of attempting to raise the character and social position of their poorer classes . To effect this , they have not vainly imagined that schools alone were sufficient , but to the accomplishment of this great end , every social institution and every social regulation has been rendered subservient . They began , it is true , by raising schools , and educating teachers ; but they have continued this great work by reforming their prisons and criminal codes ; by facilitating the transfer and division of their lands ; by simplifying their legal processes ; by reforming their ecclesiastical establishments ; by entirely changing the mediaeval and illiberal constitutions of their universities and public schools ; by improving the facilities of internal communication ; and , lastly , by opening the highest and most honorable offices of the state to all worthy aspirants , no matter of how low an origin . Nor have their labors in the cause of social reform diminished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary , to a traveler in these countries , who has not acquainted himself with all that has been going on there for the last thirty years , they would seem to be only now commencing , so vigorous and universal are the efforts which are at this moment being made . It is doubtless true , that the social polity of a country should be so ordered , that the whole life of any of its members should be a progressive and continued religious , moral , and intellectual education ; but it is no less certain that this great work , if it is Aver to have a commencement , must begin at home , and be continued , in the case of the peasant , in the village school , under the superintendence of the religious minister and village teacher , or it can never be accomplished at all . True it is , that at first the evil influence of the home will be stronger than the good one of the teacher and the school . But still , if he understand the conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those principles which , it may be , lie dormant , but which nevertheless exist in every child 's mind , and which , if once aroused , would be certain in some degree to mitigate the evil influences of home . Thus might we hope , that the cottage firesides of the next generation would prove less inj urious than those of the present to the children , who will cluster around them , and that the school would have an auxiliary , and not an antagonist , in the powerful , though now . alas ! too often misdirected influences of home . It is only when we have attained this happy result , that we can hope to realize the full bene- Jy PRIMARY SCHOOLS OF GERMANY . fits which education is capable of conferring , and which , in other lands , it is at this day coui'erring upon the people . So long as the early domestic training is in direct opposition to the education of the schools , so loi must the improvement in education be very slow ; but , however slow , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of a vicious domestic training , and of cleansing the very fount of immorality . The laborer is occupied from twilight on to twilight , and the religious ministers have but few opportunities of bringing higher influences to bear upon him . Those , too , who most need improvement , are generally the most unwilling to receive it ; and those whose homes act most injuriously on the younger inmates , are precisely those , who oppose most strenuously the entry of the religious minister , and who are most rarely brought under any ennobling influence whatever . Thus it often happens , that the only way by which we can introduce reform into a home , is through the children ; for . most happily , there is among the poor such a great idea of the benefits to be derived from education , that it very rarely happens that the parent can not be persuaded to send his child to school , when he is enabled to do so . It is delightful to see how thoroughly this truth has been recognized in Western Europe , l-'rom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the great Alpine range , and from the Rhine to the Danube , all the children of both rich and poor are receiving daily instruction , under the surveillance of their religious ministers , from long and most carefully educated teachers . Throughout the plains of Prussia , Bohemia , and Bavar ; a , among the hills and woods of Saxony and central Germany , in the forests and rich undulating lands of Virtemburg and Baden , in the deep and secluded Alpine valleys of Switzerland and the Tyrol , in must of the provinces of the Austrian empire , throughout Holland , Denmark , and almost the whole of i rance , and even in the plains of Italian JLombardy , there is scarcely a single parish , which does not possess its school-house and its one or two teachers . The school buildings are often built in really an extravagant manner ; and in Switzerland and South Germany , the village school is generally the finest erection of the neighborhood . In the towns the expenditure on these monuments of a nation 's progress is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unite several schools for the sake of forming one complete one . This is generally erected on the following plan : A large house is built of three or four stories in height , with commodious play yards behind . The one or two upper stories are used as apartments for the teachers ; the lower rooms are set apart for the different classes . A town school has generally from eight to ten , and sometimes twelve or fourteen , of these class-rooms , each of which is capable of containing from 80 to 100 children . An educated teacher is appointed to manage each class , so that there is generally a staff of at least eight teachers connected with each town school of Germany , and I have seen schools with as many as twelve and fourteen teachers . The rooms are filled with desks , maps , and all the apparatus which the teachers can require for the purposes of instruction . I gener. - ally noticed , on entering a small German or Swiss town , that next to the church , the finest building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . It is impossible to estimate the enormous outlay which Germany has devoted to the erection and improvement of school-houses alone , during the last fifteen years . In the towns , hardly any of the old and inefficient buildings now remain , except where they have been improved and enlarged . In Munich , I directed my conductor to lead me to the worst school buildings in the city , and I found all the class-rooms measuring fourteen feet high by about twenty-five square , and ten of such class-rooms in each school-house , each of which rooms was under the constant direction of an educated teacher . In whatever town 1 happened to be staying , I always sought out the worst , in preference to the best schools . In Berlin , the worst I could find contained four class-rooms , each eight feet in height , and about fifteen feet square ; and in the Grand Duchy of Baden I found that the Chambers had passed a law- prohibiting any school-house being built , the rooms of which were not fourteen feet high . Throughout Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials of popular instruction . This could never liave been effected had not the expenses of such an immense /z/ undertaking been equally distributed over all the parishes of the different states . The burden being thus divided amongst all , is not lelt by any ; but had the government started in the vain hope of being able to bear even a third of the expen. -r , popular education would have been no further advanced in Germany than in England . But wiser , or mure interested in the real success of the undertaking than ourselves , the governments of the different states have obliged each province to provide for the expenses necessary for its own primary education . The systems , so far from having been systems of uxcessive centralization , leaving no freedom of action to the parishes , have been always and still are essentially parochial systems , merely under the surveillance , and subject to the check of the central authority . It is the parishes and towns , which tax themselves for educational purposes ; it is the parishioners and citizens , who elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who pay their own teachers , and provide all the materials for the education of their own poor : it is the parishioners and citizens , who determine whether they will have separate schools for their different religious sects , or common schools for them all ; it is the parishioners , who choose the sites of their school-houses , and the outlay they will make on their erection ; and c-.lihough they have not the power of dismissing a teacher alter they have once Iccted him , without first showing to government a sufficient ground for such a step , yet they are afforded every facility of forwarding any complaints they may have to make of any teacher they have elected , to the educational authorities appointed to judge such matters , and to protect the teachers from the effects of mere personal animosities or ignorance . Germany will one day be lauded by all Europe , as the inventor of a system securing , in the best possible manner , guidance by the greatest intelligence of the Country , the cheapest manner of working , the fostering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance of the religious ministers . L'isputes about separate or mixed schools are unheard of in Prussia , because every parish is left to please itself which kind it will adopt . One of the leading Roman Catholic Counsellors of the Educational Bureau in Berlin assured me , that they never experienced any difficulty on this point . " We always , " he said , ' ' encourage separate schools when possible , as we think religious instruction can be promoted better in separate than in mixed schools ; but , of course , we all think it better to have mixed schools , than to have no schools at all ; and when we can not have separate schools we are rejoiced to see the religious sects uniting in the support of a. mixed one . When mixed schools are decided on by the parochial committees , the teacher is elected by the most numerous of the two sects ; or , if two teachers are required , one is elected by one sect , and the other by the other : and in this case each conducts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when only one teacher is elected , the children of those parents , who differ from him in religious belief , are permitted to be taken from the school during the religious lessons , on condition that their parents make arrangements for their religious instruction by their own ministers . " I went to Prussia with the firm expectation , that I should hear nothing but complaints from the peasants , and that I should find the school nothing but a worthy offshoot of an absolute government . To test whether this really was the case or not , as well as to see something of the actual working of the system in the country districts , I traveled alone through different parts of the Rhine provinces fo. 1 four weeks before proceeding to the capital . During the whole of my solitary ra.nbles , I put myself as much as possible into communication with the peasants and with the teachers , for the purpose of testing the actual state of feeling on this question . Judge , then , of my surprise , when I assure my readers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , and with both Romanists and Protestants , and although I always endeavored to elicit expressions of discontent , I never once heard , in any part of Prussia , one word spoken by any of the peasants against the educational regulations . But on the contrary , I every where received daily and hourly proofs , of the most unequivocal character , of the satisfaction and real pride with which a Prussian , however poor he may be , looks upon the schools of his locality . Often and often have I been answered by the poor laborers , when asking them whether they did not dislike being obliged to educate their children , " Why should /z/ I ? The schools are excellent ; the teachers are very learned and good men ; and then think how much good our children are gaining ; they behave better at home , they make our families all the happier , and they are much better able in after-life ID earn their own livelihood . No , no ; we do not dislike the schools . We know too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have heard this said over and over again in different parts of Prussia , Saxony , Bavaria , Wirtemburg , and Baden ; and , indeed , I may add , that throughout Germany , I never heard one single vo " d of discontent uttered against these truly liberal and Christian establishments . Every one of the richer classes , with whom I conversed corroborated the truth of all that the peasants had told me . I particularly remember a very intelligent teacher at Elberfeld saying ' to me , ' ' I am quite convinced that , if we had a political revolution to-morrow , none of the peasants would think of wishing to have any great alteration made in the laws which relate to the schools . " Recent facts have proved the truth of the assertion. * Several travelers have fallen into the strangest errors in their investigations on this subject , from having confined their attention to the schools of the capitals , or of one or two other large towns . Very few have seen the working of the system in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a fair idea can be formed of the effects it is producing , and of the manner in which it is regarded by the people themselves . * A remarkable proof of the truth of these remarks is , that since the commencement of the German revolutions of 1848 , the only change in the educational regulations , which has been demanded by the people , is , that they should be allowed to send their children to the parochial schools free of all expense , and tnat the present small weekly pence required from the parents for the education of each child should be paid out of the regular parochial school rates . This has been conceded , and the peasants themselves will now as rigorously enforce the compulsory educational regulations , as the Swiss peasants enforce laws at least as stringent . /z/ THE system of Public Instruction in Prussia embraces three degrees , provided for in three classes of institutions . 1 . Primary or Elementary Instruction , conveyed in schools corresponding to our common schools . 2 . Secondary Instruction , provided for in Gymnasia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , communicated in the Universities . We shall confine our attention to Primary Instruction , and shall present a general idea of the system from various authorities. * As early as the reign of the Elector Joachim the Second , before the kingdom of Prussia existed , except as the Mark of Brandenburg , ( 1540 , ) visitors were appointed to inspect the town schools of the Electorate , with express directions to report in relation to the measures deemed necessary for their improvement . In 1545 , the same elector appointed a permanent council or board , on church and school matters . In a decree of some length , by the elector John George , ( 1573 , ) special sections are devoted to the schools , to teachers and their assistants , and to pupils . It is remarkable as containing a provision for committees of superintendence , consisting of the parish clergyman , the magistrates and two notables , exactly similar in constitution to the present school committees . In 1777 , a decree of Frederick William the First , king of Prussia , enjoins upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment of teachers , for the education of poor children , and for catechetical instruction by the parochial clergymen . In 1735 , the first regular seminary for teachers in Prussia was established at Stettin , in Pomerania . To induce a better attendance at school , a decree of 1736 requires that the parent of every child between five and twelve years of age , shall pay a certain fee , whether his child goes to school or not ; this rule being , as it were , preliminary to the present one of forced attendance . The same decree refers to school-houses erected by associated parishes , showing , that such associations existed previously to the decree for providing public schools ; similar associations may even now exist , but they are not numerous , forming exceptions to the general rule requiring each parish to have its public school . The decree provides further for the amount of fees to be paid to the teacher by the pupils , the church , or the state , and for aid to peasants who have more than two children above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees of all over this number from a school fund . A rescript of 1738 , constitutes the clergy the inspectors of schools . Bacbe 's " Report on Education in Europe .

This decree requires that teachers shall be regularly examined by the inspectors of schools before being allowed to teach , and prescribes their acquirements in detail . It directs the opening and closing of the schools with prayers ; fixes the hours of daily attendance at from eight to eleven , or seven to tenin the morning , and one to three in the afternoon ; prescribes instruction in spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regulates the emoluments and perquisites of the master . A new impulse was given to public instruction under the reign of Frederick the Great . The regulations drawn up by Hecker , and approved by the king . ( 1763 , ) are very precise , and though they have been in part superseded by later decrees , many of their provisions are still in force . They provide for the selection of school books by the consistory ; that children shall be sent to school at five years of age , and be kept there until thirteen or fourteen , or until they have made satisfactory attainments in reading and writing , in the knowledge of Christian doctrine , and of such matters as are to be found in their text-books ; fix the school-hours , requiring six hours a day for instruction in winter , and three in summer , and one hour of catechetical instruction , besides the Sunday teaching ; require that all unmarried persons of the parish shall attend the hour of instruction in the catechism , and besides , receive lessons in reading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schoolmasters ' fees , and for the instruction of poor children ; fequire that the schoolmaster shall be furnished from the church-register with a list of all the children of the age to attend school , and that he shall prepare a list of those who are actually in attendance , and submit both to the clergyman , in his periodical visits ; direct anew the examination of candidates for the situation of schoolmaster , and refer particularly to the advantages of the seminary opened at Berlin for preparing teachers for the Mark of Bran.denburg ; lay down minutely the scheme of elementary instruction , and actually specify the time to be devoted to the different branches , with each of the two classes composing the school ; require the parochial clergy to visit the schools twice a week , and inspectors of circles to perform the same service at least once a year . The decree of Frederick regulating the Catholic schools of Silesia , ( 1765 , ) is even more particular than the foregoing . It shows the settled policy in regard to educating teachers in special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , by setting apart certain schools by name for this purpose , requiring the appointment of a director to each , and assigning his duties . In 1787 , Frederick William the Second created a council of instruction , under the title of an " Upper School Board , " ( Ober-Schul Collegium , ) of which the minister of state was president . 1 he council was directed to examine text-books , and to pass upon the licenses of masters , on the reports of the provincial school-boards . They were authorized to erect seminaries for teachers at the government expense , and to frame their regulations ; to send out an inspector from their body to examine any part of public instruction , and to rectify all wrongs by a direct order , or through the school-boards of the provinces , the school committees or patrons . This organization remained substantially in force until the separation of the departments of state and instruction in 1817 , with the creation of a ministry of public instruction . The attributes of this upper school board , it will be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1763 was modified by an ordinance of 1794. which introduces geography and natural history in the elementary schools , and refers to vocal music as one of their most important exercises ; it also attempts , by minute prescriptions , to introduce uniformity in the methods of PRIMARY INSTRUCTION IN PRUSSIA . gg instruction and discipline . The regulation for the catholic schools of Silesia was also revised in 1801 . But the most important era in the history of public instruction in Prussia , as well as in other parts of Germany , opens with the efforts put forth by the king and people , to rescue the kingdom from the yoke of Napoleon in 1809 . In that year the army was remodeled and every citizen converted into a soldier ; landed property was declared free of feudal service ; restrictions on freedom of trade wore abolished , and the whole state was reorganized . Great reliance was placed on infusing a German spirit into the people by giving them freer access to improved institutions of education , from the common school to the university . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these reforms and improvements were projected , carried on , and perfected in less than a single generation , The movement in behalf of popular schools commenced by inviting C , A. Zeller , of Wirternberg , to Prussia . Zeller was a young theologian , who had studied under Pestalozz in Switzerland , and was thoroughly imbued with the method and spirit of his master . On his return he had convened the school teachers of Wirtemberg in barns , for want of better accommodations being allowed him , and inspired them with a zeal for Pestalozzi 's methods , and for a better education of the whole people . On removing to Prussia , he first took charge of the seminary at Koenigsberg , soon after founded the seminary at Karalene , and went about into different provinces meeting with teachers , holding conferences , visiting schools , and inspiring school officers with the right spirit . The next step taken was to send a number of young men , mostly theologians , to Pestalozzi 's institution at IfFerten , to acquire his method , and on their return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminaries . To these new agents in school improvement were joined a large body of zealous teachers , and patriotic and enlightened citizens , who , in ways and methods of their own , labored incessantly to confirm the Prussian state , by forming new organs for its internal life , and new means of pn tection from foreign foes . They proved themselves truly educators of the people . Although the government thus not only encouraged , but directly aided in the introduction of the methods of Pestalozzi into the public schools of Prussia , still the school board in the different provinces sustained and encouraged those who approved and taught on different systems , such as Dinter , Zerrenner , Salzman. and Niemeyer all , in fine , who labored with a patriotic purpose , thus allowing intellectual freedom , and appropriating whatever was good from all quarters toward the accomplishment of the great purpose . To infuse a German spirit into teachers and scholars , particular attention was paid to the German language , as the treasury house of German ideas , and to the geography and history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pestalozzi 's great instruments of culture , was made the vehicle of patriotic songs , and through them the heart of all Germany /z/ was moved to bitter hatred of the conqueror who had desolated her fields and homes , and humbled the pride of her monarchy . All these efforts for the improvement of elementary education , accompanied by expensive modifications in the establishments of secondary and superior education , were made when the treasury was impoverished , and taxes , the most exorbitant in amount , were levied on every province and commune of the kingdom . Prof. Stephens , now of Girard College , in a letter to the Superintendent of Common Schools of Pennsylvania , written from Berlin , at a time when there was at least a talk of the repudiation of state debts , and especially when a distinguished citizen of that state had proposed to divert the money appropriated for the support of common schools to the payment of interest on the state debts , makes the following remarks on this period of the educational history of Prussia . " Prussia , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of her public schools , affords us a still more brilliant example in the noble policy by which she sustained them in times of great public distress . Of all the nations of Europe , Prussia-jivas reduced to the greatest extremity by the wars of Napoleon . In 1806 , at the battle of Jena , her whole military force was annihilated . Within a week after the main overthrow , every scattered division of the army fell into the hands of the enemy . Napoleon took up his quarters in Berlin , emptied the arsenal , and stripped the capital of all the works of art which he thought worthy to be trarsported to Paris . By the treaty of Tilsit , in 1807 , the king of Prussia was deprived of one-half of his dominions . A French army of 200,000 men were quartered upon the Prussians till the end of the year 1808 . Prussia must pay to France the sum of 120,000,000 francs , after her principal sources of income had been appropriated by Napoleon , either to himself or his allies . The system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowments of schools , of poor houses , and the fund for widows , was diverted into the treasury of France . These last were given back in 1811 . Foreign loans were made , to meet the exorbitant claims of the conqueror . An army must be created , bridges rebuilt , ruined fortifications in every quarter repaired , and so great was the public extremity that the Prussian ladies , with noble generosity , sent their ornaments and jewels to supply the royal treasury . Rings , crosses , and other ornaments of castiron were given in return to all those who had made this sacrifice . They bore the inscription , " Ich gab gold um risen " ( I gave gold for iron. ) and such Spartan jewels are much treasured at this day by the possessors and their families . This state of things lasted till after the ' ; War of Liberation , " in 1812 . But it is the pride of Prussia , that at the time of her greatest humiliation and distress , she never for a moment lost sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1809. the minister at the head of the section of instruction , writes as follows , to some teachers who had been sent to the institution of Pestalozzi to learn his method and principles of instructing : ' ' The section of public instruction begs you to believe , and to assure Mr. Pestalozzi , that the cause is the interest of the government , and of his majesty , the king , personally , who are convinced that liberation from extraordinary calamities is fruitless , and only to be effected by a thorough improvement of the people 's education . " In 1809 , was established the teachers ' seminary in Koenigsberg . In 1810. the seminary at Braunsburg . In 1811 , the seminary at Karalene . In 1812 , was established at Breslau , the first seminary , completely organized according to the new ideas . In 1809 , the most amply endowed and completely organized of all the German universities /z/ was founded in Berlin . Professors were called from all parts , and in 1810 the university was in full operation . In 1811 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large grants were received from the government for new buildings and new professorships . Is not this noble policy , on the part of an absolute government , at a time when the nation was struggling for existence , a severe rebuke upon the narrow and short-sighted expedients of those republican politicians , who can invent no better way to pay a public debt than by converting into money that institution on which the virtue and intelligence of the people , and the special safety of a republican state , mainly depend ? " The school system of Prussia , is not the growth of any one period , and is not found in one law . but is made up of an aggregation of laws and general regulations , enacted at different times for different provinces , differing in the condition , habits , and religion of the people , and to meet particular wants , as these have been developed in the progress of the system . An attempt was made in 1819 to prepare a general school law for Prussia , but without success . This is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it leads to great inequalities of education , and great irregularities of administration in different provinces . The ordinance of 1819 , however , embraces much of the regulations which are applicable to the whole kingdom , while the peculiarities and details of the system must be looked for in the provincial ordinances and special regulations . The authorities which administer public instruction in Prussia are the following : The chief authority is the minister , who joins to this supervision that of ecclesiastical and medical affairs . He is assisted by a council , consisting of a variable number of members , and divided into three sections corresponding to the three charges of the minister . The section for public instruction has its president and secretary , and meets usually twice a week for the transaction of business . One of this body is generally deputed as extraordinary inspector in cases requiring examination , and reports to the minister . 1 he kingdom of Prussia is divided into ten provinces , each of which has its governor , styled Superior President , ( Ober-President , ) who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) This council has functions in the province similar to those in the ministerial council in the kingdom at large , and has direct control of secondary public instruction , and of the schools for the education of primary teachers . It is subdivided into two sections , of which one has charge of the primary instruction in the province , under the title of the School Board , ( Provincial Schul Collegium . ) The school board , in addition to exercising the general supervision of education in the province , examines the statutes and regulations of the schools , insures the execution of existing laws and regulations , examines text-books , and gives permission for their introduction , after having obtained the approbation of the ministry . This board communicates with the higher authorities , through their president , to whom the reports from the next lower authority , to be presently spoken of , are addressed , and by whom , when these relate to school matters , they are referred to the board for examination . The next smaller political division to a province , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivided into Circles , ( Kreisin , ) and those into parishes , ( Gemeinderi . ) The chief civil authority in the Regency , is a president , who is assisted by a council called also a regency . This body is divided into three sections , having charge respectively of /z/ the internal affairs , of direct taxes , and of church and school matters . The last named committee examines and appoints all the teachers ol elementary and burgher schools within the regency , superintends the schools , ascertains that the school-houses and churches are duly kept in order , administers the funds of schools and churches , or superintends the administration , when vested in corporations , and collects the church and school fees . This committee is presided over by a member of the regency called the School Councilor , ( Schul-rath . ) As councilor , he has a seat and voice in the provincial consistory , where he is required to appear at least once a year , and to report upon their affairs in his regency , of which the provincial consistory has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools , and to satisfy himself that they are in good condition . The next school authority is the inspector of a circle , who has charge of several parishes . These inspectors are generally clergymen , while the councilors are laymen . Next below the special superintendents is the immediate authority , namely , the school committee , ( Schul-Vprstand . ) Each parish ( Gemeinde ) must , by law . have its school , except in special cases , and each school its committee of superintendence , ( Schul-Vorstand , ) consisting of the curate , the local magistrate , and from two to four notables ; the constitution of the committee varying somewhat with the character of the school , whether endowed , entirely supported by the parish , in part by the province or state , or by subscription . The committee appoints a school inspector , who is usually the clergyman of the parish ; In cities , the magistrates form the school committee , or school deputation , as it is there called , the curates still acting as local inspectors . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master of the school up to the minister , and every part of primary instruction is entirely within the contrel of an impulse from the central government , and takes its direction according to the will of the highest authorities . With such a system , under a despotic government , it is obvious that the provisions of any law may be successfully enforced . The cardinal provisions of the school system of Prussia , are ; First , That all children between the ages of seven and fourteen years shall go regularly to school . This is enforced by the school committee , who are furnished with lists of the children who should attend , and of those actually in the schools under theif charge , and who are required to enforce the penalties of the law . Second , That each parish shall , in general , have an elementary school . When the inhabitants are of different religious persuasions , each denomination has its school , and if not , provision is made for the religious instruction of the children by their own pastors . The erection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master , and aid to poor scholars , are all provided for . The requisite sum comes , in part , from parochial funds , and in part from a tax upon householders . When the parish is poor , it is assisted by the circle , by the province , and even by the state . Besides these elementary schools , most of the towns in Prussia have one or more upper primary or burgher schools . Third , The education of teachers in seminaries , adapted to the grade of instruction to which they intend devoting themselves . Their exemption during their term of study from active military service required of other citizens . A provision for their support during their term of study . A preference given to them over schoolmasters not similarly educated . Their examination previous to receiving a certificate of capacity , which entitles them to become candidates for any vacant post in the province where they have been examined . Their subsequent exemption from active military service , and even from the annual drill of the militia , if they PRIMARY INSTRUCTION IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school inspector , be spared from their duties . Provision for the removal of the incompetent or immoral . A prpvision for the support of decayed teachers . Fourth , The authorities which regulate the schools , and render them a branch of the general government , and the teachers in fact , its officers . In a country like Prussia , this connection secures to the teacher the respect due to his station , and thus facilitates the discharge of his important duties . Under this system of organization and administration , and especially with these arrangements to secure- the employment of only properly qualified teachers , the public schools of Prussia have been multiplied to an extent , and have attained within the last quarter of a century a degree of excellence , which has attracted the attention of statesmen , and commanded the admiration of intelligent educators in every part of Christendom . In the provinces , where the improved system has gone into operation with the habits of the people in its favor , it has already reached every human being ; and in even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along new generations , replacing the adult population with a race of men and women who have been subjected to a course of school instruction far more thorough and comprehensive than has ever been attempted in any other country . As an evidence of the universality of the system ' it may be mentioned , that out of 122,897 men of the standing army , in 1846 , only two soldiers were found who could not both read and write . But the system aims at much higher results with nothing short of developing every faculty both of mind and body , of converting creatures of impulse , prejudice , and passion , into thinking and reasoning beings , and of giving them objects of pursuit , and habits of conduct , favorable to their own happiness and that of the community in which they live . The result which may be reasonably anticipated from this system when the entire adult population have been subjected to its operation , and when the influences of the home and street , of the business and the recreations of society , all unite with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any section of the kingdom . Every where the lessons of the school-room are weakened , and in a measure destroyed , by degrading national customs , and the inevitable results of a government which represses liberty of thought , speech , occupation , and political action . But the school , if left as good and thorough as it now is , must inevitably change the government , or the government must change the school . And even if the school should be made less thorough than it now is , no governmental interference can turn back the intelligence which has already gone out among the people . It would be easier to return the rain to the clouds , from which it has parted , and which has already mingled with the waters of every rising spring , or reached the roots of every growing plant . The following Table exhibits the state of the Public Schools of Prussia , according to the latest official returns published by the government /z/ In 1848 , the population of Prussia was about 16,000,000 . According to the foregoing table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the ages of 6 and 14 , in average daily attendance ; 1,202 middle or burgher schools with 91,888 pupils , and 100 higher , or town schools , with 15.624 pupils , making an aggregate of 25,332 public primary schools , and 2,540,775 pupils . To these schools should be added 117 gymnasia for classical education , with 29,474 pupils , and 1,664 professors ; 7 universities with 4,000 students and 471 professors , and libraries with over 1,000,000 volumes ; 382 institutions , in the nature of infant schools , with 25,000 children , and a large number of schools for special instruction , as for the blind , deaf mutes , commerce , trades , arts , &c.; and Prussia can present an array of institutions , teachers , professors , and educational facilities , for all classes of her population , not surpassed by any other country .

From an investigation made by the government in 1845 , there were , in the whole of Prussia , only two young men in every one hundred between the ages of twenty and twenty-two , who could not read , write , and cipher , and had not a knowledge of Scripture history . According to the foregoing table , there were 34,030 primary school teachers employed in , viz. : Elementary schools . Head teachers , .... " " Assistants , .... " " Schoolmistresses , . . .

By means of educational periodicals , and frequent meetings for professional im- g STATISTICS OF EDUCATION IN PRUSSIA . provement , these teachers are bound together into a great association , stimulating each other to higher attainments , and marching forward a noble army for the improvement , and not the destruction of the people . The following statistics will show how steadily the primary schools have advanced in numbers , attendance , and teachers , since 1819 : 1 .

Two degrees of primary instruction are distinguished by the law ; the elementary schools and the burgher schools . The elementary schools propose the development of the human faculties , through an instruction in those common branches of knowledge which are indispensable to every person , both of town and country . The burgher schools ( Beurgerschulen Stad.tschulen carry on the child until he is capable of manifesting his inclination for a classical education , or for this or that particular profession . The gymnasia continue this education until the youth is prepared , either to commence his practical studies in common life , or his higher and special scientific studies in the university . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a great establishment of national education , one in system , and of which the parts , though each accomplishing a special end , are all mutually correlative . The primary education of which we speak , though divided into two degrees , has its peculiar unity and general laws ; it admits of accommodation , however , to the sex , language , religion , and future destination of the pupils . 1 . Separate establishments for girls should be formed , wherever possible , corresponding to the elementary and larger schools for boys . 2 . In those provinces of the monarchy ( as the Polish ) where a foreign language is spoken , besides lessons in the native idiom , the children shall receive complete instruction in German , which is also to be employed as the ordinary language of the school . 3 . Difference of religion in Christian schools necessarily determines differences in religious instruction . This instruction shall always be accommodated to the spirit and doctrines of the persuasion to which the school belongs . But , as in every school of a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) should be piety , and a profound reverence of the Deity , every Christian school may receive the children of every sect . The * Mainly in the language of the law and ordinance , as translated and condensed by Sir William Hamilton , in an article in the Edinburgh Review . /z/ masters and superintendents ought to avoid , with scrupulous care , every shadow of religious constraint or annoyance . No schools should be abused to any purposes of proselytism ; and the children of a worship different from that of the school , shall not be obliged , contrary to the wish of their parents or their own , to attend its religious instruction and exercises . Special masters of their own persuasion shall have the care of their religious education ; and should it be impossible to have as many masters as confessions , the parents should endeavor , with so much the greater solicitude , to discharge this duty themselves , if disinclined to allow their children to attend the religious lessons of the school . The primitive destination of every school , says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knowledge of the relations of man to God . it may foster in them the desire of ruling their life by the spirit and principles of Christianity . The school shall , therefore , betimes second and complete the first domestic training of the child to piety . Prayer and edifying reflections shall commence and terminate the day ; and the master must beware that this moral exercise do never degenerate into a matter of routine . Obedience to the laws , loyalty , and patriotism , to be inculcated . No humiliating or indecent castigation allowed ; and corporal punishment , in general , to be applied only in cases of necessity . Scholars found wholly incorrigible , in order to obviate bad example , to be at length dismissed . The pupils , as they advance in age , to be employed in the maintenance of good order in the school , and thus betimes habituated to regard themselves as active and useful members of society . The primary education has for its scope the development of the different faculties , intellectual and moral , mental and bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches : 1 . Religion morality established on the positive truths of Christianity ; 2 . The German tongue , and in the Polish provinces , the vernacular language ; 3 . The elements of geometry and general principles of drawing ; 4 . Calculation and applied arithmetic ; 5 . The elements of physics , of general history , and of the history of Prussia ; 6 . Singing ; 7 . Writing ; 8 . Gymnastic exercises ; 9 . The more simple manual labors , and some instruction in the relative country occupations . Every burgher school must teach the ten following branches : 1 . Religion and morals . 2 . The German language , and the vernacular idiom of the province , reading , composition , exercises of style , exercises of talent , and the study of the national classics In the countries of the German tongue , the modern foreign languages are the objects of an accessory study . 3 . Latin to a certain extent . ( This , we believe , is not universally enforced. ) 4 . The elements of mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 . Physics , and natural history to explain the more important phenomena of nature . 6 . Geography , and general history combined ; Prussia , its history , laws , and constitution , form the object of a particular study . 7 . The principles of design ; to be taught with the instruction given in physics , natural history , and geometry . 8 . The penmanship should be watched . /z/ and the hand exercised to write with neatness and ease . 9 . Singing , in order to develop the voice , to afford a knowledge of the art , and to enable the scholars to assist in the solemnities of the church . 10 . Gymnastic exercises accommodated to the age and strength of the scholar . Such is the minimum of education to be afforded by a burgher school . If its means enable it to attempt a higher instruction , so as to prepare the scholar , destined to a learned profession , Cor an immediate entrance into the gymnasia , the school then takes the name of Higher Town School . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters and the committee of superintendence , a certificate of his capacity , and of his moral and religious dispositions . These certificates to be always produced on approaching the communion , and on entering into apprenticeship or service . They are given only at the period of departure ; and in the burgher schools , as in the gymnasia , they form the occasion of a great solemnity . Every half year pupils are admitted ; promoted from class to class ; and absolved at the conclusion of their studies . Books of study to be carefully chosen by the committees , with concurrence of the superior authorities , the ecclesiastical being specially consulted in regard to those of a religious nature . For the Catholic schools , the bishops , in concert with the provincial consistories , to select the devotional books ; and , in case of any difference of opinion , the Minister of Public Instruction shall decide . Schoolmasters are to adopt the methods best accommodated to the natural development of the human mind ; methods which keep the intellectual powers in constant , general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infusion of a mechanical knowledge . The committees are to watch over the methods of the master , and to aid him by their council ; never to tolerate a vicious method , and to report to the higher authorities should their admonition be neglected . Parents and guardians have a right to scrutinize the system of education by which their children are taught ; and to address their complaints to the higher authorHies , who are bound to have them carefully investigated . On the other hand , they are bound to cooperate with their private influence in aid of the public discipline ; nor is it permitted them to withdraw a scholar from any branch of education taught in the school as necessary . As a national establishment , every school should court the greatest publicity . In those for boys , besides the special half yearly examinations , for the promotion from one class to another , there shall annually take place public examinations , in order to exhibit the spirit of the instruction , and the proficiency of the scholars . On this solemnity , the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme , is to render an account of the condition and progress of the school . In fine , from time to time , there shall be published a general report of the state of education in each province . In schools for females , the examinations take /z/ place in presence of the parents and masters , without any general invitation . But if the public instructors are bound to a faithful performance of their duties , they have a right , in return , to the gratitude and respect due to the zealous laborer in the sacred work of education . The school is entitled to claim universal countenance and aid . even from those who do not confide to it their children . All public authorities , each in its sphere , are enjoined to promote the public schools and to lend support to the masters in the exercise of their office , as to any other functionaries of the state . In all the communes of the monarchy , the clergy of all Christians persuasions , whether in the church , in their school visita lion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shall omit no opportunity of recalling to the schools their high mission , and to the people their duties to these establishments . The civil authorities , the clergy , and the masters , shall every where cooperate in tightening the bonds of respect and attachment between the people and the school ; so that the nation may be more habituated to consider education as a primary condition of civil existence , and daily take a deeper interest in its advancement . The following extracts from Kay 's " Social Condition and Education of the People " will show how these provisions of the law , and governmental instructions are carried into practice . The three great results , which the Prussian government has labored to ensure by this system of education are 1 . To interest the different parishes and towns in the progress of the education of the people , by committing the management of the parochial schools to them , under certain very simple restrictions . 2 . To assist the parochial school committees in each county with the advice of the most able inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ministers of religion . These results the government has gained , to the entire and perfect satisfaction of all parties . The provincial and county councils act as advisers of the parochial committees . These latter are the actual directors of parochial education ; and the clergy not , only occupy places in these parochial committees , but are also the exofficio inspectors of all the schools . The system is liberally devised ; and I am persuaded that it is solely owing to its impartial , popular , and religious character , that it has enlisted so strongly on its side the feelings of the Prussian people . I know there are many in our land who say , u But why have any system at all ? Is it not better to leave the education of the people to the exertions of public charity and private benevolence ? ' ' Let the contrast between the state of the education and social condition of the poor in England and Germany be the answer . In England it is well known that not one half of the country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those , which do exist , are under the direction of very inefficient and sometimes of actually immoral teachers . In Germany and Switzerland , every parish is supplied with its school buildings , and each school is directed by a teacher of high principles , and superior education and intelligence . Such a splendid social institution has not existed without effecting magnificent results , and the Germans and Swiss may now proudly point to the character and condition of their peasantry . So great haVe been the results of this system , that it is now a well known fact , that , except in cases of sickness , every child between the ages of six and ten in the whole of Prussia , is receiving instruction from highly educated teachers , under SUBJECTS AND METHODS OF INVJ'KIH T1ON IN I'iM. ' r ' . slA. y the surveillance of the parochial ministers . And , if 1 except the manufacturing districts , I may go still farther , and say , that every child in Prussia , between the ages of six and fourteen , is receiving daily instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give any adequate idea of the vastncss nt ' the educational machinery , which is at work ; for the Prussian government is encouraging all the towns throughout the country to establish infant schools for the children of parents who are forced , from the peculiar nature of their labor , to a ' . xsent themselves from home during the greater part of the day , and who wc/uld In ' otherwise obliged to leave their infante without proper superintendence ; and , ; i-i all the children in the manufacturing districts , who are engaged in the weavingroonis , are also obliged to attend evening classes to the age of fourteen years . I may say . with great truth , that nearly all the Prussian children between the ages uf four and fourteen are under the influence of a religious education . And let it not be supposed that an arbitrary government has forced this result from an unwilling people . On the contrary , as 1 have said before , the peasants themselves have always been at least as anxious to obtain this education for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A proof of the satisfaction , with which the Prussian people regard the educational regulations , is the undeniable fact , that all the materials and machinery for instruction are being so constantly and so rapidly improved over the whole country , and by the people themselves . Wherever 1 traveled , I was astonished to see the great improvement in all these several matters that was going on . Every where I found new and handsome school-houses springing up , old ones being repaired , a most liberal supply of teachers and of apparatus for the schools provided by the municipal authorities , the greatest cleanliness , lofty and spacious schoolrooms , and excellent houses for the teachers ; all showing , that the importance of the work is fully appreciated by the people , and that there is every desire on their part to aid the government in carrying out this vast undertaking . The children generally remain in school , until the completion of their fourteenth year ; and a law has been issued , for one or two of the provinces , appointing this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . But if the parente are very poor , and their children have learnt the doctrines of their religion , as well as to read , write , and cipher , their religious minister can , in conjunction with the teaoher , permit them to discontinue their attendance at the completion of their twelfth year . " No child , without the permission both of the civil magistrate of the town or village of which its parents are inhabitants , and also of their religious minister , can be kept from school beyond the completion of its fifth year , or afterward discontinue its attendance on the school classes for any length of time . " If a parent neither provides at home for the education of his children , nor sends them to the school , the teacher is bound to inform the religious minister of the parent ; the minister then remonstrates with him ; and if he still neglects to send his children , the minister is bound by law to report him to the village committee , which has power to punish him by a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for neglecting the first and greatest duty of every parent . If the village committee can not induce him to educate ' his children , he is reported to the union magistrates , who are empowered to punish him with imprisonment . But it is hardly ever necessary to resort to such harsh measures , for the parents are even more anxious to send their children to these admirably conducted schools , than the civil magistrate to obtain their attendance . In order , however , to ensure such a regular attendance , and as an assistance to the parents themselves , each teacher is furnished by the local magistrate , every year , with a list of all the children of his district , who have attained the age , at which they ought to attend his classes . This list is ; alled over every morning and every afternoon ' , and all absentees are marked down , so that the school committees , magistrates , and inspectors may instantly discover if the attendance of any child has been irregular . If a child requires leave of absence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil magistrate for it , but the clergyman can grant it , if it be only for six or seven days , and the teacher alone can allow it , if for only one or two days . At the German revolutions of 1848 ; one of the great popular cries was for gratuitous education . The governments of Germany were obliged to yield to this /z/ cry , and to make it the law of nearly the whole of Germany , that all parents should be able to get their children educated at the primary schools without having to pay any thing for this education . There are now , therefore , no school fees in the greatest part of Germany . Education is perfectly gratuitous . The poorest man can send his child free of all expense to the best of the public schools of his district . And , besides this , the authorities of the parish or town , in which a parent lives , who is too poor to clothe his children decently enough for school attendance , are obliged to clothe them for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pens , and every thing necessary for school attendance , so that a poor man , instead of being obliged to pay something out of his small earnings for the education of his children , is , on the contrary , actually paid for sending them to school . This latter is an old regulation , and is one which has aided very greatly to make the educational regulations very popular among the poor of Germany . I made very careful inquiries about the education of children in the principal manufacturing district of Prussia . I remained several days in Elberfeld , their largest manufacturing town , on purpose to visit the factory schools . I put myself there , as elsewhere , in direct communication with the teachers , from whom I obtained a great deal of information ; and I also had several interviews on the subject with the educational councillors at Berlin , who put into my hand the latest regulations on this subject issued by the government . The laws relating to the factory children date only from 1839 . They are as follows : " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any mining or building operations , before it has attained the age of nine years . " No child , which has not received three years ' regular instruction in a school , and has not obtained the certificate of a school committee , that it can read its mother tongue fluently , and also write it tolerably well , may be employed in any of the above-mentioned ways , before it has completed its sixteenth year . " An exception to this latter rule is only allowed in those cases , where the manufacturers provide for the education of the factory children , by erecting and maintaining factory schools . " If a manufacturer will establish a school in connection with his manufactory , and engage a properly educated teacher , he is then allowed to employ any children of nine years of age , whether they have obtained a certificate or not , on condition , however , that these children attend the school four evenings in every week , as well as two hours every Sunday morning , until they have obtained a certificate of proficiency in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the county court , decides whether the factory school is so satisfactorily managed , as to entitle the manufacturer to this privilege . This minister also regulates the hours which must be devoted weekly to the instruction of the factory children . " Young people , under sixteen years of age , may not be employed in manufacturing establishments more than ten hours a day . " The civil magistrates are , however , empowered , in some cases , to allow young people to work eleven hours a day , when an accident has happened , which obliges the manufacturer to make up for lost time , in order to accomplish a certain quantity of work before a given day . But these licenses can not be granted for more , at the most , than four weeks at a time . After the hours of labor have been regulated by the " schulrath " and the manufacturer , the latter is obliged by law to take care that the factory children have , both in the mornings and in the afternoons , a quarter of an hour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they always have a good hour 's relaxation from labor . " No young person , under sixteen years of age , may , in any case , or in any emergency , work more than eleven hours a day . " The children of Christian parents , who have not been confirmed , may not work in the mills during the hours set apart by t/q/
