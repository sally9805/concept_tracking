txt THE Christian traveler , in journeying to the though not strictly level , is called a plain . It i Holy Land , often obtains his first view of the was known in ancient times as th. plain of Jez. sacred shores from the deck of some small Levantine vessel in which he has embarked at Alexandria , after having completed his tour among the wonders of Egypt and the Nile . He ascends , perhaps , to the deck of his vessel , early in the morning , summoned by the welcome intelligence that the land is full in view . Here , as he surveys the shore that presents itself before him , the first object which attracts his eye is a lofty promontory which he sees rising in sublime and sombre majesty above the surrounding country , and at the same time jutting boldly into the sea . It forms , he observes , the seaward terminus of a mountain range which his eye follows far into the interior of the country , until the undulating crest loses itself at last from view in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of an ancient convent crown its summit ; its sloping sides are enriched with a soft and luxuriant vegetation ; and the surf , rolling in from the sea , whitens the rocks at its foot with breakers and foam .

The sea itself sets up a little way into the valley through which this river flows , forming thus a broad bay to the north of Mt . Carmel , called the Bay of Acre .

The conformation of the bay , together with the precise situation of Acre and Haifa , as well as the more important topographical details of the mountain , will be found very clearly represented in the chart upon the adjoining page . NAPOLEON S ENGINEERS . The topographical chart of the bay of Acre here given is one made by the engineers of the French army during Napoleon 's celebrated expedition to Egypt and Syria . These engineers accompanied the army wherever it marched , and in the midst of all the scenes of excitement , difficulty , and danger , through which they were continually passing , devoted themselves to the performance of the scientific duties which their commander had assigned them , with a calmness and composure almost incredible . No possible excitement or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturb them in their work . The din and confusion of the camp , the marches and countermarches of the troops , the battles , the sieges , the assaults , the excitement of victory , and the confusion of sudden and unexpected retreats-all failed to embarrass or disconcert them . Whatever were the scenes that might be transpiring around them , they went quietly and fearlessly on , paying no regard to any thing but their own proper duties . They adjusted their instruments ; they made their observations , their measurements , their drawings ; they computed their tables and constructed their charts ; and in the end they brought back to France a complete daguerreotype , as it were , of every hill , and valley , and river , and plain , of the vast surface which they traversed . The great chart from which the adjoining map is taken was the last one which they made , for Acre was the northern termination of Napoleon 's expedition.t APPROACHE5 TO MOUNT cARMEL .

It may be seen upon the map following closely the line of the shore on the margin of the sandy beach which has already been described . The third comes from Nazareth , in the interior of the country . It descends from the plain of Esdraelon by the banks of the Kishon , and joins the Acre road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After passing through Haifa , the road follows the shore for a short distance , and then a branch diverges to the right , leading to some ancient ruins on the extremity of the cape . A little farther on another branch turns off to the left , and leads up the mountain to the convent , while the main road continues its course round the northern and western extremity of the promontory , and there passes into the road that comes up on the western coast , as at first described . Travelers approaching Mt . Carmel from the interior of the country come generally from Nazareth by the way of the third road above described , that is , the one that leads down from the valley of the Kishon , following the bank of the stream . The town of Nazareth , where the journey of the day in such cases is usually commenced , lies among the hills about midway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Sea of Tiberias . The route for some hours leads the traveler along the northern part of the plain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fertility which pass before his view . He sees rich fields of corn and grain , groves of the pomegranate , the fig , and the olive , verdant valleys clothed with the most luxuriani herbage , masses of hanging wood , that adorn the declivities of the hills , and descend in capes and promorftories of foliage to beautify the plain , and ruins of ancient fortresses and towns , scattered here and there in picturesque and commanding positions . The whole country is like a romantic park , with the great chain of Mt . Carmel extending continuously to the southward of it , and bounding the view . BAY OF ACRE . At length the great plain of Acre , with the bay , and the broad expanse of the Mediterranean in the distance , opens before him . The town of Acre , surrounded with its white walls , stands just on the margin of the water , at the northern extremity of the bay ; while at the southern point of it stands Haifa , sheltered by the mountain , and adorned by the consular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In former times the principal harbor for shipping was at Acre , but from some change which the course of time has effected in the conformation of the coast or in the deposit of sand , the only deep water is now found at the southern extremity of the bay , where the Kishon finds its outlet  --  and Haifa has consequently become the port . It is not improbable , in fact , that the greater depth of water at this point is to be attributed to the effect produced by the outflow of the river in impeding the accumulation of deposits from the sea . The river , as will be seen from the map , in // 50 MOUNT CARMEL AND THE BAY OF ACRE . qwq traverses a sandy beach on a coast exposed to winds and storms. * The distance from Haifa to Acre along the shore of the bay is about eight miles .

PRODUCTIONS OF THE COUNTRy . The plains and valleys which border the Carmel chain of mountains , especially on the northern side , are extremely fertile . They yield grapes , olives , corn , and other similar productions , in the greatest abundance , while the grass that clothes the slopes of the surrounding mountains , and adorns with verdure and beauty a thousand secluded valleys that wind among them , furnishes an almost exhaustless supply of food for flocks and herds . A considerable quantity of wheat , barley , cotton , and other similar products is ex * A striking example of this occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses the beach in entering the sea , at a point about half a mile to the southward of the hotels resorted to on that coast in summer by bathers . The visitor who walks along the shore in that direction , sometimes at a certain point finds himself opon an elevated sandy ridge , with the surf of the sea rolling in upon one side of it , and what appears to be a large inland pond lying quietly on the other . A few days afterward , on visiting the spot , he observes , perhaps , that the pond has disappeared ; and a wide chasm has been made across the ridge of sand that he walked over before in safety , through the centre of which a small stream is flowing quietly into the sea . Neither of these views are of a nature to awaken any very special interest , except when they are considered in connection with each other but if the observer should chance to come upon the ground the present generation it has been the scene of two terrific conflicts . Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , was the struggle for the possession of the place between Napoleon and its English defenders , and the consequent check which was placed upon Napoleon 's career , on his advance from Egypt into Syria . On his arrival at Acre , the young general found the port in possession of an English force under the command of Sir Sydney Smith , and though he made the most desperate and determined efforts to dislodge them , he was unable to succeed . He planted his batteries on the declivities of the hills behind the town , and cannonaded the walls from that posiported , being brought down to Haifa and Acre from the interior , on the backs of mules and camels , led by drivers in long caravans and trains . One traveler speaks of having been detained at the gates of Acre , when going out to make an excursion into the surrounding country , by a train of one hundred camels , laden with corn . that were just then coming in . MISGOVERNMENT . The commerce of the port , however , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exactions of the government which restrict and burden it exceedingly . It is true that governments generally maintain themselves by taxing the commerce of the countries over which they rule , but the despotic authorities that have borne when the pond is nearly full , he may witness a very extraordinary spectacle in the rushing out of the torrent by which the barrier is carried away . The boys of the vicinity often find amusement in hastening the catastrophe , by digging a little channel in the sand with their hands , when the water has risen nearly to the proper level . The stream that flows through this opening is at first extremely small , but it grows wider , deeper , and more rapid every moment , as the opening enlarges , and soon becomes a roaring torrent , spreading to a great width , and tossing itself into surges and crests as it rushes down the slope into the sea , in the most wild and tumultuous manner . The spectacle is almost equally imposing when , after the pond has emptied itself , and the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its work of reconstructing the dam // military sway in Syria and Palestine for the last another , until the poor peasant and laborer finds five hundred years , have done this , as it would himself robbed of every thing but the bare means of subsistence . All hope and possibility of acquiring property by his industry and thrift , and of rising to a respectable position in society are taken away from him , and he spends his life in idleness , degradation , and despair . AN INCIDENT . An incident strikingly illustrative of these truths , occurred to a traveler who was visiting Acre , about the year 1815 . One morning , in rambling about the city , he chanced to come into the vicinity of the custom house , at the port , and there he overheard a violent dispute going on between some fishermen and a certain farmer of the revenue - probably a wealthy merchant of the town-who was standing near . It seems that a ( luty of about thirty-three oer cent. , that is , one-third part of the whole price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in the bay and qwq length , after passing through a great number of vicissitudes and romantic adventures , in the course of which he was transferred to the service of the Turkish government , he was placed by the Turks in command of the Pachalik of Acre , in 1775 . Here he ruled with such despotic cruelty , that he made himself an object of universal execration to all mankind , excepting always those who had placed him in power ; for they seemed to be pleased rather than otherwise with his remorseless and terrible energy . One of the first measures which he adopted when he entered upon his government , was to confiscate all the houses of the town of Acre , declaring them the property of the government , and requiring the inhabitants to pay rent for them to him . The taxes were exorbitantly increased , and every possible pretext was resorted to to deprive the people of their property , and transfer it to the government . Land which was left uncultivated for three years was considered as abandoned by the owners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranded upon the coast , he seized upon every thing that could be saved from the wreck , as his perquisite . His favorite mode of punishing those who displeased him , was to mutilate their persons by cutting off an ear , a nose , an arm , or a foot , or by taking out an eye . Those who visited his palace , say that it was common to see many persons in the antechambers and halls who were disfigured thus , having incurred the cruel monster 's displeasure from time to time in the course of their service . These were his " marked men , " as he called them- " persons bearing signs of their having been instructed to serve theirmasterwith fidelity . " His secretary , who was his principal banker and minister , was deprived of both an ear and an eye , at the same time , for some offense , real or imaginary , which he had committed , and yet still continued to serve his savage master . Djezzar lived in a massive palace , occupying a well-protected part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the palace and the city wall . Within this palace was his harem , the residence of his women . No person but himself was ever admitted to the harem . He was accustomed to retire thither every evening through three massive doors , one within the other , which doors he always closed and barred with his own hands . No one knew how many or what women the harem contained . Additions were often made to the number , from female slaves that were presented to Djezzar from time to time ; but no one knew how many were thus introduced , or what was their fate after they disappeared from public view . Every possible precaution was taken to seclude the inmates of this harem in the most absolute manner from the outer world . Their food was conveyed to them by means of a sort of wheel or cylinder , turning in the wall , and so contrived that those without could not see who received it . If any one was sick , a physician was brought to a room where there was a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side , put her arm , and thus the pulse was examined , and a prescription made . We might fill many pages with curious details in respect to the life and character , and peculiar habits , of this extraordinary man , but we must leave Acre and the bay , ascend the mountain , and prepare to THE MOUNTAIN . The height of Mt . Carmel has been generally estimated at about fifteen hundred feet . This is a very unusual elevation for land that rises thus abruptly from the margin of the sea . Of course , from every cliff , and rock , and projecting headland on the higher portions of it there is obtained a widely extended and most commanding view both over the water and over the land . The sea lies toward the west ; the prospect is consequently in that direction unobstructed to the horizon , and the whole western quarter of the sky is fully exposed to view . It is by understanding the position of Mt . Carmel in this respect , that we appreciate the full force and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain , after the destruction of the priests of Baal by the Prophet Elijah ; for it is always , as we observe , in the western sky , through the operation of some mysterious and hidden laws which human philosophy has not yet been able to unfold , that the clouds which produce sudden summer showers arise . It is almost invariably there , that those rounded and dome-like condensations are formed , which from small and almost unperceived beginnings expand and swell until they envelop the whole heavens in darkness and gloom , and then sweep over the earth in tempests of thunder , lightning , and rain . The narrative of the sacred writer , describing the event is as follows . AHAB AND THE aAIN . " And Elijah said unto Ahab , Get thee up , eat and drink ; for there is a sound of abundance of rain . So Ahab went up to cat and to drink . And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look toward the sea . And he went up , and looked and said , There is nothing . And he said , Go again seven times . And it came to pass at the seventh time that he said , Behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a man 's hand . And he said , Go up , say unto Ahab , Prepare thy chariot , and get thee down that the rain stop thee not . And it came to pass , in the mean while , that the heaven was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . " -l Kings , xviii . 41-45 . The traveler , as he looks up to the summit of the mountain from the beach of the Bay of Acre , over the sands of which he is slowly making his way toward the foot of the ascent , pictures in his imagination the form of the servant of Elijah standing upon some projecting pinnacle , and looking off over the sea . He loses for the moment his recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of a temporary illusion , forgetting the five-and-twenty centuries which have elapsed since the days of Elijah , al // most looks to see the chariot and horsemen of Ahab riding away up the valley , in obedience to the prophet 's command . ASCENT OF THE MOUNTAIN . The road to the mountain , as will appear from the map , passes through Haifa . Travelers and pilgrims , however , seldom make any stay in the town . There is no inn there to detain them . The convent is the inn-on the top of the mountain . After passing Haifa , the road , as may be seen upon the map , follows the line of the shore for about half a mile , and then turns a little inland , while a branch of the main road , diverging to the right , continues along the shore of the sea . This branch leads to the extremity of the cape , where are situated the ruins of an ancient place named Porphyrion , and also a small fortress , on the point . Porphynon was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it went gradually to decay , and at last when Haifa was built it was entirely abandoned . THE A*U*N1 u*r tiE MOUNTAIN . A short distance further on , the traveler comes *o another branch , where a male-path turns off *o the left from the main road , and leads up the nountain . The ascent is steep , but the path is so guarded by a parapet on the outer side wherever required , that it awakens no sense of danger . The declivities of the mountain , above and below the path , are clothed with trees and herbage , with gray walls , forming picturesque cliffs , and precipices , appearing here and there among them . There is a profusion , too , of wild flowers of every form and hue , which attract and charm the traveler , wherever he turns . He looks off at every salient point that he passes in his ascent , over the bay . He sees the white walls of the city of Acre rising from the margin of the water at the extremity of it , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth and beautiful beach which lies spread out before him , its broad expanse broken , perhaps , here and there on the side toward the sea , with the wrecks of ships which lie there half buried , and enlivened on the land with trains of mules or of camels passing toward Acre or Haifa , or by some picturesque group of tents pitched upon the plain  --  the encampment of some wandering tribe of Arabs , or of a party of European travelers . Further inland , he surveys broad fields of luxuriant vegetation , variegated with every shade of green and brown , and groves of trees that extend along the margin of the rivers , and crown the summits of the distant hills . In a calm and clear summer s morning , the observer looks down upon this brilliant scene of verdure and beauty , as upon a map , and lingers long on his way , to study minutely every feature of it . THE RIVER BELU5 AND THE DI5COVERY OF CLASS . About midway between Haifa and Acre , the traveler , pausing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace the course of the river Belus , as it meanders through the plain beneath him , northwardly , toward an outlet just in the rear of Acre , where it empties into the sea . The course and direction of the stream are delineated upon the map near the commencement of this article . This river is celebrated as the place where , according to ancient story , the discovery of the art of making glass was first made by means of an accidental vitrification which chanced to take place under certain peculiar circumstances , on its shores. * Glass is composed essentially of silicious substances-such as sand - combined with certain alkalies by fusion . For sand , though very refractory if exposed alone to the influence of heat , when mixed with these alkaline substances fuses easily , and vitrlfies , that is it forms a glass , which is more or less perfect according to the precise nature of the substances employed , and the arrangements of the process . The story of the origin of the discov ery is , that a vessel came into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laden with certain fossil alkalies which were found somewhere along the coast , and were used in those times for certain purposes , and that the sailors landed on the beach and built a fire there , with a view of taking supper on the shore . When the fire was made they looked about the beach for stones to use as a support for their kettle ; but the soil being alluvial and sandy they were not able to find any stones , and so they brought instead three fragments of the alkaline fossil , whatever it might have been , * It is somewhat doubtful whethIr the very first discovery of the art of making glass , took place here or not , as learned men have noticed a considerable number of allusions in various writings of a very high antiquity , which they have thought might possibly refer to this substance . An example of this kind is found in the book of Job , where a word , translated crystal , is used . The writer , speaking of wisdom , says , " It can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious onyx , or the sapphire . The gold and the crystal can not equal it . " It has been considered doubtful whether the word crystal . in this connection , is meant to denote a glass or same transparent mineral . // with which their vessel was loaded . These which they had built upon the sand , and rested fragments they placed in the margin of the fire the kettle upon them ; thus by means of the al kali , the sand , the metal , and the fire , all the conditions were combined that are essential to produce a vitrification , and after their supper was ended the seamen found the glassy substance which had been produced , lying beneath the fire . They made their discovery known , and the experiment was repeated . Soon after this the regular manufacture of glass for vessels and ornaments was commenced in the city of Sidon , which lies on the coast of the Mediterranean , not many miles north of the mouth of the Belus , and from Sidon the art soon spread into every part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for the ascent from Haifa to the convent is about an hour  --  the buildings of the institution , though often spoken of as upon the top of the mountain , being really only about two-thirds of the way up to the highest summit . The condition in which the various travelers who have visited the spot within the last hundred years have found the institution , and the accounts which they have given of the edifice and of the inmates , varies extremely according to the time of the visit . In fact , after Napoleon 's defeat before Acre , the convent was entirely destroyed , and the spot was for a time deserted . The cause of this was that Napoleon took possession of the edifice for the purpose of using it as a hospital , and quartered his wounded and disabled soldiers there . The Turks , consequently , when they came and found the institution in the possession of the French , considered themselves authorized to regard it as a post of the enemy . They accordingly slaughtered the troops which they found there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From this time the convent remained desolate and in ruins for more than twenty years . At length , between 1820 and 1830 , a celebrated monk , known by the name of John Baptist , undertook the work of building up the institution again . With great zeal , and with untiring patience and perseverance , he traversed many countries of Europe and Asia to gather funds for the work , and to remove the various obstacles which are always in the way in the case of such an undertaking . He succeeded , at length , in accomplishing the work , and the convent was rebuilt in a more complete and extended form than ever before . Since that time , accordingly , the traveler finds , when he reaches the brow of the mountain where the convent buildings stand , a stately and commodious edifice ready to receive him . Like most of the other convents and monasteries of Asia , the institution serves the purpose of an inn . A monk receives the traveler and his party , and conducts them to a commodious sitting-room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs . A corridor from this apartment leads to bed-rooms in the rear , furnished likewise in a very comfortable manner , with beds , chairs , and tables ; - articles which attract the attention of the traveler , and are specially mentioned in his journal , as they are very rarely to be found in the East . On the terraces and balconies of the building the visitor , wearied with the toil of the ascent , finds seats where he reposes in peace , and enjoys the illimitable prospect which the view commands , both up and down the coast , and far out over the waters of the Mediterranean Sea . Travelers are entertained at the convent as at an inn , except that in place of a formal reckoning when they depart , they make their acknowledgment for the hospitality which they have received in the form of a donation to the monastery , the amount of which custom prescribes . The rule is that no guest is to remain longer than a fortnight  --  the arrangements being designed for the accommodation of travelers , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strictly enforced , except so far as to give to parties newly arriving the precedence in respect to choice of rooms , over those whose fortnight has expired . While the guests remain , they are very kindly and hospitably entertained by the monks , THE DISCOVERY OF CLASS . // cording to their size and configuration . These stones are round in form , and are often hollow , being lined with a crystalline incrustation within , the crystals representing , in the imagination of the pilgrim , the seeds of the fruit from which the specimen was formed . These fossils are found in a part of the mountain remote from the convent , where a stream comes down from the heights above , and they are supposed to be miraculous in their origin . The legend accounting for the production of them is this . - In the time of Elijah tJ*ere was a garden and a vineyard on the spot , and one tlay as Elijah was passing that way , weary and faint with his journey , he looked over the wall and asked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melons and fruits that he saw growing there . The man refused the wayfarer 's request , saying jestingly in his refusal , that those things were not melons and fruits , but only stones . " Stones who appear before them clothed in a hood and cassock of coarse brown cloth , with a rope girdle around the loins , and sandals upon the feet  --  the ancient habit of the order . Their countenances wear a thoughtful and serious , if not sad expression . THE GROTTO* AND CAVES . The halo of sacredness which invests Mt . Carmel proceeds from the memory of the prophet Elijah , who , while he lived on the earth , made this mountain his frequent resort , if not his usual abode . This we learn from the Scriptures themselves , as well as from the long and unbroken testimony of ancient tradition . The memorable transactions connected with the destruction of the priests of Baal , in the time of Ahab , at the conclusion of which came the sudden rain , as described in the passage already quoted , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain near this spot  --  and the ground on which the priests were slain is still shown , as identified by ancient tradition , on the banks of the Kishon , a little way up the valley. * The mountain above is full of grottos and caves . It is said that more than a thousand have been counted . The one which is supposed to have been Elijah 's special abode is now within the buildings of the convent . Higher up , among the rocks behind the convent , is another which is called Elisha 's cave , and at some distance below , in the bottom of a frightful chasm , into which the traveler descends by a steep and dangerous path , and which opens toward the sea , is another cavern , the largest and most noted of all . It forms a large and lofty apartment , vaulted above , and is said to have been - the place where Obadiah concealed and protected the company qwq t 1 Kings xviii . 4 i them . // ORIGIN OF THE CARMELITE ORDER . The convent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by travelers during the last five hundred years is to be understood as denoting not a single building , but a series of buildings , that have risen , flourished , and gone to decay on the same spot , in a long succession , like a dynasty of kings following each other in a line on the same throne . The grottos and caverns which are found upon the mountain began to be occupied at a very early period by hermits and solitary monks , who lived , probably at first in a state of separation from each other as , well as of seclusion from the world . After a time however they began to combine together , and to live in edifices specially constructed for their use , and for the last thousand years the Carmelites have constituted a well known and numerous religious order , having spread from their original seat and centre to every part of Europe , and taken a very active and important part in the ecclesiastical affairs of modern times . Every religious order of the Roman Church prides itself on the antiquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time carried back the history of their society to a very remote period indeednot merely to the Christian era , but from the time of Christ and the apostles back to Elijah , and from Elijah to Enoch . In discussing this subject , however , one ecclesiastical writer very gravely maintains that the Enoch , if there was one , among the founders of the Carmelite fraternity , could not have been the patriarch Enoch , the father of Methusaleh , since it is plain that there could have been no Carmelite monks among those saved in the ark , at the time of the deluge , for the vow of celibacy was an essential rule of the order from the beginning , and the sons of Noah , who were the only men besides Noah himself that were saved from the flood , were all married men , and took their wives with them when they went into the ark ! These traditions , however , ascribing a very high antiquity to the order of the Carmelites , were allowed to pass for many centuries with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years ago , certain religious historians belonging to other monastic orders , in the course of the investigations which they made into the early history of the church , came to the conclusion that the institution of the Carmelites was founded in the twelfth century of the Christian era . The earliest authentic information that they could find , they said , in respect to its origin was the account given by a traveler by the name of John Phocas , who visited the mountain in 1185 , in the course of a tour which he was making in the Holy Land . He relates that he ascended Mt . Carmel , and that he found there the cave of Elijah , describing it as it now appears . He also states that there was a monastery there which had been founded a few years before by a venerable monk , gray-headed and advanced in years , who had come upon the mountain in obedience to a revelation which he had received from the Prophet Elijah , enjoining upon him so to do , and that he had built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of worship , and that he had established himself here with ten companions of the same religious profession with himself ; and this was the true origin of the convent of Mt . Carmel . A cONTROvERsy The Carmelite monks throughout Europe were every where greatly displeased at the publication of this account , which cut off at a single blow some two thousand years from the antiquity of their order , even supposing their pretensions to go no farther back than to the time of Elijah . A protracted and very bitter controversey arose . Volumes after volumes were published  --  the quarrel , as is usual with religious disputes , degenerating in character as it advanced , and growing continually more and more rancorous and bitter , until at last the Pope interposed and put an end to the dispute by a bull . The bull did not attempt to decide the question ; it only silenced the combatants . Nothing more was to be said by any party , or under any pretext , on the origin of the institution of the Carmelites , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issuing of which was a most excellent act on the part of his Holiness , proved an effectual remedy for the evil which it was intended to suppress . The dispute was suddenly terminated , and though the question was in form left undecided , it was settled in fact , for it has since been generally admitted that the story of John Phocas was true , and that Mt . Carmel , though inhabited by hermits and individual recluses long before , was not the seat of a regularly organized society of Monks until nearly twelve centuries after the Christian era . THE MONK ST . SASIL . The Carmelites themselves were accustomed to maintain that the earliest written rule for the government of their order was given them by a very celebrated ancient monk , known in history as St. Basil . St. Basil lived about three hundred years after the time of Christ . He was descended from a distinguished family , and received an excellent education in early life , in the course of which he made very high attainments in all the branches of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being strongly impressed with a sense of religious obligation , he determined not to engage in the duties of the profession for which he had been trained , but to seclude himself from the world , in accordance with the custom that prevailed in those days , and spend his life in religious meditation and prayer . As a preliminary step he determined on taking a journey into the countries where the practice of religious retirement had begun to prevail , in order to visit the hermits , recluses , and monks , in their dens and caves , and become practically acquainted with the mbde of life which these voluntary exiles from the world were accustomed to lead . He accordingly set out upon his travels , and in the course of a few years he explored Egypt , Palestine , Syria , Asia Minor , and other countries still // farther east , in order to visit and converse with all the monks and hermits that he could find , in the deserts and solitudes to which they had retired . We can not here give the subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his learning , his high rank , his exalted character , and perhaps his honest and conscientious piety , combined to raise him in the end to a very commanding position in respect to the whole monastic world while he lived , and to inspire many succeeding generations with a great veneration for his memory . He was believed to have been during his life an object of the special and miraculous protection of heaven ; for it is recorded as sober historic truth , that at one time , during the latter part of his career , when certain theological enemies had prevailed in obtaining a sentence of banishment against him , and the decree , properly drawn up , was brought to the emperor to sign , the pen which was put into the emperor 's hand broke suddenly into pieces as soon as it touched the paper . The emperor called for another pen , but on attempting to use it the same result followed . This was done three times , and at last , as the emperor seemed determined to persist in his design , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the chair upon which he was sitting broke down , and let him fall upon the floor . The emperor now perceived that he was contending against God , and taking up the decree he destroyed it by tearing it in pieces . Now the Carmelites maintained that this St. Basil was a monk of their order , that he was one of the successors of Elijah , that they had obtained their first written rule of their order from him , and that the Basilians , an order of monks taking their name from him and well known throughout Europe in the middle ages , were to be considered as only a branch , or offshoot , from the ancient Carmelite institution . Out of this state of things there arose subsequently a very extraordinary controversy between the Basilians and the Carmelites as will presently appear RULE5 OF THE OROER . The claim of the Carmelites to have received their first written charter from St. Basil is not very well sustained , as the earliest authentic evidence of any written rule for the government of the institution relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1205 , about thirty years after the time when the monastery was founded , according to John Phocas 's narrative . This " rule , " or charter as it would be called at the present day , consisted of sixteen articles , and some particulars of it may be interesting to the reader as illustrating the nature of this species of document . The first article treats of the election of the prior of the monastery , and of the obedience which was to be rendered to him by the other monks . The second treats of the cells in which the brethren were to live , and prescribes that they should be separated from each other in such a way that there could be no intercourse- or communication between the respective inmates The third contains regula tions in respect to the cell of the prior , its situation and relation to the other cells . The fifth requires the monks to remain constantly each within his own cell except when called away by regularly prescribed duties elsewhere , and to devote himself in his retirement to the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to divine service . By the seventh the monks are forbidden to possess any private property of any kind . The eighth requires the brethren of the monastery to build an oratory or place of prayer in some central place , near the cells , and to assemble there every morning to hear mass . The ninth prescribes rules for the internal discipline of the institution . The tenth enjoins certain fast days . The eleventh forbids the use of flesh for food entirely . The twelfth exhorts the monks to clothe themselves with certain spiritual armor which it describes . The thirteenth enjoins upon them to labor with their hands , in cultivating the fruits of the earth in their little gardens . The fourteenth enjoins absolute silence upon them , from vespers until the break of day on the following morning . The fifteenth inculcates upon them the duty of humility and of devoting themselves to prayer ; and the sixteenth closes the series by exhorting them to be always obedient and submissive to the prior . EARLY MONASTIC LIFE . There is no question that the monastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these , led in the end to evil consequences and results of the most deplorable character , and we are accustomed , as Protestants , to believe that there is nothing that is not worthy of unqualified condemnation in it from beginning to end . But when we dismiss from our minds the ideas and associations with which the religious history of the last five hundred years has invested every thing that pertains to monastic life , and look at such a community as this of Mt . Carmel as it was in its original inception and design , we shall find it impossible to ascribe the conduct of those simple-minded recluses to any other motive than a desire to withdraw themselves from the world , in a spirit of honest self-denial , in order to live nearer to God , and enjoy the peace and happiness of daily and uninterrupted communion with him . And as to the delusion and folly of the course which they pursued , in order to judge impartially , we must look at the circumstances of the case as they really were , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , all the essential requisites for human comfort and happiness were secured . The mountain which they chose for their retreat was beautiful beyond description ; the soil was fertile , the air was balmy and pure , and such was the climate that the season with them was an almost perpetual summer . They had gardens to till , which produced them an abundance of fruits and vegetables , and in those climes the human constitution requires no other food . The grottos in which they lived were dry , and formed undoubtedly very safe and not uncomfortable // Jwellings . They suffered neither heat nor cold , there is always an atmosphere of soft and balmy for in Palestine cold is seldom known , and though air reposing in the groves , or breathing gently the sun is sometimes hot , and the air sultry , in over the summit . Besides all these natural adthe valleys , the mountain which they dwelt upon vantages of their situation , their course of daily rises into a region of perpetual salubrity , where duty gave them healthful and agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their occupations , though varied in kind , were regular in rotation and order . Thus , on the whole , though there was doubtless much of superstition and of error in their ideas , still we are inclined to think that there are some usages and modes of life not at all monastic in their character  --  to be witnessed among the worldfollowing Christians of the present day , in palaces of wealth and prosperity-which exhibit quite as much delusion and folly as was ever evinced by these poor world-abandoning monks , in the caves and grottos of Mt . Carmel . THE DISPUTE WiTH THE BASILIANs . A society of monks once established , depends of course for its continuance and prosperity on external additions , and not on any internal growth ; for since celibacy is the rule of all monastic orders , there can not be in such communities , as in the case of an ordinary hamlet or village , any natural sequence of generations . A man is never born a monk : so that monasticism has at least one of the marks and characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Notwithstanding this , however , the institution on Mt Cannel gradually increased . Accessions were made from time to time to the numbers of the monks , until at length the order became so numerous that several branch institutions were established in different parts of Europe , and the Carmelites became very generally known throughout the Christian world . We can not here , however , go away from the mountain to follow the society in its general history , though we will digress from our immediate subject so far as to give a brief account of the singular controversy which arose in subsequent years between the Carmelites and the Basilians , a controversy which not only exhibits in a striking point of view some of the peculiar ideas and religious usages of the times iii which it occurred , but illustrates certain important principles in respect to the nature of religious controversy , that are applicable to the disputes of every age . The question in this case related to the costume in which the prophet Elijah was represented in a certain . picture belonging to a church which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sicily . The church was built in the year 1670 , and the open controversy arose then ; but the origin of it may be traced to a period antecedent to that time . It seems that in 1080 , six hundred years before the dispute to which we are referring commenced , a THE HERMITS OF MOUNT cAEMEL. // certain Sicilian potentate built a church near Mt . Etna , in honor of the prophet Elijah , as a token of his gratitude to the prophet for appearing to him in a visible form at one time when he was involved in very imminent danger , in his wars with the Saracens , and for interposing to protect him . He also built a monastery in connection with the church , and established a society of Basilian monks in it . It seems that at the time when the church and monastery were built , a picture of the prophet Elijah was painted and hung in the church , where it remained without exciting any question , for six hundred years . At length at the expiration of that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being often greatly damaged , and the lives of the inmates seriously endangered by the shocks of earthquakes and the volcanic eruptions to which their situation so near to Mt . Etna exposed them , it was determined to remove the institution to another place , several miles distant from its original location , where the ground was more secure . The old picture of Elijah was however found to be too much decayed to be removed . A careful copy of it was therefore made , the artist taking care to transfer , as nearly as possible , to his copy , both the features and the costume of the original . The following engraving is a faithful representation of this portrait and of the dress which became the subject of the dispute , except of course that the colors are not shown . The ' shoulders are covered with a cloak which in the painting was *eneath the cloak was LI.1JAH OF THE SASILIANS. a tunic , formed of the skin of some animal , which descended to the knees . There were sandals on the feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the head was covered with a red cap trimmed with ornaments of gold . This painting in its original state had hung in its place in the old convent during the whole six hundred years without attracting any special notice ; hut when the copy was made and hung up in the new convent , it became an object of greater attention , and the Carmelites who saw or heard of it were much displeased with the costume , inasmuch as it was not the costume of their order . The painting by exhibiting the prophet in such a dress , seemed to deny that Elijah had been a Carmelite , and to claim him as belonging to some other order . They complained to the Basilians of the injustice done them , and demanded that the obnoxious costume should be changed . Finding , however , that their complaints and remonstrances were unavailing , they appealed to the Archbishop of Sicily , praying him to interpose his authority to edress the injury which they were suffering , and to compel the Basilians to take down the painting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient order of Mt . Carmel . The Basilians in reply alleged that the costume of the portrait was no innovation of theirs , and they were not responsible for it at all . The work , they said , was a faithful copy of an ancient painting that had hung for six hundred years , unquestioned and uncomplained of , in their former monastery , and that they could not give up the ancient traditions and relics of their institution ; and they were especially unwilling to consent that the prophet Elijah should be represented in their church in a Carmelite dress , since that would prejudice the ancient claims of the Basilian order . SETTLEMENT OF THE DISPUTE . The Archbishop of Sicily , after a long hearing of the parties to this dispute , refused to interpose , and finally the case was carried by the Carmelites to Rome , and laid before a certain board of the Roman church called the College of Rites , a sort of tribunal having jurisdiction of all questions of this nature that might arise in the Catholic church , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmelites brought forward their cause , and offered their complaints in language more earnest than ever . They represented in very strong terms the deep dishonor which the Basilians were inflicting upon them in publicly exhibiting the prophet Elijah  --  the patriarch and the father of their order-dressed in a cloak , and wearing a red cap upon his head , as if he were a Turkish pashaw . To give force and emphasis to their plea they exhibited to the sacred college before whom the cause was to be tried , a representation of the picture , colored like the original , in order that the judges might see for themselves how flagrant was the wrong which they endured , and how much cause they had to complain . After many long and patient hearings of the case before the college , and many fruitless attempts to find some mode satisfactory to all parties , for settling the dispute , the college finally decided upon a middle course , a sort of forced compromise which gave the victory to neither party . The costume of the painting was ordered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // from the head , and the sandals from the feet , and the red cloak was to be replaced by one of a saffron color . The tunic of skin was to be retained , and it was to be bound about the waist with a leathern girdle . A new picture was ac question at issue . The costume of the painting , formed only the accidental battle ground , as it were , on which the war was waged . It is thus with a great many religious controversies , where at first view it would seem that the point at issue is wholly inadequate to account for the degree of interest taken in the dispute The explanation is that the apparent question is not the real one . The outward aspect of the contest seems to indicate that the combatants are merely disputing about a form , while they are really contending for a primfiple that lies concealed beneath it . They are like soldiers at a siege , who fight on outer walls , in themselves worthless , to defend homes and fire-sides that . are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE MOUNTAIN . But we must return to the mountain , though we return to it only to come down , for it is time that our visit to it should be ended . In his excursions around the convent during his stay on the mountain , the visitor is somewhat restricted in respect to the range that he can safely take , by fear of the wild beasts that infest the jungles and thickets that grow densely on the declivities of the mountain , and around the base of it , especially on the southern side . Panthers , hyenas , wild boars , and strange serpents , make these forests their abode , occupying , perhaps , in many cases , the caves and grottos of the ancient recluses , for their dens . Many tales are told by the monks of these savage beasts , and of the dangers which pilgrims and travelers have incurred from them . There is an account of a child which was found in a certain situation dead , with a monstrous serpent coiled upon its breast . On examination of the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordingly painted in accordance with this decision , as represented in the above engraving . The controversy occupied ten years ; it gave rise to protracted and voluminous proceedings , and embroiled a great number of partisans among all ranks and orders of the church : and by comparing the two engravings the reader will see at a glance the amount of the difference about which the combatants were contending . It might excite surprise in our minds that a large section of the Christian church could thus be engaged for ten years in an earnest , expensive , and bitter controversy about the costume of a painting , were it not that we sometimes see examples at the present day , of disputes equally earnest and protracted , about points smaller and more shadowy still . It ought , however , in strict justice to be said that the real questions at issue in disputes about religious rites and forms , are not usually as insignificant as they seem . Within and beyond the outward symbol there usually lies some principle ofreligious faith , which THE SERPENT . is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound could be perceived , and it was accordIn this case , for example , the comparative claims ingly supposed that the life of the little sufferer to antiquity and pre-eminence on the part of had been extinguished by the chill of the body two powerful religious orders constituted the real of the reptile , or by some other mysterious and // deadly agency , which it had power to exert . Even the roadway leading up and down the mountain is not always safe , it would seem , from these dangerous intruders . It is rocky and solitary , and is bordered every where with gloomy ravines and chasms , all filled with dense and entangled thickets , in which , and in the cavernous rocks of which the strata of the mountain are composed , wild beasts and noxious animals of every kind find a secure retreat . The monks relate that not many years ago a servant of the convent , who had been sent down the mountain to Haifa , to accompany a traveler , was attacked and seized by a panther on his return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately to death , began to play with him as a cat plays with a mouse which she has succeeded in making her prey-holding him gently with her claws , for a time , and then , after drawing back a little , darting upon him again , as if to THE PANTHER . repeat and renew the pleasure of capturing such a prize . This was continued so long , that the cries of the terrified captive brought to the spot some persons that chanced to be near , when the panther was terrified in her turn , and fled into the forests ; and then the man was rescued from his horrible situation unharmed . For these and similar reasons , travelers who ascend to the convent of Mt . Carmel , enjoy but little liberty there , but must confine their explorations in most cases to the buildings of the monks , and to some of the nearest caves of the ancient recluses . Still the spot is rendered so attractive by the salubrity of the air , the intrinsic beauty of the situation , the magnificence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monks , that some visitors have recommended it as a place of permanent resort for those who leave their homes in the West in pursuit of health , or in search of retirement and repose . The rule that requires those who have been guests of the convent more than two weeks to give place to others more recently arrived , proves in fact to be no serious difficulty . Some kind of an arrangement can in such cases always be made , though it is seldom that any occasion arises that requires it . The quarters , too , though plain and simple , are comfortable and neat , and although the visitor is somewhat restricted , from causes that have already been named , in respect to explorations of the mountain itself , there are many excursions that can be made in the country below , of a very attractive character . He can visit Haifa , he can ride or walk along the beach to Acre ; he can go to Nazareth , or journey down the coast , passing round the western declivity of the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofcontinual novelty to attract him , and be surrounded every where with the forms and usages of Oriental life . LEAVING MOUNT cARMEL . The traveler who comes to Mt . Carmel by the way of Nazareth and the plain of Esdraelon , in going away from it generally passes round the western declivity of the mountain , and thence proceeds to the south , by the way of the sea . On reaching the foot of the descent , where the mountain mule-path comes out into the main road , as shown upon the map near the commencement of this article , he turns short to the left , and goes on round the base of the promontory , with the lofty declivities of the mountain on one hand , and a mass of dense forests on the other , lying between the road and the shore . As he passes on , the road , picturesque and romantic from the beginning , becomes gradually wild , solitary , and desolate . It leads him sometimes through tangled thickets , sometimes under shelving rocks , and sometimes it brings him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees the surf rolling in upon the beach at his feet , and far over the water the setting sun going down to his rest beneath the western horizon . At length the twilight gradually disappears , and as the shades of the evening come on , lights glimmer in the solitary villages that he passes on his way ; but there is no welcome for him in their beaming . At length when he deems it time to bring his day 's journey to an end , he pitches his tent by the wayside in some unfrequented spot , and before he retires to rest for the night , comes out to take one more view of the dark and sombre mountain which he is about to leave forever . He stands at the door of his tent , and gazes at it long and earnestly , before lie bids it farewell , equally impressed with the sublime magnificence of its situation and form , and with the solemn grandeur of its history                 @ @ @ @
