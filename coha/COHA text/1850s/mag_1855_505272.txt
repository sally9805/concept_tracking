txt PERSONAL MEMOIRS OF THE HOUSE OF ORLEANS . " THE Duke of Orleans , " said Odillon Barrot ito the deputies and politicians who had assembled at Laffitte 's on the 29th of July , 1830 , and were wavering between the choice of a new king and the abolition of monarchy " the Duke of Orleans is the best of Republics . " Forty years previously , the Odillon Barrots of that day had lustily proclaimed that " the Duke of Orleans would be the best of kings ; " and might have tried the experiment had their farorite been a man of talent or nerve . In precisely similar language , seventy-five years before , the nobles of France admitted , in private conclave , that " the Duke of Orleans would be the best of regents ; " and this time , as in 1830 , the Duke having the will and the courage to take what fortune threw in his way , the expenment was practically tested . Nor have these been the highest compliments paid to bearers of the name . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many a starving family in Paris used to cry , in heartfelt gratitude for the bounties of the Palais Royal , " The Duke of Orleans is the best of men . " Romance and history have been searched in vain for a parallel to the fortunes of the house to which these men belonged . Vicissitudes , stranger than fancy ever pictured , have marked its career from its origin down to our times . Contrasts the most startling , reverses the most overwhelming , successes the most wonderful , follow each other with bewildering rapidity in its annals . Rare examples of virtue , coupled with such vices as can not even be named ; dexterous cunning , and most egregious folly ; inordinate ambition , and incredible carelessness of fortune ; the meanest kind of selfishness , and large liberality ; undaunted courage , and most pitiable pusillanimity-such are a few of the opposite qualities illustrated in the characters of the Dukes of Orleans . In one respect they resembled each other . All , from first to last , coveted the French throne . Even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis XIII . Philippe , the first of the present line , was at least jealous of his brother . The Regent conspired against Louis XIV. , and was accused of plotting mischief against his heir . Another Duke of Orleans was the acknowledged chief of the enemies of Louis XV . Philippe Egalit* voted for the death of Louis XVI. , and was openly nominated for the vacant throne . Louis Philippe , his son , associated with the conspirators who sought to overthrow Louis XVIII. , and gained the throne by the downfall of Charles X. His sons are now secretly conspiring against Napoleon III . No family can be mentioned which has been so constant a foot-ball for fortune . An Orleans once reigned in France : the same man lived to want a single servant . An Orleans was richer than the British Crmsus , the Duke of Sutherland : that man , in Philadelphia , was thankful for the loan of a few dollars . An Orleans proved that those whom the world calls vicious are only , comparatively speaking , moderately depraved : his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Paris . Some of the most repulsive doctrines of despotism can be traced to an Orleans : democracy found a chief in his heir . Power and weakness , wealth and penury , intelligence and stolidity , vice and moderation , recur in the history of this family is regular succession , like the ebb and flow of the tide . In the space of seven generations all the extremes of fortune are exhibited . Nor is the book of Destiny closed . Marvels , yielding nothing in interest to the past , may be written on the pages time has yet to unfold . On a gloomy night in September , 1640 , the Louvre was in great commotion . Lights were hurrying to and fro , courtiers were arriving from all parts of Paris , eager faces were grouped in every corridor . Here and there a messenger looking wonderfully important , or a man in office , with anxious brow , bustled through the crowd , and moved toward the royal chambers . It had been announced that the Queen 's accouchement might be hourly expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat as composed as usual , in an easy chair , chatting lazily with his favorite chevalier ; but her friend , Mazarin , was as much excited as a politician can be , and much more so than he ever appeared before . The courtiers talked in mysterious whispers . Remarks by no means complimentary to the Queen 's virtue were bandied in the ante-chambers ; and the physicians and ladies who hastened to her apartment , were greeted as they passed with significant smiles and shrugs of the shoulders . The friends of Cardinal Richelien , secure in the impunity which his protection afforded , did not scruple to vent their wit or their spite against her Majesty in coarse jests at the very doors of her chamber . The infant whose birth caused this unusual scene was not the first-bore child of Anne of Austria . Two years previously , and twenty years after her marriage with Louis , she had given birth to a son , who became Louis XIV . Rumor afterward asserted that Louis had not // been the only fruit of the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight to their statements , declared that she had been delivered of twins , of whom Louis was one , and the Man in the Iron Mask the other . These stories derived currency from the notorious character of Anne of Austria . Not only had she furnished a theme for scandal by her intimacy with Mazarin , but her conni vance at r.he conspiracy of Gaston d'Orleans , the King 's brother , had been so clearly established , that weak old Louis XIII. , when pressed to receive her into his confidence shortly before his death , exclaimed bitterly , " Is it not enough that I have lbrgiven her , and does she expect me to believe her too ? " On the 21st September her second childPhilip , the founder of the house of Orleanswas born . Less than three years afterward her husband died . Her bitter enemy and most relentless persecutor , Richelieu , had preceded him to the tomb . Anne , immersed in the concerns of the regency , abandoned the education of the family to Mazarin , who shrewdly directed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived , notwithstanding , to pick up some scraps of knowledge ; but the younger , whose natural abilities were good , was allowed to grow up a perfect dolt . He could barely read and write ; and his ignorance of history , literature , and art , were afterward peculiarly con*Acuous at the polished court of his brother . As a boy , he was singnlarly unmanly and effeminate . He loved to spend his time in the ladies ' apartments , and readily allowed them to dress him as a girl . While his brother was shooting or riding , he would shut himself up to enjoy a good dinner or a game at cards . He was fond of dancing , but wore high-heeled shoes to conceal his short stature , and consequently danced like a woman . There was nothing masculine or prepossessing in his face . Jet-black hair and eyebrows , large black eyes , a long narrow face , with a peaked nose , very small mouth , irregular teeth , and a sallow complexion ; such is the description given of him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taste of the ladies of the court to learn that the owner of these features was a general favorite-more so than his brother , the chivalrous and manly Louis XIV . Anne of Austria , who had escaped from the insulting tyranny of Richelien to fall under the equally iron rule of Mazarin , resembled the other fair dames of Paris in this respect-she loved her younger son better than her first-born . At the death of Gaston d'Orleans , brother of Louis XIII. , his title had reverted to young Philip , and with it estates which placed him on a level with the wealthiest nobles of Europe . Anne resolved to consolidate his position by a royal marriage . Though Mazarin believed in tue permanence of the English republic , Anne felt confident of the restoration of the Stuarts , a1nd fixed her choice on Henrietta , daughter of Charles I. This lady had nothing but her birth and a rather pretty face to recommend her . Even the latter has been a subject of dispute . Quaint Pepys says : " The Princess Henrietta is very pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of herself with her hair frizzed short up her ears , did make her seem so much the less to me . But my wife standing near her , with two or three black patches on , and well dressed , did seem to me much handsomer than she . " She had not a livre to bring her husband in the shape of dowry . Poverty had been her companion from her cradle . Born during the civil wars , she had been carried in her mother 's arms to Paris , and had shared that period of privation , when the family of the late King of England " remained abed all day from the cold , having no fuel to make a fire . " She was , however , not destitute of wit , and during her residence at Paris had acquired the courtly manners of the fashionable circles in that capital . The marriage took place a few months after the restoration of the bride 's brother , Charles II . Nothing paints the age better than the domestic life of the Duke and Duchess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous Duke of Buckinghnm , who made no secret of his love for his fair charge . Besides Buckiugham , the Duke of Orleans himself presented to his young wife the Count of Guiche , the handsomest man at court and a notorious lady-killer . Scandal was rife on the subject , and not without cause . One day , as Madame and Dc Guiche were together in her apartments , the approach of the Duke was suddenly announced . The Count and the lady were paralyzed , for escape appeared impossible . " I can manage it , " hurriedly exclaimed a valet , " place yourself against the door , M. Ic Comte . " When the Duke reached the landing the valet ran out , and butted his head so violently against the Duke 's face as almost to stun him , and make his noae bleed . In the confusion , the Count contrived to escape unperceived , with a handkerchief over his face . The King himself was for a time a marked admirer of Henrietta . At Fontaineblean Louis and his fair cousin were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been annoyed at the flirtation were ladies who were jealous of the favor shown to the Duchess . Philip , who , according to his second wife , never loved any one in his life , was a model husband in point of forbearance . When his mother forced him to notice his wife 's intrigue with De Guiche , he settled the matter with a mild reprimand . He claimed , by way of return , that the Duchess should receive his female friends at her soir*es ; and , as the character of these ladies excluded them even from the very indulgent society of Paris , he seems to have had the best of the bargain . Unfortunately for poor Henrietta , she did not extend her complaisance to the male friends of her husband . One of the most depraved and unprincipled men of the time was the Chevalier of Lorraine . His face was repulsive , his habits abominable , // his reputation shocking . This man was the bosom friend of the Duke , who had actually withdrawn from court when the young King , disgusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent him into exile . He had made several attempts to gain the favor of the Duchess , but each time had been sternly repulsed . He resolved on such revenge as his nature prompted . He had a creature in the Duke 's household , a nobleman like himself , the Marquis d'Effiat . One day , while the Duchess was at mass , this Marquis opened her private closet , and took up the cup out of which she usually drank her succory-water . A servant immediately inquired what he did with Madame 's cup ? D'Efflat replied that being thirsty he had come to take a drink ; and feigned great indignation at the valet 's remonstrance . That evening the Duchess called for a cup of succory-water , and lay down as usual in her apartment . Shortly afterward she awoke with a scream of pain . Medical attendance was procured ; the Duke of Orleans displayed decent concern ; the ladies of the household were in violent agitation . Henrietta declared she was poisoned , and could not recover . In the midst of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room , the King arrived , and was followed by the confessor and Montagu , the English embassador . The dying woman mastered her pain for a few moments to convey her last wishes to her countryman . She bade him tell her brother that she had loved him above all things in the world ; and was continuing to speak of him , when Montaga inquired whether she had been poisoned . The confessor instantly stepped forward and forbade her replying . Henrietta meekly obeyed . A meaning glance was her only answer to the question . The sacrament was hastily administered ; Bossuet knelt by the bedside , but before the rites of the Church had been fully completed , Henrietta of England was a corpse . The crime was fully brought home to D'Effiat and Lorraine , but neither was punished . The latter was struck with apoplexy many years after , while he was narrating an immoral tale , and died instantly . The evidence of the witnesses who were examined tended to exculpate Philip , though the murderers felt secure of his approval of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sire , " said Purnon , who confessed his share in the murder to Louis XIV. , " for he is unable to keep a secret , and would have ruined us all . " Au excellent reason , and worthy of the Duke of Orleans . The pleasure of superintending his wife 's funeral seems to have consoled him for her loss , if , indeed , he at all regretted it . Three years afterward his brother , who always treated him tyrannically , commanded him to marry Charlotte Elizabeth of Bavaria . The Duke was used to obedience . He had submitted without a murmur to deprivation of military rank and civil employment , insisting only on his right to lead a dissolute life . So he made no objection to the proposed marriage . Charlotte had not been lucky in her parentage or her companions . Her mother had been sent back to her relations by her husband , who instantly replaced her by a lady of his court . Intrusted to the care of Sophia , the Electress of Hanover and the mother of George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes of coarse indulgence and vulgarity from her earliest years . One can readily imagine the sort of woman that might be expected from the court which produced the first two GeorgeL It was , perhaps , fortunate for her that nature had denied her beauty , and thus kept temptation out of her way . She had-as she says herself- " no features , small eyes , a snub nose , long and flat lips , large pendant cheeks , and a broad face- My stature is short , and my person large ; both my body and my legs are short ; altogether I am a fright . It would be necessary to examine my eyes with a microscope to discover whether they announce intelligence . It would probably be impossible to find on earth more hideous hands than mine . " The truth of the portrait is confirmed by the conduct of two princes to whom her family offered her in marriage ; both entertained the project ' for a time , but instantly drew back when they saw the lady . The Duke of Orleans was less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which did not surprise me , " says the Duchess , quietly . But , he kept his feelings to himself , and lived with his wife about three years . He ruled her household without consulting her wishes in the least ; and though he was the richest man in the kingdom , only allowed her a hundred Louis a year as pinmoney . Their tastes were wholly dissimilar . He was stupid and illiterate ; she was witty and less ignorant than might have been expected from her early education . He was incurably prejudiced against every thing that was not French ; she was as obstinately attached to every thing that was German . Gourrnandise was his ruling characteristic ; his cuisine was French and elaborate . She describes her own habits in this respect with crude frankness : " I take neither chocolate , tea , nor coffee , not being able to endure those foreign drugs . I adhere to our German fashion , and find nothing good in eating or drinking that is not in conformity with our customs . I can not eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wine . I can not endure soup made with boiled beef . Whenever I partake of a dish of which it is an ingredient , I am subject to colic . Ham and sausages are the only things that suit my stomach . " There was as much of the man in her as of the woman in him . When a girl she used to play with swords and guns ; and having been told by a friend that girls who were addicted to jumping were turned into boys , she spent all her leisure in taking the most prodigious leaps . This was about the time that her husband was dressing himself in female clothes , and dancing in high-heeled shoes . After the birth of their second child they separated , as the memoirs say , a l'amiable . In other words , the Duke spent the whole instead // qwq The Dowager Duchess lived to condole with " the old hag " on the death of Louis XIV. ; and to drive her granddaughters distracted by her meddling , captious disposition . She was even less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoirs and letters she left behind her fully explain the circumstances . The publisher says that decency compelled him to expurgate certain passages from her correspondence : at the rate prudery is advancing , there will not he a page of what he did print that will be read a century hence . Philip of Orleans had had two children by each of his wives . Anna Maria , who married the Duke of Savoy , and Charlotte Elizabeth , who became Duchess of Lorraine , lived quiet lives , and history has no concern with them . The career of Maria Louisa , the eldest daughter of Henrietta , is quite in the Orleans style . Her mother never kissed her : when the little girl came to pay her respects , the utmost favor granted to her wa ' 1 to be allowed to press her infant lips to Henrietta 's hand . She was just blooming into womanhood , and promised to surpass her mother in beauty and liveliness , when she was abruptly told , without a word of previous notice , or the smallest inquiry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Carlos , King of Spain  --  a wretched , brokendown debauchee  --  and that she must set out for Madrid . The poor girl fainted , and was taken seriously ill . The moment she recovered she was ordered to proceed on her journey : the will of Louis knew of no delay , and the Spanish alliance was essential to his dynastic projects . To add to the misery of Maria Louisa , the man who escorted her through France was the Chevalier of Lorraine , and the bearer of her future husband 's first letter was the Marquis dEffiat-both murderers of her mother . She produced a favorable impression at Madrid . " The young Queen , " says Madame de Villars , who visited her at her palace , " dressed in the Spanish fashion , and wore some of those beautiful stuffs which she brought from France : her hair well-dressed , brushed across her forehead in front , and the rest flowing on her shoulders . She has an admirable complexion , beautiful eyes , and a very agreeable mouth when she laughs . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Spanish grandees did not think so ; they saw with positive dislike the young Queen 's tendency to gayety , and resolved that " she should at once commence the course of life to which etiquette doomed her for life . They would not grant her the slightest relaxation ; and from her arrival she was subject to a positive slavery , which was rendered more op. pressive by the rigid disposition of the camerara major . " Etiquette was then in its prime at Madrid . When the Queen fell from her horse , and two gentlemen sprang forward and saved her life by extricating her foot from the stirrup , it needed all Maria Louisa 's influence to procure their pardon , which was only granted on condition of their leaving Madrid forever . The whole court seemed bent on persecuting the poor girL The Duchess of Terra Nova wrung the necks of her parrots because they spoke a few words of French ; the King turned her servants out of doors ; and her Spanish waitingwomen shocked her delicacy by attempting to smooth her hair with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After ten years marriage Maria Louisa was not a mother . The court of Spain and the kinsmen of Carlos at Vienna were terrified at the prospect of a disputed snccession ; yet , without crime , the evil was inevitable . Who could propose such a thing to the virtuous Queen ? Olympia de Mancini , the Countess of Soissons , and niece of Cardinal Mazarin , had been at some pains to earn the reputation of the most depraved woman in France . Her uncle had rejected the offers of Charles II . of England , who wanted to marry her before his restoration ; and when Charles regained his throne , he in his turn contemptuously refused to renew the negotiation . Olympia consoled herself by educating young Louis XIV . in vice . Poisoning was her next pastime : among her victims are counted her husband , her mother-in-law , the Marshal of Luxembourg , and several other eminent persons . Detection at length forced the Countess to fly to Brussels , where she was living in obscurity when the Spanish grandees and the royal family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business which could be proposed to no decent person . The Countess possessed undoubted qualifications for the post : she cheerfully consented to go to Madrid . That she earned her reward , and bade the Queen choose between infidelity to her husband and Spanish vengeance , we have Madame d'Aunay 's word for asserting . So skillfully was the odious insinuation thrown out that the failure of the scheme did not involve th' disgrace of the negotiator : in spite of the well-founded prejudice of the King and the French embassador , Maria Louisa continued to allow Madame de Soissons to visit her . The die was cast . One sultry afternoon the Queen asked for milk ; the Countess hastily offered to procure her some . A few moments afterward she entered the room with a glass of iced milk , of which Maria Louisa drank . That night the Queen died in excruciating agonies . Like her mother , she at first declared that she was poisoned ; but , like her mother , retracted the statement by the advice . of her confessor . The Countess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only son of the first Duke of Orleans , of the present line , was named Philip , like his father . He was , like him , delicate in youth ; hut was as ardent in the pursuit of learning as his father had been slothful . Knowledge of all kinds was welcome to him . He read history and science ; became a connoisseur in wines ; practiced chemistry , and judged horse-flesh ; studied languages , and read Aretino in the original ; patronized the drama , and gave his support // to the vilest haunts of profligates . At seventeen his society was courted by men of letters ; at the same age , his mother notes that he " hated innocent amusements . " He was , in fact , the type of the young nobleman of that fast age . His marriage with Mademoiselle de Blois has been mentioned . It was as splendid an affair as the nuptials of a king 's daughter and his nephew ought to be . The young couple disliked each other ; but a Queen undressed the bride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the revolution which drove him from his kingdom , but as proud as ever-condescended to hand the groom his night-shirt . Mademoiselle de Blois was graceful , witty , and as haughty as her father . After her marriage she never condescended to notice her mother , Madame de Montespan ; and was compared to Minerva , who , according to poets , sprang from Jove 's brain without the aid of a mother . When her son was born her pride rose still higher ; she refused to visit any one that was not of royal blood . Deficiencies in her early education frequently made her the jest of her husband and the ladies of the court ; and her constitutional laziness precluded all attempt at improvement . " She is so indolent , " said her amiable motherin-law , " that she will hardly walk two yards : larks ought to fly ready cooked into her mouth . Though her appetite is enormous , she is too idle to eat fast . She goes to bed early , in order to sleep the longer . Reading she detests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep every evening . " Partly from indolence , and partly from pride , she never attempted to win her husband 's heart . She was not jealous , and seemed satisfied provided he behaved respectfully to her in public . When accounts of his infidelities reached her she treated them with contempt . Louis XIV . gave the following comprehensive view of his nephew 's character : " Phjlip of Orleans is as bad as he can be represented ; and moreover , he boasts of vices which he does not possess . " His profligacy and impiety were such that we can find no one to compare him with but himself as Regent . The restraints imposed on him by the religious court of Louis worried him beyond measure ; though he carried Rabelais in his pocket to read during mass , and took care to choose his friends among people who were unknown at court , he complained bitterly that the English nobles were - freer than he . Whether the court which affected so much more piety was in fact any better than the Duke himself may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress to midnight mass on Christmas Eve because they had heard the King was to be there , and returning as precipitately to their revels on a report that he was not coming , is well known . A very pretty guerrilla warfare was kept up between Louis 's three daughters , the Duchesses of Orleans and Bourbon , and the Princess of Conti . The two former , the children of Montespan , used to drink pretty freely ; and their sister affectionately christened them " wine-sacks . " The Princess herself had been smitten with a young officer named Clermont , to whom she wrote letters breathing the most violent love . Clermont , hearing that the Dauphin had begun to pay attention to a Mademoiselle de Chonin , immediately transferred his court to that lady , and to please her , sent her the Princess 's letters , with a humorous commentary of his own . " I had rather , " said the amiable Duchess of Orleans , when the story reached her , " be a wine-sack than a bundle of cast off clothes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirst , smoked pipes in the palace , and had closets in their rooms provisioned like fortresses for the concealment of their lovers , were the leaders of fashion and the rulers of the court . Even the King 's religion was little better than sectarianism . When Louis was told that the Duke of Orleans had appointed M. de Fontpertuis on his staff , he cried with much earnestness : " What ! my dear nephew , the son of that foolish woman who is always running after Arnauld  --  a Jansenist ! I never can consent to such an appointment . " " By my faith , sire , " replied the Duke , " I know nothing of the mother ; but as for the son , so far from being a Jansenist , I do not think he even believes in a God . " " Oh , in that case , " said the King , " if you are sure of that , there is no harm in him ; you may take him with you . " After serving a couple of campaigus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contriving a very neat conspiracy against his nephew 's throne , the Duke of Orleans returned to Paris to find himself in great disgrace at court . A new danger menaced him . The Dauphin suddenly died ; the Duchess of Orleans says of small-pox ; but the surgeons who made a postmortem examination of the body , declared that they had not found any natural cause of death . The title descended to the Duke of Burgundy . He and his wife both died a few months after , and the faculty reported that they had been poisoned . Next , their eldest son fell a victim to a disease which no one understood . A sudden illness carried off the Duc de Bern . The only life that remained between the Duke of Orleans and the throne was the Duke of Anjou , a frail sickly child in the cradle . It was singularly suspicious . People remembered how the first Duke 's wife , Henrietta of England , had been poisoned by D'Effiat , and began to remind each other that the first four governors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip 's love of chemistry-which was then an occult science-gave strength to the awful suspicions . He had openly given it out that he was a necromancer ; did not that imply sorcery , witchcraft , and every diabolical art ? Such were the questions asked at every street corner by the idle Parisians . Soon the fury of the mob burst forth . Crowds surrounded the Palais Royal , and called for the head of the " poisoner . " Imprecations were showered upon him when he appeared in the streets . Even // the women followed his carriage and fought furionsly with the guards to " tear in pieces , " as they said , " the murderer of his family . " The King himself shared the popular belief so far as to turn his back upon his nephew . If Philip of Orleans was innocent he was the most illused man in Europe ; unhappily , his private life justified almost any imputations . His fondness for his daughter the Duchess of Bern had given rise to most horrible scandal : his glaring impiety shocked even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror , to be imprisoned for safety in the Bastile ; but the King dryly answered that he saw no necessity for any thing of the kind . He still led the life of a pariah when Louis XIV . died . A change in the Orleans style was at hand . Long before breakfast-time on the 2d September , 1715 , crowds thronged the narrow street which runs past the Palais de Justice on the Isle de Paris . By seven o'clock liveried coachmen drove blazoned carriages to the door of the edifice , and the highest nobility and magistracy of France began to assemble in the Hall of the Parliament of Paris to hear the will of Louis XIV . read , and to settle the regency . The will had been deposited in the wall of the building , and the place covered with a slab , sealed at the edges . At the command of the Duke of Orleans , first prince of the blood , the seals were broken , the slab removed , and the parchment , which was mildewed , and dripping with wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the minority of the King 's grandson , the kingdom should be governed by a council of regency ; and distributed the principal posts of authority among the members of the royal family . The Duke of Orteans rose , and in a speech of much ability claimed the regency for himself in virtue of the law . The assembly hesitated . To set aside thus flippantly the written command of a monarch whose word had been law forty-eight hours before , seemed a bold enterprise . But Philip had concerted his measures skillfully . The army was devoted to his interests . A large party among the nobility had been persunded or bought over to his side . The law officers of the crown were pledged to sustain him . The latter being called upon to expound the law of the question , opined that Philip was legally entitled to the regency . Saint Simon and othernobles availed themselves of this show of right to win over several supporters of the will . A timely message from the commanding officer of the Guards , stating that in case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , settled the question . To the astonishment of every one , and while the Duke of Maine was still asserting his right to command the garrison , as provided in the will , the meeting unanimously voted the regency , without restrictions , to Philip of Orleans . More than this , the people , who had followed his car* riage shouting , " Poisoner ! Assassin ! " only a few months before , and who still sang songs in which he was compared to the most infamous characters in history , were so delighted at the assertion of the Parliament 's supremacy over the King 's will , that they celebrated the Duke 's victory as a popular triumph . Philip was forty-two years of age when he became Regent . His manners were pleasant , and as his information was extensive , and his taste in matters of art generally correct , his conversation was much admired . No change had taken place in his habits . " His suppers at the Palais Royal , " says his friend , Saint Simon , " were eaten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often his daughter , the Duchess of Bern , and a dozen men , his depraved companions , whom he called roue*s , meaning that they deserved to be broken on the wheel , were his usual guests . To these were added ladies of high rank , but faded reputation , and some persons of the lower rank distinguished for their wit or their depravity . The supper , consisting of the most exquisite viands , was dressed in a place prepared for the purpose , all the utensils being of silver ; the guests themselves often shared the work of the cooks . At these parties all drank deeply , and as the wine warmed them , uttered the most depraved sentiments , and vied with each other in blasphemies . When they had made noise enough and were all intoxicated , they reeled to bed to repeat the same scene the next day . " It took the Regent the whole morning to recover the effects of these debauches : he would never listen to business till after he had taken his chocolate at noon . The presiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bern , his daughter . She was one of the women whose character is stamped on the age . Attacked by a dangerous disease at the age of seven , she was abandoned by the faculty to be cured by the science of her father . Thenceforth she was the only being he loved . He educated her himself , and placed in her hands the infidel and licentious books from which her principles were derived . The great point among the courtiers of the day was to secure the favor of the King and the Dauphin . To attain this end , the pretty Mademoiselle d'Orleans agreed to marry the Dauphin 's son , the Duke of Bern , an honest , stupid fellow , whose head she contrived to turn . The Duke was rather given to piety , and was fine sport for the smart Duke of Orleans and his infidel daughter . He bore it all patiently , till one day coming home early he found his wife in the arms of his chamberlain . To kick the Lothario down stairs , and beat the Duchess severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it only confirmed the impetuous woman in her wild habits . The Duke 's death freed her from all restraint ; and the mad licentiousness into which she plunged scandalized the city and provoked doubts of her sanity . Half her time she spent in a convent ; the other half in revels at the Luxembourg and orgies at the Palais Royal . Passionately fond of display , she sought regal honors from her visitors , and affected the // airs of a Semiramis with the habits of an Aspasia . Her mother she snubbed ; her cousins she defied ; over her father she exercised complete control ; and the chosen gallants who were permitted to share the splendors of her caprice at the Luxembourg found themselves little better than slaves . They were at last avenged by a young provincial named Riom , who gained the heart of the beautiful Duchess , and adroitly contrived to subjugate her to his will . Subjected to a tyranny not less galling than her own , she became as submissive as she had formerly been haughty , and bore in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pettish violence of her lover ; beginning in the prime of her beauty and at the summit of her power to taste the penalty of a life of pleasure . Seized with the pains of childbirth , the doctors pronounced her in serious danger . The parish curd was sent for , but the conscientious man refused to administer the sacrament unless Riom were turned out of the house . The Duchess fired with rage at the very mention of such a thing ; the attendants stormed ; even the Regent condescended to argue with the priest ; but all to no purpose . The ecclesiastic was immovable , and for four days it seemed that the Regent 's daughter would die without making her peace with the Church . After a dreadful struggle she gave birth to a daughter , and before her strength allowed her to rise from bed was married to Riom . Such a intsalliance could not be tolerated ; Riom was instantly sent to a distant province . The Duchess dragged herself to her father , and adjured him , in a voice often interrupted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear husband once more ; but for once the Regent withstood her , and the unfortunate woman , in the twenty-sixth year of her age , went to die broken-hearted at La Muette . Though the Regent possessed undeniable ability and quick perception , it is clear that a man who spent the evening in feasting and debauchery , and the best part of the day in recovering from their effects , could not do much for his dominions . Occasionally we find him taking an active part in public affairs , as , for instance , in the negotiations with Spain , and the renewal of the Dragonnades against the Huguenots . But the bulk of the business of State fell on the shoulders of the Abb6 Dubois . The career of this man illustrates the fallacy of the proposition-so often repeated by liberal monarchists - that , under kings , the real power generally falls into the same hands as in republics . Guillaume Dubois was the son of an apothecary at the little town of Prives , and spent his youth in carrying pill-boxes and clysters to his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to receive holy orders , when he ran away with a servant girl , and apparently destroyed his prospects for life . After a year or two of connubial felicity , however , he *ew tired of his wife , left her , and went to Paris , where he was fortunate enough to fall in with M. St. Laurent , the tutor of the Regent-then Duke of Chartres . By this gentleman young Dubois-who styled himself the Abhe Dubois - was employed to give lessons to his pupil , and St. Laurent dying soon after , the apothecary 's son obtained the vacant post . He wau well suited to the young Duke . Possessed of vast learning , he was a still greater proficient in vice ; nothing came amiss to him , from a discussion on the merits of Cicero and Gorneille to a petit souper a quatre in the faubourg . The Duchess of Orleans admitted that , at first , he " assumed the tone of an honest man so well that she took him for one , " but soon corrected her opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " believes in nothing ; he is a rogue and a scoundrel ; he has the appearance of a fox creeping from its hole to steal a chicken . " He was fox enough to see through and through the Duke , and soon mastered him completely . Through life Philip never withdrew his confi* deuce from the unprincipled Abhe . When the former became Regent , the latter took office as confidential minister , and soon controlled the whole administration . His public labors were prodigious : full twelve hours a day he was in his cabinet , receiving secretaries and embassadors , dictating dispatches , digesting the day 's business for the Regent , and exercising a minute superintendence over every branch of the public service . The reward he sought for his unparalleled devotion to his master 's interests was rank . Cardinals took precedence of the highest nobles at court : Dubois resolved to be a Cardinal . There were some trifling difficulties in the way . Though nominally an Abhe , he had never taken holy orders ; he had a wife living ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glaring profligacy . It must not be supposed that all the dignitaries of the Church of that day were profligates , or infidels , or married men , or laymen ; there were several orthodox Christians and respectable men among them ; but certain it is that Dubois had no trouble in obtaining , in the course of a few days , the several orders of sub-deacon , deacon , priest , bishop , and archbishop . The next step was more difficult . Though half a dozen kings supported Dubois 's claims , the Pope refused to send him the hat , and the ambitious schemer was forced to wait till Clement died . When the Conclave met to choose his successor , Dubois managed matters just ns our political leaders do at primary elections . With all the money that could be raised by the French treasury , the AbM de Tencin , a young man whose sister enjoyed Dubois ' protection , was sent to Rome to buy up the votes . He succeeded so well that Cardinal Conti , having given a written pledge to bestow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when the time came to fulfill his bargain , his Holiness demanded more money . Dubois indignantly referred to his writton promise ; the Pope replied by sending the hat to his brother . Dubois was finally compelled to accede to his avaricious demands , and a few thousand Louis secured the long-coveted rank . // Having attained the highest pinnacle of power and con*ideratioa , Cardinal Dubois began to retaliate on the nobility for the slights he had formerly suffered at their hands . He took delight in insulting the whole body of the peers ; and even shoved a lady of rank out of his room because she addressed him as " Monsigneur " instead of " Votre Eminence . " His temper was ungovernable , and his language so coarse and profane , that he was ironically advised by his secretary to take an additional clerk , and give him , for sole employment , the duty of scolding and swearing at people . Notwithstanding these faults , he was so indefatigable in his office , that he was retained by Louis XV. , and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . The severity of his toils , added to the effects of dissipation , at length told upon his frame . Disease attacked him . Fearful of losing power , he concealed it ; and the pain made him more morose and passionate than ever . On his death-bed he swore at his doctors , ordered the priests to l* turned out of the room , and died raving and cursing every one around him . Under the regency of Philip of Orleans , and the ministry of Cardinal Dubois , the people of France endured miseries hardly to be described . The notorious swindle of the Scotchman Law which owed its success to the Regent 's patronage , beggared the whole country . When we call to mind that the amount of money in circulation was much less than it is now , and was consequently more valuable in proportion to other commodities , we can form some conception of the extent of disaster that must have been produced by the total failure of a bank which had issued paper to the amount of nine hundred millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adventurers had flocked to Paris . Merchants , professional men , mechanics , deserted their business to dabble in shares . Everyday-life was at an end . While the bank lasted , the scenes that were witnessed resembled the ancient Saturnalia . When it fell , a despair that can not be pictured overwhelmed the people . Robbers and assassins walked the streets in broad daylight . Men were murdered and thrown into the Seine , and no one seemed to notice it . In the general calamity life seemed to have lost its value . To complete the horrors of that awful period , the plague suddenly appeared in Provence and Languedoc , and swept away the population by thousands . Those who fled died by the roadaide ; those who staid died in their bed , on their chair , in their office . Famine followed ; and those who escaped the pestilence perished of hunger . It seemed as though a righteous Providence was smiting the nation for the crimes it tolerated in its rulers . While the people were overwhelmed beneath the combined weight of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans had his troubles . He had exhausted pleasure ; and complained bitterly that even the Palais Royal suppers bored him . Though the State was bankrupt , he and his friends had speculated in Law 's shares and in produce , and made money ; one of them , the Duke of Bourbon , not less than ten millions of francs . But wealth had no charms for the Duke of Orleans . He sent to the East and imported a Circassian harem , which diverted him barely a few weeks . Now and then he tried the effect of courting popularity as a change , but the people had not forgotten the stories of poison , or the monstrous suspicions which had led them to identify the Duke with the *Edipus of tragedy , and his daughter , the Duchess of Bern , with Jocasta . When he resigned the regency he fell into the lowest stage of dissipation . His palate required the fierce stimulus of raw brandy , his mind the feverish excitement of the gambling-table . Soon sleepless nights and sluggish days , during which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends , betokened his coming end . Great red blotches on his face told a meaning tale . He had no wife or children to comfort him in his moments of despondency , no religion to strengthen him when the doctors bade him prepare for a stroke of apoplexy . His death is vividly described by Dr. Taylor , in his admirable " House of Orleans . " " One day , after dinner , he retired into a saloon which he had recently furnished most sumptuously for the Duchess of Phalaris . On entering the apartment he found the beautiful Duchess preparing for a ball , her curling locks hanging loose on her shoulders , and her dressing-gown not laid aside . He sat down upon a sofa , and she , taking a low stool , placed herself at his feet , her head reposing upon his knees . After a short pause he said to her , My fair friend , I am quite worn out with fatigue this afternoon , and have a stupefying headache ; tell me one of those lively stories you relate so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face with childish coquetry , and assuming a mocking smile , began : There lived , once upon a time , a king and a queen- ' She had scarcely uttered the words when the Duke 's head sank suddenly on his breast , and he fell sideways on her shoulder . As he was sometimes accustomed to take a brief nap in this position , the lady for a second or two felt no alarm ; but when she saw his limbs grow stiff after quivering in convulsions , she sprang to the bell , and rang it violently . No one replied . She rushed into the outer apartments ; they were deserted ; and it was not till she reached the court-yard that her cries attracted the attention of a few domestics . It was more than half an hour before any medical man made his appearance , and by that time the Duke was quite dead . " So bad was his character that no *lergyman could be found to pronounce his funeral oration . The market-women-whose opinion has always had great weight in Paris-said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had intended for the King . Similar stories // had been current during his regency ; and though it is quite clear they were without foundation , the nobles attached sufficient importance to them to turn their hacks on his son when he came to court . The Regent Orleans left four daughters and one son . The Duchess of Bern was the eldest . The second , Mademoiselle de Chartres , fell in love with an opera-singer , and was sent into a convent , where she led a disorderly life , and humbly imitated her elder sister . The third , Mademoiselle de Valois , was torn from the arms of the Duke of Richelieu to be married to the Duke of Modena . On parting , her aunt gave her the following advice : " Go , my child , and follow my example ; have one or two children , and then behave in such a way as to force your husband to send you back to Paris . This is the only place that is fit for ladies like us . " She obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth daughter of the Regent , Mademoiselle de Montpensier , married Luis , Prince of Asturias , Her levity of conduct so shocked the court of Spain that her husband , when King , had her arrested and sent to prison . He died shortly afterward , and she returned to France , where for eighteen years she led a morose , secluded life , disliked by every one . Her death was hardly noticed . While the Regent was scandalizing Paris by the profanity of his language and the corruption of his morals , a pale , ill-shaped youth was wandering gloomily through the Palais Royal , evidently ill at ease in that abode of gayety and sin . Female society had no charms for him ; he was slow of speech , and shy in manner . Though the courtly crowds that haunted the ducal palace always addressed him with respect , he seldom entered into conversation , and promptly repulsed any overtures of friendship from his neighbors . He had one friend , the Abb* Mangum , a religious terrorist , whose mind was always dwelling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few steadfast believers in the exploded delusion of spiritual manifestations . With this cheerful companion the young man buried himself in the study of the Christian Fathers and the Rosicrucian philosophers . He intended , he said , to build up for the Church a rampart against infidelity . This was Louis Philip , son of the Regent . His father naturally despised him . He had neither ambition nor wit , and these were the only qualities of which the Regent could boast . " How can people be such fools as to imagine , " said the latter , when accused of seeking the death of Louis XV. , " that I would conspire against such a fine young man as the Prince , for the sake of that dunderhead of a son of mine ? " His mother , the haughty daughter of Montespan , ruled him as if he had been a child . He fell in love , or rather-for there was not much love in him-he felt a profound esteem for the Princess Mary Leczinska , daughter of the King of Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prin cess of Baden-Baden , and her son dutifully led her to the altar , while the lady of his own choice espoused the King . Louis Philip had no sympathy for his wife or any one else . The Jacobin fathers , and the works of Thomas Aquinas , absorbed his whole attention ; theological disputes dried up the fount of humanity in his breast . He was scrupulously attentive to his religious duties , and did good service in the Jansenist ranks ; but took no part in State affairs , and was equally a stranger to the intrigues of his own family . He wrote several polemical pamphlets against the Jesuits , some of Which were printed ; and founded a professorship of Hebrew at the Sorbonne , in order , as he said , that heretics should not be the only people who read the Bible in the originaL Having done this , he died in the arms of the monks of St. Genevieve . The next of the Orleans-who was also named Louis Philippe-is a new type ; as different from the brilliant profligate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Educated in the camp , he served several campaigns under the able generals of Louis XV. , and gained laurels which were sure to cost him the royal favor . After the battle of Hastenbech , the King informed the Duke that the State had no further need of his services . Louis Philippe submitted without a murmur : energy was not a part of his character . He married a princess of that inconceivably depraved family , the Bourbon-Contis , and , as might have been expected , was soon the most injured of husbands . He bore the disgrace of his wife 's conduct as long as it was possible , and when common decency compelled him to notice her enormities , he separated quietly , and without a word of reproach . The fact was , Louis Philippe never could meet an enemy face to face except on the battle-field when he had sheathed his sword his pluck vanished , and he sought to gain his ends by tortuous intrigue . Not that nature had endowed him with cunning ; any child could out-maucenyre him ; but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , when a series of disreputable tricks had elevated Madame de Pompadour to the highest rank at court , the Duke of Orleans was her most obsequious follower . He was conspicuous at her levers , ate her dinners , and , as he was intimate with Cofl6 , Favard , and other dramatic writers , helped her to get up theatricals for the King 's amusement . The lady recompensed him by countenancing the fables which charged him with being the accomplice of the assassin Damien . He aimed at popularity , and therefore always lived at Paris instead of Versailles . When bread was dear , loaves were distributed at the Palais Royal to the poor ; sick persons were attended by the Duke 's physicians , and houses hired for their use . No one applied unsuccessfully at his door for relief . These bounties procured him the title of the " King of Paris . " T was but a name . " Our cousin , " said Louis XV. , " is not // likely to be dangerous ; let him amuse himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Duke might inspire gratitude , esteem never . The Duc de PenthThvre , son of one of Montespan 's children , and the richest man in France , offered his daughter to Qrleans as a wife for his son , the Duke of Chartres . The offer was haughtily declined . " The House of Orleans would not intermarry with the bastard line . " Scarcely had the refusal been dispatched , when M. de Lamballe , the only brother of the rejected lady , fell dangerously ill . His death would swell his sister 's fortune to over half a million of dollars . The Duke instantly reconsidered his reply , and sent to say that he consented to the marriage . M. de Penthi*vre was delighted at the turn affairs had taken ; the notaries were drawing the contract , and Orleans was haggling about the settlement , when M. de Lamballe unexpectedly recovered . Without a moment 's hesitation the Duke broke off the match . He could not hear the thought , he said , of disgracing his name by allowing his son to marry a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Penthi*ivre raved with fury ; Choiseul , the nobleman who filled the honorable part of match-maker , invoked vengeance on such perfidy ; the whole court was indignant . Mademoiselle de iPenthi*ivre herself who had so far forgotten her station as to fall in love with the Duke of Chartres , would hear of no other husband . All which rather amused the impassible Duke of Orleans . Of a sudden the news rushed through the city that M. de Lamballe had had a relapse and died . The Duke instantly hastened to Choiseul , and , with tears in his eyes , confessed that he had not the heart to make two young people unhappy : let them marry , and they should have his blessing . The quarrels were soon mended , and the marriage took place . When this mean , quibbling , foolish man succumbed to an attack of gout , in his sixtieth year , much sensation was caused by the funeral sermon preached over his body . Instead of dilating on the good qualities of the deceased , as usual on such occasions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to praise but an illicit connection formed by the Duke , shortly before his death , with a beautiful widow . The King tried to suppress the sermon ; but many people heard it , and Grimm made notes of its tenor . One can hardly tell which to admire most , the boldness or the singular standard of morality adopted by the priest . After a lapse of two generations , the Regent Orleans was reproduced in his great-grandson , Louis Philippe Joseph , whose marriage to Mademoiselle de Penthi*vre has been mentioned . He was a handsome , dashing , open-hearted , wild young fellow ; of course , without any morals or religion  --  but affable to all , and a great favorite with the ladies . We can readily picture him jumping over his wife 's train at his marriage , to the speechless horror of the staid old courtiers ; and driving his wife and other ladies incognito to a rather fast ball in the public gardens , himself mounted en postiion , and the Princess de Lamballe on the box . When Voltaire came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosopher of Ferney , the Due de Chartres received him at the Palais Royal , and presented him to his family . " This pretty boy , " said the old man , patting the Duke 's eldest son , Louis Philippe , on the head , " reminds me of the Regent . " Buffon and Franklin were likewise frequent guests at the Palais Royal . After a morning spent in horse-racing with the Count d'Artois and other scamps , the Duke would gather these great men around him , and affect the Alcibiades : when evening came , he would be seen at the feet of Madame de Genlis , or in the midst of some wild revel with less reputable associates . In his youth he had been sei*it to sea , and had served-some say with credit-at Ushant ; had become vastly popular with the sailors , and made hosts of friends both in the navy and at the sea-port towns . This was enough for the King . The Duke was recalled to Paris . He begged hard to be allowed to serve under Rochambean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . The incurable stupidity of these Bourbons forced every bold spirit into the ranks of their enemies . Here was a young man , full of energy and intellect ; wild as his companions , but vigorous even in his follies ; imbued with the new lights of the age , and sympathizing heartily with the people , while closely connected with the throne and the nobility-just such a man , in short , as might , if any could , have gnided the monarch through the perilous struggle that was at hand ; and Louis could find nothing better to do than to write him unjust and cutting letters about his conduct at Ushant , while the Queen insulted his friend Madame de Genhis . What wonder that we find him banded with the enemies of the court ? At that time the very air of Paris was revolutionary . Every thing seemed to require a change . The old world-government , church , laws , literature , science , society , manners-was mouldy , and only wanted a broom to sweep it away altogether . It rained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets , every one had some abuse to correct . For his share the Duke of Orleans set the fashion of wearing pantaloons instead of breeches , and boots instead of pumps with buckles- " just like a common man ; took a stand against hair-powder , drove his own phaeton , and actually rode his own horses at races . The agony of the court at these disgracefully plebeian practices was dreadful . Worse was to follow . At the meeting of Parliament the Duke openly protested against the registration of the royal edict for raising a loan , and bearded the Kind in the most audacious manner . The old Bourbon pride rose , and the Duke was exiled . Parliament remonstrated , and was snubbed . Parisian blood was up , however , and there was no // talk of yielding : the King was peremptorily summoned to hring the Duke of Orleans to trial or to release him ; and , with his usual inconsistency , he recalled the exile within a week . The Duke returned a thorough republican . He threw down the gauntlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electing Deputies to the States-general "  --  a production of remarkable merit . This profession of political faith demanded the recognition of individual liberty ; the abolition of lettre , s de cachet , and other arbitrary processes ; the establishment of the haheas corpus ; the liberty of the press ; the inviolahiity of property ; the responsibility of ministers ; the consolidation of the public debt ; and the transfer of the right of taxation from the Crown to the States-general . This circular placed the Duke of Orleans in the van of the revolutionary party . His generous relief of the poor , during the severe winter of 1788-9 , still further augmented his popularity ; it soon rose to such a height that , when he appeared in public , crowds followed him hiessing him , and the performance at theatres was interrupted by the boisterous aeclamations of the audience when he entered . lie took his seat in the States-general us a deputy of the third estate . The King summoned him to his place among the Princes of the blood : " Sire , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be near you ; but my duty bids me stay where I am . " When the schism divided the nobles and the third estate , the Duke joined the latter , and was elected President of the National Assembly . This was the climax of his fame and power ; he seems to have lacked ambition to push his advantages , and possibly feared while he encouraged the revolutionary tide . Politicians were not wanting to propose the dethronement of Louis XVI. , to make room for the Duke of Orleans ; but if he was a party to these schemes - which he always denied-he abandoned the whole responsibility of their success to others . He was a passive spectator of the fitful contests which preceded the King 's removal to Paris ; and when Louis tried to get him out of the way by dispatching him as embassador to London , he obeyed without a murmur , aud seemed to forget , in the jovial company of the Prince of Wales and his sporting friends , the awful trials through which his country was passing . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an orator , here and there , proposed his name for the regency ; but he had tact enough to avoid the danger , whatever his real wishes may have been . Soon-as happened to all **37;274;TOOLONG he had helped sharpen was pointed to his own breast . It was proposed that princes of the royal family should be incapable of exercising rights as citizens . The Duke defended himself and his rights manfully ; but the act of proscription was carried . He resigned all his hereditary privileges , titles , and rank by a solemn act ; and was allowed to sit in the As*embly . But the personal sacrifice did him little good : he had lost his foothold among the leaders of the Revolution , and was soon far in the rear . He was foolish enough to believe in the monarchy still . When the war broke out , he offered his services to the King , and sought a personal interview . It was granted ; but the courtiers combined to insult him , and when he ap .. proached the table on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one touch the dishes I " The Duke understood the calumnious insinuation , and left the palace , a more bitter foe than ever to the court . Disasters fell thickly upon his head . Hi* fortune melted alway in the revolutionary furnace . A lawsuit with his wife rendered the breach between them irreparable . Madame do Genlis and his daughter were in England . His elder sons disapproved his political course . The old nobles treated him like a dog . The constitutional monarchists feared him as an ambitious intriguer . The republicans distrusted him as a prince . He resolved to make one more effort to regain his lost position among the revolutionary leaders . A petition he presented on behalf of his daughter brought him in contact with Manuel , a red-hot republican . " What name is this ? " - gruffiy asked the Procureur Syndic , glancing at the signature to the petition- " Louis Philippe Joseph d'Orleans ? There are no longer any Bourbons in France nor Orleans either ; the 10th of August abolished the whole of them . The petition can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Orleans still . " " Take a new one . " The Duke was paralyzed by this unexpected difficulty . " There , " continued Manuel , pointing to the statues of Liberty and Equality which stood in the room , " are two capital godmothers for a revolutionary baptism . Choose one of them , and honor her name . " The Duke acquiesced , and was christened with mock solemnity Philippe Egaliti . Egalit* , as he was always called , was returned to the National Convention by the city of Paris . Desperate were the efforts he made to ingratiate himself with the republican leaders , but to no purpose . Murat proclaimed that " a patriotic prince was as obvious a chimera as a virtuous scoundrel . " Buzot proposed his banishment ; even Robespierre , who esteemed him personally , avowed himself in favor of the exile of the whole family . The wretched man sold his soul to save himselt When the King 's punishment was before the Assembly , and the President called on Philippe Egalit* for his vote , he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty alone , and persuaded that those who have conspired or may conspire against the sovereignty of the people deserve death , I vote for death . " The horrible act did not gain him a single friend . Even the democrats shrank from contact with the man who could , with a lie on his lips , doom his relation and the head of his fain- // ilv to the scaffold . Broken by disappointment , aud shunned by every one , the wretched creature ran to hide himself in the country . Meanwhile his son , Louis Philippe , had fled with his commanding officer , General Dumonriez . The fury of the Convention knew no bounds when they ascertained the treason of the latter and the escape of the former . Their vengeance sought a victim . On 7th Aprilten weeks after the execution of Louis XVI. - Philippe Egaliti was arrested in his house . The Convention voted that it had always been intended to include him in the sentence against the Bourbons ; and with his young son , the Count of Beaujolais , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , the Duke of Montpensier , who was likewise in prison . The Duchess of Orleans had been allowed to remain at Vernon in consequence of her ill-health . A few weeks were spent by the captives in terrible suspense ; till , in October , orders came for the removal of Egalit* to Paris for trial . The separation-which was most painful to his sons - he bore with fortitude : indeed , from the time of his imprisonment to his death , his courage was worthy of all praise . Four days after his arrival in Paris , he was brought to trial before a jury . No witnesses were called : the President of the Court addressed several interrogatories to the prisoner , and his replies constituted the whole case . We can judge of its legal value from a few samples . After the usual inquiries as to name , age , occupation , etc. , the examination proceeded as follows : " Have you not had private interviews at Sillery 's house with Laclos , Brissot , and others ? " No . " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . " How could you consent to deliver your daughter into the hands of that traitor , and Genus , that clever and designing woman , who has since emigrated ? " I did certainly consent to deliver my daughter to the woman Sillery , who did not deserve my confidence , as she was associated with Petion : I allowed him to accompany her to England . " But ought you not to have known that Sillery was an intriguing woman ? " I was absolutely ignorant of it . * * * * * " Did you not one day say to a Deputy whom you met , What will you ask of me when I am King ? ' " I never said any thing of the kind . " Was it not to Poultier that you said so , and did he not reply , I will ask you for a pistol to blow your brains out ? ' " No. * * * * * " Were you acquainted with the plans of Dnmouriez before he became an open traitor ? " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that you were ignorant of the designs of that wretch who was your creature , when you placed your son under his orders to fly with him and share his treason , intrusted your daughter to his care , and even corresponded with him yourself ? " I only received two or three letters from him , and they were on indifferent subjects . " Why did you permit yourself to be called Prince under the republic ? " I have tried every means of preventing It ; even fastening a notice to my door , to warn people that those who used the title should be expected to pay a fine to the poor . " The whole examination was of this character . The interrogatories were leading questions , predicated upon the presumed treason of the prisoner ; and the replies wc*e categorical denials of the facts imputed . Yet the jury had no hesitation in finding a verdict of guilty . " Since you had resolved beforehand , " said Egalihi , in a firm voice , " to put me to death , you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can never make the world believe that you thought me gnilty of the crimes of which you have convicted me ; and , least of all , you , " he added , addressing the foreman of the jury , whom he had known previously . " However , since my lot is cast , I demand that I be led to death instantly . " The public prosecutor politely observed that he would do all in his power to gratify him . Led back to prison , Egalit* breakfasted-for the trial had occupied but a small portion of the morning  --  and spent some time with his confessor . At half past three the executioner 's cart called for him . Having dressed himself with peculiar care , in green frock-coat , white waistcoat , and doeskin breeches , and powdered his hair , he was led out by a small body of gensd'armes . " His tread was so firm , and his mien so noble , that he looked more like a general leading his troops than a prisoner conducted to the scaffold . " The cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their usual curiosity , but Egaliti 's face did not change a muscle till he reached that part of the Rue St. Honor* on which the Palais Royal stands . There the words " National Property , " inscribed on the door of his family mansion , caught his eye , and for a moment his nature gave way ; memories of his early home crowded on his mind , and his frame shook with emotion . It was but for a moment . The Place Louis XV . was soon reached , and they stood at the foot of the scaffold . The wheels cut deep ruts in the ground , moistened with the blood of so many victims . Lightly Egalit* leaped from the cart . With experienced hand the executioners bound him to the plank . One fellow , more gluttonous of plunder than the rest , tried to pull off his boots . " Patience , my friend , " said Egaliti , quietly ; " they will come off easier in a moment . " At that instant the signal was given , the knife fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled into the basket placed to receive it . // qwq at Valmy and Jemappes . He was , according to all accounts , a brave and skillful soldier , and a humane and enlightened man  --  a startling contrast to his ancestry . When Dumouriez fled from France , after failing in his attempt to persuade his army to raise the standard of revolt against the Convention , he was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres . To the lasting honor of the latter be it said , that he peremptorily refused to serve in the army which the royalist emigrants , aided by foreign tyrants , were raising to crush the young liberties of France . His wanderings through Europe are familiar to every one . He lived so near to our times and his destiny was so marvelous , that boys at school remember the stories of his travels through Germany and Switzerland-how he entered an academy as mathematical teacher , and earned a testimonial of good conduct from the principal - how he endured insult , privation , and hardships of every kind ; recognized one day by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he vainly schemed , and planned , and hoped against hope for the day which should witness the reunion of his scattered family-how , finally , pressed by want , and sick of European conflicts in which he could take no share , he accepted a generous offer made by Mr. Gonverneur Morris , United States Minister to France , and set sail for Philadelphia . Lu the following spring he was joined by his brothers , Montpensier and Beaujolais , and all three , with very scanty means , undertook to travel over the United States . Kindness awaited them on every side , President Washington setting the example ; and loans front generous friends , with an occasional remittance from their mother , enabled them to fulfill their design . Many years afterward , their mother published a book called " Vindication of the Duke of Orleans , " which contains some curious statements relative to these travels . While at Boston , the " princes " heard of the decree which sentenced their mother to be transported . " They supposed , " says this work , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cayenne , and resolved , if possible , to be there before her . They immediately proceeded ( from Boston be it remembered ) to Connecticut by Philadelphia and New York . On their way they learned that the Duchess had been sent to Spain . " With a view of joining her , they resolved to sail for Havana ; but " the ice on the Delaware prevented their taking ship from Philadelphia . " They then thought of Charleston , but abandoned the idea from a still stranger motive , according to the " Vindication , " viz. , " because the neutrality of the United Stateswas becomingvery suspicious . " Finally theyset outforPittsburg , Ohio , andsailed ( Iowa the Ohio and Mississippi to New Orleans . On the way they met with very singular adventures . At one time the boatmen were overcome by fatigue , and the " princes " were obliged to " take the oars and row . " At another " they could procure no boatmen who knew the river , or even understood how to steer the vessel ; " and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch by turns . They " were constantly exposed to the greatest dangers from the ice " on the Mississippi . Dr. Taylor remarks , that " this narrative will be read with amazement , " and it certainly is very surprising . They embarked for Cuba , at last , and were captured by an English frigate . Fortunately , however , the captain , Lord Dundonald , kindly consented to land them at Havana ; and they fancied themselves safe in the Spanish dominions . They were mistaken . The Prince of Peace could not afford to give a refuge to such exiles ; and they were civilly required to leave the island . This drove them to a British colony . They visited in succession the Bahamas and Nova Scotia ; made a second attempt , as unsuccessful as the first , to enter Spain , where their mother was : and returned for a time in England , where Montpensier died . His brother 's death followed soon after at Malta , and the only surviving male representative of the Orleans accepted a home from the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the continent of Europe three persons  --  the Duke of Orleans , his mother , and his sister-whose sole concern for many years had been to meet each other , and yet whom fate seemed resolved to keep apart . The dutiful , though singular , journeys of the first in search of his mother have already been noticed . Mademoiselle Adelaide , his sister , was as anxious to find him . They had parted fifteen years before in Switzerland , and for some time each had been absorbed in seeking safety . But when the Duke returned to England from America , the chief dangers were past , and his sister traveled thither to meet him . He had left for the Mediterranean before she arrived ; and the affectionate girl at once took ship for Malta . When she reached Palermo , she was informed that her brother had gone to Gibraltar ; she followed him thither , but was again told that lie had returned to England . At length , after journeys which would be scouted as impossible in a romance , she arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sicily ; theymet accidentally , and recognized each other with an emotion which can easily be conceived . From their mother they had been separated nearly twenty years . To see her was now their sole aim . Spain was closed against them ; but by great interest they succeeded in sending her a letter , appointing the island of Minorca as a place of meeting . The Duchess , who during these twenty years had endured all manner of suffering from illness , privation , and mental anxiety , did not recognize her children when they appeared in her presence ; the horrors she had witnessed since they had parted had obliterated their features from her memory . Louis Philippe married the Princess Amelia , the daughter of the King of Naples- " a mild and pleasing woman "  --  and lived quietly in Sicily till Napoleon 's overthrow and exile to // Elba . The news reached him accidentally . The next morning he was en route for Paris . Instantly on his arrival he flew to his boyhood 's home  --  the Palais Royal ; but was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers were not allowed to enter the private apartments . Louis Philippe burst into tears , and kissed the stairs of his ancestral palace . His father , who had scoffed at danger and met death with a smile , had likewise wept at the sight of his much-beloved Palais Royal . When Louis XVIII . began to restore the monarchy on the old Bourbon footing , it is said that Louis Philippe felt and expressed loud indignation . Certain it is that both previous and subsequently to Napoleon 's return from Elba the Duke of Orleans was in bad odor at court . When the Emperor landed at Cannes , the Duke took the command of the forces in the north ; but like the other partisans of the Bourbons , he was overwhelmed by the popularity of Napoleon , and without attempting to strike a blow , fled to Twickenham . After the hundred days , he returned to Paris , and lived as quietly as any bourgeois . That he nurtured designs upon the throne there can be no question ; he had been indicated by Alexander , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man for the occasion ; and a large party in France openly sought his elevation . But his circumspection was too large to permit him to take any steps which might have jeopardized his safety . He contented himself with gaining popularity by extensive charities ; sending his son to a public school , and drawing round him the elite of French literary and political society . He was not received at court , and was known to be intimate with the most bitter opponents of the Bourbons ; but he remained perfectly quiet , watching events . He led the same life during the reign of the imbecile Charles X. ; with this trivial difference that the monarch admitted his ambitious cousin to his society , and even condescended to attend the fetes of the Palais Royal . Louis Philippe was a giant in intellect in comparison with the Bourbons ; he bided his time . On the 27th July , 1830 , a crowd was assembled in the Rue Richelieu , opposite the printing-office of " Le Temps " newspaper . The proprietor stood , with calm face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small knots around him , showed by the agitation of their gestures that some strong excitement was at work . The by-standers , many of whom appeared intelligent , respectable men , gazed intently on the group . About noon a small body of gensd'armes , headed by a commissary of police , made way through the unresisting crowd toward the office of Le Temps . The proprietor , M. Baude , challenged them . The commissary replied that he had come , in virtue of his office , to execute an ordinance of his Majesty , Charles the Tenth , dated the day before , which suspended the liberty of the press , and enjoined upon the police to destroy the presses and type of all newspapers which presumed to violate its provisions . M. Baude replied that the ordinance in question was unconstitutional , null and void , and that he would neither obey it , nor open his door to the police . The commissary sent for a blacksmith to break open the door . When the man came M. Baude calmly opened the penal code which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking into private dwellings : the blacksmith , menaced with a criminal prosecution , drew back , and refused to use the tools he had brought . Another was procured , but he , too , dared not risk the penalties the intrepid Baude thundered in his ears . The commissary was at last compelled to send for a workman employed by the government to rivet the irons on convicts : he had no compunctions of conscience ; the door was broken open , and the presses and types partly confiscated and partly destroyed . That night a shot from the musket of a soldier killed a woman . Her body was carried in procession-it became the standard of the Revolution . For two days the Swiss and a few French regiments did battle with the insur. gents : on the 29th the victory was won . During the whole of the conflict , and indeed for some days previously , constant communications had taken place between the banker Lafitte and his friend the Duke of Orleans . When the overthrow of the monarchy became a fixed fact , Lafitte assembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the project of raising the Duke of Orleans to the throne . They agreed upon the following proclamation , which was posted on all the walls of Paris : " FRENcHMEN ! " Charles X. can return no more to Paris . He has shed the people 's blood . " A republic would involve us in civil dis cord and foreign wars . " The Duke of Orleans is devoted to the rev* lutionary cause . " The Duke of Orleans never fought against us . " The Duke of Orleans fought at Jemappes . " The Duke of Orleans would be a citizen King . " The Duke of Orleans carried the tricolor flag against our enemies cannon . " The Duke of Orleans can alone carry it again . We will have no other flag . " The Duke of Orleans does not declare himself . He waits our orders . If we proclaim them , he will accept the Charter as we have always understood and desired it . He will hold the crown as the free gift of the French people . " This skillful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafitte to a man . As the Bourbons were crushed , there only remained the Republicans to conciliate . To these it was that Odillon Barrot spoke the famous words : " The Duke of Orleans is the best of Republics . " T was well said ; but a fine speech did not convince the mob assembled before the Hotel de Ville . Had they been // Americans or Englishmen , they would have reqnired explicit pledges , frankly given by the proposed monarch , and guaranteed by wellknown popular leaders ; being Frenchmen , the road to their convictions lay in a different direction . The Duke of Orleans , who had hastily arrived at Paris from Neuilly , appeared on the balcony of the Hotel de Ville , arm-in-arm with Lafayette , waving a tricolor flag over his head . This proved every thing . The mob shouted , " Vive le Due d'Orleans ! " and all was settled . The Deputies elected him king by a vote of 219 to 33 ; and in presence of the assembled Chambers he was duly crowned . At length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The prize for which the Regent and Philippe EgalitS-not to speak of the more insignificant members of the family-had striven in vain , had fallen into the grasp of their descendant . The family feud between the Orleans and the Bourbons had lasted till the dishonor of the latter and the triumph of the former . The Duchess of Orleans , bred in profound respect for hereditary rights , had seen her husband 's elevation with pain . On the other hand , his sister , Madame Adelaide , the same whose energy has been already noted , a woman of masculine mind thoughquestionablevirtue , had entered warmly into his ambitious schemes , and advised him throughout the crisis of July . His sons shared his feelings in every respect . The best men in France , led by Lafitte , Lafayette , and Dupont de l'Eure , felt fully satisfied with the Revolution , and sanguinely hoped great things from Louis Philippe . They had miscalculated their man . No sooner had he reaped the fruit of forty years of prudence , than he forgot all the lessons of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn round upon those to whom he owed his elevation was his first act . Under his directions , the office held by ILafayette as commander of the National Guard , was abolished ; and the venerable patriot died in mortification and disappointment , deeply bewailing with his last breath that he had been instrumental in raising Louis Philippe to the throne . To Lafitte , the banker , the king owed still more than to Lafayette . It was Lafitte who swayed the council on the 27th July , in favor of the Duke of Orleans : his influence first brought round the leaders of the republican party , and procured the vote in the Chamber . After the revolution Lafitte , in common with other mercantile men , became embarrassed in his private business : a short respite would probably have enabled him to re-establish his credit ; but at the very moment his creditors were pressing him , Louis Philippe called for the repayment of an old loan , and the banker failed . Dupont de l'Eure , the friend of Lafitte and Lafayette , tendered his resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philippe felt that he had shaken off the load of obligation he owed them . He made the same mistake as Napoleon Ill. : 787 he forgot that he was nothing more than a popular chief , and aimed at consolidating a dynasty . Louis XIV . himself was less ambitious for his children than " the Citizen King . " His eldest son , an amiable and enlightened man , was , he thought , secure of the French throne . For the second , the Duke of Nemours , he tried hard to obtain a Belgian crown , and even induced the Belgian statesmen , partly by argument and partly by corruption , to invite the Duke to rule over them . But England had not forgotten her jealousy of the royal house of France : she vetoed the arrangement , forced the Belgians to bestow the crown on Prince Leopold , son-inlaw of *George IV. , and Louis Philippe , too weak at that time to risk a contest with his powerful neighbor , contented himself with marrying one of his daughters to the successful rival of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Due d'Aumale , he sought to compensate him by securing him unrivaled riches . The last member of the great families of Bourbon and Cond* , and the sole possessor of their enormous wealth , was an old dotard , the Duke of Bourbon , Prince of Cond* , who was living in a wretched way in the country , in complete subjection to an imperious Buglish actress named Dawes . With this woman Louis Philippe did not disdain to open a private correspondence , not only placing her on a footing of equality with his own family , but actually stooping to cajole and flatter her . By her machinations the old Duke was induced to make a will , in which , after several rich bequests to herself , the Due d'Aumale was named heir to the bulk of the Cond&amp;* property . A short while afterward , one morning , the Duke 's servants entered his room and found him banging by a handkerchief to the window-sash , quite dead . Medical men declared that the handkerchief ; tied as it was , could not have produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , the fact may be regarded as beyond question . The public mind in Paris was vielently agitated by the news . People called loudly for the trial of the woman Dawes , and confidently expected to see her condemned for murder . But , to the amazement of every one , the King stepped forward , took her under his protection , forbade any prosecution , hushed up the affair , and quietly assisted D'Aumale to enter into possession of the property . Louis Philippe never recoveredthe effects of this act . When M. Thiers resigned office , in 1836 , . he left a minute for the instruction of Count Mohi , his successor , which contained the following sentence : " The Duke of Orleans must be married . Two ladies are proposed : the Duchess Helena of Mecklenberg Schwerin , and the Princess of Coburg . The former is the most intellectual , but the plainest ; the latter is pretty , but has not ceased playing with her dolL " The dispute between the two was settled by the marriage of the Duke of Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter . The marriage of Louis Philippe 's youngest son , the // Duke of Montpensier , was more difficult to conclude . The Queen of Spain , Isabella , was unmarried ; all the Sovereigns of Europe set to match-making for her benefit . Knowing Louis Philippe 's propensities , foreign statesmen expected him to put forward Montpensier as a suitor  --  the cunning old fox knew better . She had a sister , a pretty little girl , named Louisa , who was just budding into womanhood . Her the French King-solemnly protesting that his regard for his allies prevented his seeking her sister 's hand for his son-selected for his daughter-in-law . England saw through the scheme , and vehemently opposed it ; but the Spanish Queen-Mother , Christina , was induced to give her support to the project . Her object was to marry her daughter to her nephew by marriage , Don Francisco d'Assis , who was an imbecile in mind , and effeminate and weakly in body ; and this was precisely what Louis Philippe desired . Availing herself of a fit of ill-temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , extorteda reluctant assent from her daughter , and had it celebrated that very night . Within an hour , Don Francisco became the Queen 's husband , and the Duke of Montpensier the consort of her sister . Thus far all had gone well with Louis Philijpe . He had lost his eldest son , it was true ; but the Duke had lived at open variance with his father , and , however deeply the King 's paternal affection felt the shock , his policy was a gainer by the bereavement . The Due de Nemours had married the first cousin of the Queen of England . D'Aumale was the richest man in France . Montpensier stood a fair chance of succeeding to the Spanish throne . His daughter ruled her husband , the King of ' the Belgians . Even Joinville had contrived , by artfully pandering to the French prejudice against England , to gain considerable popularity in France . The King 's authority seemed secure . A compact majority sustained his Ministers in the House . Severe laws curbed the press . An active police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe seemed so fair or so prosperous as the house of Orleans in October , 1846 . Sixteen months afterward the rottenness of the basis on which it rested became apparent . The nation demanded electoral reform : the King-obedient to the invariable law that reformers in office are the most obstinate of conservatives-refused to yield an inch . Banquets all over France menaced the throne . On 22d February , 1848 , a banquet was to be held at Paris . Two days before , the walls were pla* carded with notices prohibiting assemblages on that day ; and on the morning of the 22d the Place de la Concorde and the boulevards were filled with soldiers , among whom the uniform sf the mounted municipal guards was conspicuous . Crowds thronged the streets , wandering to and fro , apparently without a motive ; but every now and then a gamin threw a stone at a soldier , and the crowd applauded the act . Retaliation on the part of the military roused the anger of the populace . A *woman-street-frays always begin with the killing of women-was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men rushed to avenge the deed . Every straw showed how the wind blew . On the night of the 22d barricades rose . Next day the National Guards appeared in the streets , and marched round the city calling for Reform ! Bugeand , who commanded the garrison , advised energetic resistance and the argument of " infallible artillery ; " but Louis Philippe had lost his presence of mind , and would consent to nothing . When he heard that the troops on the boulevards had fraternized with the insurgents , he agreed to dismiss his Ministers , and appoint popular men in their stead ; but it was too late . All Paris was in commotion . Hard fighting was going on at the Palais Royal . Emile de Girardin-who is said to be the illegitimate son of Adelaide , the King 's sister-thrust a pen into his hand , and forced him to sign an act of abdication in favor of his grandson , the Count of Paris . With this he hurried to the Chamber of Deputies , where the Duchess of Orleans , accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon made their appearance . The House was in confusion . A desultory debate on forms began , when a body of armed insurgents burst open the doors and dissolved the sitting at the point of the bayonet . To seize the chair which M. Sauzet , more from stupidity than cowardice , had just vacated , to place in it M. Dupont do l'Eure , and to vote a Provisional Government , was the work of an instant . The monarchy was overthrown . Louis Philippe , paralyzed by the rapidity of events , remained in a state of abject imbecility while his throne was falling . To Bugeand 's prayers that the cannon of the Carousel might be used he would not listen ; his ear was closed to every manly proposal . While he was wringing his hands at the thought of the abdication which had been extorted from him , the mob invaded the Tuileries , and the King , with his wife , fled precipitately to St. Cloud . There again , some of his officers proposed resistance ; but Louis Philippe thought of nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he posted to Versailles , and thence to Dreux . There he learned the proclamation of the republic , which completely prostrated him . He shaved his whiskers , called himself Mr. Smith , and hastened to the sea-coast . Over and over again he was recognized , and might have been seized , had the agents of the republic sought to secure his person . Though profoundly terrified , he could not avoid betraying himself by his language , and constantly muttered , " Like Charles the Tenth ! Like Charles the Tenth ! " At length , after several days of agony he embarked onboardan English steamer , and landed , brokenhearted and penniless , in a foreign land . At Claremont House , which belonged to his son-in-law , the King of the Belgians , he spent // the brief remainder of his life in comparative poverty , under the name of the Count de Nenilly . Repose was the only benefit misfortune had brought him ; all his manhood and his philosophy had departed . The British nobility and the royal family visited him in his retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm resignation and noble fortitude which might have been expected from his checkered fortunes . On becoming a king , Louis Philippe bad ceased to be an uncommon man . He died a very ordinary one . None of his sons have earned celebrity . Nemours and Montpensier are involved in the dis . grace of having allowed the Government to he overset in 1848 without a struggle to maintain their father . The Duchess of Orleans lives in retirement , educating her son . Of Joinville and D'Aumale the world hears nothing . It is said that the family have agreed to waive their claims on the throne in favor of Henri V. , the Bourbon heir ; if any such bargain has been made , it was intended as a blind to the world . If Napoleon falls , and a monarchy succeeds him , the sceptre will belong to him who has nerve and power to grasp it .
