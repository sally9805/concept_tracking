txt ART . VI. - HENRY WARE , JR . Memoir of the Life of Henry Ware , Jr . By his Brother , JOHN WARE , M.D. In two volumes . New edition . Boston : James Munroe &amp; Co . London : Chapman , Brothers . 1846 . FROM a perusal of " Ware 's Hints on Extemporaneous Preaching , " from the title of some others of his published works , and from his general reputation , we had known something of him , as an earnest and effective practical writer , and as a man of serious religious spirit . But it was far from our thoughts to expect to feel any strong interest in a memoir of one whose life was mostly spent in a circle of men whose theoretic views on some of the main points of Christian doctrine differ widely from our own , and , as we are constrained to believe , from the Bible . We esteem it a privilege , however , to render the tribute of our admiration and praise to true Christian excellence , wherever it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gladly , the lively interest with which we have read again and again this simple , dignified and unambitious memoir , the modest offering of brotherly affection , written in perfect keeping with the unpretending goodness and greatness of him whom it commemorates . It is a record of the life of a Christian minister , the perusal of which , we think , can // scarcely fail to quicken and instruct any one who loves , and serves , or intends to serve , in the work of the ministry , the same Master . For ourselves , we are free to confess , that we have risen from the perusal of these volumes , with a feeling of near and sacred friendship for the man , with the thought that it would have been a rich privilege to have been an occasional attendant upon his preaching , and to have been led by him to the throne of grace , and with purified and exalted views of the nature and excellence of the work of the Christian ministry . With these views of this memoir , we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its subject , than was given in the brief notice which appeared in our pages shortly after its publication . It is not our purpose to give a narrative of Mr. Ware 's life . Nor do we design to set forth his literary merits , which were certainly of a rare and superior order , nor to give an analysis of his pure and lovely character , which won for him , while living , a high place in the esteem of Christians of all denominations . Much less do we propose to controvert his denominational views , which , though they distinctly appear , do not occupy a very prominent place in this memoir , as they did not in his preaching . We can not indeed refrain from a smile of wonder at the traditional notion of Calvinism which passes current with the Unitarians , as the veritable creed of the orthodox in New England . And they perhaps have ready an answering smile at our misconceptions of their real practical views of truth , and our personal prejudice . Very well . We only hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England , neighbors as they are in locality , and nearer still to each other in the world of letters , will not fear to become acquainted with , and to understand and appreciate each other . Then , if they still feel bound earnestly to dissent from , and oppose , each other , as they may , the controversy will at least have the dignity of freedom from personal prejudice and of purity and comprehensiveness of doctrinal statement . Ware , however , was not , though he easily might have been , an eminent theologian . A controversy with Unitarianism over these unpretending volumes , which , while they conceal nothing , obtrude nothing , would seem to us out of place , and in very bad taste . Still less would we attempt the ungracious task of laboring to cast suspicion upon Ware 's Christian and ministerial character , because his views of theology do not agree with our own . We do not feel called upon to hew down the tree , and seek , by an analysis of its sap and internal structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem , and however good it may taste , must be bad-that its apples must be apples of Sodom : nor , because other trees which grow in the same inclosure and soil appear to bring forth leaves only , will we conclude that this does not bear genuine fruit , and thus debar ourselves from the enjoyment and profit which it may afford . // We would not be understood to mean that Ware 's religiou*s character and life were the legitimate offspring of Unitarianism or " Liberal Christianity , " distinctively considered . We do not mean or think so . Far from it . His intercourse with Christians and ministers of other denominations was frequent and familiar . He sometimes preached in the pulpits of the orthodox with great acceptance . And we are constrained to believe that he was indebted more than either he or his biographer seems to be aware , to other than distinctively Unitarian influences . But we do not wish to discuss this point . It is sufficient , for the object which we have in view , to judge the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . Our main purpose in calling the attention of our readers to these volumes , is to set forth Ware 's characteristic excellences in the discharge of the duties of that calling which was the formative idea and soul of his whole life , the calling of a Christian minister . We would approach this pleasant task , not with a self-complacent patronizing air , but with an unaffected sense of our own deficiencies by the side of this rare example of ministerial excellence . As his biographer has well remarked , Henry Ware , Jr. , was one of those in whom the man is only the continuation of the boy . Wordsworth 's odd but beautiful phrase , " The child is father of the man , " has exactness of meaning when applied to such men as Ware . There was nothing fragmentary , there were no abrupt changes , no marked contrasts , no dark intervals , between one part of his life and another . One part , take which we will , was like another , and the progress which was made in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a beautiful symmetry and harmony between the parts of his mind and character . All were in keeping , and in just completeness . The same qualities of mind and heart which early showed themselves , passed over , without any specific or abrupt change , into youth and manhood . There was evident growth , ripening , strengthening , as his years glided on ; but there was no characteristic difference , either mental or moral , between " little Henry Ware , " and the Rev , and Prof. Henry Ware . The same seriousness of character , the same good sense , correct judgment and practical turn , balancing an imagination of not inferior power , the same method and facility in writing , which characterized the youth and the man , were seen , though without unhealthful precocity , in the boy of eight years . The same gentleness of heart , the same gentleness of action , and the same vivacity and playfulness of disposition , which characterized the child , survived in their integrity the passage from childhood to manhood . This unity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm . It is at once easy and delightful to look into such a mind and heart . These very peculiarities , however , are to some minds signs of // 253 mediocrity . There is an aspect of tameness which does not suit the eye that requires abrupt contrasts and high colors . Yet , if the union of a broad and sound understanding , with fair poetic powers , a refined taste , a rare talent for practical execution , most amiable and gentle affections , and a pure and upright purpose , is uncommon , then Henry Ware , Jr. , possessed no common mind and character . It is implied in what has been said , that religion very early assumed its proper sway in his heart . From the very first , he was the subject of clear and decided religious impressions . The parents under whose watchful training and counsels , his early character was formed , were unusually solicitous for the early cultivation of religious feelings , and the establishment of religions habits in their children , and were watchful for opportunities to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who died in his boyhood , he retained an affectionate remembrance . In a poem composed by him the year of her death , when he was only eleven years old , he thus speaks of her , " 0 may I live like her , and like her die ; Living , to God 's commands my soul apply ; Blameless and virtuous be in all men 's sight , And try to prove myself to God aright ; Jlhjzng , to his just will my soul resign , And count the triumphs of the righteous mine . Mother , the last commands from thee received , ( When almost at the goal of life arrived , ) And all which when alive thou didst impart , Be ever written on my faithful heart . Those precepts ever be my guide , my friend , My comforter , till life 's drear journey end . If ever from my heart those words be lost , As sand upon the foaming ocean tossed ; If e'er from virtue 's path , the perfect way , In which thou taught'st me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade my ways reprove , With all the kindness of thy former love . " - Vol . I , p. 23 . In a poem of later date , " The Dream of Life , " there are some exquisite touches by the hand of filial affection ; " There stood my bed ; There I lay waiting for a mother 's kiss , And soft good-night ; then breathless sought to catch Her last faint footstep as she slow retired ; Then drew the blanket on my face and slept . Time in its lengthened flight has wrought such change , That hardly could I recognize those walls ; But that sweet evening kiss , I feel it now , I hear that soft good-night , that parting step Still faintly fall upon my waiting ear . * * * * * What darkness followed then ! * * * * // 254 Henry Ware , Jr . The sacred light of home was dimmed : The tender smile the voice of patient love , The anxious counsel , the directing eye , Cheered the sad pathway of my youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world Had other lights , but none to fill that void ; And friends , but none that wore a mother 's heart . "  - -  Vol . I , p. 24 . In a fictitious prose work , entitled Jotham Anderson , he is supposed also to refer to his mother : " My earliest recollection of her is in the act of teaching me to pray , when she every evening took me on her knees , and , clasping my little hands , made me repeat after her my childish petitions . Methinks I still see the beautiful expression of her maternal eye , and feel the kiss , full of affection and piety , with which she closed the service . At such times she would explain to me the purposes of prayer , and teach me to love the good Being , who gave me father and mother , and made me happy . It was her practice , also , to seize the moments when my young heart was overflowing with cheerfulness and good-will , to remind me of the Father above , and direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 25 . It was , however , to his surviving parent that he was most consciously indebted . " No human being , " says his brother , " could owe more to another than Henry owed to his father . " The utmost confidence was established between them ; and with an earnest care , counsel and sympathy did the father regard and seek his son 's improvement . Passing his boyhood and youth under such parental influences , he gave increasing evidence , as he grew in years , of being ruled by the fear and the love of God . It bears more directly on our purpose , while it also illustrates the strength of his religious feelings , and in good part explains the unity of his character and life , that he had far back in his early remembrances , and thenceforward , the idea of becoming a minister of the Gospel . Nor was it a mere childish fancy , such as would naturally seize the mind of a clergyman 's son . It was a ruling purpose , which more than any thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his own improvement . " I doubt , indeed , " says his brother , ( Vol. 1 , p. 10 , ) " whether the idea of a different one ever presented itself seriously or for any length of time , from the days when he preached a juvenile sermon of his own composition from a cradle turned on end as a pulpit , to that in which he actually assumed the office of a minister of the Gospel , and made his appearance in the sacred desk . " This purpose , while it did not induce an unseemly gravity , kept him through his college life in a remarkable purity and gentleness of life arid manners . For a few months of the latter part of his college course , he taught a common school at Beverly . During his residence there a revival of religion occurred . He was brought into close contact with the orthodox , and learned their views . His own religious feelings seem to have been much quickened . After leaving // college , he taught a year or two in Exeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought more than ever before into the society of literary men , and on a footing of equality . it was here especially that he matured in his own mind his views of the nature and duties of the Christian ministry , and deliberately devoted himself to its sacred work . The nearer he drew to the fulfillment of this long cherished purpose , the more did he dwell upon the sacredness of the duties of the ministerial office ; and with a quickened zeal , a more assidous self-culture , and a more entire devotedness , did he surrender himself to preparation for his high calling . Returning from Exeter to Cambridge , he gave himself wholly to studies bearing directly upon the ministerial work . The theological instruction given at Cambridge at that time amounted to little , and must have been of small moment in forming his mind and heart . The sources of his excellence were indeed far higher than any routine of theological study . While yet employed in teaching at Exeter , he had been called upon to fill the pulpit for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermons of his own selection , and conducting the devotional exercises . All were delighted ; and a distinguished civilian , on leaving church the last Sabbath during which Ware thus officiated , remarked to Dr. Abbott , " I have attended church in Boston . New York and Philadelphia , and I do not recollect ever to have been better satisfied with the exercises of four Sabbaths , than with those of this young man of yours . He will be eminent in his profession . " Yet it is illustrative of the unambitious nature of the man , that his first efforts at preaching , which were not made until a considerable time after his receiving his " approbation , " made no strong impression . The same thing was strikingly shown by the fact , that there was a long interval between his first and second engagement to preach to the Second Church in Boston , over which he was afterwards ordained Pastor , Jan. 1st , 1817 . Here was formed the sacred tie which bound him long and late , which was never in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after , through ill health , he had ceased to be able to perform pastoral duties , nor then until he had been installed in a new yet kindred office , that of Professor of Pastoral Theology at Cambridge . Even there he was only gathering up the rich fruits of his T ) astoral experience . He was characteristically a pastor . Having entered thus upon a work to which his life was devoted , he was in a position congenial to his tastes , the pastor of a flock , not the most highly cultivated , nor yet ignorant , not the richest , nor yet the poorest , but composed of the middle class to whom he unambitiously thought his talent best adapted . Here we behold him , loving and beloved , and wielding a power unexpected from one so unassuming . Here we are to study him and learn the secret of his genuine strength and influence . // But let us first set before us the picture drawn by his successor , Rev. Chandler Robbins . " The throng of worshipers swelled from Sabbath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful and deep . Its invitations to holiness became more persuasive ; its calls to duty more stirring ; its appeals to the conscience more pungent ; its discourses to the understanding more convincing ; its addresses to the affections more constraining . ' There were more splendid edifices than these old walls . There were more wealthy and fashionable and highly cultivated congregations , than that which gathered around him with attentive faces and captivated hearts . There were more graceful rhetoricians and more learned theologians occupying the sacred desk . But where was there a temple more fragrant with the breath of devotion , more beautiful with the spiritual adornings of holiness and peace ? Where was there a Society more harmonious or more engaged ? And where was the preacher , whose whole air , and action , and tones , were more suited to the messages of Heaven , whose discourses and whose prayers had more power of moral and spiritual effect ? ' " - Vol. 1 , pp. 103 , 104 . Nor will it be out of place to add the humbler testimony of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preaching . She said that " she always loved to hear him preach . She did not know what it was . There was nothing remarkable in his appearance or looks . He was no great of an orator , yet every body was glad to see him come into the pulpit . There seemed to be something in him different from other men . " What was it ? Whence this power which did not lie in dazzling eloquence , nor flaming zeal , nor profound theology , nor graceful rhetoric , yet was unquestionably great and beneficent ? this is now to be our study . It can hardly fail to strike the reader of this memoir , that a love for the pastoral work was no small element of his efficiency . It was a long cherished love . It had grown with his growth , and strengthened with his strength . It was not the zeal of a novice , who , because the love of God has been shed abroad in his heart , finds himself impelled forthwith to take upon him the office of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirant after fame in the religious community , who would thus reconcile his religion with his ambition . He entered upon the duties of his profession , not because he regarded that profession as the most eligible , nor because he was driven to sacrifice his inclination to a sense of duty ; but because he truly and heartily loved the work of a minister . Singularly free as he was from the mere arnor habendi , it can with difficulty be conceived that he was led to assume the ministerial office by regard for its emoluments . Though he was by no means indifferent to the voice of human praise , yet , as appears in this memoir , he very early learned to detect and watch against this infirmity . Had a pleasant , congenial , literary occupation with its meed of honor been his object , it would have been found , without assuming the arduous duties and responsibilities of a pastor , by one who was nurtured in the bosom of Harvard , and was well fitted to pursue with high success the walks of ele // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ware that native eloquence and that freedom in promiscuous intercourse , which might incline a religions man to become a preacher of the Gospel . Just the opposite to this was true of him . To say that he loved the emoluments , the praise , the esteem , the literary occupation , the scope for eloquence and general influence which the office afforded , and that for these reasons he assumed it , is to say what no candid reader of his life can believe . He loved the work for its own sake . That love was exercised in full view of the cares of the office ; and it continued , meek and uncomplaining , cheerful and strong , under the wearing , exhausting pressure of its labors . To become a minister of Christ had been the dream of his childhood , the deliberate and constant purpose of his youth . This desire had grown so habitual as to take its place , as a matter of course , side by side with his natural affections . The work of the Christian ministry required meditation on religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave an opportunity for a kind of attachment to his fellow-men , captivating to a good man of gentle and amiable affections and strong sympathies ; it connected him directly with God and Christ , and offered a field for the highest usefulness to man ; therefore it was that Ware strongly and purely loved it . Seldom indeed , we think , has that love been found so strong and pure , so wholly untinged by a romantic fancy , so little debased by the mixture of unworthy aims and desires . This love for his work made it to him a source of the highest happiness . " First of all , " he writes soon after his ordination , " let me tell you how happy I am , too happy I am afraid . " This love for his work led him to crave more and more of it , to devise and execute continually and with eagerness , plans for the religious welfare of his people in forming and conducting Sabbath schools for the children , Bible classes for the youth , and special meetings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This love for his work , led him , against the dictates of friends , to fix his residence in a part of the city otherwise undesirable . " His was a North end parish , and he must be a North end man . " This love rendered his people , of all ranks and ages , the object of a devoted affection and sympathy , such as is seldom felt . Whether at home , or journeying in pursuit of health , in his native land , on the ocean , or the distant continent , his people evidently lay as near to his heart as any , if not nearer than any , other earthly object . Even when it became proper that the tie should be nominally broken , he could hardly think or speak of his people , except as those who were bound to him forever . It was enough to know that any one was his successor in the pastoral office , to awaken the strongest interest in his prosperity and usefulness . Such a love , while it is the spring of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // throng of delighted and serious worshipers , who on the Sabbath and at other tunes were eager to place themselves under his iiistruction and influence . Along with this trait there was in Ware a remarkable earnestness and singleness of purpose . Earnestness was characteristic of him , whether as a boy , a youth , or a man . While he spoke and thought as a boy , he yet thought and spoke , with a sobriety unusual though not unbecoming to boyhood . The same seriousness of character gave maturity and manliness of thinking to his youth , and spread itself over all the laborious years of his manhood . He lived in earnest . Death and immortality were to him familiar and animating subjects of thought . He kept the highest ends of life in view . He devoted himself to the will of his Master , to the work of self-culture , and to the highest good of men . Abhorring every thing like cant , and maintaining a constant truthfulness of character , he did yet with heroic self-sacrifice , and with a spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This he did riot as a matter of constrained and gloomy self-mortification , but because he saw a worthy object to be accomplished . Since there was good of the highest kind to be done , he aimed heartily to do it . The man was lost in the object . Even on the verge of the grave , with the frill knowledge that flesh and heart were failing , that life was fast ebbing to its close , he is still found planning and executing with the eagerness and alacrity of vigorous health . He was also peculiarly single-minded . However multifarious his studies arid plans might seem , the unity of his purpose was remarkable and easily discernible . Whether engaged as pastor , or professor , there was a single , earnest purpose of the highest usefulness , running through and animating all his labors , arid giving unity to his employment ; a purpose which found its most perfect realization in. that which was the great business of his life , the work of a pastor . With little of high enthusiasm in his constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single and conscientious purpose , he gave h imself in his early years to preparation for his high calling , in the way of forming plans of sermons , constructing sermons , observing and criticising the styles of different preachers , fixing in his own mind his idea of what a sermon should be both in matter and in style , habituating himself to extemporaneous speaking , getting information , studying the Bible critically , and above all in jealously examining hiS own motives , cultivating the religious affections , and striving after that purity of purpose and superior excellence of character which seemed to him quite indispensable in a Christian minister . It is interesting in this view to see how calmly and cheerfully , in obedience to his ruling purpose , he set aside or indefinitely postponed his early predilections for poetic composition , which if // cherished and followed , as he would have cherished and followed them if he had made poetry his.chief pursuit , would have gained him no mean place among the poets of America . He preferred usefulness to fame . During the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties , he wrote much in a miscellaneous way for the periodical press . His wife one day said to him while thus occupied , that " she wished instead of frittering away his time and thoughts in this way upon ephemeral productions , he would concentrate the same amount upon some single work , which would be of substantial value . " His pleasant answer was , " Now that is your ambition for me ; for my part , I am glad to do the little good I can in any way that presents itself ; no matter if all is forgotten to-morrow , provided a seed is sown to day ; it will germinate some time or other . " Just so single-minded was he through his whole ministerial life . He seems scarcely to have thought of any thing else than his duties as a minister . By such singleness of purpose was he prompted in the various plans which he was ever devising for the religious benefit of his people , in his familiar intercourse with them as well as in his public official duties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy , he was always practically in earnest . We can easily imagine the unobserved yet mighty influence which would flow forth unbidden in his public ministrations from one thus earnest and single-minded . There was no ambitious nor even conscientious striving to be in earnest ; but there was earnestness itself , the earnestness of a man who spoke practically to his fellow-men , on things of the greatest practical weight ; an earnestness which was felt to be inseparable from the man , the earnestness of one who felt and thought what he spoke , and who spoke simply for the benefit of his fellow-men what he felt and thought . An earnestness which was felt to be real , the more deeply because unaccompanied with any flights of imagination , or fits of emotion , or ostentation of style , or attempts at philosophical novelties , could not fail to produce its own deep and wholesome effects upon the mind of the hearer . We may not , however , separate from these qualities in Ware , his correct idea of the object of the ministry . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also justness of purpose . Unhappily these things are not always together in the Christian minister . There is many an earnest and single-minded man who fails of knowing the precise object of preaching the word ; many a man , who , though he has the right end in view , coiiceives of that end too vaguely and unsteadily for the full and wholesome effect of it upon his ministrations . On this point Ware was like himself , sound-minded and l ) ractical . He had little sympathy with those who , for the Gospel , would utter soft sentimentalism and rapt discourses upon immortality , and who // love to conduct their hearers into the moonshine of vague speculations , rather than into the sunLight of revealed truth . Said he , " I like some roughness , I should learn to sleep if my minister were never venturesome , never hazarded a bold idea or expression . " And again , in a letter to his brother , the author of " Probus , " he thus sets forth his views upon a graver matter , incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian delineation , I think , from what occurred in former times , that your tendency may be to regard it too exclusively as a Revelation of Immortality , and too little as a Remedy for Sin . The former is the vein for speculative philosophers and for poets ; the latter for real life and substantial influence , and that to which its whole power is due . The doctrine of Immortality , without its stern application to the conscience , and the other doctrine of the world 's actual depravity , would have been worth little ; and the New Testament , and all the history of the Christian progress , show the great fact of regeneration to be the chief thing of pith and moment . " * * * " There is no satisfactory view of our religion and its efficacy from any other point . " - Vol . II , p. 178 . The deliverance of men from sin , the production of the Christian character and life in them-this in his view was the sole end of the ministry . That he did set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly , steadfastly and singly than is common , we fully believe . And what becomes of the utility and the efficacy of the minister , if he have not this end before him . To amuse and entertain his audience with polished , literary essays , to purify the taste , to inform the mind on points of science , are not the legitimate objects of the Christian minister . Useful in themselves , and proper in their place , as they are , they are not the distinctive objects of his ministry . He may accomplish these objects , and purpose to accomplish them , incidentally ; but lie degrades his office and destroys its whole significance , if he for a moment lets them become any part of his engrossing end . Nor should he think it his end to set forth in their theoretic form and logical proofs the doctrines of God 's word , accompanied with appropriate practical inferences . Nor is it his proper aim to popularize these doctrines by any illustrations which may seem plausible and taking ; nor to clothe them with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great admiration of the unthinking . His proper object is not even to explain and enforce the word of God . This is only the means to his end . His end is not to contend earnestly for the truth , but to affect the heart and life . He deals not with an abstract , but a concrete subject , the minds and hearts of his people . The rough material is placed before him , the defaced soul to be fashioned anew after the pure and perfect image of his Redeemer . So thought Ware , and therefore the business of a minister was to him a grave and earnest business , beyond the maintenance of any assumed professional gravity , beyond any philosophic or theologic interest in // the truth . He cared for nothing which did not stir the soul to some good practical end . The simplicity and sincerity with which he yielded himself to this end , and intensely stretched his powers for it , was what characterized him as preacher and pastor , gave profound effect to his ministrations , and finally wore him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor 's chair , in the height of his reputation , and amid high-raised expectations , the critical eyes of Cambridge students could discover nothing but the simple , unambitious , earnest desire of the highest usefulness in preparing them for the same work ; a conviction which could hardly fail to produce upon their minds , as it had done upon the popular mind , a profound impression in favor of the man , and of the justness and moment of his object . With regard to the means by which Mr. Ware tried to meet an object so high and arduous , he was correct , almost to singularity , in his high estimate of the importance of superior religious excellence in the minister . This opinion was uniformly acted upon , and frequently expressed by him , at all periods of his life , and was constantly enjoined upon students in theology under his instruction . It is expressed very fully in a letter to his own son , then about to make choice of his frther 's profession . " To make a good and happy minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he must be a religious man first ; he must be a minister because impelled to be so by his religion , and not be religious because impelled to be so by his profession . I could be happy , therefore , in encouraging you to this great step , just in proportion as I had cause to believe , that an interest in religious things had become the chief and moving concern in your mind . " No minister , we suppose , was ever more free from professional airs and assumptions , than Ware . None we believe was ever more successful than he in performing his ministerial duties , simply as a religious man speaking to his fellow-men , and telling them of that which he himself had experienced , and summoning them to embrace the same faith , to taste the same joys , gain the same victories and pursue the same objects . In his judgment , all of the professional which there should be in a Christian minister , consists in his being a leader and example in those Christian qualities and enterprises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary it was to the successful discharge of his duties , that he should possess in a superior degree those qualities of character which he inculcated upon others , just as it is needful that the successful general should possess superior courage , skill , energy and endurance . Ware frequently and earnestly deprecated a tendency , which he thought he detected , in the public estimate of ministers , to exalt intellectual above moral qualifications for the office . In his own theory and practice he reversed the order . In his view , the // genuine power of the pulpit lay not in the superiority of the spoken to the written word , nor in the tones and manner , an 'd impressiveness of style , and weight of thought , but in the man who spoke . If he uttered his own experience truthfully , and without exaggeration , there was genuine power . Then there was truth , not merely transmitted through a mouth-piece , but received , digested and acted forth as the product of the living man . Of course the more impressively this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wanting , or fell short of the preacher 's representation , then all the arts and tricks of oratory were a poor substitute , unworthy of the high office . And in our own judgment , no preacher has truer dignity , deeper or more wholesome efficiency than he , who , in his representations of faith , declares just what he himself believes and no more , and in the shape in which the truth presents itself to his own mind ; who sets forth that style of Christian character , which he himself exemplifies and seeks to perfect , and no other ; who urges those motives which he finds it practicable to be governed by ; whose preaching , and whose prayers are in deed and in truth , the just , faithful and living expression of the practical views and notions of the man , and not of some abstract traditional and mooted style of piety and religious duty , which it may be every body is praising , but in which no body sincerely believes . The work of such a man will abide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Christian preacher who dares not be thus true to himself and to his own religious experience , through fear of some phantom of orthodoxy , or some idol of the religious public , acts unworthily of the plain dignity of a religious teacher , and forsakes the only source of the truest power . the Christian preacher who dares thus utter himself or rather the working of God 's grace in himself , will find a fountain of thouEdlt and feeling fresh and perennial , the flowings forth of which can not fail to cheer , refresh and render fruitful in good words and works , the hearts of his hearers . At the same time , who does not see and feel , as Ware deeply and solemnly felt , the obligation imposed , in this view , upon the minister who would be at once true to himself and efficient in his ministrations , to engage with diligence in the work of selfculture , that he may first be and do all that he would lead his people to be and to do . Having this idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency , Ware regarded the private intercourse of the minister with his people as not less important than his work in the pulpit . Not that he was much inclined to religious conversation , or had a high opinion of its utility . But he would bring before his people familiarly in its every-day expression , the power of a Christian character . He sought to make // that power as pervasive as possible in its efficiency . He would thus lead his people to receive the words of the preacher with the same unhesitating confidence , with which . in private intercourse , they had learned to trust in the man , and to yield to his influence . It scarcely need be added , in speaking of one so just-minded as Ware , that he went for his faith to the great and common source of all true piety , the Bible . In distinction from all theological dogmas , instead of the uncertainties of human speculati on , he rested , and loved to rest his faith upon the simple verities of revelation , especially on Him who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He early saw and shunned those tendencies in his own denomination to exalt human reason above revelation , which have since issued in such pernicious vagaries . Did our limits permit , we should love to lay before our readers a letter of his , to one who was lost in the blinding mazes of human speculation , which shows the child-like simplicity of his own faith in Christ . His faith and integrity were equally evinced , in his promptly calling to account his cherished friend and successor , Emerson , for some of his lawless , and as he viewed them , unhallowed and anti-scriptural speculations . The word of God , not as a dead letter but in proportion as he had made it to live and abide in his own heart and character , he sought to urge upon the faith and the practice of others . So far as he himself was a living epistle of the truths of the Bible , so far did he proclaim them with felt and living energy . Regarding them simply in their practical aspects , he presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt their power , on the hearts and consciences of his people , and according to their wants . In the practical realization of them consisted his progress as a preacher of the word . Herein lies the true profiting of every minister . In proportion as he can make the word of God live and abide in himself , is he fitted to minister to his people , and to profit them by his ministrations . It is not the idolized book , but the principles of the word living and abiding in the soul , which is the true source of life and power in the preacher and to the hearer . So thought Ware . And accordingly while none was more steadfast than he in his implicit belief in God 's word , none was more true to himself . While also none was more strenuous for the substance , none was more free and untrammeled in the mode of presenting and applying divine truth . In doing this he found a place for the highest literary culture . Studiously regarding even the prejudices of his people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothing that might shock their cherished associations , he yet made himself , by assiduous culture , master of a style , which for beauty , purity , simplicity , taste , freedom from theological technicalities , and suitableness to the common mind , challenges // the highest admiration , and seemed to give to the other elements of his power , and influence , an unbroken transmission into the hearts and minds of those whom he addressed . Says his friend and classmate , Mr. Loring , with whose words we may fitly conclude this notice " As I have listened with intense interest to his discourses from the pulpit , and none ever went deeper to my heart , I have often wondered how he could produce such astonishing results upon the minds of his audience , with the apparently simple materials he had collected . His exordium and the early portions of his address would seem almost trite and common-place , but for the beautiful transparency of the style , and the apostolic simplicity of his manner : ere long , however , these seemingly quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost unperceived combination , collected like scattered rays into a focus , shedding the brightest light upon some topic of moral duty , or exhibiting in a broad glare the hideous deformity of some common sin , or kindling the flame of earnest devotion , throughout the whole assembly . And I delight to trace the beautiful analogy of his life and writings ; his widely extended fame and beneficial influence on society ,  --  a light shining far and wide ,  --  the beaming combination of all those quiet and unpretending yet most earnest Christian graces and virtues , which marked him from the cradle to the grave .
