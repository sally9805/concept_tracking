NAPOLEON BONAPARTE . BY JOhN S. C. ABBOTT NAPOLEON IN COUNCIL . THE amount of intellectual labor which Napoleon performed seems actually superhuman . No other man has ever approached him in this respect . His correspondence , preserved in the archives of Paris , would amount to many hundred volumes . His genius illumines every subject upon which he treats . Thc whole expanse of human knowledge seemed familiar to him . He treats of war , government , legislation , education , finance , political economy , theology , philosophy , engineering - upon every subject which can interest the human mind , and he is alike great in all . Notwithstanding the constant and terrible wars through which his banded foes compelled him to struggle , and all the cares of an empire , which at times seemed to embrace the whole of Europe , during the twenty years of his reign he wrote or dictated more than the united works of Lope da Vega , Voltaire , and Sir Walter Scott , three of the most voluminous writers of Spain , France , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two years from 1796 , to 1798 , which was published in Paris in 1819 , amounts to seven large closely-printed volumes . The following letter will he read with interest , as a specimen of his correspondence with his ministers . It strikingly shows his lofty spirit , ST. cLoun. // his noble ambition , his expanded views , his practical wisdom , and the blended familiarity and elevation of tone with which he addressed his ministers . " Fontainebleau , Nov. 14 , 1807 . " Monsieur Cretet , Minister of the Interior , - You have received the Imperial decree by which I have authorized the sinking-fund to lend 1,600,000 dollars to the city of Paris . I suppose that you are employed in taking measures which may bring these works to a speedy conclusion , and may augment the revenues of the city . In these works there are some which will not be very productive , but are merely for ornament . There are others , such as galleries over the markets , the slaughter-houses , &amp;c. , which will be very productive . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which I have granted you funds , are not yet commenced . I suppose you have taken up the funds destined for the fountains , and that you have employed them provisionally for the machine at Marly . Carry on the whole with spirit . This system of advancing money to the city of Paris , to augment its branches of revenue , is also intended to contribute to its embellishment . My intention is to extend it to other departments . " I have many canals to make ; that from Dijon to Paris ; that from the Rhine to the Sa6ne ; and that from the Rhine to the Scheldt . These three canals can be carried on as vigorously as could be wished . My intention is , independently of the funds which are granted from the revenues of the state , to seek extraordinary funds for the three canals . For this purpose I should like to sell the canals of St. Quentin , the produce of which might be employed to expedite the works of the canal of Burgundy . In fact , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds to the construction of the canal from the Rhine to the Sa6ne . I suppose that the canal of St. Quentin might be sold for 1,600,000 dollars ; that of Loing for as much ; and the canal of Languedoc for more . There would then be 6,000,000 dollars procured immediately , which I should employ in carrying on the three great canals with all possible rapidity . I have the money . The state will lose nothing ; on the contrary , it will gain ; since if it loses the revenues of the canals of Loing , St. Quentin , and that of the South , it will gain the product of the canals of the Scheldt , Napoleon , and Burgundy . When these works are completed , if circumstances permit , I shall sell these , in order to make others . Thus , my object is to pursue a directly opposite course to that of England . In England , a charter would have been granted for constructing the canal of Quentin , and the work would have been left to capitalists . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Quentin . It has cost , I believe , 1,600,000 dollars ; it will produce 100,000 dollars annually . I shall then lose nothing by selling it to a company for what it has cost me ; since , with this money , I shall construct other canals . Make me , I beg of you , a report upon this subject , otherwise we shall die without seeing these canals navigated . In fact , it is six years since the canal of St. Quentin was begun , and it is not yet finished . Now , these canals are of much more importance . The expense of that of Burgundy is estimated at six millions . What can be expended from the general funds of the state does not exceed two hundred and fifty thousand yearly . The departments do not furnish more than 100,000 dollars . It would , then , require twenty years to finish this canal . What may not happen in this time Wars and inefficient men will come , and the canals will remain unfinished . The canal from the Rhine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general funds of the state are not sufficient to carry them on as quickly as we could wish . The canal of Napoleon is in the same situation . Let me know how much it will be possible to expend yearly on each of these three canals . I suppose that , without injuring other works , we might allow to each , yearly , three or four millions ; and that thus in five or six years we might see them all navigated . You will inform me how much the existing imposts will furnish for these three canals ; how much I have granted for 1808 ; and the supplementary funds which I granted in 1806 , for carrying on these works with the greatest activity . You will propose to me to sell the three canals already finished , and at what price it would be best to sell them . I take upon myself the charge of finding purchasers : then we shall have money in abundance . You must tell me , in your report , how much the three , which I wish speedily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sums which the three old canals have cost that I wish to sell . " You understand what I wish . My intention is , to go beyond your report Perhaps it will lead to opening a fund for public works , into which the proceeds of the navigation of the canals would be immediately thrown . We might thus grant to this the proceeds of the sale of the three canals , and of others besides , if there are any which can be sold . With this institution , we should change the face of the country . " I have made the glory of my reign to consist in changing the surface of the territory of my Empire . The execution of these great works is as necessary to the interest of my people as to my own satisfaction . I attach equal importance and great glory to the suppression of mendicity . Funds are not wanting . But it seems to me that the work proceeds slowly , and meantime , years are passing away . We must not pass through this world without leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to be absent for a month . Be ready on the 15th December , to answer all these questions , which you will have examined in detail , that I may be able , by a general decree , to put the finishing blow to mendicity . You must find , before the 15th December , in the reserved funds , and the funds of the communes , the necessary // means for the support of sixty or one hundred houses for the extirpation of beggary . The places where they shall he erected must be designated , and the regulations completed . Do not ask me for three or four months to obtain further instructions . You have young auditors , intelligent prefects , skillful engineers . Bring all into action , and do not sleep in the ordinary labors of the bureau . It is necessary , likewise , that , at the same time , all that relates to the administration of the public works , should be completed ; so that , at the commencement of the fine season , France may present the spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the population may be in action to embellish and render productive our immense territory . " You must also prepare for me all that is necessary respecting the measures to be taken for obtaining , from the draining of the marshes of Cottentin and Rochefort , money for supporting the fund for public works , and for finishing the drainings , or preparing others . cation to business . Napoleon said of him that " he labored like an ox , while he displayed the courage of a lion . " On one occasion only were his energies ever known to fail . The Emperor called him at midnight to write from his dictation . M. Daru was so completely overcome by fatigue , that he could scarcely hold his pen . At last nature triumphed , and he fell asleep over his paper . After enjoying a sound nap , he awoke , and to his amazement perceived the Emperor , by his side , quietly engaged in writing He saw , by the shortness of the candles , that he had slept for some time . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met those of the Emperor . " Well , sir ; " said Napoleon with rather an ironical smile , " you see that I have been doine " The winter evenings are long ; fill your portfolios , that we may be able , during the evenings of these three months , to discuss the means for attaining great results. * NAPOLEON . " At a meeting of the Privy Council Napoleon appeared much incensed against one of his generals . He attacked him with great severity asserting that his principles and opinions tended to the entire subversion of the state . A member of the Council , who was a particular friend of the absent general , undertook his defense , stating that he lived quietly on his estate , without obtruding his opinions upon others , and that consequently they were productive of no ill effects . The Emperor vehemently commenced a reply , when suddenly he stopped short , and turning to the defender of the absent said , " But he is your friend , sir . You do right to defend him . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " M. Daru was at one time Secretary of State . He was distinguished for his indefatigable appliyour work , since you would not do it yourself . I suppose that you have eaten a hearty supper , and passed a pleasant evening . But business must not be neglected . " " I pass a pleasant evening , Sire ! " exclaimed M. Daru , " I have been for several nights closely engaged in work , without any sleep . Of this your Majesty now sees the consequence . I am exceedingly sorry for it . " " Why did you not inform me of this ? " said Napoleon , " I do not wish to kill you . Go to bed . Good-night M. IDaru. " * It was the reading of this letter , many years ago , which first led the author of these articles to imagine that justice had not been done to the character of Napoleon It is needless to add that the thorough investigation of subsequent years has not weakened that senti-ment , NAPOLEON AND 1115 sECRETARY . // Napoleon , conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever kept a watchful eye upon the meetings of the Institute . It was an invariable rule of this body , that a newly elected memberwas to deliver a speech eulogistic of the member whom he was succeeding . M. Chateaubriand , a friend of the Bourbons , was succeeding M. Chenier , one of the judges of Louis XVI . Chateaubriand , trampling upon established courtesy , stigmatized the political principles of his predecessor , and proscribed him as a regicide . A scene of uproar immediately ensued , and a stormy and angry debate agitated the assembly . From the Institute the dispute spread rapidly through Paris . Old feuds were revived and the most bitter animosities rekindled . Napoleon ordered the speech to be shown to him , pronounced it extravagant in the extreme , and forbade its publication . One of the members of the Institute , who was also a prominent officer in the Emperor 's household , had taken a lively part in the discussion , sustaining the views of M. Chateaubriand . At the next levde , when a group of the most distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offending officer made his appearance . Napoleon thus addressed him : " How long is it , sir , " said he , with the utmost severity , " since the Institute has presumed to assume the character of a political assembly The province of the Institute is to produce poetry an ( l to censure faults of language . Let it beware how it forsakes the domain of literature , or I shall take measures to bring it back within its limits And is it possible that you , sir , have sanctioned such an intemperate harangue by your approbation If M. de Chateaubriand is insane , or disposed to malevolence , a mad-house may cure him , or a punishment correct him . Yet it may be that the opinions he has advanced are conscientiously his own , and he is not obliged to surrender them to my policy , which is unknown to him . But with you the case is totally dif*'erent . You are constantly near my person . You are acquainted with all my acts . You know my Will . There may be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be none in yours . Sir , I hold you guilty . I consider your conduct as criminal . It tends to bring us back to the days of disorder and confusion , anarchy and bloodshed . Are we then banditti And am I but an usurper ? Sir , I did not ascend the throne by hurling another from it . I found the crown . It had fallen . I snatched it up , and the nation placed it on my head . Respect the nation 's act . To submit facts that have recently occurred to public discussion in the present circumstances , is to court fresh convulsions , and to become an enemy to the public tranquillity . The restoration of monarchy is vailed in mystery , and must remain so . Wherefore then , I pray , this new proposed proscription of members of the Convention and of regicides Why are subjects of so delicate a nature again brought to light ? To God alone it must belong to pronounce upon what is no longer within the reach of the judgment of men ! Have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my efforts been of so little avail , that as soon as my presence no longer restrains you , you are quite ready once more to bathe in each other 's blood " Alas ! poor France ! " he exclaimed , after a moment 's pause , " long yet wilt thou need the guardian 's care . I have done all in my power to quell your dissensions . To unite all parties has been the constant object of my solicitude . I have made all meet under the same roof , sit at the same board , and drink of the same cup . I have a right to expect that you will second my endeavors . Since I have taken the reins of government , have I ever inquired into the lives , actions , opinions , or writings of any one ? Imitate my forbearance . I have ever had but one aim . I have ever asked but this one question , Will you sincerely assist me in promoting the true interest of France ? ' All those who have answered affirmatively , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rock , and without issue on either side . Through this I have urged them on to the other extremity , where my finger pointed to the honor , the glory , and the splendor of France . " This reprimand was so severe , that the person to whom it was addressed , a man of honor and delicate feelings , determined to ask an audience the next day , in order to tender his resignation . I-Ia was admitted to the presence of the Emperor , who immediately said to him " My dear sir , you are come on account of the conversation of yesterday . You felt hurt on the occasion , and I have felt no less so . But it was a piece of advice which I thought it right to give to more than one person . If it has the desired effect of producing some public good , we must not either of us regret the circumstance . Think no more about it . " Napoleon introduced this year into the financial department , the most rigid system of accounts by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the present day . It has rendered the French system of accounts the most sure , the most accurate , and the most clear of any in Europe . In one of the meetings of the Council , Napoleon proposed that long galleries , or rather streets , covered with glass , for pedestrians only , should be constructed , to shelter buyers and sellers from the vicissitudes of the weather . This was th origin of those brilliant Passages , where every visitor to Paris loiters away so many pleasant hours . Forty slaughter houses had deformed Paris , filling the air with pestilent odors and paining the eye with the revolting necessities of the shambles . At the suggestion of Napoleon they were all removed . Four large and peculiarly appropriate houses were constructed for these purposes outside of the city , and near the four principal entrances to the metropolis . The generals and the soldiers who had endured such wasting fatigue , and who had achieved such Herculean enterprises for France , were most // magnificently rewarded . Besides their regular pay , nearly four millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gratitude . A handsome annuity was settled upon every wounded soldier . Napoleon seemed never weary in lavishing favors upon those , who , in fields of blood , bad defended and established the independence of France . He was magnificent in his provision for others . He was simple , frugal , economical in the highest degree , in every thing which related to himself . With an eagle eye he guarded against the slightcst misapplication of the public funds . The adopted mother of Josephine having died at Martinique , he directed that the negroes and ne* , resses who had served her , should be made free and placed in a condition of comfort for the rest of their lives . He ordered the number of Christian chapels to he increased to 30,000 , that the benefits of divine service might be extended to every village in the empire . He endowed several theological seminaries to encourage suitable persons to enter the priesthood . The nation insisted that the civic code , which had become the crowning glory of France , should be called the Code Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever title was merited , it was this . For that code was as much the work of Napoleon as were the victories of Austerlitz and of Jena . He had soldiers who lent him their arms . He had lawyers who lent him their knowledge . But to the force of his will , to the soundness of his judgment , was owing the completion of that great work . " It will remain , through all time , a memorial which never can be sullied , of Napoleon 's genius and philanthropy . The Emperor wrote to all the princes under his influence urging them to introduce into their respective states this code of justice and of civil equality . It was thus established in large portions of Europe , conveying , wherever it went , perfect equality of rights , and putting an end to feudal tyranny . In his intense desire to promote the grandeur of France , Napoleon appreciated , perhaps more highly than any . other sovereign , the glory of intellectual achievements . Science , literature , arts , he encouraged in every possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known , who united with his army , a literary and scientific corps to extend the bounds of human knowledge . Under his fostering care Lagrange gave a new power to abstract calculation . La Place , striding beyond the limits attained by Galileo . Kepler , and Newton , rendered his name as immortal as those celestial bodies whose movements he had calculated with such sublime precision . Cuvier exploring the mausoleums of past creations , revealed the wondrous history of our planet , when " the earth was without form and void , and darkness was upon the face of the deep . " The world is destined to be as much astonished by the writings of Napoleon as it has been by his deeds . Neither Bourbon nor Orleanist has been willing to do justice to his fame . His letters , his proclamations , his bulletins , his instructions to his ministers , glow with the noblest eloquence of genius . They will soon be given to the world . And they will disperse much of that mist of calumny and detraction which have so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this extraordinary man without admiring the majesty of his all comprehensive mind . The clearness , the precision. , the fervor , the imperious demonstration , and the noble simplicity which are impressed upon all of his utterances , give him a place in the foremost ranks of THE PASSACES. // science , of literature , and of eloquence . " Singular destiny , " exclaims Thiers , after perusing volumes of manuscripts from his pen , " of that prodigious man , to be the greatest writer of his time , while he was its greatest captain , its greatest legislator , its greatest administrator . Every man of refined genius admires the classical productions of the scholars of Greece and Rome . Napoleon , from a natural appreciation of the beautiful , strove to create an enthusiasm for classical studies in the university . There is an element of melancholy which pervades every noble mind . Amidst the mausoleums of dead empires , such spirits love to linger . The utilitarianism of Napoleon was beautifully blended with the highest poetic sensibility . The sun which ripens the corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with beauty the violet and the rose . To encourage exertion , and to rescue merit from hostile or unjust detraction , Napoleon had classes of the Institute organized , to give a perfectly impartial report upon the progress of literature , the arts , and the sciences . These reports were read to the Emperor in the presence of the Council of State , and munificent rewards were conferred upon the deserving . When the reading of the first report was finished , Napoleon said to the deputies of the Institute . " Gentlemen ! if the French language is become an universal language , it is to the men of genius who have sat , or who still sit among you , that we are indebted for this . I attach a value to the success of your labors . They tend to enlighten my people . They are essential to the glory of my crown . I have heard with satisfaction the report you have just made to me . You may rely on my protection . " The approbation of the Emperor was the highest reward which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts of design , he visited with Josephine and a brilliant assemblage of his court , the studio of the painter David . This distinguished artist had just completed the picture of the Coronation . He had selected the moment when the Emperor was placing the crown upon the brow of the Empress . The painting had been criticised as rather representing the coronation of Josephine than that of Napoleon . The Emperor contemplated for a few moments , in silence , the impressive scene which the pencil of the artist had so vividly delineated . Then , turning to the painter , he said , " Monsieur David , this is well , very well , indeed . The Empress , my mother , the Emperor , all are most appropriately placed . You have made me a French knight . I am gratified that // proofs of affection I was desirous of testifying toward the Empress . " Then advancing two steps , and turning toward the painter , he uncovered his head , and bowing profoundly , said , " Monsieur David , I salute you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirable tact , " I receive the compliment of the Emperor in the name of all the artists in the Empire . I am happy in being the individual one you deign to make the channel of such an honor . This painting was afterward suspended in the grand museum of the Louvre . Napoleon , in a second visit , met by appointment M. David and all his pupils . He conferred upon those young artists who had distinguished themselves , the decoration of the Legion of Honor . He also conferred upon M. David the dignity of an officer in that honorary corps . It may , perhaps , be hardly decorous to introduce the public to the private and sacred hours of the Emperor . Yet the most trivial acts illustrate character . Every thing is interesting which can throw light upon one whom the world has pronounced to be the most extraornary man the world has ever known . The Emperor and Empress had separate apartments in the palace . He occasionally , however , passed the ni , , ht with Josephine , when much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Emperor , Constant , was ordered to enter the apartment at seven o'clock to awake the imperial couple , draw the curtains , and replenish the fire , if necessary . The valet thu*s artlessly reports the scene which usually ensued : " The Emperor commonly asked for tea , or an infusion of orange flowers , and rose immediately after . The Empress would say , with a smile , Will you rise so soon Remain a little longer . ' Well , if I do , you will not sleep , will you ? ' was his Majesty 's usual reply . Then he would roll her up in the coverlet , laughing , and tickling her on the cheeks and neck . In the course of a few minutes the Empress rose also , and putting on a loose morning-dress , either read the journal while the Emperor dressed , or retired , by a private access , to her own apartments , but never without addressing some kind and condescending words to myself . " The revolution had destroyed the feudal throne of the Bourbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendor . It seems to be essential to a monarchy that it should be surrounded by an aristocracy . Napoleon was a democratic Emperor , the choice of the people , and ever studying their interests . He now displayed his mighty genius in the attempt to create a democratic aristocracy . This , perhaps , might have been possible , by avoiding the incorporation of the hereditary element . Napoleon wished to surround his throne with great families , who should contribute to the splendor of French society , without doing violence to the principles of republican equality . He thought that this could be accomplished by allowing the members of the new nobility no exclusive priv NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. ileges , and by presenting these honorable distinctions as a reward to all who could earn them by their services . He had at his disposal immortal names to confer upon those who had performed immortal exploits . The new nobility , proud of titles won upon the fields of Rivoli , ' Castiglioni , Montebello , Auerstadt , and Eylau , were regarded with contempt by the ancient aristocracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of departed centuries . Stable-boys , tailors ' apprentices , and merchants ' clerks , soaring upon the pinions of genius , from uncongenial employments , into the regions of mighty enterprise and renown , though decorated with the loftiest titles , and burdened with wealth , were still regarded with contempt by the impoverished and undistinguished descendants of the Cond6s , the Guises , and the Montmorencies . Napoleon was fully conscious of this difficulty . In speaking of the subject at St. Helena , he said : " An aristocracy is the true , the only support of a monarchy . Without it , the state is a vessel without a rudder  --  a balloon in the air . A true aristocracy , however , must be ancient . Therein consists its real force , its talismanic charm . That was the only thing which I could not create . Reasonable democracy will never aspire to any thing more than obtaining an equal power of elevation to all . The true policy in these times was to employ the remains of the aristocracy with the forms and the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage of the ancient historic names . It was the only way to throw the halo of antiquity over our modern institutions . My designs on this were quite formed , but I had not time to bring them to maturity . It was this : that every lineal descendant of an old marshal or minister should be entitled at any time to get himself declared a duke by the government , upon proving that he had the requisite fortune ; every descendant of a general , or governor of a province , to obtain the title of a count upon obtaining a similar endowment . This system would have advanced some , excited the hopes of others , awakened the emulation of all , without injuring any one . Pretty toys , it is true , but such as are indispensable for the government of uten . Old and corrupted nations can not be governed on the ' same principles with those which are simple and virtuous . For one , in these times , who would sacrifice all to the public good , there are thousands and millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or their enjoyment . To attempt to regenerate such a people in a day , would be an act of madness . The ' true genius of the workman consists in making a right use of the materials which he has at his disposal , to extract good even from the elements . which appear at first sight most adverse to his . designs . There is the real secret of the revival of titles , ribbons , and crosses . And , after all , . these toys are attended with few inconveniences , and are not without some advantages . In the ' state of civilization in which we are placed , they ' are proper to awaken the respect of the multi , // tude , and not without influence in producing a feeling of self-respect in their owners . They satisfy the vanity of the weak , without giving any just cause of offense to the strong . " The attempt to unite republican equality with imperial splendor is vain . But Napoleon was now involved in a laby*rinth of events from which no finite wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true republic , ten years of anarchy had conclusively proved . But Napoleon was now gathering all power into his own hands , and surrounding himself with a proud , hereditary aristocracy . Though he was disposed to consecrate all his energies to the welfare of the people , he was laying the foundations of a perfect despotism . He seems to have some misgivings himself respecting the expediency of appointing an hereditary aristocracy . O'Meara remarked to Napoleon at St. Helena , that it had excited some surprise that he never gave a dukedom in France to any person , although he had created many dukes elsewhere . He replied , " It would have created great discontent among the people . If , for example , I had made one of my marshals Duke of Bourgogne , it would have excited great alarm in Bourgogne . They would have conceived that some feudal rights and territory were attached to the title . The nation hated the old nobility so ranch , that the creation of any rank resembling them would have given universal discontent , which I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I instituted the new nobility to destry the old . The greater part of those I creased had sprung from the people . Every private soldier had a right to look up to the title of duke . I believe that I acted wrong in doing even this . It lessened that system of equality which pleased the people so much . But if I had created dukes with a French title , it would have been considered as a revival of the old feudal privileges with which the natiofl had been cursed so long . " The power of i*apoleon was absolute . Circumstances , which he could not control , rendered it necessary that it should he so . It was essential that he should he invested with dictatorial authority to repel the foes handed against the independence of France . Every intelli , ert man in France recognized this necessity . That Napoleon devoted this absolute power to the glory of France , and not to his own selfish indulgence , no one can deny . He says , with his accustomed glow of eloquence : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operations with the utmost . rapidity , and capable of the most nervous efforts . And , truly , nothing less was required to triumph over the immense difficulties with which we were surrounded , and to produce the marvels which we accomplished . The organization of the prefectures , their action and results , were alike admirable . The same impulse was given at the same instant to more than forty millions of men . By the aid of these centres of local activity the movement was as rapid at all the extremities as at the heart of the Empire . Strangers who visited us were astonished at this system . They never failed to attrihute the immense results which were attained , to that uniformity of action pervading so great a space . Each prefect , with the authority and local patronage with which he was invested , was in himself a little emperor . Nevertheless , as he enjoyed no force hut from the central authority , owed all his lustre to official employment , and had no natural or hereditary connection with the territory over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the feudal government without any of its inconveniences . It was indispensahle to clothe them with all that authority . I found myself made dictator by the force of circumstances . It was necessary , therefore , that all the minor springs should he entirely dependent on , and in complete harmony with the grand central moving power . " The efficiency of this government no one can question . That France was driven to its adoption hy the incessant attacks of its foes can not he denied . That this alone enabled Napoleon for twenty years to triumph over the combined despots of Europe , in arms against him , is equally beyond a doubt . France in her peril surrendered herself to a dictator in whom she reposed confidence , and invested him with absolute power . Nobly did Napoleon requite the trust . He concentrated every energy of his body and every thought of his soul to the promotion of the welfare of France . Wherever . he erred , it was in the path of a lofty and a generous ambition . His power was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monarch of the nobles ; Napoleon the chosen sovereign of . the people . The centralization of power was , however , appalling . The Emperor selected the members of the Council of State , the Senate , and the Legislative Bodies . He appointed all the officers in the army and the navy . The whole police of France , all the magistrates , the judges of all the courts ; all persons connected with the customs , the revenue and the excise ; all the ministers of religion , the teachers in schools , academies and universities , the postmasters , and all persons concerned in the administration of roads , bridges , public buildings , canals , fortresses &amp;c. , were either directly or indirectly subject to the appointment of the Emperor . One day Napoleon at St. Helena , was reading the infamous memoir of his life by GoldsmitL He found himself there accused of every crime which a demon could perpetrate . Calmly laying down the book he said " After all , let them abridge , suppress , and mutilate as much as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me entirely into the shade . The historian of France can not pass over the Empire . If he have any honesty he will riot fail to render me my share of justice . His task will be easy . The facts speak of themselves . They shine like the sun . " I closed the gulf of anarchy and cleared the // chaos . I purified the Revolution , dignified nations , and established kings . I excited every kind of emulation , rewarded every kind of merit , and extended the limits of glory . This is at least something . And on what point can I be assailed on which an historian could not defend me Can it be for my intentions But even here I can find absolution . Can it be for my despotism ? It may be demonstrated that the dictatorship was absolutely necessary . Will it be said that I restrained liberty It can be proved that licentiousness , anarchy , and the greatest irregularities , still haunted the threshold of freedom . Shall I be accused of having been too fond of war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . Will it be said that I aimed at universal monarchy ? It can be proved that this was merely the result of fortuitous circumstances , and that our enemies led me step by step to this determination . Lastly shall I be blamed for my ambition ? This passion I must doubtless be allowed to possess , and that in no small degree . But at the same time my ambition was of the highest and noblest kind that perhaps ever existed-that of establishing and consecrating the empire of reason , and the full exercise and complete enjoyment of all the human . faculties . And here the historian will probably feel compelled to regret , that such ambition should not have been fulfilled and gratified . This is my whole history in a fewwords . ' The 15th of August 1807 , Napoleon was thirty-eight years of age . A brilliant party was assembled at the Tuileries . It was an evening of surpassing loveliness . All Paris , intoxicated with enthusiasm , thronged the spacious garden of the palace . With loud acclamations they called for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding the Empress by the hand , and surrounded by a brilliant group . NAPOLEON AND THE CHILD . // Spontaneous bursts of applause , from one hundred thousand voices , greeted him whenever he appeared . Taking the arm of his faithful friend Duroc , Napoleon , in disguise , left the palace and mingled with the groups crowding the garden . Every where he heard his name pronounced with gratitude and love . A little boy was shouting with transport , Five l'Empersur . Napoleon caught the child in his arms . " Why do you shout in that manner V said he . " My father and mother , " replied the child , " taught me to love and bless the Emperor . " Napoleon conversed with the parents . He found that they had fled from the horrors of civil war in Brittany and had found employment and competence in Paris . With glowing hearts they testified to the blessings which Napoleon had conferred upon France . The next day a present from the Emperor informed them to whom they had unbosomed their gratitude . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed by an immense concourse of people , met the Council of State , the Senate and the Legislative Body . He thus addressed them : " Gentlemen ! since your last session , new wars , new triumphs , new treaties of peace have changed the political state of Europe . . All nations rejoice with one accord , to see the influence which England exercised over the Continent destroyed forever . In all that I have done , I have had in view solely the prosperity of my people , more dear in my eyes than my own glory . I am desirous for maritime peace . No resentment shall be allowed to interfere with this desire . But whatever be the issue which the decrees of Providence have allotted to the maritime war , my people shall find me ever the same , and I shall ever find my people worthy of me . Your conduct , when your Emperor was more than fifteen hundred miles away , has heightened my esteem . The proofs of attachment which you have given me , have excited my warmest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improving our institutions . I have created several imperial titles to give new lustre to distinguished subjects , to honor eminent services by eminent rewards , and to prevent the revival of any feudal title incompatible with our Constitution . My Minister of the Interior will inform you of the public works , which have been commenced or finished . But what remains to be done is of far greater importance . I intend that in all parts of my Empire , even in the smallest hamlet , the prosperity of the citizen and the value of land shall be augmented by the effect of the general system of improvement which I have conceived . Gentlemen ! your assistance will be necessary for me to arrive at this great result . I have a right to rely firmly upon it . " this speech was heard with deep emotion and applauded with transport . After Napoleon had retired , the President of the Legislative Body gave utterance to the almost unanimous sentiment of France , in the following words : " The picture set before our eyes seems to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged , in the internal administration of his dominion . And yet all these useful labors , all these wise projects , were ordered and conceived amid the din of arms on the furthest confines of conquered Prussia , and on the frontiers of threatened Russia . If it be true that , at the distance of five hundred leagues from the capital , amid the cares and the fatigues of war , a hero prepared so many benefits , how is he about to increase them by returning among us ! The public welfare will wholly engage him , and his glory will be the more touching for it . " He displaces , he contracts , he extends , the boundaries of empires . All are borne away by his ascendency . Well ! this man , covered with so much glory , promises us still greater . Peaceable and disarmed , he will prove that this invincible force , which , as it runs , overturns thrones and empires , is beneath that truly royal wisdom , which preserves states by peace , which enriches them by agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and founds them everlastingly on the two-fold support of morality and the laws . Napoleon took great interest in the female school which he had established at Ecouen . He often made presents to the young ladies who distinguished themselves . One day in a visit he found all the young ladies engaged in needle-work . After having addressed a few pleasant words to each of the classes , he playfully asked a bright-looking girl , " How many needles-full of thread does it take to make a shirt ? ' She archly replied , " Sire , I should need but one if I could have that sufficiently long . " Napoleon was so pleased with the readiness of the reply , that he immediately gave a golden chain to the young lady . It became , of course , to her a priceless treasure . All the pupils of the school most enthusiastically loved the Emperor . After the restoration of the Bourbons , an order was issued that every thing should be removed from the institution which could call to the mind the Usurper . The gifts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But Miss Brouard kept her chain in her bosom . She had declared that she would part with it only with her life . One day a servant perceived it . The fact was reported to the Principal . The chain was demanded . It was refused . She was reported to the higher authorities . The chain was again demanded . She replied , " It was the gift of the Emperor , and I will keep it , be the consequences what they may , till I die . " She was imprisoned in the hall of correction , where she remained in solitude several days . Still she would not yield . The whole school was assembled together , and Miss Brouard , though an universal favorite , was expelled . A short time after , one of the ladies of the Bourbon family , the Duchess of Angoul6me // NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. made a visit to the school . All the young ladies were ordered , as soon as she should enter , to shout , " Vive le Roi P in honor of the Bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consternation , was greeted with the unanimous acclaim , " Vice l'Empereur ! " The Count de Lille , afterward Louis XVIII. , then residing in Russia , made some movement indicative of a new conspiracy to recover the Bourbon throne . Alexander , that his good faith might not be suspected , communicated the fact , through General Savary , to Napoleon . The Emperor replied , " Thank the Emperor Alexander for the communication which he directed you to make to me . He is mistaken if he supposes that I attach the least importance to any thing that the Count de Lille can do . If he is tired of his residence in Russia , he may come to Versailles . I will make every necessary provision for him . " Napoleon was minutely informed of every thing that was passing in the court of St. Petersburg . Alexander , often the victim of way .. ward passions , had become so captivated by a beautiful woman , that all his time was absorbed in devotion to her . At the close of a letter of diplomatic instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a matter of indifference to me to observe the character of that man who was born a sovereign . A woman turns the head of the autocrat of all the Russias ! All the women in the world would not make me lose an hour . Continue to acquaint me of every thing . Let me know the most minute details . The private life of a man is a mirror in which we may see many useful lessons reflected . " After the marriage of Jerome with the daughter of the King of Wurtemberg , as the young couple left Paris for their kingdom of Westphaha , Napoleon gave the following instructions to his brother : " My brother , I think you ought to go to Stuttgard , as you have been invited thither by the King of Wurtemberg . You will proceed thence to Cassel , with all the pomp with which the hopes of your people will induce them to sur round you . You will convoke the deputies of the towns , the ministers of all religions , the deputies of the States now existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half noble . Before that assembly so composed , you will receive the Constitution and swear to maintain it . " Appoint at first only half of your Councilors of State . That number will be sufficient for commencing business . Take care that the majority be composed of non-nobles , but without letting any one perceive this habitual caution to keep up a majority of the third estate in all offices . I except from this some places at court , to which , upon the same principles , the highest names must be called . But , in your ministries , in your councils , if possible , in your courts of appeal , in your administrations , the greater part of the persons whom you employ should not be nobles . This conduct will go to the heart of Germany , and , perhaps , mortify the other class . It is sufficient not to use any affectation in this conduct . Take care never to enter into discussions , nor to let it be understood that you attach such importance to the advancement of the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are to be found . " What is of particular consequence to me is , that you delay not in the least the introduction of the Napoleon Code . The happiness of your people is of importance to me , not only for the NAPOLEON AT THE FEMALE SCHOOL . // influence which it may have upon your glory and mine , but also under the point of view of the general system of Europe . Listen not to those who tell you that your people , accustomed to servitude , will receive your benefits unthankfully . They are more enlightened in the kingdom of Westphalia than some persons would fain persuade you . Your throne will never be firmly founded but on the confidence and the love of the population . What the people of Germany desire with impatience is , that individuals who are not noble , and possess talents , should have an equal right to your consideration and to office ; that every species of bondage , and all intermediate restrictions between the sovereign and the lowest class should be entirely abolished . The benefits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution of juries , will be so many distinguishing characteristics of your monarchy . And , if I must tell you my whole mind , I reckon more upon their effects for the extension and consolidation of that monarchy than upon the results of the greatest victories . Your people must enioy a liberty , an equality , a prosperity unknown to the other people of Germany . This liberal government will produce , in one way or another , changes the most salutary to the system of the confederation and to the power of your monarchy . This mode of governing will be a stronger barrier to separate you from Prussia than the Elbe , than fortresses , than the protection of France . What people would be willing to return under the arbitrary Prussian Government after it has tasted the benefits of a wise and liberal administration* The people of Germany , those of France , Italy , Spain , desire equality , and require liberal ideas . It is now several years that I have directed the affairs of Europe , and I have had occasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrary to the general opinion . Be a constitutional king . If the reason and the intelligence of your times were not sufficient , in your position , good policy would enjoin it . " Said Napoleon at St. Helena : " It was the subject of my perpetual dreams , to render Paris the real capital of Europe . I sometimes wished it , for instance , to become a city with a population of two , three , or four millions , in a word , something fabulous , colossal , unexampled until our days , and with public establishments suitable to its population . " Had Heaven but granted me twenty years , and a little more leisure , ancient Paris would have been sought for in vain . Not a trace of it would have been left . I should have changed the face of France . Archimedes promised every thing , provided he was supplied with a resting place for his lever . I should have done as much , wherever I could have found a point of support for my energy , my perseverance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budgets . I should have displayed the difference between a Constitutional Emperor , and a King of France . The kings of France have never possessed any administrative or municipal institution . They have merely shown themselves great lords , who ruined their men of business . " The nation itself has nothing in its character , but what is transitory and perishable . Every thing is done for the gratification of the moment and of caprice ; nothing for duration . That is our motto . And it is exemplified by our manners in France . Every one passes his life in doing and undoing . Nothing is ever left behind . Is it not unbecoming , that Paris should not possess even a French theatre , or an opera house , in any respect worthy of its high claims " I have often set myself against the feasts which the city of Paris wished to give me . They consisted of dinners , balls , artificial fire-works , at an expense of two or three hundred thousand dollars , the preparations for which obstructed the public for several days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they had cost in their construction . I proved , that with these idle expenses , they might have erected lasting and magnificent monuments . " One must have gone through as much as I have , in order to be acquainted with all the difficulties of doing good . If the business related to chimneys , partitions , and furniture for some individuals in the imperial palaces , the work was quick and effectual . But if it were necessary to lengthen the garden of the Tuileries , to render some quarters wholesome , to clean some sewers , arid to accomplish a task beneficial to the public , in which some particular person had no direct interest , I found it requisite to exert all the energy of my character , to write six , ten letters a day , and to get into a downright passion . It was in this way that I paid out as much as six millions of dollars in sewers , for which nobody was ever to thank me . I pulled down a property of six millions in houses in froiit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carousel , and throwing open the Louvre . What I did is immense . What I had resolved to do , and what I projected , were still much more so . " Some may suppose that the above account of Napoleon 's administrative labors , is the glowing eulogy of a friend . Read then the testimony of an English historian . Every page of Lockhart 's Life of Napoleon , bears the impress of his hostility to the mighty Emperor against whom England waged such unrelenting warfare . And yet Lockhart is constrained to witness to the following facts : " Wherever the Emperor was , in the midst of his hottest campaigns . he examined the details of administration at home more closely perhaps than other sovereigns of not half so great an empire did during years of profoundest peace . His dearest amusement , when he had nothing else to do , was to solve problems in geometry or algebra . He carried this passion into every department of affairs .
