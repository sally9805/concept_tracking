TEMPERANCE . CLERGYMEN and physicians have acted nobly and efficiently in the cause of Temperance . To the first is due the praise of having originated the movement , and the still greater praise of persevering in it through a period of more than twenty-five years , with earnestness and zeal . To the last the second honor is due , not so much for their public professional activity in the cause , as for their constant and efficient commendations of it . in their professional intercourse with society . It is with regret I am compelled to confess that lawyers , as a profession , have taken no part in this most important cause . A few most estimable individuals have given it their active support and influence ; but the great body of the bar has stood aloof from it , while it is notorious that a fraction , and by no means an inconsiderable one , has encouraged , rather than discouraged , intemperance . It is highly probable that this state of the case has arisen from causes incident to the different professions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physicians for the promotion of private and public virtue . It is emphatically the business of the clergy to be sentinels on the moral watch-towers , to ring the tocsin on the appearance of an enemy . This duty they have performed most faithfully and energetically . So , too , it is especially the business of physicians to attend to the health of the public , and of each within his bounds , to warn his customers of the injurious effects of intemperance on the human constitution . These two professions address the fears , the minds , and the consciences of men . But it is no part of the professional business of lawyers to watch over the morals or health of the public . In common with every other citizen , as individuals , each is required to do all in his power to promote the public good ; but , professionally , his whole duty is confined to an exact and impartial administration of the laws of the land . It is not the lawyer 's province to address the fears , the minds , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to act correctly ; but confident in his knowledge of the law , he imperatively dictates a course of conduct which must be pursued , or certain consequences become inevitable . Nor is it his duty , any more than it is the duty of every citizen , to prosecute for offences that come under his observation ; for his duty begins only when a case is professionally brought to him . In this country public opinion is , in a very great degree , the higher law . It controls legislation ; and , if it can not prevent , it may embarrass the execution of a law . In every matter , therefore , relating to a reform of inveterate habits , however pernicious , it is of the highest importance to secure a decided public opinion in favor of the necessity and measure of reform , before attempting to restrain them by coercive acts ; for the cause must be injured if legislation should anticipate public opinion consequently , the cause of Temperance has been admirably conducted by permitting clergymen and physicians to enlighten the public on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energetic operations . Public opinion is now ripe for them ; and although I will not say that a majority of the people is ready to sanction a law prohibiting the sale of intoxicating drinks , I certainly hazard nothing by asserting that nine-tenths // of the people will sanction a rigorous execution of all the laws on our statute book relating to excise . It may be supposed that lawyers can do nothing more for the cause of Temperance than clergymen and physicians , or any other citizens . In a sense , this is true . They have neither more moral influence , nor more persuasive eloquence , to lead men to the voluntary performance of duty . Nor is it to be expected that they will become informers and prosecutors ; but there is a vast moral field open to them in explaining the laws , and in giving sound legal advice to the people , which will come home to their bosoms and consciences with more power than abstract moral influence , eloquence , informations , or prosecutions . The laws now on our statute books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our state . If they were  --  and temperance men should direct their energies to an observance of their proper execution-we should have little cause to lament the want of an act to prohibit the sale of intoxicating drinks , and we should soon see a reformation in taverns and public morals . If the lawyer can not banish intemperance from our state , he can fence it in so that it will pro . duce little harm , and the unanimous public voice will ultimately demand a prohibitory law for the sale of strong drinks . If we can not execute the laws now in being , how can we hope to execute a more stringent law  --  a prohibitory law-if it were enacted * The laws that are now in force are the very next thing to a total prohibition of the sale of intoxicating drinks , and , if executed according to their letter and spirit , the next step in advance must be a prohibitory law . In this paper I propose to examine the section exclusively relating to the license of taverns , and expect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act relating to Excise and Taverns is in the fol. lowing words : " Licenses shall not be granted to any person to sell strong and spiritous liquors arid wines , to be drank in the house of the seller , unless such person proposes to keep an inn or tavern , nor unless the commissioners are satisfied that the applicant is of good moral character , that he is of sufficient ability to keep a tavern , and has the necessary accommodations to entertain travelers , and that a tavern is absolutely necessary for the actual accommodation of travelers at the place where the applicant resides , or proposes to keep the same ; all which shall be expressly stated in such license. ** This language is so strong and clear , that it may be supposed it is un . necessary to explain it ; and yet , it is a notorious fact , that it is universally misunderstood , or , if understood , disregarded , by the officers charged with its execution ; and that the public , believing the practice of these officers to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has silently acquiesced in their practice . The officers charged with the execution of the above-quoted law are , first  --  the trustees of villages ; and , second , the commissioners of excise . Some corporations , as New-York , etc. , have exclusive control of the matter ; but the trust reposed in them , and the principles of the general law , are as applicable to them as to the trustees of villages and the commissioners . The acts of incorporation of the villages of this state , confer on the trustees of these corporations the power to restrict the number of taverns to be licensed within the limits of their respective corporate bounds , to a certain number . They can not designate who shall , or shall not receive a // license* nor interfere with the acts of the commissioners of excise in any other manner than by confining them to certain limits ; consequently , the only part of the above quoted section legitimately within the scope of their power is , whether " a tavern is absolutely necessary for the actual accommodation of travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed to their keeping , and nothing else . The deposit of this power in the trustees is the most judicious that could be made . Who could determine the number of taverns " absolutely necessary for the actual accommodation of travelers , " so well as the trustees , and be responsible to the inhabitants for the manner of performing the trust ' ? Who could be expected to discharge this most important duty so carefully , to exclude mere grog shops , and neighborhood pest-houses , as men elected to discharge this duty under the sacred responsibility of an oath , with the eyes of their constituents upon them sharpened by fears of riots , gambling , and every moral depravity ? The cautious words of the law prohibit the trustees from authorizing a license to be granted in a doubtful case . A tavern must not only be necessary , " but " absolutely necessary ; " and not only necessary for future , contingent or possible travelers , but " for the actual accommodation " of the real customary number of travelers within their bounds . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustees to indulge in any speculation for the future ; it gives them no discretionary power , but confines them to the single naked fact , whether a tavern is AB5OLUTELY necessary for the ACTUAL accommodation of travelers " then frequenting the place . If the trustees exceed the powers thus granted , they violate the law , and assume a heavy responsibility : And yet it is notorious that the trustees have been successfully solicited to authorize a larger number of licenses than the law and their oaths permit , on the unjustifiable ground of charity to landlords and their families ; because , forsooth , if they should receive no license to make drunkards ,  --  to corrupt the morals of our youthto starve , and in various ways make wretched parents , wives , children and neighborhoods-they will be unable to maintain their families and bring up their children in the midst of corruption , and will lose the amount they have invested in their stands ! ! And again , the still more absurd reason has been successfully urged , that if licenses should not be granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nefarious business without a license , and the public will suffer the evil without receiving the amount required for a license ! ! ! It is not necessary to waste time to show the weakness and corruption of these arguments , which would be a very easy matter ; but , I ask , where is the power conferred on these officers to take such facts into consideration at all , even if they were just and proper appeals to their sympathy as men ? All the power they possess is conferred by the act , all the provisions of which relate to the protec* tion of the public , and not one to the prot*eetion of the tavern-keeper . Where , then , do they obtain the power to annul and disregard the statutory provisions , without the literal fulfilment of which the law expressly says , " Licences shall not be granted , " and substitute others , all in favor of the tavern-keeper , at the ruinous expense of the public ? I beg , nay , I demand , of them to show it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor . The above remarks apply as forcibly to the commissioners of excise as to the trustees ; but , the commissioners of excise have more duties to // perform in this matter than the trustees , and , therefore , demand special attention . We have seen that the power of the trustees is confined to a prohibition to license more taverns than a specified number ; but it by no means follows that the commissioners are bound to license the number thus authorized . They can not license more , whatever may be the necessity ; but they are bound not to license as many , if ; in their judgment , they are not " absolutely necessary for the accommodation of travelers " in the village . They are sworn to do their duties according to their own sober judgment , and not by the dictation of others . The trustees have the power of fixing the outside number to which they may go , but not fixing the number to which they shall go , which is a matter the law has left to their judgments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trustees . But to enable us to understand the important duties of the commissioners of excise , we must examine them in detail . It will be seen by a reference to the section of the act I have quoted , that five conditions are made necessary by the law , every one of which must be fulfilled to the letter , or , in the words of the law , " Licenses shall not be granted " by the commissioners . These conditions are-First , " That the person proposes to keep an inn or tavern " - not a mere groggery , but a tavern , in a legal sense , for the accommodation of travelers . I will not stop to inquire into the general practice of commissioners in relation to this condition or provision , because it is notoriously disregarded or overlooked . It is true that this condition is rather a promise made by the applicant , to be fulfilled if he should get a license , than a condition precedent , to be investigated by the commissioners . But , nevertheless , respect must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty requires that no license should be granted without a confidence that it will be fulfilled . And yet is it not notorious that licenses are granted to parties whose real intentions are known to be , not to keep a tavern , in a legal sense , but a mere groggery and pest-house of a neighborhood ? Is there a town in the state in which such establishments can not be pointed out ? But let us pass this comparatively unimportant matter , if any duty can be unimportant which is enjoined under the solemn sanctity of an oath , and which relates to the morals of our citizens , and pass to the next condition or provision , which is-Second , " nor unless the commissioners are satisfied that the applicant is of good moral character . " Here we have a condition requir*n g the positive knowledge of the commissioners . The applicant must be " of good moral character , " of which the commissioners must be satisfied " by proof , if they should not personally know it . Negative character is not sufficient , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was wise in the Legislature to require a positively good character in a man appointed to entertain **25;340;TOOLONG comfort and safety , in money and person , are in his keeping for a time . The term good moral character is understood to be that against which no particular vice is chargeable . He must neither be a drunkard , a bawd , a cheat , a common liar , a gambler , nor any of those things which the common-sense of the community asserts to be vile or infamous . How many tavern keepers in our state would have been refused a license this year , if the commissioners had conscientiously respected Fthis most important provision of the law ? How many of the old tavern keepers , who have for years been growing rich by violations of the law ,  --  selling liquors on the Sabbath , selling at all times to minors , paupers and apprentices ,  --  encour // aging and engaging in various modes of gambling , and permitting obscene exhibitions and practices on their premises , would have been refused licenses by commissioners sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under oath , that these men are " of good moral character , " as they are compelled to do when they sign the license ? I contend , and at least every lawyer will support the position , that a tavern keeper of a year 's standing , has a moral character as a tavern keeper which may be entirely distinct from his character as a citizen , and which should be the subject of special attention by conscientious commissioners . He may be a man of strict probity as a citizen , and , as such , maintain an excellent character ; and , as a tavern keeper , violate every provision of the law , and maintain an infamous character , and , consequently , not entitled to a license from commissioners who are compelled to certify , under oath , that he is " of good moral character . " But it is unnecessary to dwell on this most important provision , and I , therefore , pass to the next condition or provision of the law , viz : Third , " that he is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next condition , viz : Fourth , " and has the necessary accommodation to entertain travelers , " which I will notice in conjunction for the sake of brevity . The word " ability " has reference to pecuniary means , and signifies that he has something more than the mere outfit for the " necessary accommodation of travelers " which immediately follows . These provisions exhibit the minute and careful circumspection of the Legislature in conferring the power to grant tavern licenses , by surrounding it with all the guards a far-sighted prudence could suggest . The applicant must not only be " of good moral character , " but he must have the " abi lity " to continue so , and , at least , be above the necessity of immediate temptation to do wrong ; in other words , he must have the " ability " to keep a tavern in a legal senseto wait for travelers  --  and not be under the necessity to corrupt and sponge on a neighborhood to meet his daily wants . The 4th provision confirms this construction , because it proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only design , in licensing taverns . The Legislature knew that they are sometimes useful accommodations to neighborhoods ; but they are never so useful as to be indispensable , and are a hundred times more pernicious than useful , unless all the provisions of the law are strictly observed or enforced . But of what avail is it for the Legislature to enact laws so carefully , if the provisions remain a dead letter on the statute book , and the commissioners license without regard to them ? I come now to the last condition , which , if it is possible for one to be of paramount importance where all are most solemnly enjoined under the highest sanction known to the law and the consciences of men , is emphatically the most important of any enacted ; it is , Fifth , " that a tavern is absolutely necessary for the actual accommodation of travelers at the place where the applicant r keep a tavern . " esides or proposes to This condition or provision , although it is the last in the series applicable to the tavern keeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioners ; and , as I have said , the only one for the trustees of the villages . All the previous conditions relate to the personal fitness and ability of the applicant to keep a tavern ; but this last is fundamental , independent of fitness and ability . He may have all the legal requisites // in the highest degree ; but unless " a tavern is ABSOLUTELY necessary for the ACTUAL accommodation of travelers at the place where the applicant resides or proposes to keep a tavern , " the commissioners have no more right to license him , than they have to resolve themselves into a legislature , and prescribe conditions for themselves , which , in effect , though not in form , is what they have done for years . I have also said that it should be the first in consideration ; for as it contains the fundamental principle of the law ,  --  the object and end of its enactment ;  --  and as the naked fact , whether " a tavern is absolutely necessary for the actual accommodation of travelers at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tavern , " can easily and speedily be decided , without involving any personal or irritating investigations , it should be disposed of by the proper authorities , before they take into consideration " moral character , " " ability , " and " necessary accommodations " of the applicant . But , most unfortunately for the public , so far from being first considered by commissioners , it is not only not considered last , but , generally , is not considered at all . The positive proof of this most lamentable fact is before the eyes of every man in the state , competent to judge , who will cast his eye over the town in which he resides , and he will see that from one half to three fourths of the taverns have been licensed without any reference to this important provision , and most of the remainder without regard to the other provisions . I have now arrived at the last solemn clause of the section quoted , a clause which , though it does not form a condition to be fulfilled by the tavern keeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissioners of excise . It is a certificate given by them , in their official character , and under their official oaths , that all the provisions of the law , viz. : - that the " person proposes to keep an inn or tavern " - that he " is of good moral character " - has " sufficient ability to keep a tavern , and the necessary accommodations to entertain travelers " - " and that a tavern is absolutely necessary for the actual accommodation of travelers at the place " for which the license has been granted ,  --  have been fully considered , and ascertained by them to be just and true in every respect . This is precisely the import of the language of the law . The words are : " all which shall be expressly stated in such license . " I can conceive of no official duty more clearly defined , and of a more solemn character . The Legislature has contrived to embody in this short section all the duties of commissioners relating to taverns , expressed in the clearest terms , and surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the express powers granted , and by such enumeration excluding all other considerations-I say , not satisfied with a presumption that the commissioners will do their duties because they are prescribed by law , the same section commands them to certify " in such license , " that they have bestowed the required consideration on " all " the duties enjoined on them . What could be done more if licenses were to be granted at all * It only stops short of prohibiting the sale of intoxicating drinks . I ask every commissioner of excise in the state , whether he would be willing to appear in court , in the trial of a cause , and solemnly swear that each item of the law was , in every instance of license granted , fully considered and found to be true ? Let inc suppose a case which might readily occur . A tavern keeper is indicted for some offence , in the trial of which it will be of the highest importance for him to prove that he // 111 Temperance . is , or at least recently was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His lawyer tells him so , and asks him to subp4zena the best man in his neighborhood for the purpose . The tavern keeper is at a loss to find them , and tells his lawyer of his difficulty , who asks him , " have you a license ? " " Yes . " " Well , subpoma the commissioners of excise , who are men of high characters , and have officially sworn that you are of good moral character , ' and will unquestionably testify to the same thing in court . " It is done ; and the commissioners are put on the stand . It is probable there is scarcely a commissioner in the state who might not be placed in a very unpleasant and awkward predicament under such circumstances . I have now dissected this very important law , and have conscientiously directed attention to the duties of officers acting under it . This law has been administered for many years by some of the best men among us , and often by sound lawyers , notoriously without attention to its requirements , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how this exceedingly loose practice , under this plainly and accurately expressed , and most rigid law , originated , is of no importance . We know it has prevailed long enough to have obtained an influence over men whose moral worth is above suspicion . The power of precedent over human conduct is so great , that we need not be surprised that this practice has been so generally followed without a suspicion of error ; and , consequently , our present officers are not chargeable with a wilful neglect of duty . It will be otherwise when their attentions shall have been specially directed to the subject . Nothing is more common , and nothing is more erroneous and pernicious , than for people to regard official oaths as of less sanctity than oaths administered on the trial of causes in court . All legal oaths are of equal sanctity ; but if any should be more sacred than others , they should be those taken by officers to whom is entrusted the moral and physical interests of the people , whose decisions are final , without appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vexation , I know of no officers in our country of as much consequence to society as justices of the peace , when considered in all their relations , and viewed as a vast body of men disposing of the every-day controversies of neighborhoods , and promoting peace or strife , and virtue or vice , as magistrates and commissioners of excise . The good or bad acts of a single justice are , comparatively , small matters to the state ; but the good or bad acts of twenty thousand , ( the probable number in the state , ) scattered in every direction , and in every neighborhood , sensibly controlling , or , at least , influencing , the morals and peace of every family , are matters of infinitely more importance to the community , than the official conduct of any governor of the state , or President of the United States . I now come to the main object of this communication . It must b* evident to every reflecting man who has felt an interest in the cause of Temperance , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , that the means hitherto applied to promote it , although they were essential preparatory measures , are not those which will command final success . Persuasion is exhausted for the want of subjects to be persuaded ; for I contend that a vast majority of those who are not now temperance men , are not open to conviction on the subject , in the manner and form it has hitherto been urged . The influences which have closed their minds are as various as the pursuits and objects in life // of the various parties . Nevertheless , it wdizld be unfair , nay , unjust , to class all those who have stood aloof , as anti-temperance men . All who are not with us , are not against us . There is a middle , a neutral ground , although very zealous advocates will not acknowledge it . This middle , this neutral ground , I propose to occupy with every citizen friendly to the support of law and order , without any direct reference to the temperance cause , beyond what is recognized and enjoined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eminently , but incidentally , promoted by the measure . It will be advisable to keep this movement altogether distinct from the temperance movement , as the mode of operating in the two are wholly different . It is expected that every temperance man will become a member of a society to enforce the excise laws ; but there are many men who will cheerfully join a society to execute the law , who would not be willing to join , and never have joined , a temperance society . From what I have said , it is evident that it is of the highest importance the citizens generally , and the officers having the power to authorize and grant licenses for the sale of intoxicating drinks , should possess a correct knowledge of the laws relating to excise , and the regulation of taverns and groceries , and the obligations arising from them . Thousands of trustees of villages and commissioners of excise in the state , good , honest , conscientious men , could not be induced to violate any known duty , and in respect to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object to obtain the required corrections . A comparatively small number may be of a different character , and might , in particular places , continue the evils of which we have so much reason to complain , if there were no checks to restrain them . A severe check would be obtained , if a critically correct knowledge of the law , and of their duties , were familiar to citizens ; for they would then be regarded as men only to be governed by the strong arm of the law , which would speedily be invoked for their chastisement . It is a common error to suppose that trustees of villages and commissioners of excise are not answerable , in law , for malfeasance or nonfeasance of their duties . They can soon be undeceived , if they should obstinately persist in error , if men should be found in their neighborhoods , -I will not say of sufficient moral courage to correct evils affecting the moral and physical condition of the neighborhood , but of sufficient pa. triotism to vindicate the supremacy of the law from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law have not been noticed , because there is no misconception respecting them ; such as selling liquors on the Sabbath , and selling at all times to minors , paupers , and apprentices , by tavern keepers . Also , selling liquors without license by public-house keepers , groceries , beer shops , &amp;c . Against these we have a prohibitory law in as strong terms as if alcohol were wholly prohibited to be sold in our state ; and yet I should not hazard much by saying , that the number of these establishments in our state nearly equals the number of taverns licensed ,  --  a fact which does not speak loudly in praise of temperance advocates and the temperance reform . I can think of no better method of remedying these evils , than to organize societies in every village and town in the state , to execute the laws relating to excise , and the regulation of taverns and groceries ; an outline of a constitution for which I subjoin , as the shortest mode of explaining what I think necessary to give them the requisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

And , whereas most of the evils , for the remedy of which this society is instituted , have their origin in the careless administration of the law in authorizing and granting licenses , therefore it shall be the special duty of this committee , to pay particular attention to the doings of these bodies in authorizing and granting licenses , and , if need be , to take the necessary legal measures to compel them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be the duty of the Finance Committee to provide the ways and means of obtaining the necessary funds required by this society , to collect the same from the various sources agreed upon , and pay the same to the Treasurer .

No money shall be drawn from the Treasurer without a resolution from the Executive Committees or Publication Committee . ART . 6. - It shall be the duty of the Publization Committee to publish in pamphlet form , if need be , in periodicals , such matter as may , in the opinion of the committee , be a clear and correct exposition of any law relating to excise , and the duties of officers acting under such law , and distribute , or have distributed , such publication to every voter in the village or town in which the society has been instituted .

I appeal to every citizen in the state to say , whether it is not high time that some coercive measure should be adopted to vindicate the law in the matter I have discussed . I most earnestly appeal to the bench and the bar to give their powerful assistance in this great and most important struggle . They can easily and speedily secure the victory without sullying their ermine , or degrading their robes . If judges , in their charges to grand juries , would notice the duties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oaths , to become thoroughly acquainted with their duties , that they may discharge them honestly and conscientiously ; if grand juries would present the careless and illegal administration of the excise laws as intolerable erievances , and the cause of many of the vices and crimes of society ; if lawyers would join the societies in their respective places of residence , instituted to superintend the execution of the excise laws , and would explain those laws , and the duties of trustees , commissioners of excise , &amp;c. , in respect to them ; and if citizens who desire to maintain the integrity and supremacy of the law , joined by those who are also the advocates of temperance , would show a determination to make an example of obstinate offenders-in one year we would see a most thorough and gratifying reformation , and **26;367;TOOLONG of the // complaints against the venders of strong drinks would disappear . From innumerable pulpits and secular jbra everything has been done to reach the consciences and the judgments of men for a quarter of a century , which has been answered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those they have corrupted . Parents , widows , orphans , wives , mothers and children , have implored them not to fasten on them the extreme and hopeless wretchedness of shame , misery , want and crime , and their woes have been met by derision . The legislature has enacted stringent and wholesome laws for the protection of the public , which are altogether disregarded by public officers and venders of liquors for their own private benefit , at an enormous expense to the public . Establishments without licenses are prohibited from selling intoxicating liquors , and yet there are thousands of these pandora boxes in the state , from which are issuing the diseases , crimes and distresses of society . Are we men ,  --  I will not say freemen ,  --  Americans ,  --  for we are actually in bondage to alcohol sellers and drinkers ,  --  but are we men , and submit to the domination of a class of men who recognize no reason opposed to sensual gratification no ties or impulses opposed to self interest ; and no legal obligations opposed to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power that can tame them  --  the bench and the bar can make them gentle and obedient by a very little effort , particularly if citizens do their duties in villages and towns . Let me not be understood as desiring to supersede the advocacy of temperance on persuasive principles . Would that all men were so conscientious and . intelligent as to be reached by facts and arguments , when laws , coercion , could be safely abolished ; but so long as many men are governed by prejudice , pride , passion , selfishness and consciences , more frequently less than equal to their mengre intelligences , coercion must be applied to cases reason can not reach . If this latter class of men are not a majority of our citizens , they are the noisy , reckless , bullying minority , who constantly attempt to evercrow peaceable men , and force silence through fear of unpopularity , and , sometimes , of violence to property or person .
