txt ART . X. - The Life and Labors of the REV . T. H. GALLAUDET , Lb . ID . By REV . HEMAN HUMPHREY , D. P. New York : Robert Carter &amp; Brothers . 1857. l2mo. pp. 440 . THE story of active philanthropy is ever interesting , and many a schoolboy has read with delight the lives of comforters of human sorrow , from John Howard to Florence Nightingale . But in the whole range of biography we seldom meet with a more interesting narrative than that of Thomas H. Gallaudet . His labors were neither in jails nor in military hospitals , but chiefly with the deaf and dumb , whose woes at first sight would appear more utterly irremediable than those of chained felons or mangled soldiers . Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was born in Philadelphia on the 10th of December , 1787 . He came of a Huguenot family , originally settled in the city of Rochelle , France , his great-grandfather , Peter Elihu Gallaudet , having emigrated to this country // a short time prior to the revocation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents removed from Philadelphia to Hartford , where he grew up , giving early promise of more than ordinary success in life . He appeared singularly adapted by nature for the instruction of the deaf and dumb , which vocation he afterward pursued with such eminent ability , and we find one of his first compositions to be " A Reverie " regarding languages , and speculations as to the possibility of inventing some universal language , which , although a plan that has occupied many profound minds , has as yet proved abortive . He was fitted for Yale College in the Hartford Grammar School , and entered the Sophomore Class in the autumn of 1802 , when fourteen years of age , - quite too young , as he afterwards thought . He was a universal favorite , while in his studies he was remarkably systematic . He displayed a strong taste for mathematics , and in English composition had no equal in his class . He graduated in 1805 with the highest honors , and soon entered the office of Hon. Chauncey Goodrich , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself diligently to legal studies . But law , although offering many attractions to his mind , was not destined to be his profession . His health failed before one year of study had elapsed , and he accepted the post of tutor in Yale College at the end of the second . He discharged the duties of his tutorship with honor to his College and himself for two years , devoting his leisure hours to English composition and literature , and acquiring a pure and transparent style . On leaving his Alma Mater for the second time , his health demanded active service , and by a large commercial house in New York he was offered a business commission which took him over the Alleghany Mountains , the journey invigorating his constitution , and proving profitable to his employers . Soon after his return he entered a counting-room , probably intending to devote his life to trade ; but , in the language of the work under review - " This was not the will of Providence . God had more important work for him to do ; a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other young man whose services could have been // secured . The great and only deficiency was , he had not yet given his heart to God . And just here it was that the Holy Spirit interposed to supply the deficiency ; opened his eyes to his guilty and lost condition , and , as he tremblingly hoped , brought him out of darkness into the light and liberty of the Gospel . He soon after made a public profession of his faith in Christ , and united with the First Congregational Church in Hartford , under the ministry of the IRev . Dr. Nathan Strong . " - p. 24 . In 1811 he entered the Andover Theological Seminary , passed through the prescribed course of studies , and took his diploma at the anniversary in 1814 . Now opens the most useful and interesting part of Gallaudet 's life . He was fitted to preach , and did preach , but the ministry was not to be his special mission , more than the law or commerce . About this time he became very much interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten years of age , whose misfortune had been caused by an attack of spotted fever when she was two years old . The house of her father , Dr. Cogswell , adjoined Gallaudet 's , and he thus had frequent opportunities of seeing the little mute . His benevolent disposition was deeply stirred by the unfortunate condition of his young friend , and he soon discoverdll that he was better able than any one else to communicate with her by signs . He taught her the names of persons and things by simple sentences , and these favorable beginnings induced her friends to hope that eventually she might be taught to read and write . Her father in the mean time was of course much interested in the system of instruction for the deaf and dumb as practised in Europe , and among other works which he perused was one by the Abb6 Sicard , the pupil and successor of the celebrated Abb6 de l'Ep√©e , and who perfected the sign language . Dr. Cogswell supposed that he would be obliged to send his daughter abroad for the needful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country for the instruction of mutes , and not a single individual who understood the foreign system . On further examination of the subject , it was found that a much greater number of the deaf and dumb were living in Connecticut than any one had imagined , and it was believed that enough might be found in the New England States to form a very large school . A number of benevolent individuals at once interested // themselves in the project ; but in the first place it was necessary that some one should visit Europe in order to qualify himself thoroughly for the task of instruction . Mr. Gallaudet was at once looked to as the man , and indeed no one else appears to have been thought of . " His fine education , gentlemanly manners , attractive social qualities , philosophical turn of mind , undoubted piety , and growing sympathy for the large class of deaf mutes , wholly uncared for in this country , recommended him as pre-eminently qualified for the task of pouring the light of a new being into their dark minds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hesitated for a short time about assuming this new responsibility ; but at length accepting the call , he was furnished with letters of introduction to many of the most distinguished philanthropists in Great Britain , as well as to the principals of the Deaf and Dumb schools in London and Edinburgh . He sailed from New York for Liverpool on the 25th of May , 1815 , and arrived at his destination after a pleasant passage of thirty days . It was hoped and expected that Mr. Gallaudet 's high testimonials would at once give him free access to the London and Edinburgh schools , in order that he might in a short time qualify himself for the office of tr* acher , and return to his own country ; but in this he was greatly disappointed . To an American for the first time going abroad , there is much in the European system of rigid exclusion which is peculiarly annoying . In his own free land he is at perfect liberty to visit , without showing passports or demanding permits , all the government buildings , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its mints , arsenals , dockyards , patent-office , its legislative chambers , and President 's house . In the same spirit , nearly all private establishments are open to his inspection . But in Europe he finds many objects of interest closed to him entirely , and for many more which he is allowed to see a permit is required , for which he is not infrequently made to pay , and , what is far more trying to an American , to wait also . Some of the picture-galleries , museums , and palaces are alone exceptions . It is also frequently remarked , that the professedly despotic governments , as France , Russia , Austria , and Naples , offer f*wer barriers to the researches of an intelli // gent traveller than England . There is in our mother country an inveterate prejudice against innovation , a blind reverence for old forms of red-tapism simply because they are old . The English people reform slowly , less on account of their dislike of imitating the improvements of other nations , than from the fear of destroying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Gallaudet now found that , although the schools of England and Scotland were private establishments , whose proprietors with one or two exceptions treated him courteously , they had bound themselves by rules and restrictions which virtually shut him out . They would receive him only on condition of his entering the lowest class as a pupil , to pass regularly through a course of three years . With such a requirement he was unwilling to comply , believing that he could thoroughly possess himself of the system of instruction in a much shorter time . He asked that he might be admitted to the London school for a few weeks only , on trial . His application was peremptorily refused ; he must serve three years or not at all . He passed six weeks in London in anxious suspense , referred by teachers to committees , and by committees back to teachers , the spirit manifested towards him being , to say the least , narrow and illiberal . He could , after all his efforts , only obtain leave to join the London school for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as assistant teacher for three years , unless the principal , Dr. Watson , saw fit to release him sooner as thoroughly qualified . This placed him entirely in Dr. Watson 's power , and he determined to apply in other quarters . So wholly devoted was he to his philanthropic purpose , that he scarce allowed himself any time for sight-seeing . To his active mind and cultivated taste the picture and sculpture galleries , the museums and libraries of London , would have offered inexhaustible pleasures . But , with stern selfdenial , he saw little of these , his whole time in the vast metropolis being busied with the great cause of his mission , while his thoughts turned fondly homeward upon those whose miseries he longed to alleviate . He left London on the 24th of August , 1815 , and three // days afterward reached Edinburgh . Here he was beset by the same difficulties which had baffled his efforts in the Southern capital . He became at once anxious to depart for Paris , where he could meet the Abb6 Sicard , but decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unsettled state of France . The great events which had followed the battle of Waterloo on the 18th of June , the flight , surrender , and exile of Napoleon , and the restoration of the Bourbons , took place just at the period of his arrival in England , and he wisely judged it inexpedient to visit the Continent until the new , or rather ancient , order of things should be fully established . He therefore remained in Edinburgh until the 12th of February , 1816 . His sojourn in England and Scotland made him acquainted with many distinguished men and women , who took a kind interest in his mission , and among those with whom he formed friendships may be mentioned Josiah Roberts , Robert Hall , Zachary Macaulay , father of the great historian , Dugald Stewart , Dr. Thomas Brown , Dr. Chalmers , Mrs. Grant , and Hannah More . At length Mr. Gallandet reached Paris , on the 9th of March , 1816 , bearing a letter from Mr. Macaulay to the Abb6 Sicard . The Abb6 , in strong contrast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cordial manner , promised him every facility , and was as good as his word . Mr. Gallaudet at once entered upon a regular course as pupil , and , notwithstanding his imperfect knowledge of the French language , made such rapid progress , that in three months , instead of three years , he had so far mastered the system as to be prepared to return to the United States , and place himself at the head of the proposed deaf-mute asylum . But as the branch of instruction for which he was now qualified was entirely new in America , and more than one teacher would be required for a successful beginning , it was necessary for him to find some competent assistant . One of the Abb6 Sicard 's principal aids was M. Laurent Clere , and , after some little negotiation , Mr. Gallaudet induced him to leave his native land , and go to America in his company , to become a teacher in the asylum . This gentleman is still attached to the institution in Hartford , where we saw him but a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackboard conversation , both in our bad French and in his good English . While Mr. Gallaudet was pursuing his inquiries and studies in Europe , the friends of the asylum were taking active steps to insure its success . In May , 1816 , the Legislature of Connecticut granted an act of incorporation , the institution being styled " The Connecticut Asylum for the Education of Deaf and Dumb Persons . " It could not , however , at once be opened , as it required some months to collect funds , and also to enlighten the public mind as to the practicability of the undertaking . Mr. Gallaudet on his return visited several of our large cities with this double object . lie was eminently successful , as he inspired confidence wherever he went , and on the 20th of April , 1817 , the asylum was opened . At first , only seven pupils were entered ; but before the end of the year , so successful was the experiment , that the number increased to thirty-three , and applications for admission came from all quarters . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , the directors had not sufficient funds to provide for those indigent mutes whose friends were unable to meet the cost of supporting them , and this sum was afterward expended in educating the needy pupils of the State alone . The principal building being completed and occupied , it was dedicated on the 22d of May , 1821 , 011 which occasion Mr. Gallaudet delivered an interesting and impressive discourse . Meanwhile the institution had continued to prosper , in the autumn of 1818 containing between fifty and sixty pupils . The salaries of the teachers , however , and other school expenses , much exceeded the income from tuition , and as charitable subscriptions could not always be relied on , it was determined to petition Congress for a grant of money or of land from the public domain . The petition , being drawn up and presented , was warmly advocated by the Connecticut delegation , and among others who greatly interested themselves in its favor was Mr. Clay , then Speaker of the House of Representatives . The reception and success of the petition present a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose land-bill for the benefit of the insane was vetoed by the late President . A grant of twentythree // thousand acres of land was obtained , the avails of which have constituted a large fund . Between the years 1825 and 1830 , the number of pupils increased from seventy to one hundred and forty , and Mr. Gallaudet had the satisfaction of seeing the institution placed upon a permanent basis , and continuing to enlarge its charities year by year . Not only did he give daily his personal aid in the arduous task of teaching , but , in order more effectually to inform a generous public of the progress of deaf-mute instruction , he visited most of the principal towns of New England with some of his pupils , giving such exhibitions as he thought were demanded to secure general confidence . Mr. Gallaudet 's incessant labors gradually wore upon his health , which at length imperatively demanded his resignation as principal of the asylum , and , after twelve years of most active service , a sense of duty to himself and to his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tender his resignation to the Board on the 25th of April , 1830 , and it was accepted . But although his official connection ' with the school was at an end , he never ceased to feel the deepest interest in its prosperity ; nor did he until the end of his days manifest less sympathy with many other benevolent associations . We must hurriedly pass over his connections with these , as the limits of this article will not permit us to enlarge upon them , and at the same time to refer again , as we purpose , to the subject of deaf-mute education . As soon as it was known that his duties with the asylum were about to cease , he received commuflications from philanthropic individuals and institutions in many quarters . He had always displayed a warm feeling in favor of the American Colonization Society , and he at once received solicitations from the officers of different branches in Connecticut , New York , New Jersey , and Pensylvania , to accept the office of agent , which , however , he felt obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New England Asylum for the Blind . His fame had gone abroad , and the trustees of this institution were exceedingly anxious that he should take charge of it , even before he left his post at Hartford . He also received pressing invitations from the New York University , Dartmouth College , the // Oneida Institute , the Utica Female Seminary , the High School of Burlington , New Jersey , the New York High School , the Cincinnati Seminary , and many others . It does not appear that Mr. Gallaudet had any fixed plan when he left the asylum beyond a strong desire to write books for children . Busy as he continued to be in his various avocations , he found time to write many of these , as well as numerous contributions on his favorite topic of deafmute instruction , for magazines , reviews , and the journals of the day . Eight years thus passed , and in 1838 he was solicited to accept the post of chaplain to the Insane Hospital at Worcester . Unwilling to leave his home , he declined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office at the Retreat in Hartford . Here he greatly interested himself in the condition of the insane , and , in the same benevolent spirit which he displayed in every action of his life , he thoroughly examined systems and modes of treatment , and made many valuable suggestions for the happiness and improvement of the victims of mental disease . His duties were faithfully performed until the summer of 1851 , although his health had sensibly failed for some time previous . In July of that year he was attacked with dysentery , from which he never recovered . He lingered until the 10th of September , and then peacefully closed his pure , faithful , and earnest life . In Hartford his death was deplored as a public calamity , and no funeral ceremony could ever have gathered together a company of more sincere mourners than the deafmutes who shared in his obsequies . The art of instruction for the deaf and dumb is almost entirely the result of the philanthropy of modern times . Before the Abb6 de l'Ep*e , various attempts had been made , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-grounded hope of success . The fate of those unfortunate beings , who from birth had been destitute of the sense of hearing , or who had lost it in infancy before the age of articulation , and consequently became dumb also , was peculiarly hard . Their minds were suffered to remain without culture , they were left to themselves , and shut out from the society of rational beings . Such unnatural prejudices were 45 * // formed against them , that in some countries it was the custom to destroy all infants who at three years of age remained incapable of speech and hearing . Even in France , the country in which deaf-mute instruction afterward most rapidly advanced , the birth of such children was accounted a family disgrace . Their animal existence was alone regarded ; they were rigidly secluded in some convent or asylum , left to the tender mercies of unfeeling keepers ; and , all desire of improvement being repressed , they gradually grew into the idiots they were deemed , and , if naturally gifted even with the powers of Shakespeare or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the first experimenters in deaf-mute instruction was Pedro de Ponce , a Benedictine monk of Leon , who lived about the middle of the sixteenth century . John Bonet , also a Spaniard , published the first known work on the subject , in 1620 . It was accompanied by a manual alphabet , from which the one now in use in Europe and America was derived . Other laborers followed , but little was done to attract public attention until the Abb6 de l'Ep√©e devoted his life to the relief of the unfortunate deaf and dumb . He was born in 1712 at Versailles , and was educated by his father , the king 's architect , during an irreligious age , in the fear of God , and taught to love his neighbor as himself . He entered the Church , but , being a Jansenist , met with much persecution , and remained poor to the end of his days . His benevolent spirit was ever zealous in its offices of charity , but it appears that accident first led him to the great work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters who were deaf and dumb resided with their mother in Paris . De l'Ep√©e had occasion to call at their house , when , learning that the mother was absent , he addressed some questions to the young ladies , and was surprised at receiving no answer to anything he said . The mother soon returned , and explained the apparent rudeness by a detail of their infirmity ; farther informing him that a kind friend , Fat her Fanin , had attempted to give them some instruction , but had died before his labors were crowned with success . IDe l'Ep√©e at once was interested for the poor women , and set himself to work in the endeavor to invent // some mode of communication with them . After long reflection , it struck him that language is but an assemblage of the signs , in the same manner as drawings are the representations , of numerous objects . He also remembered the principle laid down by his tutor , a good metaphysician , " that there is no more natural connection between metaphysical ideas and the articulated sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the written characters which strike the eye . " Why might he not therefore frame a language of gestures , as signs to meet the eye , to serve instead of a language of words ? In his essays with his pupils he met with many disappointments . He showed them letters which he taught them to imitate , but nothing like ideas reached their minds ; the teaching was purely mechanical . He had indeed invented gestures to correspond with every sound in the language ; but the medium of communication was still wanting , and he was as if striving to teach a language by a grammar in that same language , every syllable of which was unknown to the pupils . He taught them at length even to transcribe whole pages of abstruse disquisitions , but appears to have deceived himself as to the real amount of knowledge he imparted . He was in truth somewhat in the position of Egyptologists , prior to the decipherment of hieroglyphics ; he had discovered the Rosetta stone of the deaf-mute language , but it was reserved for the Abb6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligible to others . The language of IDe l'Ep√©e himself , on complimenting Sicard for his improvements on his own system , was , " Mon ami , j'ai trouv6 le verre , c'est * vous d'en faire les lunettes . " We can not enter into any detail of the Abb6 Sicard 's system , which would require a paper specially devoted to it ; but while he retained the plan of artificial signs contrived by IDe l'Ep√©e , he soon found that the intellectual education of his pupils should be the chief object , and in order to attain this end he struck out for himself a new path . The object of his first lessons was to teach his pupils the relation between the names of objects and the objects themselves , and thus he gradually proceeded to the comprehension of abstract ideas . His system has been eminently successful , and at // the present time well-educated deaf mutes are as capable of understanding the most subtile metaphysical distinctions , as of comprehending any of the ordinary phases of material life . From personal experience and reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of articulation to the deaf and dumb . Mr. Gallaudet coincided in his views , and placed the greatest reliance on the language of natural signs , which he contended is universal . Some of his papers on the subject are exceedingly curious and entertaining . He thinks that this sign-language might be generally used by missionaries in foreign lands , as a means of communicating with the heathen , in a very much shorter time than that usually spent in the necessary study of their languages before they can be instructed in Christian precepts . In the summer of 1818 , a young Chinese passed through Hartford , and spent an evening with Mr. Gallaudet . He was so ignorant of the English language that he could not express in it his simplest wishes . Mr. Gallaudet introduced him to M. Clerc , a deaf mute from birth , who did not know a single word of Chinese . No two persons , therefore , could possibly be brought together more completely disqualified for colloquial intercourse . The result , however , surprised all present . M. Clero learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents and their family , his occupations at home , and his ideas of God and a future state . By the aid of proper signs , also , M. Clerc ascertained the meaning of about twenty Chinese words . So remarkable was Mr. Gallaudet 's success in the signlanguage , as frequently to astonish strangers , and we quote an extract from his Memoir in his own words , in illustration of his skill . One of his pupils was a lad of much intelligence , with whom he made frequent experiments to ascertain how far he could communicate ideas to him without the use of words spelled to him on the fingers , or of any signs made by the arms and hands , but solely by expressions of the face , motions of the head , and attitudes of the body . " One day our distinguished and lamented historical painter , Colonel John Trumbull , was in my school-room during the hours of instruction , and on my alluding to the tact which the pupil referred to had of reading // my face , he expressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select any event in Greek , Roman , English , or American history , of a scenic character , which would make a striking picture on canvas , and said I would endeavor to communicate it to the lad . Tell him , ' said he , that Brutus ( Lucius Junius ) condemned his two sons to death for resisting his authority and violating his orders . ' " I folded my arms in front of me , and kept them in that position , to preclude the possibility of making any signs or gestures , or of spelling any words on my fingers , and proceeded , as best I could , by the expression of my countenance , and a few motions of my own head and attitudes of the body , to convey the picture in my own mind to the mind of my pupil . It ought to be stated that he was already acquainted with the fact , being familiar with the leading events in Roman history . But when I began , he knew not from what portion of history , sacred or profane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this wide range , my delineation on the one hand , and his ingenuity on the other , had to bring it within the division of Roman history , and , still more minutely , to the particular individual transaction designated by Colonel Trumbull . In carrying on the process , I made no use whatever of any arbitrary or conventional look , motion , or attitude , before settled between us , by which to let him understand what I wished to communicate , with the exception of a single one , if , indeed , it ought to be considered such . " The usual sign at the time , among teachers and pupils , for a Roman , was portraying an aquiline nose by placing the forefinger , crooked , in front of the nose . As I was prevented from using my finger in this way , and having considerable command over the muscles of my face , I endeavored to give my nose as much of the aquiline form as possible , and succeeded well enough for my purpose . Everything else that I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind spontaneously endeavored to convey its thoughts and feelings to his mind by the varied expressions of the countenance , some motions of the head , and attitudes of the body . It would be difficult to furnish the reader anything like a complete analysis of the process which I pursued in making the communication . To be understood , it ought to be witnessed , and accompanied with the requisite explanations . The outlines of the process , however , I can give . They were the following : - " A stretching and stretching gaze eastward , with an undulating motion of the head , as if looking across and beyond the Atlantic Ocean , to denote that the event happened , not on the western , but on the eastern continent . This was making a little progress , as it took the subject // out of the range of American history . A turning of the eyes upward and backward , with frequently repeated motions of the head backward , as if looking a great way back in past time , to denote that the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nose , already referred to , indicating that a Roman was the person concerned . It was , of course , an old Roman . Portraying , as well as I could , by my countenance , attitude , and manner , an individual high in authority , and commanding others as if he expected to be obeyed . Looking and acting as if I were giving out a specific order to many persons , and threatening punishment on those who should resist my authority - even the punishment of death . " Here was a pause in the progress of events , which I denoted by sleeping as it were during the night and awaking in the morning , and doing this several times , to signify that several days had elapsed . Looking with deep interest and surprise , as if at a single person standing before me , with an expression of countenance indicating that he had violated the order which I had given , and that I knew it . Then looking in the same way at another person near him as also guilty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - then hesitation , accompanied with strong conflicting emotions , producing perturbation , as if I knew not how to feel , or what to do . Looking first at one of the persons before me , and then at the other , and then at both together , as a father would look , indicating his distressful parental feelings under such affecting circumstances . Composing my feelings , showing that a change was coming over me , and exhibiting toward the imaginary persons before me the decided look of the inflexible commander who was determined and ready to order them away to execution . Looking and acting as if the tender and forgiving feelings of the father had again got the ascendency , and as if I were about to relent and pardon them . These alternating states of mind I portrayed several times , to make my representation the more graphic and impressive . At length the father yields , and the stern principle of justice , as expressed in my countenance and manner , prevails . My look and action denote the passing of the sentence of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution . " Before I had quite completed the process , I perceived from the expression of his countenance , and a little of impatience in his manner , that the pupil felt satisfied that he was fully in possession of the fact which I was endeavoring to communicate . But , for the sake of greater certainty , I detained his attention till I had nothing more to portray . He quickly turned round to his slate , and wrote a correct and complete account of this story of Brutus and his two sons . " - pp. 198-202. // The services of Mr. Gallaudet were not forgotten by his pupils after his connection with the asylum had ceased ; and not long after his death the " Gallaudet Monument Association " was formed , for the purpose of erecting some suitable memorial in his honor . With true earnestness of purpose , the association determined that no subscriptions should be received excepting from deaf mutes , although the citizens of Hartford generally would have freely contributed . The proposal was gladly met by the deaf and dumb in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means wealthy , but they cheerfully gave from their little , and the result is one of the most elegant monuments of its size in the United States . The same rule that limited the subscriptions was applied as far as possible in the construction of the work , so that it should be the sole product of deaf-mute labor . It stands within the grounds of the asylum , and in front of the building , - an obelisk and base of pure white marble , about twenty feet in height . Besides the usual inscriptions commemorative of the deceased , the south panel is decorated with a beautiful bass-relief ( the work of Mr. Carlin , adeaf mute ) , representing Mr. Gallaudet in the act of teaching the manual alphabet to little children . The attitudes and expressions of the figures are exceedingly natural and graceful . Above this panel , on the shaft , is the Syro-Chaldaic word " Ephphatha , " and on another side of the column the name of Gallaudet in the letters of the manual alphabet . The entire cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 6th of September , 1854 , in the presence of many hundreds of deaf mutes , it was formally inangnrated , with appropriate ceremonies . Surely that man is entitled to our love and veneration , who , had he accomplished nothing else in life , raised up the deaf and dumb from the position of outcasts , to take their places in the great human family as intelligent and thinking beings . As a Christian philanthropist the name of Gallaudet will ever be remembered , andwe of this century can point with pride to the noble institution of which he was the chief ornament . To those who leave its walls , even with all the aid of modern art in teaching them , many of the pleasures of this world are denied . All // the varied and exquisite delights of sound they never know ,  - -  neither the charms of instrumental music , nor the far sweeter tones of human voices . They may enjoy the sparkle , but not the murmur , of the nil ; the plumage of the bird , but not its song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its thunders . Yet they can share human love and sympathy , can labor happily and usefully , can appropriate the consolations of literature , and the richer promises of religious faith . In patient hope , they wait the dawning of that day when they shall hear and answer the summons to immortal life . @
