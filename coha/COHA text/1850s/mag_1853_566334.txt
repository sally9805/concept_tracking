txt ART . VIL-DANJEL WEBSTER . A Discourse delivered before the Faculty , &amp;udents and Alumni of Dartmouth College , on the day preceding Commencement , July 27 , 1853 , commemorative of Daniel Webster . By Rurus CHOATE . Boston and Cambridge : James Munroe &amp; Co. 1853 . IT is now more than a year since Mr. Webster left us to return not " until the heavens be no more . " His death called forth such an universal and profound sorrow , as surprised even his friends . The national grief has been expressed in every appropriate way-by the booming cannon and the tolling bell , the funeral service and the commemorative discourse . Our publications* from the daily journal to the quarterly review , have teemed with biographical notices , criticisms , and eulogies . Some have uttered praise without measure , some have censured without discrimination , a few have tempered eulogy with truth . Several circumstances having prevented us at the time from joining in this general expression of feeling and opinion , we take the opportunity afforded by the publication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record some account of the life and opinions of the great New Englander , and to give our views of him as a man and a statesman . As it does not fall within our plan to make any farther use of the discourse of Mr. Choate , at the present time , we take the occasion to express the opinion , that it will add to his already well-established , but growing reputation . Great as he is , and great as he is admitted to be , by his countrymen , there is , we believe , a wider and more enduring fame for him , than is expected by many of his admirers . Even some of his best qualities are often overlooked , as when , being dazzled by the reflection of sun-light , we quite forget that the rays come from the polished surface of solid metal . In the blaze of his imagination , we are apt not to see how broad and robust is his understanding , and how keen is the vision of his reason . What we mean was happily expressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech delivered in the recent Constitutional Convention of Massachusetts . " Many compliments , " said Mr. Dana , " have been paid to that distinguished gentleman , in this House , for his beauty of fancy , wealth of language , and charm of manner . These expressions are naturally drawn from those who have // heard and studied him but little . But I can say that it is the opinion of those who have heard him most , know him best , and studied him the longest  --  the judges on the bench and his brethren at the bar-that but for these fascinations , he would be recognized at first by all , as he is by them , as the greatest master of logic we have amongst us . " But we must hasten to our task , and we do so expressing in the meantime our hope , that Mr. Choate will soon favor the public with a collected edition of his various publications . In one of the books of Samuel , there is a long list of the names of the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom are spoken of as " the three chief mighty men . " Our national annals will furnish a similar example . In our contemporary history , we can name many eminent men who have recently passsd off the stage , or who yet fill stations of trust and honor . Generals , naval heroes and statesmen , judges , poets , historians and divines , pass before us in grave procession . Our eyes linger on the forms of Kent and Story , of Emmons , Channing and Stuart , of Allston and Cooper , of Jackson and of Taylor . And there is yet another , whose career of public service began under the administration of Washington , was continued with increasing honor under every successive president , until he occupied the office of chief magistrate , and under the dome of the capitol , drew to a close most glorious and hallowed by the out-gushing plaudits of a mighty nation , as his remains were borne to the ancestral resting-place at Quincy . But still there were three men , in our time , who for their intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen , towered over all others , " proudly eminent . " In a generation prodigal of distinguished men , Webster , Calhoun , and Clay , stood out distinctly from all the rest as men of special mark ; and of these three , the first , like Adino the Eznite , was chief . Among the others he x**as facile princeps , although he took the highest seat , not without a tremendous effort , but still triumphantly . Nor from that lofty eminence shall the course of time , nor the capricious turns of public opinion , ever cast him down . These three men were born not far from the same time ; one in Virginia , another in South Carolina , and the third in New Hampshire . They all entered public life while young , continued in it through a prolonged life , and retired from the scene just after that great epoch in our history , when an empire on the Pacific coast was added to the list of the free States . Mr. Clay was the child of a poor man , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons of affluence in his native State were accustomed to enjoy ; and that State itself has never been a good mother to her poorer children . At an early age he entered a lawyer 's office as a copyist and clerk ; but the liveliness of his parts and the resoluteness of his character , recommended him to Chancellor Wythe , who advised him to study law . Accordingly he fitted for the bar , and removed to Kentucky , which was then filling up with settlers from Virginia . Thus the North . the South , and the young West were supplied each with a worthy champion . Rising rapidly at the bar , and in the councils of his adopted State , he was transferred to the great arena of the United States Senate , almost as soon as his age permitted him to take a seat in that august body . After a short term of service , he was elected to the House , and was immediately chosen Speaker . By one bound he sprang to the first position in the House , and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ambassador , an executive officer , a lawyer , and an orator . he acquitted himself so as to acquire and maintain a reputation and an influence almost unparalleled in the history of our public men . Bold , fiery , proud , self-willed , but frank , chivalrous , and affable , he was fitted to impress and move masses of men ; whilst his power over individuals was almost irresistible . He was formed by nature to win the popular heart , and perhaps nothing but his known eagerness to reach the presidency , prevented that consummation of his hopes . He died on the field of his greatest triumphs , and his body was followed through populous cities and across great States , by the representatives of a mourning nation . Mr. Calhoun was born in circumstances which enabled him to obtain the best education the country could afford . He graduated at Yale College , and the burning ambition which glowed in spite of the frosts of age was even then discernible by the keen eye of President Dwight , who remarked of him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the once celebrated law school of Litchfield , he obtained that legal knowledge which was necessary to fit him for public service . Returning home , he was soon sent to Washington as a member of the House , and in that body he met , among other men of rising reputation , those two intellectual giants , who afterwards divided with him , the admiration of the American people . As a member of Congress , as Vice President , and as a cabinet officer , he took the first rank . No one ever despised him . He seemed to be above the weaknesses of his great rivals , for he betrayed neither passion in debate , nor luxurious habits in convivial hours . A man of earnest purpose , of un // common energy , and of unconquerable resolution , he drew a large section of country after him ; but becoming a sectional man in middle life , he lost the favor and the suifrages , though not the admiration , of the whole Union . With him , and the great Kentuckian , Mr. Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at others , in stern conflict . The two first had the start of the latter in being known to the nation , and in being on the popular side , which originated and sustained the last war with Great Britain ; but the Titanic son of the White Mountains soon showed himself to the great public in his vast proportions . The relative position of these distinguished rivals , may be given in the language of a foreign Review , which coining from beyond the ocean , may sound more like the voice of posterity . Speaking of the forthcoming Works of these statesmen , it proceeds as follows : " Clay 's speeches disappoint , and whoever reads them is astonished that so little thought has been evolved by a person so celebrated and powerful , while the student of Webster is amazed that the reputation and authority supported by such an intelligence have not overspread his country . The secret is one of character ; the Kentucky senator had tact and an indomitable will , but the wisdom of the late Secretary of State , however practical in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities , so indispensable to the ambitious politician . For more than twenty years , Mr. Webster was constantly opposed by Mr Calhoun , the champion of state rights , of slavery , and of free trade ; and the occasional conflicts of these two illustrious men , mark the epochs in the history of the Senate . But nothing is more certain , though the south will hardly admit it , than that Mr. Calhoun was the least powerful dialectician . His chain of argumentation was , to Webster 's , as shining tissues of attenuated glass , to the large , close-twisted , glittering strands of steel , with which the expounder of the constitution ' supported himself , and bound his antagonists . " Turning from this brief glance at the " three mighty men** of our own time , in their relations to each other , we will now direct more particular attention to the career and character of him who was , at least , primus inter pares , and as it seems to us , by far the greatest in the elements which form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Salisbury , N. H. , in the early part of the year 1782 , just as the war of the Revolution was drawing to a close , and the mother country was making up its mind to acknowledge our independence . He attended the common school in his native town ; continued his education // in the family of Rev. Mr. Wood of Boscawen ; finished preparation for College at the celebrated Academy at Exeter , where he was appreciated by his tutor , the admirable Buckminster ; entered Dartmouth College in 1797 , and took his degree in regular course , in the summer of 1801 , when in his twentieth year . During a portion of the years 1801 and 1802 , he studied law in Fryeburg , Me. , teaching an Academy at the same time ; in 1804 he pursued his legal studies under the direction of Hon. Christopher Gore , afterwards Governor of Massachusetts ; and after practicing as a lawyer a shOrt time in Boscawen , he removed , in 1807 , to Portsmouth , then the leading town of the State . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Common Pleas for Hilisborough County , being determined , as he said , to use his tongue rather than his pen , in court . He was married in 1805 to Miss Grace Fletcher , daughter of Rev. Mr. Fletcher , of Hopkinton , N. H. , a lady remarkable for her many virtues , and capable of adorning any station to which the rising fortunes of her husband might introduce her . In 1813 , he was elected to Congress , and took his seat in the extra session of that year , where he found Mr. Clay in the chair , and such men as Calhoun , Forsyth , Grundy , Gaston , and Pickering , in the seats around him . His first speech was delivered on the 10th of June , and immediately gave him a reputation , making a sudden and indelible impression upon older and more experienced men . By a reelection , he was continued in Congress until 1816 , when he removed to Boston , rather than the capital of the Empire State . No one can tell how much depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what his fate might have been , if escaping from the seductions of Boston , and the suspicion of being the agent of the commercial and manufacturing interests , he had been led to seek popular sympathy in the great State of New York . Before 1820 , he had been urged to become a candidate for Congress from Boston , had been offered a seat in the Senate of the United States , had served a short time in the Legislature of his adopted State , and had been a presidential elector . He was a member of the Constitutional Convention of Massachusetts , in 1820 , and we have been told by a gentleman who was familiar with the men and events of that time , that though he was one of the youngest , he was the most powerful speaker in that body . A learned judge was asked why he did not reply to an attack on one of his favorite provisions . " What is the use , " said he , " of en. - countering a man , all whose words come with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1822 , to enter Con* gress again , where he continued in the lower House until 1827 , // when he entered the Senate . During fourteen eventful years , his services and his oratory made his name familiar as a household word to all his countrymen . He visited England in 1839 , while a Senator , where he was received with distinguished respect . We can not resist the temptation to break the thread of our narrative , and introduce an anecdote belonging to this period of Mr. Webster 's life . Our informant was a Virginia gentleman , who had traveled much in Europe . We shall let him speak in the first person . Said he , " I was taught to have a strong prejudice against Mr. Webster personally , and as a New England man , supposed to be opposed to the policy of the South . Besides I was a State's-rights man and a nullifier , of the school of Mr. Calhoun , and therefore held the political sentiments of Mr. Webster in detestation . Being in England in 1838-9 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on account of the Canada difficulties , I was exposed to continual insults wherever I appeared in public . We Americans could scarcely get a civil answer to a question , and were everywhere objects of dislike . At this time , Mr. Webster arrived in London , and was at once made a lion of by all classes . The great American filled the public mind ; there was an instantaneous change of feeling , and every citizen of the United States sojourning there , was congratulated on being a fellow-countryman with him . My prejudices melted away like morning frost , and I could have hugged him with pride and gratitude . And farther , " he continued , " I afterward traveled in italy , the finest country in Europe , and filled with the most intellectual people . Capable of forming one of the greatest of European States , but all broken up into little kingdoms and principalities , by reason of tenacity for State rights and local independence ; and rendered thoroughly contemptible by reason of disunion and consequent weakness , they taught me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the defender of the Constitution . " In 1841 , Mr. Webster became Secretary of State by the invitation of Gen. Harrison , in which office he continued under Mr. Tyler , until some time in 1843 , when the project of withdrawing Texas from Mexico , and other questionable measures , induced him to retire . In 1845 , he re*ntered the Senate , and continued there until called by Mr. Fillmore to the first office in his gift , in the latter part of the year 1850 , where he remained until his death , on the 24th day of October , 1852 . Such is a brief chronological view of the leading points in the life of Daniel Webster . We now turn to his career as a public man . // Mr. Webster always belonged to the same political party , though called by different names , as federal , national i*epublican , and whig ; and he was always a champion of his party in relation to the great questions which successively divided the opinions of his countrymen . Many questions come up which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the support or opposition of men without regard to party lines . It is our intention , in the first place , to refer to Mr. Webster 's connection with questions of the former class . When he first entered the national councils , war was already raging between this country and Great Britain . In common with the party to which he belonged , he was opposed to that war , believing it to be unnecessary , and therefore wrong , because an unnecessary war is one of the greatest of crimes . In this opinion there is a growing unanimity of sentiment , and probably nothing but the brilliant successes of our arms , on the sea and on the land , saved the abettors of that contest from political ruin . It is now known that the declaration of war was urged forward contrary to the wishes of Mr. Madison , and the older and wiser friends of his administration , by the fiery ardor of Mr. Clay , Mr. Calhoun , and other young men , who were anxious to redress real or supposed insults to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by raising the cry of war . If ambition entered into their motives in engaging in that course , they had reason to rue the day they forced the reluctant president to let slip the dogs of war ; for one of the heroes of that war , in after years broke them both down , and trampled their favorite measures in the dust ; while the other secured the nomination over Mr. Clay , and was borne triumphantly to that position which for many years had drawn the longing gaze of the gallant orator of the West . But for that war , there would have been no hero of Tippecanoe ; no hero of New Orleans ; and but for these heroes , the way to the presidency would have been open to one or both of these belligerent statesmen . Thus do the sins of men return to plague the inventors . This war never received the favor of Mr. Webster , though he offered no factious opposition to it in Congress . He rather labored to regulate and bring it , as speedily as possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memorable fact that one of the most prominent reasons given for the declaration of war , was not even noticed in the treaty of peace . The British government did not yield the point respecting the impressment of seamen ; " free trade and sailors ' rights " were unguarded as before ; and so continued , until Mr. Webster , in the correspondence with Lord Ashburton , during // the pendency of the celebrated treaty of Washington , signed in 1842 , compelled the ambassador , by an irresistible argument , to admit that the ancient position of his government , relating to this subject , would never be enforced again . It is well known that the Seminole war , which the South enforced on Mr. Van Buren , for the purpose of recovering a few fugitive slaves , and breaking up a lurking place for others , met his steady opposition . And it is equally certain that he was opposed to the recent contest with Mexico , and to all the causes which led to it . But here came out , what appears to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war was entered upon , his opposition ceased , and his only aim was to bring it to a termination in a manner which would be glorious to our arms . A few men , among whom was the veteran Adams , and the majority of the Massachusetts delegation , voted against raising money or troops for carrying on the war , and insisted that as we were the aggressors , it was our duty to withdraw our army , and make reparation for the injury already done . It is understood that Mi ' . Webster dissented from this righteous and morally honorable policy , and advised that the blame of the war should be fastened on the administration ; but since it was begun , it should be fought through . This was a clear case of policy against right ; and what made it worse , many men who were opposed to the war , voted to raise large bodies of men to carry it on with vigor , though they complained that the bill authorizing the levy of troops contained a monstrous falsehood-a falsehood so transparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remark , that he would sooner have his arm severed at the shoulder , than raise his hand in favor of the bill that contained it . However , this may be said in behalf of the great northern statesman , that he never plunged the nation into a war , that he never advised war ; and that he sought peace with Mexico without endeavoring to dismember her territory . Indeed he went so far on this latter point , that he made determined opposition to the treaty of peace , because it secured to us the vast territories of New Mexico and California . The reason given was , that the accession of so much territory would introduce new agitations , derange the existing relations of the States , and lead to the ultimate ruin of our government . He is therefore entitled to the high praise of being a politician who ardently desired peace ; but this credit is to be qualified by the fact that he lacked the moral energy to oppose the continuance of a war when it had engaged the support of the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Tariff was a great // and agitating question . At the close of the war , a new system of duties had to be levied , to enable our treasury to pay off the national debt ; while , at the same time , the long interruption of commerce had compelled the people of New Eng4and , and some other States , to turn their attention to manufactures . To meet this state of things , Mr. Clay brought forward his plan of a tariff , as part of a comprehensive scheme , called the American System . At this time , the cities of the North were eager to re*ngage in the commerce which had been the source of their wealth before the war , and they looked with jealousy upon any *measure that would have a tendency to cripple corninerce . It was feared by them that a high system of duties would , in the first place , prevent the importation of goods , and so turn their ships into worthless hulks ; and secondly , that it would raise up such a system of home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerable part of foreign commerce . What then would become of the seaports ? Grass would grow on the wharves of Boston , while the vessels rotted to pieces in the docks . Capital must seek new investments , at great risks , such as always attend the beginning of new enterprises ; or else it must seek another field for its use , to the great loss of the Eastern States . These things sound strange in the year of grace , 1853 , but they were no trifles then . Mr. Webster sympathized with those who entertained these views and feelings ; besides , he did not believe New England would be improved , intellectually and morally , by the introduction of a numerous factory population . At that time the idea that the proprietors were under obligation to regard the highest weliare of the operatives was not so well understood as at present , when some of our factory villages are among the best communities in the land . A meeting of the citizens of Boston was called in opposition to the new policy , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking ground against the doctrine of protection , and , if we mistake not , maintaining that it was unconstitutional . He was in favor of modified freetrade . In 1824 , he voted against the tariff act , in company with the delegation from his State . But by 182* , the people of the Eastern States had so adjusted themselves to the new policy , that he deemed it his duty to give his support to the modified bill of that session . From that time his course was consistent to the end in relation to the tariff policy . At this point of time , there was a change in his action , but it seems to be accounted for and justified by the altered condition of the country , and the new investments which had been made of capital . The lesson had been learned and demonstrated by // capitalists , that commerce and manufactures together would enable cities to grow , and cause wealth to increase , with accelerated rapidity . Henceforth , therefore , Mr. Webster may be regarded as a tariff man , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , if any , confidence in the compromise measure of W32 , and desirous of having the whole subject removed from the interference of Congress , and left to the treaty-making power . On this important subject public men have often been found on both sides , at different periods of their life ; and the same thing may be expected hereafter . There is a temporary lull in the agitation , but the question will come up again for discussion and settlement . The fact is , that all civilized States are fast drifting towards the policy of absolute free trade , to the overthrow of the whole custom house and bonded warehouse system . At the same time , it is the dream of folly for a nation to formally abandon the policy of protection . A branch of business which is conducive to national welfare , may need encouragement and protection until it is sufficiently established to maintain itself . No nation possessing common sense would ever deprive itself of the power to protect its interests , and bring out its resources by the encouragement of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is advancing , protection-whether incidental or positive-will never be abandoned for any great length of time . How these apparently antagonistic principles may be reconciled , need not be pointed out at the present time . The future will take care of itself , and when the enormous waste caused by duties on importations shall be saved , there will be ways and means for protecting necessary branches of industry until they acquire strength enough to stand alone . We only allude to the subject to show that this tariff policy is not settled , as some seem to think , and to prove that Mr. Webster was quite as consistent in his course in relation to this matter , as the majority of his distinguished contemporaries . His connection with the policy of a national bank derives its chief interest from the great debates which grew out of it in the contest between the executive and the bank itself . Questions of power arose , and claims were made by President Jackson which were resisted by the first men of the nation ; and though that determined man carried his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as that particular institution was concerned , yet it is quite clear he exercised power with a high hand , and in a manner that deserved the powerful senatorial rebuke which it received . The old bank , established according to the plan of Hamilton , had wound up its concerns , when Mr. // Webster was in Congress from New Hampshire , and the democratic party , which had originally been its opponent , was inclined to resist a re-charter , or the erection of a new institution . However , a bill was introduced by thb recommendation of Mr. Dallas , the democratic Secretary of the Treasury . " It required the reservation of a Bank capital of fifty millions of dollars ; of which only five millions were to be in specie , and the remainder in the depreciated Government securities ; with an obligation to lend thirty millions for the use of the Treasury . " A bill , with these provisions , passed the Senate , and came to the House , where it met the persistent opposition of Mr. Webster . He denounced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in securing its defeat . A new project , creating a real specie-paying bank , met his approval , and passed the House . It was vetoed by the President ; but in a subsequent session a bill was carried , creating the second United States Bank , which received the signature of a democratic executive . In later times , the same party changed ground , and refused , first by its President , and afterwards by a majority of Congress , to continue such an institution . In relation to this matter , Mr. Webster appears to have been uniformly consistent ; though in the year 1842-3 , he did not think it advisable to force Mr. Tyler to sign a charter for a new Bank . Gen. Harrison was dead , but a large majority of his supporters were in both Houses . Mr. Clay assumed the lead of the party , determined to dictate to the administration , if he could not nominally be called its chief . He had seen his favorite measures cast out by Gen. Jackson , and was eager for the triumph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading minds of the party thought a bank could safely be dispensed with . But his will was up ; a bill was passed , creating a new bank , and sent to the President . It was vetoed , and the whole policy had finally to be abandoned . Mr. Webster then called a meeting of the first men of the party , at his house , to persuade them to hold on to Mr. Tyler , and let the bank go ; saying , they still had an opportunity of seeing the substantial fruits of a Whig victory , if they would be wise and moderate . But the edict had gone forth ; Mr. Clay was determined that the President should yield , or be broken down . iTnwise anger overruled the calm , far-seeing wisdom of the Secretary of State , and the President was denounced as an enemy of the party that placed him in power . The event showed that the unyielding Kentuckian had taken counsel of his passions instead of his reason , and in consequence , a triumphant party soon melted away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands // of Mr. Polk . During these struggles , Mr. Webster fell under the suspicion of great numbers of the party , because he continued in the Cabinet . And yet , there is scarcely an act in his life that is capable of a clearer and more honorable vindication . He had great duties to perform as a negotiator , in settling the northeastern boundary , in closing up disputes with Great Britain , and in determining questions of national law . And we have always admired his noble bearing , when he met his fellowcitizens of Boston , in September , 1843 , under an implied censure , because he had held the office of Secretary of State so long under Mr. Tyler . A hint was given that he must take care of his reputation and honor ; and a desire was expressed to know what he was going to do . In replying , all the lion in him spoke out . " I am , " said he , " exactly of the Mayor 's opinion . I am quite of opinion that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am to bear the consequences of the decision , I had a great deal better be trusted to make it . No man feels more highly the advantage of the advice of friends than I do ; but on a question so delicate and important as that , I like to choose myself the friends who are to give me advice ; and upon this subject , gentlemen , I shall leave you as enlightened as I found you . " He went on to speak of the " out-pouring of wrath , " which had been hurled at him , for maintaining his post , and not running at the nod of the dictator in the Senate , and intimated that " he was a little hard to coax , but as to being driven , that was out of the question . " But time presses , and it must suffice to remark , that his advice , if followed , might , perhaps , have saved the party ; while the management of his great rival , drove it upon certain ruin . The Bank is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be revived again . A derangement of the currency , which is liable to happen every few years , may call up the whole furious agitation of former years , and compel the government to establish a bank , or issue paper of its own in the shape of Treasury notes . And whenever this question shall come up again , no writings will be more consulted than the speeches of Daniel Webster . Twenty-five years ago , one of the great questions of policy was Internal Improvements ; and on this policy Mr. Webster agreed with Mr. Adams . Nor did he ever change his views in relation to this subject , though he saw other men , who , like Mr. Calhoun , entered public life with him , become the advocates of a narrower policy . It is sometimes said that this policy of internal improvements has failed , and that Mr. Webster , in this respect , as in others , was an unsuccessful statesman . Like many other remarks about him , there is but a fraction of truth vot. xt. 78 // in this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the masses of the people than that of encouraging the extension of railroads and canals , by the aid of the general government . So strong is this feeling , that men who have openly opposed the policy , have been forced to yield , and by an indirect mode , to build up what they once endeavored to destroy . They have adopted the ingenious device of giving alternate sections of land to railroad corporations , instead of giving them land , or the proceeds of land , lying elsewhere . To this democratic device , Mr. Webster was never obliged to resort . The public lands are so intimately connected with this subject , that this is the place to speak of his views with regard to a proper disposal of them . In his earlier years in Congress , he favored the plan of Mr. Clay . In 1829 , he suggested the resolution offered by Mr. Foote , which brought on the great debate in the course of which , Col. ilayne met with such a signal overthrow . But within three or four years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any land bill that has ever been passed . Its object was to give the public lands , in conveniently small sections , to all actual settlers . This policy would remove the foreigners from our Atlantic coast ; force them from the servility of menial service ; take them away from the control of their priests ; make them independent freeholders ; and fill up the new territories with a population that would be sure to form free States . This far-seeing and magnificent plan will yet be embodied in a law , and its beneficient results will secure the admiration and gratitude of coming generations . Would God that its author could have left the infamous fugitive slave law alone , and directed his matchless powers to the securing of this great object ! The recollection of it , on his death-bed , would have been a joy without any sorrow , and he would never have been forced to acknowledge of it , as of the other , that he had made a mistake . The contest of Mr. Webster with the nullifiers of South Carolina lasted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Senator Foote 's resolutions , and ending with the unanswerable reply to Mr. Calhoun , which drew from Mr. Madison , the author of the famous resolutions of 1798 , in favor of State-rights , a strong expression of his approbation . In a letter to Mr. Webster , he says : " I return my thanks , &amp;c. for the copy of your late very powerful speech in the Senate of the United States . It crushes nullification , ' and must hasten the abandonment of secession . " This extract gives the sentiment of the great mass of the nation at that time , and ever since . The debates of those days did much to settle the meaning // of the Constitution ; and it will not be disputed that Mr. Webster raised himself to be considered its ablest interpreter and defender . Above lawyers , statesmen , and judges , he fixed its meaning with regard to the rights of the States , and the powers of the general government . General Jackson , Mr. Livingston , and the other leading men of the democratic party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal teacher ; and they followed his counsels with the confidence of docile pupils . That was a proud day for the northern champion , when the Proclamation of General Jackson against South Carolina appeared , based as it was upon the reasonings with which he had filled the public mind . Then , though he sat not in the executive mansion , he ruled the country , forcing the whole government in the direction of his judgment and determination . His name is inseparably and most honorably connected with one of the most important events-probably the most trying event in our history since the government was formed . He will be considered the defender of the Constitution , in a time of extreme peril , as long as that institution exists ; and if even that perishes , the fame of his oratory and his power will survive . How vain is it then to speak of him , as-in comparison with some other men-an unsuccessful statesman ! Mr. Webster 's connection with the acquisition of Texas , and subsequently of other Mexican territory , opens a new chapter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with mingled admiration and grief . It is known that he left the Cabinet of Mr. Tyler chiefly because he would not consent to the policy of acquiring Texas , in any manner . He feared the consequences of taking such a step . He foresaw that it would reopen the question of slavery , and lead to the dangerous agitation that preceded the Missouri compromise . He had always been strenuously opposed to the erection and admission of new slave States , and preferred to have the territory already possessed , filled up and cultivated , before adding to our wide domain . In accordance with these views , he made a speech in Niblo 's Garden , in 1837 , which contained admirable sentiments on the subject of slavery , and which warned the coun-try to resist all farther attempts to acquire new slave territory . In 1845 , he prepared resolutions which were passed at an antiTexas meeting ; and he wrote to some of his friends urging them to arouse themselves against the Texan policy . But here he faltered . The merchants of Boston , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " resisted him , and he went off , complaining that the north could not be aroused ; that Massachusetts could not be aroused . Here was a fatal mistake , // committed by leaning to the opinion of a few wealthy men , when the great mass of the people were ready and waiting to to be moved . If he had come before the citizens of the State , in a series of public meetings ; if he had appealed to the popular heart , he could have aroused an enthusiasm not surpassed since the days of Peter the Hermit . However , he voted against the admission of Texas , though he was too easily discouraged in his efforts to defeat that measure . In subsequent years , he seemed to despair of resisting slavery and gave his consent that Texas might be divided into several slaveholding States . And now we come to the point in his life in regard to which he has received the most zealous support , and the most vehement opposition . It is yet too soon to write the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still involved in obscurity . But there is no doubt of one thing , which is , that he turned right about face , and walked in a path diametrically opposite to the whole previous course of his life . If he did not change his principles , he entered upon a new course of measures , and it was equally painful and amusing to see the comparatively few northern men who followed him , giving the contradiction to their former professions , and taking back the words they had always been forward to utter . In 1848 , Mr. Webster was indignant at the nomination of Gen. Taylor , for two reasons , namely ; first , that he was an " ignorant frontier colonel ; " and secondly , because it was high time* to select a northern man , who favored northern as well as southern principles . For a time , he could not be persuaded to advocate Gen. Taylor 's election ; he encouraged his friends to form a separate organization ; and it was hoped , nearly through the summer , that he would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , he fell back , and professing the most ardent devotion to liberty and free soil , contributed much to the election of a slaveholder . Still he expressed his determination to stand by the Wilmot proviso , and even claimed that as his peculiar property , in the slang phrase of the day , as his " thunder . " In time , a change came over him . The South nerved itself to a mighty effort to keep out California and New Mexico , until they had brought them under the influence of slavery . Being in danger of losing all the objects for which they had plunged the nation into the war , they fought desperately to secure slavery in California , and to open Utah and New Mexico for its introduction . Here they met the opposition of General Taylor , who stood by his pledge , to receive the territories as they should come-if free , to be free States ; if slaveholding , then to be slave States . He also opposed the encroachments of Texas upon Mexico , determined // to resist her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , when southern members were threatening Gen. Taylor with desertion and fierce attack , where was the great chainpion of freedom ? It is sad to pursue the question , and find the reply : but duty urges us forward . He was consorting with Mr. Foote , Mr. Mangum , and other ultra defenders of the extreme claims of the South , and concocting a speech to aid them in laying open two great territories to slavery ; in dismembering New Mexico ; in giving Texas ten millions of dollars to buy off a false and impudent claim ; and in enacting the most shameful and wicked statute of modern legislation . And yet , like Macbeth , he hesitated , and sometimes alarmed his new allies . The native nobleness of his character , and the course of his life , rose up against the infamy of the law , and he drew up two provisions respecting the right to a jury trial and the writ of habeas corpus , either of which would have made the law almost a nullity . Nay , more , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards General Taylor . They had not been on speaking terms , but affairs were in a train to bring them together . Says one , who has means of knowing , there is good reason for " believing that Mr. Webster at this time had been disabused of erroneous impressions that had led to a partial estrangement between himself and the President ; and that he had come to regard General Taylor as the man best fitted by position , and by his views , to carry the country safely through the crisis . This , however , belongs to the secret history of those important events , and the time for writing that , has not yet come . it is sufficient to say that if Gen. Taylor had lived , Mr. Webster would have been the acknowledged leader of the Administration in the Senate , and that affairs would undoubtedly have taken a different turn . " Thus speaks a profound admirer and an intimate personal friend of Mr. Webster , and it is certain that the statement has the air of probability , for the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with all his previous life . General Taylor died , and we know the sequel . He had been defending one course of measures ; at once , he veered , and to the astonishment of the whole country , and the deepest grief of thousands of his admirers , moved in another direction . If he had been right before , he was entirely wrong now ; if he was right now , he had been wrong before-unless he was governed by sufficient reasons which have never been made public . He sailed in an opposite course , as if a sailor , now sailing towards the northern , should put about and steer for the southern pole . So he , who with large-hearted nationality , had sailed by the polar // star of freedom , suddenly fixed his eye on the southern crown , and found himself  --  a victim-on the southern cross . He made a determined effort to change the policy of the north ; he used almost superhuman efforts to turn the tide of opinion respecting certain measures which the north detested ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the political press , for the most part , opposed him , or uttered faint praise , crowds of enthusiastic young men , who had been his devoted admirers , deserted him , in the name of liberty ; the religious press almost unanimously came out against him ; and the clergy , who had always esteemed him more than any other public man , with here and there an exception , mourned over his course in silence , or lifted up the voice of indignant remonstrance . They thought of the words of holy writ : " Put not your trust in princes . " His own State would not follow his - lead ; his party would not support him for the presidency , and then because he had lost his popularity , the heartless , treacherous , relentless South refused him a vote . His great heart broke , and he went home to die ; to lay down , nobly indeed  --  to bring his life to such a magnificent close , as to attract the admiration of the civilized world ; but still to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did indeed fail in attaining his object , so far as personal ambition was concerned , and we have a lively faith that all the compromise measures will yet prove a delusion to the South , and hasten the success of free principles . Four or five places only have been found where a fugitive slave can be secured and sent back to bondage ; - nothing but the godlessness of great cities is equal to that infamy ;  --  and Texas itself may yet furnish more than one free State . But this chapter is not without its moral , and public men will learn-ambitious young men will learn-that there is a North ; there is a public sentiment against slaver ; and that it is dangerous to enter upon devious courses . Kentucky might follow Mr. Clay , in all his changes ; Carolina might register the edicts of Mr. Calhoun ; but Massachusetts could resist , in the cause of truth and freedom , the persuasions and arguments of a favorite son , far more powerful than either . In the course of public events , many questions arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn . Men of all parties , sects , and shades of opinion , indiscriminately oppose or affirm , according to their individual judgment . We now propose to refer to some questions of this nature , for the . purpose of showing the opinions , and in that way , illustrating the character of Mr. Webster . An occasional extract will be // given , both to exhibit his exact opinions , and keep alive the attention of our readers . An occasion offered soon after he entered Congress from Boston , when the subject of the Greek Revolution came before the House . On the 8th of December , 1823 , he presented the following resolution : " That provision ought to be made by law , for defraying the expense incident to the appointment of an Agent or Commissioner to Greece , whenever the President shall deem it expedient to make such appointment . " This resolution was followed by a speech of remarkable research and eloquence . While discarding the use of force , in assisting the struggling Greeks , he manifested ardent sympathy in their cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion . In setting forth this point , he uttered the following glowing sentence : " Sir , this reasoning mistakes the age . The time has been , indeed , ' when fleets and armies , and subsidies , were the principal reliances even in the best cause . But happily for mankind , there has arrived a great change in this respect . Moral causes come into consideration in proportion as the progress of knowledge is advanced ; and the public opinion of the civilized world is rapidly gaining an ascendenc y over mere brutal force . It may be silenced by military power , but it can not be conquered . It is elastic , irrepressible , and invulnerable to the weapons of ordinary warfare . It is that impassable , inextinguishable enemy of mere violence and arbitrary rule , which , like Milton 's angels , Vital in every part , Onunot , but by annibilating , die . ' Unless this be propitiated or satisfied , it is in vain for power to talk either of triumphs or repose . No matter what fields are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or what provinces overrun , there is an enemy that still exists to check the glory of these triumphs . It follows the conqueror back to the very scene of his orations ; it calls upon him to take notice that the world , though silent , is yet indignant ; it shows him that the sceptre of his victory is a barren sceptre ; that it shall confer neither joy nor honor , but shall moulder to dry ashes in his grasp . In the midst of his exultation , it pierces his ear with the cry of injured justice ; it denounces against him the indignation of an enlightened and civilized age ; it turns to bitterness the cup of his rejoicing , and wounds him with the sting which belongs to the consciousness of having outraged the opinion of mankind . " These were his sentiments to the last , and in January , 1852 , at the Kossuth banquet in // Washington , he declared , that " in the sentiments avowed by him in the years 1823 and 1824 , in the cause of Greece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departing from himself . " And it is worthy of remark , that on this other question of Hungarian independence , his sentiments were equally liberal and decided . As a cabinet officer , it was a delicate matter for him to give utterance to his thoughts ; and as a candidate for the Presidency , he could not speak out in favor of the injured , but glorious cause of Kossuth and his countrymen , without the hazard of losing support in all the Southern States ; nevertheless , he went to the verge of official propriety , and beyond the point of slaveholding sympathy , and openly gave his countenance to the mission and the object of the great Hungarian . This he did at the Congressional banquet ; and later still , when he stood before the Historical Society of New York , by a quotation from the speech of Adherbal , he proved that the liberty of the Magyars was near his heart . When the Numidian Prince was driven from his country , he went to Rome , and there poured out the woes of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic . This outburst of patriotic eloquence , Mr. Webster put into the mouth of the more recent exile from home and country , and thus commended him to the hearts of the American people . On the question of Slavery , his sentiments are all one way . His course in 1850 , and since , has already been adverted to , with no more than just severity ; but it is a fact that both his enemies and his friends seem to have overlooked , that his sentiments on the subject have undergone no change . To leave no doubt on this point , let us recur to his own words . Here is what he said in 1820 , at Plymouth Rock : " I deem it my duty on this occasion to suggest , that the land is not yet wholly free from the contamination of a traffic , at which every feeling of humanity must forever revolt ,  --  J mean the African Slave-trade . Neither public sentiment , nor the law , has hitherto been able entirely to put an end to this odious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy has blessed the Christian world with a universal peace , there is reason to fear that , to the disgrace of the Christian name and character , new efforts are making for the extension of this trade by subjects and citizens of Christian States , in whose hearts there dwell no sentiments of humanity , or of justice , and over whom neither the fear of God nor the fear of man exercises a control . In the sight of our law , the African Slave-trader is a pirate and a felon ; and in the sight of heaven , an offender far beyond the ordinary // depth of human guilt . There is no brighter page of our history , than that which records the measures which have been adopted by the Government at an early day , and at different times since , for the suppression of this traffic ; and I would call on all the true sons of New England , to coöperate with the laws of man , and the justice of Heaven . If there be within the extent of our knowledge or influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves here , upon the rock of Plymouth , to extirpate and destroy it . It is not fit that the land of the Pilgrims should bear the shame longer . I hear the sound of the hammer , I see the smoke of the furnaces where manacles and fetters are still forged for human limbs . 1 see the visages of those who , by stealth and at midnight , labor in this work of hell , foul and dark , as may become the artificers of such instruments of misery and torture . Let that spot be purified , or let it cease to be of New England . Let it be purified , or let it be set aside from the Christian world ; let it be put out of the circle of human sympathies and human regards , and let civilized man henceforth have no communion with it . " Still later he spoke at Bunker Hill , on this wise : " Let our conceptions be enlarged to the circle of our duties . Let us extend our ideas over the whole of the vast field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object be , our country , our whole country , and nothing but our country . And , by the blessing of God , may that country itself become a vast and splendid monument , not of oppression and terror , but of Wisdom , of Peace , and of Liberty , upon which the World may gaze with admiration forever . " And still later , in 1837 , he was fired with the same spirit . " On the general question of slavery , a great portion of the community is already strongly excited . The subject has not only attracted attention , as a question of politics , but it has struck a far deeper-toned cord . It has arrested the religious feeling of the community ; it has taken strong hold on the consciences of men . He is a rash man , indeed , and little conversant with human nature , and especially has he a very erroneous estimate of the character of the people of this country , who supposes that a feeling of this kind is to be trifled with , or despised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be reasoned with , it may be made willing , I believe it is entirely willing , to fulfill all existing engagements , and all existing duties , to uphold and defend the Constitution as it is established , with whatever regrets about some provisions which it does actually contain . But to coerce it into silence , to endeavor to restrain its free expression , to seek to compress and confine it , warm as it is , and more heated as such endeavors would inevitably render it ,  --  // should this be attempted , I know nothing , even in the Constitution or in the Union itself , which would not be endangered by the explosion which might follow . " These were his sentiments when he was young , and when he was gray with years . Even in the ever-to-be-lamented speech of the 7th of March , he let fall not a single remark in favor of slavery , and he spoke with the most cool and withering contempt of the philanthropy ot the South . Alluding to the debates about abolishing slavery , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the oftrepeated statement that there was a serious purpose to abolish that great wrong until the interference of the abolitionists put the cause of emancipation back , he gave the true explanation , in this manner . Slave property was becoming a drug , and the time seemed to be drawing near , when it would be not worth having . Then the Virginians became philanthropic , and talked of giving their slaves the boon of freedom . Suddenly , the cotton lands of Alabama were laid open , the price of slaves immediately rose , philanthropy took to itself wings , and it became an offense to speak in favor of abolition , in the Old Dominion . Here there is an opportunity for us to be just . Though Mr. Webster gave the South his aid in the last two years of his life , he never gave them his sentiments . All his writings ; all his set speeches ; all his occasional letters ; and all his casual remarks , with one exception , were in accordance with the principles of true freedom . We rejQice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despotism , can not quote the foremost man of New England in their favor . No deliberate utterance of his shall ever screen , or shelter their abominable and inhuman designs . Though he did wrong-and we must mourn over it-his immortal works are not only a well of " English undefiled , " but a fount of grand truths and sentiments in favor of the best welfaie of human kind . The necessity of Religion to the welfare of nations , and the binding force of the Divine Law , in all cases , found frequent expression in his speeches , orations , and writings . We know of but one exception to this remark  --  the exception already referred to ,  --  and let us give that the most liberal construction it will admit of . On a visit to the Capron Springs , on the 26th of June , 1851 , he was invited to a dinner , and after dinner , he uttered almost the only abstract sentiment that he ever needed to recall . He forgot his noble nature-he forgot the cherished political and religious ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevation of thought and speech . Said he , " When nothing else will answer , the abolitionists invoke religion , and speak of the higher law ' Gentlemen , the North Mountain is // high , the Blue Ridge higher still , the Alleghanies higher than either , and yet this higher law ' ranges on eagle 's flight higher tl ) an the highest peak of the Alleghanies . " And he continued , " You of the South have as much right to secure your fugitive slaves , as the North has to any of its rights and privileges of navigation and commerce . " Now it is plain that these were not his opinions in his considerate moments ; for only a few years previously he had burst forth with this exclamation " What ! when all the civilized world is opposed to slavery ; when morality denounces it. ; when Christianity denounces it ; when everything respected , everything good , are united witness against it , is it for America-America , the land of Washington , the model republic of the world-is it for America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maintenance of slavery is necessary to the support of her institutions . " Then his head , his heart , his whole nature spoke out ; how , then , could he have believed a word of what he said at Capron Springs ? It can be accounted for only by the fact that those remarks were made after a Virginia dinner , and after the free circulation of that Circean cup , which , according to the ancients , changes men into beasts Saving this one address , when and where did he ever ridicule the " higher law , " or sneer at those who invoke religion ? He always maintained that it was adutyto carry out the fugitive law , because we had agreed to do so , but he never , except this once , or possibly , on some similar occasion , held it above the " higher law . " How he could reconcile that law of despotism with religion , is more than we understand ; but this is clear , that in his deliberate opinion , he held the law of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly apply . But passing this , let us bear some of his words on the relations of religion and government . " Our ancestors , " he says , " established their system of government on morality and religious sentiment . Moral habits , they believed , can not safely be trusted on any other foundation than religious principle , nor any government be secure which is not supported by moral habits . Living under the heavenly light of revelation , they hoped to find all the social dispositions , all the duties which men owe to each other and to society , enforced and performed . Whatever makes men good Christians , makes them good citizens . Our fathers came here to enjoy their religion free and unmolested and , at the end of two centuries , there is nothing upon which we can pronounce more confidently , nothing of which we can express a more deep and earnest conviction , than of the inestimable importance of that religion to man , both in regard to this life and that which is to come " // But he expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian religion . This may be seen in many of his productions , but it is brought out with great vigor of intellect , and an intense glow of feeling , in his speech on the Girard Will case . That Will forbade the employment of Christian ministers of any denomination , in the instruction of the orphans which were to he sustained by its bounty . It went farther , and excluded them even from the buildings and the grounds of the institution . lie therefore attempted to break the Will , by showing it was no charity , since it was not founded on the principles of the Christian Religion ; and in the course of his argument , he made an unanswerable defense of the religion of Christ and of the Christian ministry . But as copious extracts from this argument were given in a former Number , in an article prepared by one of our most able and judicious contributors , we need only refer our readers to the speech , as it will be found in his Works . We will simply remark that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not uttered in Court merely to carry a point ; but carefuliy written out , printed and embodied among his Works . After this brief review of his opinions and cherished sentiments on the subject of Liberty and Slavery , of Morality and of the Christian Religion , are we not able to congratulate ourselves that the finest and grandest intellect of our country , in our time , has striven to explain and defend the right and the true ; and have not we of New England reason to be proud that this defender of the Constitution and advocate of Christianity , was , in a peculiar sense , our countrymen ? We must be permitted to say , that we have always admired him ; in spite of all his deviations towards the close of his career , we shall admire him still . Under a Southern sky , where low-minded prejudice maligns and vilifies New England character , we were proud to be a native of the same section that gave him birth ; for there , while they opposed his measures , and steadily withheld their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feared , they almost adored him , for his unequaled powers of intellect . And as advancing years have given us more occasion to take in his greatness in comparison with other men , our admiration of his peerless mind has increased ; and now , not forgetting one of his faults ; not apologizing for one of his deviations , we can truly say , as Cowper said of England , " With all thy faults , I love thee still . " In assigning to Mr. Webster his true position in the galaxy of American worthies , it is necessary to consider him in several // capacities ; for he he was not of that tribe of distinguished men , who are great in one line only . He was a Lawyer , a Legislator , a Minister , a Negotiator , an Orator , and a Writer ; and in all of these departments of public life , he equaled , if he did not excel , * all other men , his contemporaries and rivals . It is not for one man to combine such varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indeed , men who are equally good at all they undertake ; and yet they are not eminent in anything . This was not the case with Mr. Webster . It is not within our province to assign him his proper rank among American lawyers . One of his own profession shall speak for us . " As a lawyer , he has for very many years held the foremost rank . Surpassed by many in legal learning , by some in logical power , and by a few in the eloquence of his appeals to the jury ; in the combination of all these great faculties , he stands unrivaled . " This is said , with reference to his general legal standing ; and with more emphasis , it may be affirmed , that as a constitutional lawyer , no man in our history can aspire to be his equal . Enough has been said to evince his standing among the foremost men who have adorned either house of Congress . The absurd idea that his Congressional career was a failure , has already been exposed . Judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our great men have failed , for most of them have changed their policy , and scarcely any one of them has his name inseparably connected with any established measure . Webster was successful as a legislator , in giving a right direction to those who established the National Bank , in regard to its specie paying basis ; he was successful in breaking the neck of nullification , and thus making himself an undying reputation as the best and ablest expounder of the Constitution . And his land policy will yet be successful . Besides all this , he was successful , like Sheriden , Fox and Burke , like Canning and Peel , in making speeches , on which his Congressional fame may securely rest , if he had always , in every case , voted with the minority . What statesman , in the comprehensive sense of the term , can be compared with him , except Alexander Hamilton ? Mr. Webster was twice Secretary of State , and in that office performed the double duty of giving instructions to our Ministers abroad , and of negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his state papers should surpass all that had been written before his time , and who shall say that his ambitious desire was not amply accomplished . He was ambitious of reputation , as a Negotiator , and none will deny that his ambition was equaled by his performance . In // this line , he stands by the side of the Elder Adams , and of John Jay . At the conclusion of the Ashburton treaty , " Mr. Webster , both at home and abroad , was at once recognized as one of the foremost diplomatists of the day . His reputation became a European one ; " and it conferred honor on the country of his birth . He acquired reputation as an orator in every department except that of the Pulpit ; and if he had entered the gospel ministry , would have risen to the front rank as a Preacher . Says a writer in this journal , for Jan. 1845 , " To us , we confess , Daniel Webster seems to be about equally great at Plymouth , at the foot of Bunker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Senate Chamber , in the Supreme Court *Poom at Washington , and amid the deafening cheers of thronging multitudes , wherever he chooses to discuss the allabsorbing topics of the day . " It may be admitted that other men surpassed him ; one for one thing , and another for another thing ; but who combined his great qualities , or a moiety of them ? James Otis , and Patrick Henry , had more of electric fire , and of dramatic element ; John Adams , more of that rapid , common-sense , condensing power , which carries public bodies along ; Wirt had more grace ; Hamilton more logic , and Burr more of that facination which persuades without convincing ; Calhoun was superior in simple , naked statement of principles , and Clay surpassed him in appeals to the heart ; but will any one pretend to say that either of them was the peer of Daniel Webster ? Have any of them left speeches , orations , discourses , eulogies and addresses , on such a variety of subjects , before such dissimilar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of illustration , correctness of sentiment , and such clear , terse , precise , elegant and forcible language ? Can any one of them ; nay , can all together , hope to have their speeches so often read , so deeply pondered , and so admiringly appreciated , as the son of the White Mountains ? Read the speeches made in the Knapp case , in the Girard case , in the Dartmouth College case , and in the 1 ) ay and Goodyear case , as well as those made in Congress , and on other occasions . They are not mere arguments , nor mere narratives , nor mere strings of beautiful thoughts , however difficult and praiseworthy such may be ; but they are great , finished productions ; they are storehouses of thought ; chambers of imagery , where pearls and diamonds of the imagination are arrayed in rich profusion ; models of style , worthy in their form to be the casket containing such transcendent qualities . It has always been our private opinion that the argument in the // Knapp case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " Dial " once said , that it is pleasant to have our thoughts come back with the echo of a brother 's approval . We confess to a pleasurable emotion on finding that this opinion was confirmed by such a competent judge as Mr. Choate , whose words are : " I can not help thinking it a more difficult and higher effort of mind than that more famous Oration for the Crown . ' " While upon this topic , we can not , though our article is drawing out into unusual length , help quoting the following description of the scene in the United States Court in Washington , when the Dartmouth College case was before it , from the elegant pen of Prof. Goodrich , whose judgment is the more entitled to respect , since it has been formed by familiarity with the eloquence of all ages . He proceeds as follows : " Before going to Washington , which I did chiefly for the sake of hearing Mr. Webster , I was told that , in arguing the case at Exeter , New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion of his speech . This I confess , struck me unpleasantly-any attempt at pathos on a purely legal question like this , seemed hardly in good taste . On my way to Washington , I made the acquaintance of Mr. Webster . We were together for several days in Philadelphia , at the house of a common friend ; and as the College question was one of deep interest to literary men , we conversed often and largely on the subject . As he dwelt upon the leading points of the case , in terms so calm , simple , and precise , I said to myself more than once , in reference to the story I had heard , Whatever may have seemed appropriate in defendin0 the College at home , and on her own ground , there will be no appeal to the feelings of Judge Marshall and his associates at Washington . ' The Supreme Court of the United States held its session , that win*r , in a mean apartment of moderate size  --  the Capitol not having been built after its destruction in 1814 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was therefore small , consisting chiefly of legal men , the elite of the profession throughout the country . Mr. Webster entered upon his argument in the calm tone of easy and dignified conversation . His matter was so completely at his command that he scarcely looked at his brief , but went on for more than four hours with a statement so luminous and a chain of reasoning so easy to be understood , and yet approaching so nearly to absolute demonstration , that he seemed to carry with him every man of his audience without the slightest effort or weariness on either side . It was hardly eloquence , in the strict sense of the term ; it was pure reason . Now and then , for a sentence o.r two , his eye flashed and his voice swelled into a holder note , as he uttered some emphatic thought ; but he instantly fell back into the tone of earnest conversation , which ran throughout the great body of his speech . A single circumstance will show you the clearness and absorbing power of his argument . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , had prepared himself ' , pen in hand , as if to take copious minutes . Hour after hour I saw him fixed in the same attitude , but , so far as I could perceive , with not a note on his paper . The argument closed , and I could not discover that he hod token a single note . Others around me remarked the same thing , and it was among the on dits of Washington , that a friend spoke to him of the fact with surprise , when the Judge remarked , every thing was so clear , and so easy to remember , that not a note seemed necessary , and , in fact , I thought little or nothing about my notes . ' " The argument ended . Mr. Webster stood for some moments silent before the Court , while every eye was fixed intently upon him . At length , addressing the Chief Justice , Marshall , he proceeded thus This , Sir , is my case ! It is the case , not merely of that humble institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . It is more . It is the case of every Elee // mosynary Institution throughout our country-of all those great charities founded by the piety of our ancestors to alleviate human misery , and scatter blessings along the pathway of life . It is more ! It is , in some sense , the case of every man among us who has property of which he may be stripped , for the question is simply this : Shall our State Legislatures be allowed to take that which is not their own , to turn it from its original use , and apply it to such ends or purposes as they , in their discretion , shall see fit ! " Sir , you may destroy this little Institution ; it is weak ; it is in your hands ! I know it is one of the lesser lights in the literary horizon of our country . You may put it out . But if you do so , you must carry through yovw work ! You must extinguish , one after another , all those great lights of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their radiance over our land ! It is , Sir , as I have said , a small College . And yet , there are those who love it . " Here the feelings which he had thus far succeeded in keeping down , broke forth , His lips quivered ; his firm cheeks trembled with emotion ; his eyes were filled with tears , his voice choked , and he seemed struggling to the utmost simply to gain that mastery over himself which might save him from an unmanly burst of feeling . I will not attempt to give you the few broken words of tenderness in which he went on to speak of his attachment to the College . The whole seemed to be mingled throughout with the recollections of father , mother , brother , and all the trials and privations through which he had made his way into life . Every one saw that it was wholly unpremeditated , a pressure on his heart , which sought relief in words and tears . " The court room during these two or three minutes presented an extraordinary spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure bent over as if to catch the slightest whisper , the deep furrows of his cheek expanded with emotion , and eyes suffused with tears ; Mr. Justice Washington at his side , with his small and emaciated frame and countenance more like marble than I ever saw on any other human being-leaning forward with an eager , troubled look ; and the remainder of the Court , at the two extremities , pressing , as it were , toward a single point , while the audience below were wrapping themselves round in closer folds beneath the bench to catch each look , and every movement of the speaker 's face If a painter could give us the scene on canvas-those forms and countenances , and Daniel Web-. ster as he then stood in the midst , it would be one of the most touching pictures in the history of eloquence . One thing it taught me , that the pathetic depends not merely on the words uttered , but still more on the estimate we put upon him who utters them . There was not one among the strong-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep , when he saw standing before him the man who had made such an argument , melted into the tenderness of a child . " Mr. Webster had now recovered his composure , and fixing his keen eye on the Chief Justice , said , in that deep tone with which he sometimes thrilled the heart of an audience " Sir , I know not how others may feel , ' ( glancing at the opponents of the College before him , ) but , for myself , when I see my alma mater surrounded , like C*esar in the senate house , by those who are reiterating stab upon stab , I would not , for this right hand , have her turn to me , and say , Et tu quo que mi flu ! And thou too , my son ! ' " He sat down . There was a deathlike stillness throughout the room for some moments ; every one seemed to be slowly recovering himself , and coming gradually back to his ordinary range of thought and feeling . " The speeches and orations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a distinct reputation as a writer . Under this head may be ranked his official letters ; like the reply to M. ilulseman . But he was also the best letter writer in the country . The publication of his familiar letters like those to Mr. Everett , to his old schoolmaster , to John // Taylor , and to a friend in New York , writen in his farm house at Franklin , will be awaited with eager interest . Let them be printed , volume on volume , just as he wrote them ; and there can not be too many . In them we shall see the man , and probably find him greater than his other works present him to us . And in this connection , it may he proper to speak of the qualities of his mind . It has been said that he had not constructive power ; but how can any reasonable man doubt that he who understood the true meaning of the Constitution so well , would have been foremost in the convention that framed it , if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , because he left no new system of politics , philosophy , or religion . Now , there are some men , who aspire to be notable themselves , who consider no man to be great , in the highest sense , unless he will concoct a new system of transcendental philosophy , of impossible government , and of religious scepticism . If he will attack the Bible , and reduce Christ to mere manhood  --  and not first rate , even at that  --  and run a tilt at Moses , he has indubitable marks of greatness . Thank God , Mr. Webster never belonged to that rather smart , but shallow and impious school . Doubt . less he thought out many schemes of philo*ophv , government , and religion ; but he was wise enough to throw them away when his large , broad , deep mind found that what was new in them was not true , and what was true was not new . In philosophy , he adhered to common sense ; in politics , to the slowly evolved , and laboriously established principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , as the word of God , and in the Gospel of Christ , as divinely inspired . Like Paul and Augustine ; like More and Bacon ; like Calvin and Luther ; like Cromwell , Washington , and Milton ; like Newton and Locke , he sat at the feet of the Son of Mary , and worshiped the " Man of Sorrows . " But this , surely , is not a reason for denying that he had an original mind ? It has been said that he had not much imagination . How then could he paint so lucidly , the scene in the chamber of old Mr. White , in Salem . We enter the house with the murderer : ascend the stairs with noiseless step ; carefully open the chamber door ; see the moonbeams on the carpet and the bed ; there lies the old man , in gentle slumber , the white hair falling from his venerable temples , and the drapery softly rising and ftdling while he breathes in sleep . Then comes the blow of the heavy bludgeon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the victim . And then the murderer stands by the couch , over the body of the dead , and carefully feels for his // pulse , and more carefully for the beating of his heart , until that pulse was still , and that heart ceased its beating . But this is not a solitary instance ; it is but a specimen . The reply to Col. Hayne is full of such . His own account of that speech , though the shortest , is the best that has ever been given . In answer to a friend , he said , " I felt as if everything I had ever seen , or read , or heard , was floating before me in one grand panorama , and I had little else to do , than to reach up and cull a thunderbolt and hurl it at him . " Then what a word painter he was ! What poet could surpass him in description . Here he paints a field , in front of his house in Franklin : " Looking out of the east windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , my eye sweeps a rich and level field of one hundred acres . At the end of it , a third of a mile off , I see plain marble grave-stones , designating the places where repose my father , my brother Joseph , and my sisters. - This fair field is before me-I could see a lamb on any part of it . " Take this description of his father . " He had in him what I recollect to have been the character of the Old Puritans . He was deeply religious , but . not sour-on the contrary , good humored , facetious-showing even in his age , with a contagious laugh , teeth , all as white as alabaster-gentle , soft , playful  --  and yet having a heart in him that he seemed to have borrowed from a lion . He could frown ; a frown it was , but cheerfulness , good humor , and smiles , composed his most usual aspect . " Another dash of his pen , gives the form and lineaments of his brother , as if we looked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father was the handsomest man I ever saw , except my brother Ezekiel , who appeared to me , and so does he now seem to me , the very finest human form that I ever laid my eyes on . I saw him in his coffin  --  a white forehead  --  a tinged cheek-a complexion , as clear as heavenly light ! But where am I stray-ing ? " Our task would not be done if we should fail to dwell for a few minutes on some of the noticeable traits of his character , for by these he appeals more effectually to our hearts . Family affection was strong in him . Speaking of his brother Ezekiel , he says , " The grave has closed upon him , as it has on all my brothers and sisters . We shall soon be all together . But this is melancholy  --  and I leave it . Dear , dear , kindred blood , how I love you all . " One day while working in a field , a friend called on his father . " When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we sat down beneath the elm , on a haycock. lIe s id , my son , that is a worthy man : he is a member // of Congress ; he goes to Philadelphia , and gets six dollars a day , while I toil here . It is because he had an education , which I never had . If I had had his early education , I should have been in Philadelphia in his place . I came near it as it was ; but I missed it , and now I must work here . ' My dear father , ' said I , you shall not work ; brother and I will work for you , and wear our hands out , and you shall rest , '  --  and I remember to have cried , and I cry now at the recollection . " This was written at the age of 64 . In due time , he went to College , carrying all his clothing and books in his saddle bags , and riding two days in a cold northeast storm , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went home on a visit . At bedtime , he and his brother lay down , but not to sleep . They talked and cried , and cried and talked , till morning light . He was bent on having Ezekiel go to College also . He mustered courage to speak to his father , and the poor old man referred the decision to the mother . Hearing the proposition , she said : " My sons , you have my consent to sell the homestead , pay off the mortgage , and spend the remainder in getting an education , if you will support me in my old age . " Daniel went back to Dartmouth , and his brother to the preparatory studies . In due time , the first took his degree , and then labored day and night to help his brother . They kept a common purse . Daniel helped Ezekiel through College ; Ezekiel aided Daniel through his legal studies , and their love grew till death . Did it cease then ? Then remember how piously and tenderly he gathered all the dear ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great heart had a large space for his friends . In like manner , he had a strong love of scenery , and of nature , in all her aspects . The forest , the stream side , the mountain , the shaded deli , the dark ravine , the sheltered bay , the smooth lake , the surging ocean , the flying cloud , the clear depths of the blue heavens , the roaring wind , and the rolling thunder , had charms for his soul . All animated nature pleased him . He conversed with fishes and with birds , and with the flocks of his fields . Doubtless he was naturally proud-so proud as to be entirely free from vanity . He could not avoid the consciousness of his own great abilities , but he never paraded them before others ; he never sought to make others feel small ; he never asked for any man 's admiration . Nor need we deny that he loved luxuries , and suffered th*refor . Prodigal of money , he yet would have scorned all Ca* ifornia as a bribe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial friends ? A gift blindeth the eyes , even wher6 one is not conscious of * *y bias . He was // ambitious , not like Ca*sar , to found a dynasty , but to be the first in merit , and the highest in place . And an intimate political and personal friend says , that the refusal of his country to give him the highest post , shortened his days . Studiousness was one of his characteristics , though it has been supposed that he was a lazy man in his study , and careless as to books . If he went a fishing , his mind was busy ; but he was a laborious student all his life . Good pal-so 1 Wood one day told him that he had no fault to find about his lessons , but he feared the other boys might be encouraged by his example to stroll too much . The next morning , Mr. Wood heard him recite his usual hundred lines in Virgil . This being done , breakfast was ready , but the pupil wanted to go through another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on to the end of the book . He received no caution after that . At College , he was studious , honorable , obedient to academic laws , and above all the tricks and small wit of the ordinary sort of students . Though pained at the part assigned to him on Commencement day , he did not do the absurd thing that has been attributed to him by that sort of students who never could obtain any College honors . His diploma was not torn in pieces and trampled on the stage . As a law student , he won the respect of Governor Gore , who , on introducing him to the bar , foretold his future eminence . He employed those golden years , before his practice absorbed his time , in enlarging his store of legal , historical , literary and classical attainments . To the end of his days , he was a man of books as well as a man of action . He never appeared before the public in print , without paying the most minute attention to his style ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently believed that his great speech in reply to Hayne , was sudden and unpremeditated . This was not the fact . " A very foolish endeavor , " says his friend , General Lyman , " has been made by some of Mr. Webster 's friends , to create the impression that the great orations and speeches which have carried his celebrity all over the world , were made with little effort , and trifling preparation . " Speaking of the reply to Colonel Hayne , he continues ; " Mr. Webster had prepared himself for that debate with all his usual care . He knew a fortnight beforehand , the points that would be made , the position that would be assumed , and the parties that would be assailed . And we have no doubt that all those magnificent passages which live in the memory , and glow in the heart of all who read them , were prepared beforehand with the utmost care , and the nicest discrimination in the choice of words . " // 637 1853 . In confirmation of this statement , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received , several years since , from good authority . The very resolution offered by Governor Foote , was drawn up , months before , by Mr. Webster himself During the recess of Congress he met , by appointment , Senator Foote , of Connecticut , in the office of General Arad Hunt , ( also a member of Congress , ) at Brattleboro ' , Vt. , and in that little yellow building the resolution was drafted , and the plan of the discussion arranged . Such was the origin of the great debate , and there can be no doubt that ample preparation was made for it . In all probability it was foreseen that a debate upon the disposal of the public lands must come up ; and it is quite possible that the great man of the North was aware that an united attack on him as one that must be put out of the way , was already concerted by leading politicians of the South and West . It was only proper prudence in him to select his position , and keep the management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great adroitness ; and then consummate skill was shown in managing the debate when it came on ; in seizing the weak points of the enemy , and in accumulating such a momentum of power as to drive his opponents from the field . We can not have a complete idea of any man 's character , until we know something of his religious principles and his habits of life . This is eminently true in the case of Mr. Webster , and therefore we have before us a subject of remark which can not be adequately treated in the space at our disposal . It is difficult to condense , and quite as difficult to say the right thing . The natural religious element in him was very strong ; he had a clear view of the distinction between right and wrong , with a conscience sharp to detect all aberrations , and urgent in impelling him to act according to his convictions . In addition , he received a religious education , was taught to hold divine things in reverence ; had his whole intellectual nature saturated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the great facts and truths of the Bible . On the other hand , he had strong appetites , which required the control of an iron moral resolution . Thus furnished , he went forth to the battle of life , and it is undeniable that n many instances , his lower nature , stimulated by the temptations which beset public men , got the mastery of his reason and conscience . He did not openly and actively give his influence in favor of beneficent , moral reforms ; in some regards , it is to be feared ,  --  yea , to be confessed with grief ,  --  that his practice was indefensible . For this , let so much blame be laid to the customs of the time when // he came upon the stage , and to the habits of men in public life , as justice demands . The rest let us forgive , when we look into those great mournful eyes , and gaze upon that face , so graved in every feature , with the marks of a thoughtful and repentant spirit , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of his life . What the Spirit of God did for him , and with what results , is set down in that book which no mortal eye may read , but whose accumulating records will hereafter be spoken in the hearing of the universe . We only know that his early religious history was interesting ; that he made a public profession of his faith in Christ , in early life ; that he never withdrew from the orthodox connection ; that for several years he attended upon Unitarian preaching in Boston ; that he often communed with the Episcopal Church ; that he desired to be buried according to Congregational usages , under the guidance of his parish minister ; and that no profane or impure word was ever heard to fall from his lips . But whatever may be our speculations about his religious character as exhibited in daily life , there were many circumstances in the latter part of his sojourn on earth , which are fitted to inspire hope . We shall leave this point to the judgment of our readers , after giving an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler , of Washington , and from a letter written by Dr. Jeifries , of Boston . Says Mr. Butler : " He loved most that preaching which was plain , earnest , affectionate , personal and expository , r* ther than that which was general and discursive . His conversa* tion was always understood hy me to proceed upon the admission , on his part , of what are called the distinctive and evan*elical trnths of the Gospel . I have known his most emphatic approbation to have been expressed of sermons in which these truths were most distinctly presented . " Mr. Webster was exceedingly fond of discoursing and conversin* on religious subjects . I never remember to have visited him , when the circumstances admitted of it , that he did not enter upon the subject . I particularly rememher a call which made upon him on the third or fourth evening after the delivery of his great speech of the  |p7th  of March , 1850 . He was alone , and somewhat indisposed . But at once , and with great interest-apparently for*etful of public affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every pore to know how their course would he responded to or approved-he entered upon a most interesting discussion of moral , philosophical and religious questions . Among other subjects , he dwelt much on the tendency of men to rest in Church , or services , or sacraments , or doctrines , or something else , for salvation and acceptance , except just that spiritual purity , and homage , and service which God demands , and he gave me a sketch of a seiies of sermons which might he preached from the text , God is * spirit , and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth . " The facts stated by his attending physician , Doctor Jeifries , will ever be read with the deepest interest . We put on permanent record all that we can find room for . Says the Doctor , " I have not time , at so short a notice , to explain the circumstances and incidents of his sick chamher . I therefore send you only a few feds for your consideration and use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been printed . // " If you analyze that remarkable embodiment of his thoughts , you will find a full expression of his faith under the teachings of the spirit . His reference to the atonement you will perceive by what followed my recital of the hymn . I have no doubt that he was an experimental Christian . May we not confidently hope that he who so often spoke with the truth and clearness of a prophet 's vision , uttered under a Divine gnidance those remarkable words , I shall be to-nib ht in life , and joy and blessedness . ' " The few facts I have to present to you are as follows : " On leaving Mr. Webster for the night at half past eleven , on Saturday , Oct. 16 , 1852 , 1 asked him if I should repeat to him a hymn at parting , to which he gave a ready assent ; when I repeated the hymn which begins , There is a fountain filled with hisod , Drawn from Immanuel 's veins , ' he gave a very serious attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amen , ameis , even so come Lord Jesus . ' This was uttdred with great solemnity . He afterwards asked me if I remembered the verse in one of Watt 's hymns on the thought of dying at the foot of the cross , and repeated these lines with remarkable energy and feeling : Should worlds conspire to drive me hence , Moveless and firm this heart should lie , Resolved , ( for that 's my last defence , ) If I must perish-leers to die . ' " After this he said that he owed it to his fellow countrymen , to express his deep conviction of the divine inspiration of the gospel of Jesus Christ , and had embodied some thoughts which he gave to Mr. Edward Curtis . " He repeated the text , Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved , ' and then ,  --  hat he had given to be inscribed upon his tOlflbttOne , which was as follows : " Lord I believe , help Thou mine unhelief . ' " Philosophical argument , especially that drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent insignificance of this 0lohe , has sometimes shaken my reason for the faith which is in me ; hut roy heart has always assured and re-assured me , that the Gospel of Jesus Christ must he a Divine reality . " The Sermon on the Mount can not he merely human production . This belief enters into the very depth of my conscience . " The whole history of man proves it . DANIEL WEesTEs . ' " He afterwards said that he wished also to leave , somewhere , his testimony in favor of early piety ; that he was familiar with all the great poets , Pope , Dryden , Cowper , Milton and others , but that the hymns of Watts , from his cradle lsymns to his version of the Psalms , and other deeper hymns , were always uppermost in his mind and on his tongue ; that lse could repeat them faster than four scribes could write them down . " He conveyed very strongly by his remarks , that his early religious instruction and acquirements had always had the most profound and abiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed by Mrs. Webster , about a fortnight before his death , that Ise had been speaking to her of his case , and expressed the apprehension that it would terminate fatally ; he then appeared to consider his preparation for the event , and clasping his hands he said , with deep emotion , I *elieee on the Lord Jesus Christ . ' " A short time before he became unable to express his thouglsts , he appeared to be engaged in silent prayer , ( as I often noticed his appearance to inricate during Isis sickness , ) when he gave utterance to something  --  a few words of which were low and lost to me ; that which followed was- ' but whatsoever I do , Almiglsty God , receive me to Tlsvself for Jesus Christ 's sake . ' - He also exclaimed , I shall be to-night in life , and joy , and blessedness . " ' But all these scenes are over-all the great triumphs of inteb fectual exertion in full view of the public , and all those grander // struggles of the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall never again read any new orations of his ; never be called to sigh over any fresh proof that he was fallible . He went down to his grave amid lamentations more wide and heartfelt , than have been called forth by the loss of any man since the news of Hamilton 's death carried sadness through the land . And the closing incidents of his life found a simple , appropriate , and truly grand conclusion to his career . For months , even for two years , he had been growing feeble in body , ( although his mind retained all its " natural force , " ) and such is the amiability of mankind that the weakness of age and sickness was attributed to intoxication , on the occasion when for the last time he met his friends in Fanueil Hall . It now appears that he actually rejected the advice of his medical friend , who urged him to take a glass of wine for that occasion , and made that address when it was with difficulty that he could walk without leaning his weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with himself in 1850 , when he changed his course ; the exhausting efforts he made to turn the public favor towards the compromise measures ; the weight of years ; the responsibilities of office ,  --  all combined to weaken his iron frame . Then the alienation of friends was a bitter draught to one so formed for confidence and friendship . And last of all , when the result at Baltimore made it certain that he never could attain to the office which he was conscious of having adequate powers to fill with honor to his country ; bitterer than all , when the ever selfish South , with unparalleled ingratitude , refused to support him , his strong heart broke . Let us not deny it , for he must have been less or more than man , to have escaped that fate . He came home to die . Boston strove , by a splendid ovation , to soothe his feelings ; but it was of no avail . The whole pageant was aptly called the funeral of a living man . He was hastening to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary are at rest . He knew that his days were numbered . To a friend from whom he parted in New York , when on his last journey to Marshfield , and who inquired , as he shut the door of the carriage : " When shall we see you in New York again ? " he replied in solemn tones , " Never ; never . " He went home to put his house in order , and prepare to meet his God . And how serenely he passed away . He closed up his public business ; he regulated his property ; he made his will , to the satisfaction of his friends ; he directed that the farmers of the neighborhood should be his bearers to the grave ; then he was carried to the door to take a last look at his noble herd of oxen ; retiring , he laid himself on his bed , no more to leave his chamber . A wife , // an only surviving son , dear friends , and faithful household servants , gathered around , received parting words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He prayed to the God of his fathers , in the name of Christ , as he had done aforetime . He avowed himself a believer in the Bible ; a sinner who needed mercy ; a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth . He expressed a hope that he should soon be " in life , and joy , and blessedness . " Then he entered the dark valley , saying : " The fact , the fact , is what I want ; thy rod , thy rod , thy staff , thy staff , " *hus intimating that he was not then taken up with the beauty of words , but would lean on the strength of the Almighty . And as he stood on the confines of both worlds ,  --  the earth receding-eternity opening-in complete self-possession-that voice once more rose high in the stillness of night , and rang through the mansion ; " Life , death ,  --  death , life ! how curious it is . " And then the broad chest sank . His spirit was with his God . So sinks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye of day So dies a *ave along the shore . " America has produced three men of the first order of mind . The first , on account of his public services , of his patriotism , and of his inccruptible character , is the great model of a hero and statesman . He sleeps in the shades of Mount Vernon , where the exile of other lands comes to rekindle the flame of liberty in his own bosom , on the banks of that Potomac , which , by its full volume of waters , and its ceaseless flow , emblems the vastness and the perpetuity of his fame . The second , by his sense , his imagination , his unsurpassed reasoning powers , his amazing insight , his peerless genius , and his saintly piety , has made every place of his abode a shrine . East Windsor , Northampton , Stockbridge and Princeton , are hallowed spots , since Edwards lived there . He lies beneath the waving branches of Nassau Hall , where the Christian scholar , from every clime , will long go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Marshfield , which looks towards " the bay where the Mayflower lay , " and fronts the ever-heaving ocean . Over his grave may ever be heard the mingled cadence of the farresounding sea , the mournful murmur of the pine forest , and the warbling of tuneful birds ; and there , in coming generations , will his appreciating countrymen , from shore to shore , and the admirers of his intellectual great burial-place of Webster
