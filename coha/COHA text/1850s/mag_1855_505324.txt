txt TAYLOR 'S BATTLES IN MEXICO . ON the 8th of March , 1846 , General Taylor broke up his camp at Corpus Christi in Texas , and marched toward the Rio Grande . In the eyes of the Mexicans , the movement was an act of war . Though Texas had been ten years independent and unmolested by the Power which still claimed a nominal sovereignty over her ; though she had solicited and obtained admission , over a year before , into the family of the United States , Mexico still regarded her as a dependency , and protested against the occupation of her territory by our troops as an in-. vasion of Mexican soil . Furthermore , Mexico denied that Texas extended to the Rio Grande , as asserted in the treaty which followed the battle of San Jacinto ; and persisted in regarding the River Nueces as the proper southern boundary of her rebellious province . When , therefore , the United States army , not content with occupying Corpus Christi and the whole of Texas to the north of the Nueces , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit to fever heat , and preparations were instantly made for war . Fully apprised of the temper of the southern republic , our little army , about 3500 strong , struck their tents at Corpus Christi with alacrity and glee . They were in perfect condition and discipline . Among their officers they counted several who had fought thirty years before on the northern frontier ; and a large proportion of the men had been inured to the hardships of warfare in the campaigns against the Indians . The recruits , full of youthful ardor and hope , promised themselves to make up for their want of experience by excess of zeal and valor . All had unbounded confidence in their general . Nor was their trust misplaced . Old " Rough and Ready " was a model republican soldier . Never doubting his own powers , he acted and spoke with invariable decision and energy . Thbugh fully conscious of the importance of maintaining discipline , he was always accessible to the ' lowest private in his army ; and neither in his mode of living , nor even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and the troops he commanded . Danger he had begun to affront fearlessly when his cheek was smooth as a girl 's ; now that his brow was furrowed , his head grizzled , and his face bronzed by southern suns , old " Zach " grinned at the whistle of bullets as composedly as if he had been ball-proof . No Spartan lived more plainly than he . The coarsest food was his usual fare , and the sod his favorite bed . " I saw him , " says a volunteer , " sitting in front of a soiled and ragged tent , dressed in an old linen coat and trowsers , twirling a straw hat between his fingers , and dictating to some one within the tent : " not more composed , however , then than he was when he stood in the thick of the fight at Resaca de Ia Palma , or amidst the rain of balls at Buena Vista . He had a Wagon which accompanied him throughout the campaign-a clumsy , hard-seated , low-backed Jersey concern , which he had bought by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wounded soldier , while the General sat on his old gray . As a commander he was daring , prompt , and unshakable in his purpose ; all the army knew that when he had said a thing , no power on earth could alter it . At the same time he was careful of his men . While he commanded , no lives were needlessly risked for the sake of glory , " If the enemy oppose my march , in whatever force , " he wrote to the Secretary at War , " I will fight him " But at Palo Alto he would not suffer his infantry to advance within range of the Mexican guns till the day was nearly decided . On the 11th March the last of the troops left Corpus Christi for Point Isabel . They set out ' in high spirits , but the trials of the march soon put their endurance to the test . Eight days they toiled over a country cursed by Heaven . A broiling sun overhead-beneath , a desert , with here and there a patch of rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes to the weary feet of the soldiers : no water , save stagnant pools or glassy lakes filled with a salt , unwholesome liquid : not a sign any where of life or animated nature . Day after day young men fell in the ranks overcome by the heat , or sat down to die by the roadside , as reckless of life as of glory . Many a poor fellow who left Corpus Christi full of vigor and martial energy , closed his career before the army reached the Arroyo Colorado . It was not - till the 19th that the advance-guard encamped on the border of that stream . There the sol // diers ' hearts were roused by the appearance of ranchero cavalry on the south hank , and the sound of many bugles betokening the long-expected enemy . Men forgot their fatigue*at the first blast . Weapons were cleaned , spirits cheered , nerves braced for battle . It came not , however . When the gallant Worth , at the head of some light artillery , dashed into the river , expecting to hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all was silent on the opposite shore , and for this time the army was balked . The rancheros had fled . On the troops pushed , over better ground in some respects , but disputing the space for their tents at night , and their blankets in the morning , with huge rattlesnakes . At length they reached the Matamoras road , and from thence to the iRio Grande the country sensibly improved . Pomegranate , fig , and orange groves smiled in the distance . Cattle were seen toiling in cultivated fields ; poultry and game tempted the soldier as he thought of the hard fare of the past few days . Above all , in front , rolled the blue waters of the Rio Grande : nothing marvelous as a river to those who had come from the shores of the Hudson and the Mississippi , but a stream of fresh water suggestive of cool bathes and plenteous draughts to these tired and thirsty bands . Especially was it hailed with joy as the Mexican border , which the enemy could hardly fail to defend . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the train and a party of dragoons had left the army for thence on striking the Matamoras road . On his approach the Mexican residents of the village on the Point gallantly fired their houses and fled . Fortunately for our army the dragoons arrived in time to stop the conflagration ; the d*p5t was established , . and AI*eneral Taylor returned to the main body , which marched on the Rio Grande opposite Matamoras . Crowds assembled on the Mexican bank to see the Stars and Stripes hoisted for the first time within sight of the Rio Grande : in all their domestic wars the good people of Matamoras had never known such a period of excitement . Within hail of each other two armies were encamped , each waiting for the other to commence the work of death . Each saw the muzzle of the enemy 's cannon , but shrunk from applying the match to its own . The whole month of April was spent in this way  --  the Mexicans in the city of Matamoras , and the forts erected on the banks of the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was being constructed en the Texas side under the directions of Major Mansfield . Alarms frequently roused our army , and the men flew to arms anticipating a surprise ; but , notwithstanding the peremptory orders that had been sent to the Mexican general Arista , he would not cross the river . Parties of ranchero cavalry , headed by the famous bandit Romano Falcon , scoured the vicinity ; and in one of their expeditions fell in with Colonel Cross , a gallant officer , who was taking his afternoon ride . The old man was pulled off his horse and robbed of his arms , purse , etc. ; then , it is said , the rancheros proposed to take him a prisoner to Matamoms ; but their savage leader , indignant at the humane proposal , instantly rushed upon him and beat his brains out with the butt of his pistol . Lieutenant Porter , who was sent to look for him , was surprised by the same party , and having been wounded in the thigh , was butchered with one of his men . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent out with a party to reconnoitre , was captured and caraled to Matamoras . Stragglers from the camp were sure to be trapped by the vulture rancheros . These incidents embittered the feeling of our men , and the intercourse which had been at first instituted with the city was broken off . On 1st May , General Taylor decided to relieve Point Isabel , which was threatened by the Mexicans and was inadequately garrisoned . He left to hold the new fort ( since called Fort Brown ) the 7th infantry and two companies of artillery , in all 500 men , under Major Brown ; and , at four in the afternoon , marched with the rest of the army . Peals from the church-bells at Matamoras , *nd loud shouts from the spectators who lined the Mexican side , testified the enemy 's delight at what they called " Taylor 's flight . " Several Mexican regiments instantly crossed the river  --  a body of cavalry , under General Torrejon , had already crossed above the city  --  and Taylor was hardly out of sight before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's position . Clouds of smoke arose from the four batteries opposite to Fort Brown , and round shot and shells rained thickly upon its walls and parapet . The little garrison were not dismayed . The 18-pounders were brought to bear on the batteries immediately opposite , and in thirty minutes two of the guns were dismounted , and the upper batteries silenced . A few shot were fired at the city , but the distance was too great and the practice was discontinued . Indeed , it was soon found that the quantity of ammunition in the fort was barely sufficient for defense in case of assault ; and it was accordingly resolved to sustain the fire of the lower batteries without replying . The delight of the Mexicans at having , as they believed , " silenced Fort Brown , " was even greater than that produced by the " flight of Taylor . " Nothing , it seemed , was now wanting but an assault ; but for this they were not yet prepared . Shells and shot were rained from a safe distance . Arista erected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and played with admirable accuracy upon the work ; without , however , effecting any greater result than a mere annoyance . Bomb-proofs of the most primitive description had been erected-stakes being laid on pork barrels , and several feet of earth placed upon them  --  and to these the besieged fled when a shell made its appearance in the air . For six days the Mexican batteries kept up an incessant fire . On the third day a shell struck the parapet , exploded , and a cloud of dust arose ; when // it blew away , Major Brown was seen lying on the ground , his right leg torn completely off by a fragment of the shell . The soldiers crowded around him ; but their dying chief cried : " Men , go to your duties ! Thank God ! the country has not lost a younger man . " Ills leg was amputated , but to no purpose  --  the wound was mortal . The next day the Mexicans approached within range of the 6-pounders ; and , for the first time since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of replying . It was done with such effect that the assailants precipitately retired . Arista then summoned the garrison to surrender . Captain Hawkins , who succeeded Major Brown in the command , replied that , not being familiar with the Mexican language , he was not very sure of the meaning of General Arista 's letter ; but if it was a request to surrender he must positively decline . Then the shot and shells poured into the fort with greater fury than ever . The men were constantly occupied in watching for them , and at last joked familiarly about their Mexican visitors . The cook said the rascals had spoiled his coffee by throwing a shell into the pot . Still , the fatigue of watching was beginning to tell on the little party . Unless relief came , they must yield at last . Eight days had elapsed since Taylor marched , and they had no news of him . The anxiety of the garrison was worse than the Mexican fire . On the afternoon of the 8th , in the intervals between the discharges from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Isabel . A tremendous shout from the fort welcomed the sound . They knew Taylor was coming . They knew a battle was being fought . On its fate depended their own and that of the whole army . Their anxiety can be conceived . The evening before , the defenses of Fort Isabel being completed and a garrison left for its defense , General Taylor marched with 2111 men and ten guns , two of which were 18-pounders , in the direction of the Rio Grande . The men were boiling with excitement and ardor for the battle . At noon next day a long shout arose from the advance-guard . They had come in sight of the Mexican army in order of battle . Apprised by his scouts of Taylor 's movements , Arista had marched to meet him , chosen his ground , and drawn np his army in a most advantageous position . The spot he had chosen is a plain about three miles in extent , bounded by chaparral , or brushwood , and clumps of dwarf mosquito trees , called , by contrast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or high timber . The plain itself is covered with long rank grass , reaching to the muzzles of the field-pieces ; but not a hillock or an elevation of any kind breaks the level of its surface . At the extremity of this plain the Mexican army spread from side to side . On either wisig the cavalry were posted , their bright uniforms and lances glancing in the noonday sun ; between them were solid columns of infantry , with cannon at intervals . Gaudy flags and pennons waved ovtr each regiment ; conspicuous among all was the banner of the celebrated Tampico battalion , floating proudly over as fine a body of men as ever carried a musket . T was a fine sight , this army , about six thousand men in all , in perfect discipline and equipments , glittering with bright steel and tinsel ornament , and evidently as eager for the fray as our own . The lancers on the left wing , under General Torrejon , were especially admired . There were a thousand of them , gallant fellows , on fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the enemy was signaled , General Taylor ordered a halt , and bade the men quench their thirst at the pools by the roadside . The colors were then unfurled , and the infantry officers reminded their men of the significant sentence in the last general order : " The General enjoins upon the infantry that their main dependence must be in the bayonet . " There was not in that army , small as it was , one man who doubted what the result of the battle would be . At two o'clock the troops advanced in two wings . The right was composed of the 3d , 4th , and *th infantry , Hiuggold 's battery , a few dragoons nuder May , and two 18-pounders under Churchill ; in the left was a battalion of artillery serving as infantry , Duncan 's battery , and the 8th regiment of infantry . As they marched forward , Lieutenant Blake , of the topographical engineers , galloped out from the line alone toward the enemy , never drawing rein till within one hundred and fifty yards of their front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made a minute observation of their force ; which concluded , he rode back as coolly as if on parade . Poor fellow ! he had braved the fire of the whole Mexican army to fall ingloriously the next morning by an accidental shot from his own pistol . When our troops had advanced within seven hundred yards of the Mexicans , a stream of fire ran along their line , and round shot and canister came whizzing through the air . T was the first of the battle . Swift as thought , Duncan and Riuggold replied with far greater precision ; and the terrible 18-pounders under Churchill roared louder than all . Through and through the solid Mexican masses the round balls cut lanes , and as the serried ranks closed over the bodies of their fallen comrades , fresh discharges mowed them down in their turn . Taylor 's infantry were prudently kept out of range ; and the enemy 's pieces , directed against the batteries , were too ill aimed to do much mischief . Galled by the American fire , and thrown into confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged to be led against the foe . Arista ordered them to turn the American right , which rested against a clump of chaparral . They instantly disappeared from the field of battle , and came sweeping round the clump in headlong haste . But the movement had not escaped the eye of Taylor . Before they wheeled round , the 5th moved // rapidly toward the point where they must reappear ; and when the lancers emerged from cover , our fellows awaited them in square . On they came , unslinging their escopetas as they rode , and firing a harmless volley into the square . For a moment there was silence ; then a rapid discharge from the 5th shut them from view , and when the smoke rose the lancers had broken , and with many an empty saddle were in full retreat . A loud cheer from the 6th hailed the failure of the charge . The Mexicans were not heaten , however . After retiring a short distance , they re-formed and moved in the direction of Taylor 's train . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brought up against the 5th . The moment was critical . In douhle-quick time the 3d infantry hastened to protect the train , and two of Ringgold 's guns , under Lieutenant Ridgely , flew over the plain to meet the Mexican artillery . Both were perfectly successful . The terrible volley they had encountered from the 5th had made the lancers cautious ; a very few shots from the 3d put them to flight ; and at the same moment Ridgely opened on the Mexican artillery before they had time to unlimber . So well aimed were his guns , that the Mexicans turned at the first fire , and sought refuge behind the chaparral . All this time the roar in the front had never ceased . It was now arrested by a singular accident . The wadding of the guns , falling into the long dry grass , set it on fire , and immense clouds of blinding smoke arose from the plain . In a twinkling the whole battle-field was in a blaze , and neither combatant could see his foe . A dead silence ensued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their position-Taylor to pursue his advantage , Arista to escape the murderous fire of our artillery . The latter turned his whole line at right-angles to his former position ; the former pushed forward his right wing , until Riuggold 's guns stood on the very spot at first occupied by Torrejon 's cavalry . So profound was the silence that the creaking of the wheels of the gun-carriages , as twenty yoke of oxen drew them heavily forward , could be heard distinctly . There was a moment of fearful suspense , when no one could tell how or where the battle would burst forth anew . At length a gap in the smoke disclosed to Duncan 's sharp eye the Mexican masses moving silently down along the chaparral against the American left wing . In a few moments the whole force , with 1000 ranchero cavalry , in good order , would have fallen resistlessly upon the 8th and artillery battalion . There was no time for hesitation . Urging his horses to a hand gallop , Duncan tore round the burning prairie , under cover of the smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unihabering , with match lighted , and guns pointed , he awaited the foe . A puff of wind lifted the vail of smoke ; the cavalry were within musket-shot , sweeping along with steady tramp . The Mexicans hardly saw the unexpected adversary when a thundering discharge from the whole battery assailed them . Reeling beneath the shock , men and horses rolled over in the plain : the advance was checked . Behind the horse , however , the infantry moved steadily and rapidly forward , the Tampico battalion pressing eagerly to the front . Duncan was unsupported . A vigorous charge would have carried the battery . General Taylor saw the danger , and ordered up the 8th , with Ker 's dragoons , to support the guns . But the men whom Duncan led sought no support . Dividing their aim , one section poured its volleys into the dense columns of Mexican foot , . while shells and grape from the other crashed through the disordered ranks of the horse . Yalliant as they were , the assailants could not advance under that deadly rain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other extremity of the plain . Riuggold 's battery and the 18-pounders reopened their fire upon the masses in front of them . In return , the Mexican artillery poured a stream of canister upon the guns . The range was closer than at the beginning of the battle , and on both sides the practice was murderous . In the excitement of the moment , Colonel Payne begged Lieutenant Churchill to allow him to sight one of his pieces . He had hardly done so when he heard his name pronounced in a plaintive voice behind him . Turning hastily , he saw Major Riuggold lyingon the ground , mortally wounded . A shot had mangled both the gallant soldier 's legs , and laid bare the bones . Payne rushed to his side . " Take this , " said the dying man feebly , resting is head on his left hand , and removing with his right a chain from his neck , " for my sister . " Thus fell one of the best artillery men in the army. * Beside him lay Captain Page , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the range perfectly , and though their firing was slower than Churchill 's , it never slackened . Still , in many portions of the line a wavering was visible . On the American right , their preponderance of metal enabled Churchill and Ridgely to do terrible execution ; on the left , Duncan had just received a fresh supply of ammunition and followed the retreating masses with shell and canister . Desperately did the Mexicans struggle against the irresistible torrent which drove them back . Over and over again Torrejon rallied a squadron of cavalry for a charge , but each time an unerring shot from the batteries dispersed them . The fate of the day was sealed . As night fell the retreat of the Mexicans became undisguised : their batteries ceased firing , and under cover of the darkness their troops withdrew out of range into the chaparral . Thus was won the day of Palo Alto . Worn out by fatigue , many of the men lay down where they stood , and fell asleep before the smoke had risen from the battle-field . The surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wounded , stumbling over corpses , and guided by the groans of those // whom the shot had laid low . The plain was strewed with bodies . Fifty-six Americans had fallen , nine of them to rise no more ; the Mexican loss , which was far greater , has never been accurately determined . Arista set it down at 252 killed , wounded , and missing ; but it was probably nearly double that number . As the Mexicau surgeon-in-chief had fled with his instruments , the wounded were left to die on the field ; the damp night saw many a brave spirit succumb to the agony of thirst and loss of blood . Before daybreak next morning Taylor and his officers were astir . Though the men had encamped on the field , nothing was known of the position of the Mexicans ; the attack might be renewed at break of day . But the dawn burst on a deserted plain . The enemy had fled , leaving his wounded on the field . Several hours were consumed in providing for these , and preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the army advanced toward the river . It was late in the afternoon , and the General had begun to think Arista had fallen back on Matamoras , when a sudden rattle of musketry , followed by the heavier boom of cannon in the front , revealed the presence of the enemy . A few miles from the Rio Grande the Matamoras road intersects a ditch or ravine , about sixty yards wide and four feet deep , called Resaca de in Palma . In front it resembles an irregular quarter-moon , with the horns to the north , from which side the army was advancing . With the exception of the narrow road , the whole space inclosed by the ravine , as well as its outside borders , is covered with thick chaparral , in every portion of which , with guns planted so as to sweep the *oad , the Mexican army awaited Taylor 's approach . They had received reinforcements that morning , to replace the losses of the day before ; and the ardor of the new troops , joined to the confidence inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispelled the moral effect of their recent defeat . The day was fast declining , and Taylor was anxious to reach Fort Brown . The Mexican army , about three times his strength , was , in his eyes , a mere obstacle to be overcome as a matter of course . A few minutes sufficed for his plans , and to rest the troops . He then sent forward Ridgely 's light battery along the road , and the 3d , 4th , and 5th infantry deployed as skirmishers through the chaparral toward the ravine . Ridgely advanced under a sheet of flame to within three hundred yards of the nearest Mexican battery ; then , rapidly unlimbering , he opened fire as vigorously as usual . The skirmishers forced their way through the tangled brushwood with such alacrity that they kept pace with the flying artillery , and engaged the enemy at the same moment . On their side , the Mexican batteries thundered away , and the infantry , posted in the ditch and under cover of the thicket around it , poured in a destructive shower of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide this contest , as it had the one of the day before . Now was the time for the infantry to recall Taylor 's injunction . Well did they remember it . Bursting furiously from the chaparral , the gallant 3d and 4th leaped into the ravine , bayoneted or drove back the Mexicans stationed there , and proceeded to form in the hollow . Rallied by their officers , the Mexicans returned to the charge before our troops had formed , and again the steel line drove them back . Onward then our brave men rushed to the foremost Mexican battery , and carried it with the bayonet . But the road was nutenable . The powerful batteries in the rear of the ravine swept it with constant discharges . Ridgely had enough to do to keep off the cavalry with his pieces , and , as it was , his men were falling rapidly under the the iron hail to which they were exposed . It was clear that the fate of the day depended on the capture of the Mexican guns . " Captain May , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must take that battery I " " I will do it , Sir 1 " was the reply ; and the next moment May and his squadron were thundering down the road . Ridgely 's batteries were in the way , the men stripped to the skin , loading and firing amidst the rain of shot like very devils . " Wait , Charicy , " said their commander to Captain May , " till I draw their fire . " The air was rent by the ring of the light guns , followed instantaneously by the stunning roar of the enemy 's batteries ; then the artillerymen limbering up , May dashed gallantly forward , far ahead of his troop , through the ravine , and straight over the battery . The guns were taken . Dearly bought , however . In the act of cheering on the men , the gallant Inge had been struck by a ball in his throat , and silenced forever . Over the Mexican guns they had captured , the dragoons had fallen so thickly that May could only rally six men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bayonet , and May was obliged to cut his way back to the lines with one prisoner , General IDe Ia Vega . But his glorious exploit was not destined to be fruitless . Just as the Mexicans retook the pieces , Colonel Belkuap , with the 8th , and part of the 5th , charged up the road , and fell upon the enemy with a yell . Over the cannons and round the carriages a desperate fight with the bayonet began . Man to man , and foot to foot , every inch of ground was contested with desperate obstinacy . The cold steel was doing the work all over the field . The infantry had rushed through the ravine , and were attacking the Mexicans on their own side . A party of the 4th , headed by Captain Buchanan , stormed an intrenchment containing a cannon , and drove off the gunners . A squadron of Mexican horse immediately charged them . They fired , and Corporal Chisholm shot down the commanding officer . " Water , water ! " cried the dying Mexican , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) laced his canteen to his lips . He had scarcely risen when a Mexican ball laid him beside his ex* ) iring foe . // On another side M'Intosh , with the 8th , made a similar attack on a party of Mexicans ensconced behind the chaparral . This was so thick that the men could not force their way through it . M'Intosh alone , carried forward by his horse , penetrated to the Mexican side . He was instantly surrounded by a host of foes . One man thrust his bayonet through his mouth till it came out below his ear ; another ran him throu , , h the arm ; and a third pinned him to the earth with a thrust through the hip . At that moment an attack from another side diverted the attention of his assailants . Duncan 's battery had crossed the ravine , and threatened them in flank . M'Intosh rose from the ground , and Duncan , without looking at him , called upon him for support . The wounded man could barely articulate ; he tried to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you the support you need . " The whole army had by this time crossed the ravine and driven back the Mexicans from its border . For a time the contest was maintained with the bayonet ; but despite the valor and numbers of the enemy , in a band-to-hand con. filet victory was sure to rest with the men of the north . They fought with a ferocity which appalled the Mexicans . From bush to bush , from sod to sod , they forced them back , seemingly as unconscious of fatigue as of wounds . First one side , then another gave way . The lancers , scattered and dismayed , began to charge fitfully and recklessly , losing men and gaining no advantage . At last , Duncan 's and Hidgely 's batteries took up a commanding position on the south side of the ravine , and opened a fire of grape on the broken masses . This finished them , and the rout became general . The whole army , with Arista at its head , sought safay in flight . His camp was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had barely time to rally a few lancers when the dragoons and the light batteries were on his heels . Overthe plains , with the wings of terror , scrambled the fragments of the Mexican army , throwing away accoutrements , knapsacks , and arms , to increase their speed . - Horse and foot , Taml ) ico veterans and splendid lancers , were all huddled together in confused masses , no man knowing his companion , or thinking of aught but flight . For close behind them rumbled the light artillery of the victors , halting ever and anon to pour a deadly shower of grape upon their helpless bands . On another side , the light infantry and dragoons pressed hotly upon the hindmost , slaking the savage fury a battle engenders in the soldier 's breast . There was n* pity for the slayers of Riuggold , or the brutal assassins who would have murdered M'Intosh . With bayonet and sabre , with grape and canister , they were driven like sheep to the banks of the Rio Grande . There new dangers awaited them . Boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crowds rushed headlong into those that were there , and swamped them . Others dashed into the stream , and perished in the waves . To add to all , the defenders of Fort Brown , who had spent a day of maddening anxiety within hearing of the battle , assailed the flying host with showers of shot as it reached the river . Over one hundred Americans were missing next morning when the roll was called . Thirty-nine had been killed . The Mexican loss was very great . Some said that 750 had fallen on the field ; others , who are perhaps nearer the truth , set down the number at 500 . But to this must be added the list of those who perished in the flight ttt the hands of the pursuers , or in the waters of the Rio Grande . All next day the United States troops were busily engaged in burying the dead ; night came on before the sod was trodden down over the last grave . A few days were spent in repairing the damage of the battles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Taylor prepared to cross the river and attack Matamoras . Dissensions and strife distracted the Mexican camp . Arista was for retreating without striking a blow ; some of his officers recommended a bolder course ; but others , influenced by the political intrigues at work in the army , seconded the suggestion of their chief , and Matamoras was evacuated . Haggard and sullen , the remnant of the Mexicah force slunk out of the city at dusk on the 17th , and began to move slowly southward . As they marched , some vented openly their anger at the timidity of the general ; others gave way to grief at the misfortunes of their country ; a few committed suicide in rage , and General Garcia died of a broken heart . Of the splendid army which had made such an imposing appearance at Palo Alto , barely 1800 disorganized troops remained . Meanwhile Taylor crossed the Rio at leisure and invested Matamoras , awaiting reinforcements . It was not till the last days of July that he felt strong enough to advance into the interior . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brazos , and had Taylor possessed means of transportation , he might have led ten thousand men against the enemy . As it was , he resolved to do the work with little more than half that number . Pushing up the river to Camargo early in August , he reviewed his army there , discharged all sickly and discontented men , and selected from the volunteers the Mississippi , Tennessee , 1st Ohio , and Kentucky regiments of infantry , two regiments of Texas horse , the Baltimore battalion , and the remnant of the Louisiana " three months ' volunteers , " to accompany the regulars . The rest he stationed at various posts along the river . On the 19th August , General Worth , who had rejoined the army at Camargo , marched to Cerralvo , and the two other divisions under Twiggs and Butler followed shortly after . The march to Point Isabel had been severe , but it was nothing to this . Fever and other diseases had weakened the volunteers in the camp at Camargo ; heat and thirst now threatened to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In five days , Butler 's division-all raw men-marched seventy-five miles , for the most part through a barren country , where no water could be had , and the thorny chaparral was the only vegetation visible . At the close of each day the men staggered as if drunkbreaking the ranks constantly to rush to holes in the earth in search of stagnant water , hut seldom finding the boon they sought . Scores of fine fellows died by the roadside , and were hastily thrust into pits dug at night , and covered over with a few handfuls of dry earth . A whole month elapsed before the army marched from the village of Maria toward the dark towering linc of the Sierra Madre , and encamped within a few miles of Monterey . A squadron of Mexican horse had constantly hovered round them ; and from their scouts they knew that H H 0 VOL . XI. - ? NO. tiZ. -M // qwq citadel and Fort Teneria , two companies , under Captain Backus , found shelter in a tannery , and immediately clambered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort . Just us the 4th gave way , Backus opened a galling fire upon the Mexican gunners . At that moment Quitman 's brigade of Tennessee and Mississippi volunteers were advancing in the track of the 4th against the work . Backus saw the opportunity , and , urging his company to load and fire rapidly , shot down man after man at the Mexican guns . Ten minutes would do it : on came the Brigade , cut up by the citadel fire , but spared the fatal volleys of the fort : the roof of the tannery was wreathed in smoke . At 100 yards Quitman gave the word to charge . A tremendous shout rose along the plain , and the gallant volunteers swept like a flame up the slope , over the parapet , through an embrasure , and into the fort . Nothing could resist those bayonets . As they rushed in , the Mexicans rushed out . Teneria was safe . The news reached Taylor just as Butler was preparing to fall back : he dispatched an aid at full gallop to countermand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers , Butler then pressed forward toward the centre of the city ; and at the same time Garland re-formed his men , and made a second charge more desperate than the first . But it was impossible to contend against the batteries . Fort Diablo and the citadel pelted the advancing columns ; every street was raked by cannon ; every house was a battery , whence unseen foes poured in a deadly fire on the assailants . After prodigious loss , a retrograde movement was ordered . The regular infantry fell back on Fort Teneria ; their comrades on the camp . The first day 's work , at the west end , was over . It had cost nearly 400 men . General Worth had been more fortunate . After an uneasy night , stray shots from skirmishers rousing the bivouac every few minutes , lie had debouched at an early hour from the corn-fields and advanced toward the Saltillo road . There a strong party of lancers awaited him , supported by several companies of foot . As Hay 's Texans approached , leading the column , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two companies of the Texans dismounted and took a position behind a fence ; the others vainly endeavored to withstand the charge . Pressing forward with resistless force the lancers rode through the line , scattering the Texans , and bore down on Smith 's light infantry , which was deployed as skirmishers . These firing hastily and without aim , failed in checking the foe . On they came , their bright pennons floating , and their horses covered with foam , when the dismounted Texans opened fire . Not a shot was lost . Those unerring rifles rang not in sport . Saddle after saddle was emptied , and the front rank pulled up . At that moment Duncan had unlimbered his guns , and poured a deadly discharge of canister over the heads of the skirmishers into the lancers ' ranks . They broke instantly and fled . After them , in hot haste , ran Smith 's skirmishers and the artillery . Man after man was picked off as they galloped up the hillside . The Colonel , a gallant fellow , who had vainly endeavored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his horse , struck by a bullet , and to roll down the slope . Master , by their defeat , of the Saltillo road , Worth detached Captain Smith , with 300 men , to storm the height of Federacion , on which stood Fort Soldado and a battery of two guns . At noon they advanced stealthily through the corn-fields toward the river . Discovered by the enemy , a rain of shot was poured down upon them , splashing the water into their faces as they crossed the stream ; and almost at the same moment a body of Mexican infantry were seen descending the height to meet them . Worth , perceiving the movement , instantly dispatched the 5th and 7th , by different lines , to divide the attention of the enemy , and support Smith . As soon as they arrived , the latter began to ascend the slope , seeking cover under crags and bushes , and firing irregularly at the Mexican sharpshooters overhead . Here the Texan rifle came into beautiful play . The Mexican aim was bad , the balls passing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shot . Upward they crept , clinging to roots and bushes , narrowing their circle as they approached the summit , and picking off the enemy 's advance ; till , at last , the crest gained , they fell upon the Mexicans with the bayonet , and drove them headlong toward Fort Soldado . A glorious cheer rent the air as the stars and stripes were run up over the Mexican flag-staff . The 5th and 7th , seeing that the battery was carried , and that the enemy was flying toward Soldado , wheeled , and advanced in double-quick time upon that point . It was a race between them and the Mexicans . Both entered the fort almost at the same moment , the Low parapet offering no serious obstacle . Within , the struggle did not last five minutes . In less than that time the few who resisted were shot or bayoneted , and the bulk of the garrison was in full flight down the hillside . The whole height was taken , almost without loss . As the United States flag rose in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill opened upon it . Showers of grape tore up the ground . In reckless fury the Texans , following close on the heels of the flying Mexicans , toppled many a man ere he reached the plain . In the midst of the conflict a storm burst overhead ; the thunder roared as loud as the cannon , and a hurricane swept over the height . War seemed to rage above as well as below . The night was wet and , on the mountain heights , piercingly cold . Many of the men had neither food nor blankets . But a small portion of the work was done . At three next morning a small party , under Colonel Childs , marched to storm the other height . Silently they groped their way in the darkness to its base , and began to climb through the mist which enveloped the // whole acclivity , observing the utmost precaution to prevent detection by the enemy . So well did they manage that the first ray of daylight piercing the morning fog found them close to the summit , and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou , , ht fit to throw out . The latter fired hastily , and fell back . The storming party gave them a volley in return , and charged vigorously upward , reaching the summit just in time to see the Mexicans , bewildered and panic-struck , throw their cannon down the declivity , and scamper toward the Bishop 's Palace . The redoubt was carried as easily as the forts on Federacion . There only remained the Bishop 's Palace , situate on the same hill ( Independencia ) , and the most important of the defenses on that side of the city . It wasa work of great strength ; solid walls of masonry , mounted with a howitzer and cannon , and well garrisoned . Fearing the loss of life , Worth forbade any attempt to storm it , but directed a field-piece to be drawn up to the redoubt , and brought to bear . In two hours a 12-pounder was partly dragged partly carried to the summit  --  a height of 800 feet above the plain  --  and opened with shell and shrapnel on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sortie were , however , soon apparent , and a body of light infantry were thrown out as an advance along the road to the redoubt , while the riflemen and the rest of the main body lay in wait on both sides of the pathway . These preparations were hardly made before a squadron of lancers were seen sweeping up the hill at full gallop . The advance fired and fell hack . The Mexicans , mistaking their manouvre , pressed on the faster , till the troops on both sides were enabled to close to the right and left , and deliver their fire at close range . Stunned by this unexpected discharge , the lancers turned their horses ' heads back toward the Palace . The infantry instantly followed with the bayonet . Down the bill they ran , almost side by side with the foe , keeping pace with the horses , and rapidly approaching the Palace . The officer vainly endeavored to carry out Worth 's order , and restrain their men . Their blood was up , the enemy was in full flight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they rushed up to the walls ; Ayers soon found an embrasure , through which he leaped , followed by his men , while Bradford entered by the priestcap . The fall of the Federacion , and the capture of the redoubt , had destroyed the morele of the garrison : they did not wait to dispute the entrance of the Palace , but , spiking their guns , fled precipitately to the city . Great havoc was committed among the flying masses by the riflemen and Duncan 's pieces . Thus fell the last of the defenses on the west side . The tug of war had now come . At the dead of night , Fort Diablo was evacuated . As soon as the fact was discovered , Quitman hastened to occupy it with the Mississippi regiment . Thus early on 23d , a cross-fire was opened on the city from the Bishop 's Palace on the west , and from Teneria and Diablo on the east . Simultaneously , bodies of riflemen on both sides began to force their way through the streets toward the Gran Plaza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barricaded with mason-work pierced for musketry , and every second house bad on the roof a sand-hag battery , from whence showers of bullets were poured on the assailants . The Mexicans fought obstinately . Grosser mismanagement on the part of generals , or nobler courage on that of soldiers , were never witnessed . Taught by the losses of the first day , Taylor gave special directions to Colonel Davis , of the Mississippi volunteers , and to the other officers of the advance corps to husband their men . He himself was seen , as usual , in the midst of the bullets , coolly directing this house to be occupied , or that street to be abandoned . Worth , on his side , was equally careful . On east and west the riflemen were directed to crawl over the housetops , exposing themselves as little as possible , and to pick off every Mexican visible . The order was literally obeyed by the Texans . Meanwhile the infantry cut their way into houses with the ax , and slowly advanced , battering a passage for themselves through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besiegers enjoyed as complete a shelter as the besieged ; and that their strong position was useless to check the steady advance of the Americans . The scene in the Gran Plaza and its environs was frightful in the extreme . Men , women , and children ( for many , trusting in the strength of the place , had not removed their families ) were huddled together , smitten with panic , and shrieking whenever a ball whizzed over their heads . There was no concert among the officers . The inner barricades were well garrisoned , and whenever the Americans appeared in a street a hail of bullets was poured upon them ; but neither the Commander-in-chief nor any one else seemed capable of planning an offensive movement . The hand of fate was laid heavily upon the city . Already the sack had commenced . In many of the houses groups of Mexicans were surprised , and old men andyonug girls were seen clasping the knees of the officers and praying for protection against the soldiery . Elsewhere the native women , with manly courage , were tending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end was approaching . When night fell , the assailants had hemmed in the garrison , and two blocks were the only interval between Worth 's sharpshooters and the Gran Plaza . A mortar , under Major Monroe , had been sent to the west end , and was served at intervals during the night on the Cathedral . A very few hours of daylight would have enabled it to blow up the building , which was filled with powder . But Ampudia had already decided to surrender . Early on the 24th , a bugle sounded , and a messenger , bearing a flag of truce , approached the forts with proposals for a capitulation . He was gladly received by Taylor , who // was anxious to spare further effusion of blood ; hostilities were suspended , negotiations commenced , and , on the day following , Monterey snrren , *lered . Thus fell the stronghold of Northern Mexico , and one of the best fortified places in America . It had stood many a siege ; for thirteen days had been vainly attacked by the Spanish troops in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native soldiers . Yet Taylor 's army , composed , according to Ampudia , of a couple of thousand regulars , with " a band of adventurers without valor or discipline , " stormed it in three days , at a loss of only 158 killed and 368 wounded  --  the besieged losing over 1000 men . On the 26th the evacuation commenced , and on the 29th General Worth was installed as military Governor of Monterey . Its appearance resembled a vast burial-ground . Putrid corpses tainted the night air , and the howl of the wolves , which were attracted from the chaparral by the scent , echoed dismally through the subuibs . Many of the citizens had fled with the army ; only a few woe-stricken families were left to pass under the yoke of the conqueror . An armistice terminated hostilities till the 13th November . By that time Santa Anna*ho had returned to Mexico-bad mustered a powerful army at San Luis Potosi , and was expected to march against Monterey . Taylor , intending to act on the defensive only , proposed to occupy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been evacjmted by the Mexicans ; and , in pursuance of this plan , marched on Saltillo and Victoria , and occupied them without resistance . His plans were frustrated by a requisition from General Scott depriving him of Worth 's and Twiggs 's divisions of regulars . Thus reduced to a force of some 5000 men-all of whom , except a few dragoons and artillery , were volunteers-Taylor was compelled to abandon his projected line , and to content himself with one stretching from Saltillo to the mouth of the Rio Grande . December , January , and part of February were spent by the army in awaiting the Mexican attack . It was known that Santa Anna would advance from San Luis to expel the invaders ; his force was fairly estimated , and the wide disparity , in point of numbers , between the two armies was not concealed from the troops . Yet there was no thought of retreating ; on the contrary , when Taylor determined to advance southward from Saltillo , and to occupy Agun Nueva , eighteen miles nearer the foe , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the force under Taylor-including Wool 's division , which had joined the main army-was too small to hold Agna Nueva , and a retrograde movement was ordered to the pass of La Angostura , a narrow defile near the hacienda of Buena Vista . There the army awaited Santa Anna 's approach . It was on the 22d of February-Washington 's birth-day-that the Mexican advance made its appearance , rolling before it clouds of dust . It had suffered dreadfully on the road from San Luis from cold and want of supplies ; but allowing for these sources of loss , the army led by Santa Anna can not have numbered less than 20,000 men , including 4000 cavalry , and twenty pieces of artillery ; and the sufferings of the march made the soldiers all the more eager for the battle . Disappointed in not finding Taylor at Agna Nueva as he had expected , Santa Anna proclaimed that he had fled , and ordered the cavalry in pursuit . The Mexicans had already had one experience of Taylor 's flights  --  a second was at hand . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded by Washington 's battery of eight pieces , and very properly halted . The correspondence , since so famous , between the two generals , then took place ; and on receipt of Taylor 's laconic letter , Santa Anna commenced the attack . The advantage of position was all on the side of the United States army . The pass itself was so narrow that Washington 's battery could guard it against almost any force ; impassable gullies and ravines flanked it on the west , and on the east the mountains gradually rose to a height of some 2t ) 00 feet . The only spot on which a regular battle could be fought was a plateau on the east of the pass , which stretched from the precipitous mountain slope hearlv to the road , terminating on that side in several ridges and ravines . This plateau gained , the pass might have been turned ; and accordingly Santa Anna 's first thought was to master it . A strong body of light infantry was dispatched , in the afternoon of 22d , to climb the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manouvre was perceived , a party of Taylor 's riflemen ascended the opposite ridge to keep them in check . The Mexicans opened fire , and the Kentuckians replied ; and thus , as each body strove to overtop the other , both ridges were soon covered with smoke . Foiled in his object , Santa Anna awaited the morning to commence operations in earnest ; and Taylor , fearing an attack on Saltillo , set out to complete the defenses of that point during the night . At two o'clock in the morning the American pickets were driven in , and at break of day the Mexican light infantry , on the ridge above the plateau , led by General Ampudia , commenced charging down into the ravine which separated them from the Kentuckians . They had received reinforcements during the night , and were at least eight to one . Fortunately , General Wool had anticipated the movement , and Lieutenant OBrien was ready at the foot of the bill with a piece of cannon . A very few discharges , wellaimed , sent the Mexicans back to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under Pacheco and Lombardini , supported by lancers and a 12-pounder battery in the rear , marching directly toward the plateau , and a third moving against the pass . Wool had disposed the army // almost in a line across the plateau from the pass to the monntain : Washington 's battery being on the right , and O'Brien 's on the left wing , the infantry and a sqnadron of dragoons in the centre , and the volunteer cavalry inclined slightly to the rear on the right and left . About nine in the morning Pacheco 's column debonched from a ravine , and began to form coolly on a ridge of the plateau . General Lane hastened forward , skirting the mountains with the 2d Indiana volunteers and O'Brien 's battery to meet them . At two hundred yards O'Brien opened with terrific effect ; the close columns of the Mexicans were plowed by his shot . But the reply was steady and almost equally effective . Raked on the left by the 12-pounder battery , and assailed by a storm of bullets from the masses rising out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , and , after some minutes , the Indiana volunteers could stand it no longer , and fled in spite of Lane 's efforts to rally them . O'Brien was left almost alone with his guns . He fired one last discharge , then hastily limbering up , followed the flying infantry over the plateau . It had like to have been a fatal movement ; for Lombardini gaining the southern edge of the plateau at that moment , the two Mexican columns united , and the lancers , who swarmed on the flanks , galloped down with fell swoop on the volunteers . To add to the danger , the Indiana regiment in its flight became entangled with the Arkansas volunteers , who caught the panic and fled likewise . Their loss in a fight where the enemy was over four to one was severely felt . However , nothing daunted , the 2d Illinois , under Colonel Bissell , received the Mexican fire , and returned it as fast as the men could load . The dragoons , who could do no service in such a conflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , under Trench and Thomas , were brought to bear , and every shot cut like a knife through the Mexican columns . Still , it was impossible for such a handful of men to check an army of thousands : the enemy poured down the plateau , and , passing between the mountain and the Illinoisaus , turned our left , and poured in a flank as well as a front fire . Eighty men having fallen in twenty minutes , Colonel Bissell gave the word of command to face to the rear , and the gallant regiment , as cool as if on drill , faced about , marched deliberately a few yards toward the ravine-Churchill walking his horse before them-then turned and resumed firing . Meanwhile the lancers were driving the Indiana and Arkansas volunteers off the plateau , and cutting off the riflemen in the mountain from the main army . These , perceiving the danger , and trusting that the lancers would be checked by the Arkansas and Kentucky cavalry , toward which they were approaching , abandoned their position , and came running down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back to the batteries . But the mounted volunteers made but a brief stand against the impetuous charge of the lancers ; and Ampudia 's light infantry no sooner saw the riflemen move than they followed close on their heels , firing as they went . The slaughter of our poor fellows was dreadful ; the Texans were annihilated . In one confused mass , riflemen and volunteer cavalry , Arkansans and Kentuckians were driven back by the advancing columns of the enemy , and little was wanted to complete the rout . Vainly did the officers try to rally the fugitives . No sooner had a handful of men been persuaded to halt and turn than a volley from the Mexicans scattered them . Thus fell Captain Lincoln  --  a chivalrous spirit , who was struck to the earth by two balls in the act of cheering on a small party of Kentuckians to hold their ground . At this perilous moment the rattle of musketry was drowned by a tremendous roar of cannon in the direction of the pass . The Mex-. scans under Villamil had approached within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold the pass against any odds , was keeping his word . The gunners had been wild with ardor and suspense all morning ; they were now gratified , and though three guns had been taken from the battery , they poured such a murderous fire upon Villamil 's column as it approached through the narrow pass , that , after wavering a moment , it scattered , and most of the men sought refuge in the ravines . The moment they broke the 2d Illinoisans , who had been stationed at the pass , eagerly followed their colonel , Hardin , to the plateau , to share the dangers of their comrades . Almost as soon M'Kee 's Kentuckians and Bragg 's battery came plunging through the gullies on the west of the pass and joined them ; while Sherman 's guns were speedily brought up from the rear . Thus the 1st Illinoisans were saved , and grape and canister mowed down the Mexican masses at the foot of the mountain . Still , the light infantry under Ampudia were pressing on by the left to the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass might have been turned . Most providentially at that moment Taylor arrived with Davis 's Mississippi riflemen and May 's dragoons . The former barely stopped an instant for the men to fill their canteens , then hastened to the field . Boiling with rage , Davis called on the Indiana volunteers to form " behind that wall , " pointing to his men , and advance against their enemy . Their colonel , Bowles , the tears streaming down his face , finding all his appeals fruitless , seized a musket , and joined the Mississippians as a private . Time could not be lost ; Ampudia was close upon them ; Davis formed and advanced with steady tread against a body more than five times his strength . A rain of balls poured upon the Mississippians , but no man pulled a trigger till sure of his mark . Then those deadly rifles blazed , and stunned the Mexican advance . A ravine separated them from the enemy ; Davis gave the word , and , with a cheer , down they rushed and up the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // shattered the Mexican head , and drove them back to cover . But the cavalry had crept xound the mountain , and were descending on the hacienda . They were Torrejon 's brigade , splendid fellows , mostly lancers , and brimful of fight . Opposed to them were Yell 's Arkansas and Marshall 's Kentucky mounted volunteers-less than half their number . Hopelessly these brave fellows stood , firing their carbines as the foe approached ; but the last man was still taking aim when the lancers were upon them like a whirlwind . The brave Yell was dashed to the earth a corpse , and Lieutenant Vaughan fell from his horse , pierced by twenty-four wounds . Huddled together in a confused mass , Mexicans and Americans dashed side by side toward the hacienda , engaged in a death-struggle as they galloped onward , and enveloped in a cloud of dust . One tall Mexican was seen , mounted upon a powerful horse , spearing every one that came within reach , in the drunkenness of battle ; while here and there a Kentuckian , with native coolness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after man . In less time than it takes to read these lines , the horses ' hoofs were rattling over the streets , shrieks and shouts heralding their approach . Amidst the din , the crack of rifles from the roofs of the houses told that the little garrison were holding their own . Through and through the hacienda the Mexicans swept , disengaging themselves from the volunteers just in time to escape a charge from May 's dragoons , which came clattering down the ravine to the rescue . Reynolds followed with two pieces of flying artillery , and Torrejon himself , badly wounded , and minus several of his best men , was glad to escape to the mountains . Meanwhile Major Dix had snatched the colors of the 2d Indiana volunteers from the hands of their bearer , and bitterly swore that , with God 's help , that standard should not be disgraced that day . " He would bear it alone , " he said , " into the thick of the fight . " Roused by . his words , a few men rallied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plateau . The gallant 3d Indiana were there , and Sherman had brought up a howitzer . Enraged at the failure of the attack on the hacienda , a fresh body of lancers now charged these troops , advancing in close column , knee to knee , and lance in rest . In breathless haste , the volunteers were thrown across the narrow ridge , in two lines , meeting at an angle near the centre . Not a whisper broke the silence as the Mexicans approached , and the intrepid bearing of men , whom nothing could have saved from destruction if the charge had been vigorous appaled the lancers . Within , eighty yards of the lines they actually halted . At that instant the rifles were raised : a second-an awful second-elapsed . Then " Fire ! " and a blaze ran round the angle . The Mexican column was destroyed . Horses and men writhed on the plain . The rear rank stood for a moment , but a single discharge from the howitzer scattered them too , and they fell back . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemmed in on two sides , and driven to the base of the mountain , five thousand Mexicans , horse and foot , with Ampudia 's division , were being slaughtered by nine gnus , which never slackened fire . Their fate was certain ; when a flag of truce from Santa Anna induced Taylor to silence his batteries . T was but a ruse . Santa Anna asked " What General Taylor wanted ? " Before the answer reached him , the Mexicans had made good their escape to the rear . Notwithstanding the parley , one Mexican battery continued its fire upon our troops . This was the 15 and 24-pounder battery of the battalion of San Patricie , composed of Irishmen , deserters from our ranks , and commanded by an Irishman named Riley . Harassed by this fire , and perceiving the enemy 's treachery , Taylor sent the Illinoisans and Kentuckians , with three pieces of artillery , in pursuit of Ampudia . They hurried forward along the heads of the ravines ; but to their horror , as they neared the southern edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprising the whole of Santa Anna 's reserve , emerged from below and deployed before their firing . To resist was madness . rho volunteers discharged their pieces , and rushed precipitately into the nearest gorge . Its sides were steep , and many rolled headlong to the bottom . Others were massacred by a shower of bullets poured from Mexicans who clustered on both ridges above . In the midst of the carnage , Ilardin , M'Kee , and many other brave officers fell , vainly trying to seek an exit for their troops . At the mouth of the ravine , a squadron of lancers were ready to cut off their escape . Down the sides poured the Mexican infantry , slaughtering the wounded with the bayonet , and driving the helpless mass before them . Above , pale as death , with lips clinched , O'Brien and Thomas stood to their deserted pieces . Once before that morning , the Mexican shot had left the former alone at his gun ; for the second time , the fortune of the day seemed to depend on his single exertions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few* minutes , there would be time for other batteries to come up . Ball after ball tore ragged gaps through the advancing host . After each discharge , O'Brien fell back juit far enough to load and fire again , praying in an agony that help might come . He was wounded himself ; all his men were killed or wounded ; hut he flinched not before the surging wave of Mexicans till the clack of whips and the rattle of wheels were heard behind him . Then-for he knew it was Bragg urging onward his jaded horses-the brave fellow aimed one deadly volley of canister , and abandoned his pieces . The next moment Bragg unlimbered and opened a telling fire . Sherman followed , and Davis and Lane coming up at a run , the crack of rifles was heard away to the extreme left . On the right , the well-known roar of Washington 's guns startled the foe . It was the death-warrant of the lan- // cers , who were penning our volunteers in the ravine . Out came the remnant , leaving crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horrid trap , and hastily sealed the side of the plateau . Taylor was there , coolly picking the balls out of his dress , and Wool rode wildly backward and forward , urging on the rear ranks . But it was needless . At Bragg 's third discharge , the whole body of the Mexicans broke , and dashed l ) ell-mell into the ravine whence they had come . This was the last of the battle . Davis and Bragg followed the enemy a short distance ; hut the San Patricio battery still commanded the southern edge of the plateau , and the troops were so fagged that they could hardly walk . Night was coming on , and the firing ceased . The men lay down where they stood ; and a few , overcome by fatigue , slept side by side with the dead and the wounded . It was a dark , gloomy night , and a bitter wind swept from the mountain . Not far in the distance the wolf 's howl broke dismally on the ear , and the vultures flapped their wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one could say what the morrow might bring forth . With anxious eye the officers looked for the dawn . It came at last ; and to their inexpressible delight , the first streaks of light in the eastern sky revealed a deserted camp . The Mexicans had fled . An army of over 20,000 men , comprising the flower of the Mexican troops , had been beaten by 4600 Americans , over 4000 of whom were raw volunteers . Such a cheer as rose from the pass of Angostura on that February morning never before or since re-echoed through the dark gorges of the Sierra Madre .
