ART . 111. - CHALMERS ON THE INDUCTIVE METHOD IN THEOLOGY , AND THE NATURE OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE . Institutes of Theology , . By the late THOMAS CHALMERS , D.D. , LL.D . In two volumes . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . 1849 . CHALMERS is a name of power and attraction on both sides of the Atlantic , and in all Protestant communions . He belongs , not to Presbyterians , but to Christians of every name ; not to Scotland , but *vherever the English language is spoken , and sacred eloquence is valued . He was a man and a Christian ; he had breadth of understanding and catholicity of feeling enough to identify himself with the interests of humanity rather than of a party or a sect , and his life was devoted to the illustration and enforcement of our common Christianity . He has originated no school of theology , nor is he claimed as the exponent of any . Leaders of conflicting parties , champions of the old school and of the new , unite to do him homage ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very doctrines which kindle their separate fires . He was neither an argus-eyed conservative , nor a flaming herald of progress ; and yet conservatives trusted him , and progressives quoted , if they did not claim him . And when we take into consideration the times in which Dr. Chalmers lived , so fruitful of novel theories and angry controversies in both religion and politics , and especially when we call to mind that memorable struggle , which issued in the exodus of the Free Church of Scotland , and in which he acted as a leader and a master-spirit , it is surely a remarkable fact that he enjoyed to so large an extent the respect and confidence of opposite parties ; and it must be held to be a tribute not only to his greatness as a man , but also to the moderation and soundness of his views , and the purity and consistency of his character . Now that he has passed from among us , we can see that he enjoyed a posthumous fame while living . The interest with which his works are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the veneration felt for his memory , are but the continued growth of the love and admiration with which he was regarded in the midst of his intellectual and Christian activities . If now we were asked what gave to Chalmers his peculiar and acknowledged power , we should be disposed to reply that the secret lay in his strong comtnon sense , in minion with great l ) OXVers of analysis and a lofty imagination . He was an earnest and practical man , and he grew to be an eloquent preacher , a brilliant writer , and a profound thinker ; but in all and equally he was // earnest and practical . His history is illustrative of this-it is altogether a natural one . He was both a preacher and a thealogian ; but a preacher first . Beginning with a direct application of the Gospel to the *vants of men , as he found them in their actual circumstances , and in the various walks of life , he proceeded onward and upward to those high and tasking problems , which grow out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he expended the whole force of his earnest nature and disciplined intellect . We believe that he approached these questions by the right avenues , and in the right spirit , and consequently that he has been preeminently successful in his investigations and results . He did riot commence in the schools , amid the factitious difficulties of an artificial life ; but he left off in the schools . Or rather , carrying with him the facts and lessons of experience , he filled the lecture-room and his study with the vital air of daily life . They were to him shady and refreshing bowers by the road-side , not hermitages on the mountain , away from the hum and haunts of men . To us it seems the most prominent and also the most beautiful trait in the life of Chalmers , that his profoundest studies were expended upon the practical concerns of men , and that the loftiest flights of his genius were sustained by the aspiration of Christian benevolence . He lived and had his being amid the wants of men , and the remedies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon none did he task himself so willingly , as those which related to the application of Christianity to the masses . The stroke of his wing was strongest and boldest , and his sweep the most majestic , when he started from the scenes of actual life , arid soared to mid-heaven , that he might obtain wider views and fresh inspiration for the objects of his care . And what was true of Chalmers , we think , was strikingly true of the late Thomas Arnold and John F'oster ,  --  men who may stand as representatives of our times , each exhibiting the spirit of the age truly , and yet differently ; both united to humanity by ties of intensest sympathy ; both earnest believers in Christianity , but one giving expression to a hopeful and liberal spirit , the other to mingled skepticism and fear . We claim it to be the distinguishing character and honor of our generation , that genius and learning , not less than Christian benevolence , are chiefly busy in the habitations of men and around the walks of daily life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , find their themes of study , and their sources of inspiration , in the wants of mankind , and the remedies provided by God . Neither poetry nor science arc what they once were , as to their subjects or their spirit . It is now safe to believe that Wordsworth has propounded and acted upon the true theory of poetry , in making the characters , events and scenes of ordinary life , the fittest materials for the imagination to work upon ; and we hold it as actually demonstrated , that // modern science has discovered the ouiy true method of scientific investigation , by making facts the basis of deductions . Just so with theology and the theologians . Their proper field lies arotind the hearts of men ,  --  their homes and their altars . There is as little of dignity as of trtith , in that theology , whose first and surest doctrines are other than the most practical and necessary ; and we accord no greatness to that theologian , who does not find his deepest studies growing ever out of the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chiefly an application of Christ 's Gospel , on the broad scale , to the regeneration of human character , and the reconstruction of human society . The above remarks we have designed simply as an introduction to what we have to offer upon The Institutes of Theology , which constitute the 7th and 8th volumes of the Posthumous Works of Chalmers , issued under the editorial supervision of his son-in-law , Dr. Hanna , and republished in this country by the Harpers . This work is a digest of the lectures delivered by Di ' . Chalmers before the theological classes of the University of Edinburgh . On the labor of recasting these lectures into the form of Institutes , he was engaged at the time of his death ; the work was left incomplete , and the editor has appended in their original shape the lectures , which their lamented author had not time to transform according to his intention . We do not intend at present to consider the details , or even the general features , of Chalmers 's theological system ; our object is merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his introduction , and as it bears particularly upon the nature of Christian doctrine , and systematic theology . We learn from the introduction , that in his course of lectures , as first delivered , Dr. Chalmers began with Natural Theology , and the Evidences of Christianity , and next in order entered upon the subject of the character and constitution of the Godhead . When , however , he had gone through with his discussion of the Trinity , he became thoroughly convinced that this order of topics , although generally adopted by systematic theologians , was unphilosophical , and productive of mischievous consequences ; and he consequently changed it for another and a more natural method . So deep were his convictions on this subject , and so important did he esteem it , that he prepared a lecture at that time and gave it to his class , on the right order of a theological course . This lecture Dr. Hanna has judiciously published as an introduction to the whole work . In it Dr. Chalmers with characteristic clearness and force sets forth the two methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , the common and most ancient one , begins with God-his being , and character , and the constitution of his person  --  and proceeds in the order of a high chro // nology , from the uncreated One , who fills a past eternity , through the successive creations of time , onward to the final consiimmatiod of all things in an eternity to come . The other method takes man for the starting-point , and pursues the chronology of his history , beginning with his conscious ignorance , sinfulness and fear , next approaching the remedies and provisions of the Gospel as connected with human events , and finally reaching the high problems belonging to the philosophy of religion . Between the two methods , Chalmers observes there is much the same difference as subsists between the synthetic and analytic processes in scientific expositions . The first presupposes an acquaintance with the grand constituent principles of a science , which we construct by putting to , ' ether these first truths or elementary principles . By the analytic process , on the other hand , we begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the case may be , and by comparison of these we detect and infer those first princil ) 1e5 with which the other method starts . The synthetic process presupposes a full and certain acquaintance with the subject-matter of a science at the outset ; the analytic , on the other hand , is applicable to a subject , where ultimate truths , instead of being known , are yet to be known . rr*lis simple consideration would seerh sutficienc to show , that the latter is the only method in which theology can be successfully studied . Indeed this last course is but the application of the Baconian philosophy to theological investigations ; and we confess our surJ ) rise that the usefulness , and necessity even , of this application , has not been more universally acknowledged . That the catechisms and confessions of our Reformed Churches were formed on the other method , is easily accounted for ; as they were formed at a time when all sciences were studied and taught in a similar way . The great leaders of the reformation but conformed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forming their systems of theology , they took high a priori ground , and reasoned from the less known and mysterious principles of religion , downward to its plain facts and necessary lessons . They could not do otherwise , living and dying as they did , before those principles were settled , which have conducted modern science through stages of progress , not less glorious than sure . But is it not an anlazing fact that systematic theology should still remain tinder the dominion of the old methods and of an exploded philosophy , and that theologians should be the last of all , to act upon principles , which they , in common with all other men of the time , acknowledge to be most useful and indeed indispensable with reference to all other departuients of truth ? Is there any thing so peculiar in the science of theology , as to make it an exception to all other sciences ? Does it , less than they , rest upon facts , and ascend by induction and inferences to higher generali // zations , and first truth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not aware that it has ever been pretended . It surely can not be held by any who acknowledge the authority of Bacon , for he applies his principles expressly to theology. * rl*he use of human reason in matters pertaining to religion , he teaches , is two-fold ; one in the exposition of mysteries , the other in the inferences which are thence deduced . The articles and elements of religion are first to be ascertained and settled in their respective connections ; and afterwards reason is to he employed in deducing inferences from them according to their analogies . And as there is a two-fold use , so , he remarks , there is a two-fold e*rcess . One is an over-curious spirit of inquiry ; the other is an attributing to our own inferences , an authority as great as belongs to the Scripture itself . " That man is a disciple of Nicodemus , who presses the inquiry , How can a man be born again , when he is old ? ' and he is not Paul 's disciple , who does not sometimes preface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord , ' or add to them that other qualification , According to my judgment . ' " Now we claim it , as the preeminent distinction of Chalmers to have applied the spirit and processes of the inductive philosophy to theology . Au ardent lover of the natural sciences , and successful at once in cultivating and in teaching them , he applied the same rules to his favorite science , and succeeded in awakening a like enthusiasm in regard to it . He began his labors with those practical truths , which lie upon the surface of revelation , and come into immediate contact with the hearts of men , and for this his success and experience as a preacher gave him peculiar fitness . Fixing thus the meaning of the plain doctrines , and the current language of Scripture , he worked his way in*vard , by rigid analysis and keemi l ) elletration , to those interior principles and harmonizing unities which can be ascertained only by a clear apprehension and induction of the facts in which they manifest themselves . Now this method of approaching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of theology , we hold to be as important , as it is universally conceded to be in its application to natural science . In the first place , it teaches modesty and caution , just the qualities most needed in our theology . To start at the outset in the interpretation of the Scriptures , as if we understood the constitution of the Divine Being , and had fathomed his mysterious purposes , is to forsake the posture of learners , and fall into the sin of pride and the condemnation of presumption . It is also to miss of the only path which can conduct us to the truth . We can not take our position at the center , and thread out the mysteries of the universe from the radiating point . We are on the hither side , the outer edges , of all the great mysteries of God // and eternity . We can peer into them only through the openings which Providence and revelation afford us ; and by these our approach , if real , must be of necessity slow and gradual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of those doctrines , which , by their vastness exceed the comprehension , and by their mysteriousness baffle the researches of men . For instance , the doctrine of the Trinity , when approached by this method of inquiry , instead of being found lying on the threshold of the temple , is indeed far and farthest removed within the vail of the Holy of Holies ; and only the High Priests of God 's service can approach it . Indeed it is in this respect that the met hod for which we contend , evinces its truthfulness and value . For , beginning with the plain and obvious , and on this account the most important , truths of religion , it advances by successive gradations to the less certain and in the same degree less essential truths , until , reaching the highest problems which tax the human intellect , it approaches the most tenuous and misty conceptions , and by the same remove the most distant abstractions , of religion . The experience of Chalmers , in discussing the doctrine of the Trinity , is in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early a place has been given to the doctrine of the Trinity in the common expositions of theology , he proceeds as follows . " It seems to have been a very general conception that this was the way to begin at the beginning ; or in other words , after having , by a transcendental flight , assumed our station at the top of the ladder , to move through the series of its descending steps instead of climbing up from the bottom of it . Our movement we think should be in the last direction . We should feel our way upward , and not , as if already in possession of the summit , march with a look of command and an air of demonstrative certainty to the subordinate and dependent places that are beneath us . We greatly fear that a wrong commencement and a wrong direction may have infected with a certain presumptuous and a p ? *iori spirit the whole of our theology , and that we address ourselves to its high investigations more with the conscious mastery of one who , as from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him , than in the attitude of humble inquirers into the word of God . " - Vol . I , pp. 12 , 13 . With these views Chalmers entered upon his duties as a Professor of Systematic TI'heology ; and it might have been expected that he would forsake the old method , which at the outset he distrusted . But venerable names constrained him at first to adopt the time-honored order , consecrated by all the confessions and catechisms of Europe ; and so , after passing through with the introductory lessons of natural theology , he says , " We lifted ourselves up by a transcendental movement to the most transcendental of all the topics in the Christian theology . I felt the violence of the disruption , and what was still more painful , had no doubt that the vast majority , if not the whole of the class , felt it along with me . It is any thing but a good introduction to the scientific study of Christianity , to lay hold , in the first instance , of thattopic , which among all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to unravel which we have to clear our way through // a ceaseless mass of creeds and criticisms , the products either of modern sophistry or of ancient and scholastic barbarism . I felt a want of sympathy , and what is more , I dreaded the mischief on minds yet unpracticed in the science ; and though the expression be stronger than you perhaps can enter into , yet it is not stronger than to adequately convey my own sensations , when , on comparing this intermediate period with the genial topics of our introductory months , and the still more genial topics on which we now expatiate , I offered you my sincere congratulations in that we had traversed the horrors of the middle passage . We may as well have a middle passage no longer ; and I would far rather give the whole discussion a separate place in an appendix to the course , than admit it as a constituent part at an early stage of it . We make the alteration , hut not , you will allow , till after the substantial justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are glad to quit the region of transcendentals , and alight upon earth among the wants , and the feelings and the moral aspirations of our own familiar nature . Instead of looking first to Christianity , at the place where it retires into the viewless unknown of immensity , we look to it at the place where it hears on the urgent necessities of the human spirit , and holds forth an asylum to weary and heavy-laden men-instead of holding converse with her in dark cabalistic phraseology about the inaccessible secrets of heaven , we are to hold converse with her about the duties and destinies of our species . What a mighty refreshment to the spirit , when it thus descends from the mysteries which are far out of view , and of which it can know nothing , to the matters which lie within the reach of its discernment , and on its knowledge of which there hinges the interest of its eternity ! " - Vol . I , pp. 19 , 20. this is indeed strong language and heartily said . It is to us strikingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some may be disposed to say that it is a mere cluestion of the order in which topics are to be handled , of which Chalmers speaks . We do not indeed suppose , and Chalmers expressly gnards himself against being so understood , that he titidervalues the importance of the doctrine of the Trinity , or distrusts its evidence . No man believed more earnestly this great truth , or taught it more forcibly . " For a far ulterior , perhaps an ultimate topic in the subject-matter of Christianity , I can not conceive * fitter doctrine than the Trinity , as a sort of high and concluding exercise in the science . There is such clear and resistless scriptural evidence in behalf of the separate propositions , and at the same time something so impracticable to reason in the attempt to reconcile them , that I know of no subject on which the soundness of one 's Christian philosophy is brought more decisively to the test . It requires the function of a much finer discernment than belongs unfortunately to the hulk of theologians to know when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmixed truth which is in it from the gratuitous speculation . I can not imagine a more befitting theme by which to try both our supreme respect for the deliverances of Scripture , along with an utter distrust of our own powers , when directed to a matter that lies immeasurably beyond the farthest outskirts of that domain which is accessible to the human faculties . And then both for the varied scripture criticism which the question demands , and also for the insight which it gives into the principles and even the errors of the orthodox , we know of none more deeply interesting to the theological student , who can not fail , from a thorough discussion of it , to learn much in the way of settling opinions in theology by Biblical interpretation , and much on the history and progress of opinions in the church . It is a question , then , which forms an indispensable part of your pro* fessional literature . On this we hold no dispute-our only doubt was as to // the rightness of the common arrangement ; and we now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities and examples , we really could not have felt till we had made the trial , must declare it as our purpose in all time coming to advance it to a greatly posterior , if not to the concluding place of all in the order of your theological studies . " - Vol . I , pp. 16 , 17 . It will be seen , at once , that the order in which Chalmers arranged the topics and problems of Christianity , connects itself with his views of systematic theology ; althoutrh in itself it mereiy prescribes the method in which theology should be studied and apprehended , it goes farther than this , and determines the relation which systematic theology holds to the Scriptures . This relation has been described with great clearness and force in the chapter on Systematic Theology , which is the final one in the third book . Chalmers here insists upon the application of the Bacon ian principles of philosophizing to theology ; and the whole spirit of his chapter is in entire keeping with what Bacon has laid down respecting the two-fold use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pp. 357 and 360 of vol. i , between a system in theology and a system in general science . " The scripture critic is in Christianity in science . * * There are first , the individual sayings of Scripture , which like the individual phenomena of nature , may be regarded as the facts of our science . There is , secondly , the comparison and classification of these sayings , which , just as a natural philosophy is grounded on the resemblance of individuals , gives rise to a systematic divinity , whose office it is to expound and establish the principles of our science . * * rphe systematic theologian , is the philosopher of Christianity . It is his office to mark the generic resemblances which obtain , among the specific objects of his contemplation , and thus to marshal the individual sayings of the Bible under the more brief and comprehensible sayings of a creed . We are aware that there are theorists in Christianity ; but ever remember that to systematize is not to theorize . The one is just as unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlike the philosophy of nature in the middle ages . To frame a speculation from the gratuitous fancies of one 's own spirit , is a wholly different exercise from that of classifying according to their observed resemblances , the observed individuals which have a place and a substantive being in some outer field of contemplation . In the case before us these individuals are Bible texts ; and the theologian who systematizes these , fancies nothing , conjectures nothing . He deals not with what he fancies , but with what he finds-not with the specious plausibiiities which himself hath picture ( 1 , but with the solid materials , which Scripture or the scripture critic hath put into his hands . " // This language shows very plainly that Chalmers was a strenuOtis advocate for the application of the Baconian logic to theology ; he cherished in his latter years the liveliest gratitude towards Dr. Robison , to whom he was largely indebted for his views on this subject , and whose exposition of this method is still regarded as one of the very ablest in our language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 55 , ) that often as Chalmers had spoken of it , few knew how weighty the debt was which he owed to Dr. Robison , until within a year of his death , when he expressed it in a letter to a friend . We feel disposed to rest the reputation of Dr. Chalmers as a theologian , upon the clearness with which he has enunciated , and the steadiness with which he has applied the princi. ples of the inductive philosophy to theology . We believe that nothing more is necessary than to carry out these principles intelligently and faithfully , in order to bless the Church of God with a stable faith , and a theological science , at once enlightened and progressive . The want of the Christian world remains substantially what Bacon described it to be in his own day , the want of a " sacred logic , which , like an opiate , might put to sleep the inane speculations upon which our schools are laboring , and mitigate not a little the violence of those controversies , which excite tumults within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done much to bring into use and favor among us , and its blessed fruits will be experienced , in proportion as the distinction is practically understood between the revelations of Scripture and the deductions of theologians , and as the two are made to bear to one another the relation of the facts of observation to the conclusions of science . lie has done much to expose the error of those who confound theology with Scripture , making the sacred writers , systematic theologians , and also carrying over to their own deductions the authority belonging exclusively to the utterances of Inspiration . In the light of Bacon 's logic we learn the true nature of the facts of Scripture ,  --  that they are the materials of science ; and it gives us a theology which can vindicate to itself the name of science , in4its strictest and fullest sense . XVe regard this principle , therefore , as casting a flood of light both ways ,  --  upon the true interpretation of Scripture , and also upon the nature and relations of systematic theology . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain not only the materials of science , but a science , or at least the disjecta membra of a science , in downright affirmations and abstract terms , already squared and shaped to their place in a system . Hence many speak of the doctrinal and practical parts of Christianity , as if the Bible contained two sorts of instruction , altogether distinct , one scientific and abstract , the other moral and f ) ractical ; just as some of the pulpit discourses of our Puritan fathers had , firstly , a use of knowledge , and secondly , a // use of wisdom . But we believe such a notion to be as untrue in regard to the Scriptures , as it obviously is in regard to natu 're . Just as the facts of the outward world embody principles , and stand for causes which are out of sight ; so do the revelations of the Bible , the subject-matter of theology , involve principles , and lead tip the mind to those abstract conceptions which belong to theological science . We think it can be shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements . They were oiven for l ) ractical purposes , and they have always a practical form . rphe word doctrine , as it is employed in the New Testament , has a very different signification from what it bears , as used by us , in these days of refizied speculation ; and it is a fact which mauy seem never to have learned , or which they habitually forget . The scriptural meaning is simply teaching , it is instruction , *sJauxd** , the business , or the lesson of a * The whole purport of Christian doctrine is wholesome or health-giving instruction , 1S ) ' LU&amp;POL'Ua Yu*uuxu*hz , translated sound doctrine , Tit. 2 : 1 rphe doctrine of Christ as contained in his sermon on the mount , and his parables , the most formal and didactic of all his instructions , was a delineation of the nature of spiritual religion , in opposition to the prevailing errors of the day , and an iziculcation of the duties devolving upon men as the subjects and members of his kingdom . Substantially the same was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourses of Peter , of Stephen , and of Paul , all hear the same character . they insisted largely on facts . They preached Jesus and the resurrection . And what were the letters written by the Apostles ? Just what the circumstances which called them forth would seem to warrant . They applied the law of Christianity to the disorders , the offenses and heart-burnings , which from time to time sprazig up in the brotherhood , whom a common belief and love had brought together . No doubt can exist as to the doctrine taught by James , and John , and Peter , if we may judge by their catholic epistles to the churches of Christ . But was not the great apostle to the Gentiles an exception ? Did not the Holy Ghost inspire Paul to systematize the Gospel , and has he not given us its fundamental principles in terms as abstract and precise as the most rigid science requires ? We know that this is often claimed ; and we believe that this misconception has done more than any other cause to mystify and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , systematized as little as did any of his brethren of the apostolic college . The most fervent of them all , his style is marked rather with the kindling eloquence of a preacher , than with the calm and discriminating statements of a theologue . The active and affectionate nature of Paul always gave him an immediate and practical end to accomplish , and as little can his arguments as his rhetoric be understood , // if they be interpreted independently of the end to be secured . We think it can be shown of the Epistle to the Romans , and of the most elaborate portions of it , that it is as immediately practical in its whole drift , as is his letter to Philenion . But for the purposes we have now in view , it xviii be sufficient to refer to the letters of Paul to rpimothy and Titus , in which he treats chiefly of the duties of preachers of the Gospel , and particularly to the last in which he occupies a whole chapter ( the second ) in mentioning the sub which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical , and as far removed as possible frcrn the abstract statements of scientific theology . To sum up all in a word , the doctrines of the Gospel are fa*ts , historical narratives , and principles in application to actual cases . That this was the teaching of the Apostles and of the first ages may be clearly proved by the sacred records ; and it derives no little confirmation , we think , from that simple and beautiful creed , which hears the name of the Apostles , and is in such perfect keeping with the spirit of the Nexv Testament , and with apostolic teachings so far as we are acquainted with them . The skepticism , that would deny the early antiquity of this document , is bold enough to invade the sacred canon itself . We need no better proof of its early origin than its own internal evidence affords us . It is as free from contact with the subtleties of the Athanasian age , as with the controversies of the reformation , or the metaphysics of our New England theology . The uncertainty which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to emerge , and the fact that when first heard of it was in general use ,  --  this is the best evidence , and all the evidence of which the nature of the case admits , that it was the first common utterance of the churches , the earliest articulation of that faith which the Apostles preached , and in which the apostolic churches steadfastly continued . rl*hi5 document proves that the Christian faith was originally taught and confessed in historic foruns ,  --  that the churches were originally satisfied to hold as their common faith , the facts contained in the gospels , respecting the conception and birth of our Lord , his sufferings and death , his resurrection and ascension , and his second coming to judgment . Nor do we risk any thing in saying that there is more power in these evangelical facts to awaken in human hearts the sense of sin , and beget love to Christ , than in the most carefully considered and accurately stated propositions respecting the interior constitution of the Savior 's person , and the efficacy of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human mind has given it a quicker sensibility to facts than to arguments , a readier comprehension of things than of ideas , and a stronger love to persons than to principles ; and accordingly he has given us the Gospel of our salvation in the shape of facts , and concentrated its saving influences in one glorious person , our divine and self-sacrificing Redeemer. // We might make our appeal to the experience of the church universally , and indeed to the observation of every intelligei*t man , for proof of the position that the doctrines we derive by analysis from the disclosures of God 's word , are essentially different , as we II in form , as in effect , from the doctrines taught by Christ and his Apostles . Take for instance the doctrine of free will , of predestination , and of trinity in unity . We do not presume to say that these doctrines , as they are defined in our confessions of faith , are not the scientific equivalents of those statements in the Scriptures from which they are derived . But we maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be confounded . Much less ought we , in the pride of reason , to imagine that our scientific forms are better for the purposes of enlightening and saving men , than the forms in which they appear in the Scriptures . rJ*he doctrine of free agency , which is that men areendowed with free-will , and have the power of contrary choice , is a doctrine of philosophy , and not the same thing with that doctrine of religion which teaches that men ought to repent , cease to do evil and learn to do well . The difference is , that one is an abstraction , wearing a form such as the speculative reason gives it , addressed to the understanding , and provoking inquiry ; while the other is a practical doctrine , appealing to the heart , as well a the understanding , awakening conscience , and leading to obedience of life . A still further difference is , that not a few who stumble at the philosophical doctrine , and deny the power of contrary choice , do at the same time heartily and reverently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of repentance and reformation of life . So likewise the doctrine of predestination , is in its connections with human freedom and the attributes of God , the grandest problem in philosophy , or theology , which is only another name for the sublimest philosophy . But this truth , as it is taught in the Bible , and connects itself with Christian experience , is simple and natural , and seems never to have occasioned difficulty , until it was thrown into a scientific form , and thus became a profound mystery , a perplexing problem . In religion this doctrine presents itself as a fact ; it is taught in the duty of prayer ; it underlies the duty of submission ; it breathes in the ascription , " not unto us , not unto us , but unto thy uiame give glory ! " It finds utterance in the hour of secret communion , arid rejoices to use the words of Jesus , " I thank thee , 0 Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight ! " How many there are who can say Amen ! to this , and do say it habitually through the light and shade of life , to whom it is not given to understand and receive that speculative dogma of universal foreordination , which to other minds is the necessary implication of this language . // The same remarks are applicable to the doctrine of the Trinity . As a truth respecting the mode of the divine existence , previous to the incarnation , it is of all things the most incomprehensible ; but as such it is not a truth of revelation . It lies in the Gospel , like its other doctrines , in practical connections ; and * these it is as simple as it is useful . The Gospel presents Christ to us as distinct from the Father and yet as so one with him , as to be worthy of equal honor and love and confidence ; and there is nothing more vital to practical Christianity than supreme love to Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Christians did thus regard Him , we have the testimony of Scripture . Paul speaking in the name of Christians , says that they live to the Lord Jesus , and to the Lord Jesus they die ; so that living or dying they are the Lord 's . " For to this end , Christ both died and rose and revived , that lie might be Lord both of the dead and living . " This is the practical doctrine of Scripture , teaching us to believe in the Lord Jesus with perfect confidence , with adoring love , and with unswerving obedience , persuaded that He is able to keep the souls we commit to him against the day of judgment . It is , when apprehended by a living faith , at once simple and necessary . The believer readily and naturally receives it ; it inspires him with unfaltering hope through life , and gives him sweet peace in death . Now the fact that these great , and in certain aspects most perplexing , doctrines have a practical dress and lie in practical connections in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching theology on its practical side , and ascending from the basis of admitted facts and simple declarations to those high and far-reaching generalizations , which embrace in their sweep the nature of God , the principles of his government , and the destiny of men . The advantage of proceeding from the plain to the obscure , from the simple to the more complex , is , that in this way we make sure at the outset of the most important truths , and thus escape the danger of making shipwreck of the faith : and furthermore , when we enter the regions of speculative theology , we have all the security and assistance to be derived from the fact that the conclusions we have thus far reached are fixed and settled truths ; and when at length we are met by insuperable difficulties , the faith we have acquired receives no shock , and we rest as quietly before an acknowledged mystery , as the voyager , who drops his anchor in a secure harbor , waits till the light of heaven revisits him and the mists clear away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , that it gives us a theology whose warrants are the premises of Scripture , and the deductions of reason ; while it gives to the doctrines of revelation their sacred authority , discriminating accurately between God 's work and man 's , between the communications of heaven and the cornpilations // of earth . And with regard to this last point , we insist upon it , that for the practical uses of the church and the Christiah life , it is not theology we want , but the Gospel ; not the philosophy of religion , but religion itself . Science can not take the place of art , and the philosopher in the work shop is as truly out of place , as the artizan in the study or the laboratory . Do we then divorce study from practice ? By no means . What natural science has proved to the arts , their hand-maid , and nurse , and mother even , that would we have theology l ) e to the ministry and the church . Systematic theology is unquestionably the necessity of a thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christianity . The thinking and inquiring minds of every generation need thinking Christian teachers ; and in every congregation there will be at least one in a hundred who will *vander off on the dark mountains of philosophical unbelief* and his shepherd ought to be able to follow him-only let him leave the ninety and nine behind him in the green pastures and by the still waters , while " he goeth into the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray . " We only insist upon the natural and philosophical order ; we would make theology secondary and subordinate to the plain and direct teachings of God 's word ; and to these teachings we would always give the first place , as most useful and necessary . Science , properly so-called , in spiritual as in natural things , lies above and beyond the immediate uses of mankind . When we reach the regions of theory , the summits of a high generalization , we must remember that we leave the many for whom Christ died behind us ; and if they are to be benefitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ourselves received . The great instruments of salvation , the great sources of light and heat , to the mass of mankind , will be in time to come , as they always have been , the simple facts and plain declarations of the Gospel . There is a vitality and power in the a*tiial lessons of Scripture , which is absolutely inexhaustible ; they are suited to the human mind , and immediately applicable to the wants of all mankind . Men show by their conduct , not alone in their religious but in all their relations , that the forces which move them reside not in ideas but in facs , not in theories but results . It is doctrine put into practice , f ) principle sent to its consequences , that awakens feeling , carries conviction , and elicits action . The English revolution , which overthrew the arbitrary and perfidious Charles , was not excited by the mere assertion of unconstitutional prerogatives . It was not until the prerogative was exercised , and ship-money demanded and refused by Hampden , that a case was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused to the danger that threatened their ancient privileges . There were not a few loyal souls , who would listen re* spectfully and bow submissively , when the most absolute claims // issued from the throne , whose feelings and whose attitude were wholly changed , when they saw the royal prerogative in actual conflict with the people 's rights . And such is man and nature . The American Revolution was not begun in the hearts of the people , when the right to tax America was asserted by the British Parliament . The tax was Jevied ; the people understood the case ; and resistance began . So too the Reformation was not begun , when the Pope claimed the keys of the kingdom of heaven ; but it was begun when Leo acted upon the claim , and cominissioned Tetzel to raise money by the sale of indulgences . This called forth the theses of Luther , and the people were ready to sustain them ; for the doctrine had become a fact . We have seen too in our own day how differently men feel towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history . This difference alone has been sufficient to lead forth a free church from the ancient sanctuaries and manses of Scotland ; and the settlement of the question of baptismal regeneration may yet lead out a free church from the hoary piles of the English establishment . The union of church and state in theory is one thing ; but when it forces a minister upon a protesting people , or decides a doctrine of Scripture by the statute book , it is another . In a word , as human nature is constituted , and as men are wont to act , truth , to be seen and felt and obeyed by the masses , must be bodied forth in facts and visible results . It follows from this that the practical forms in which God has given us his revelation , are the wisest and best possible . Precept and doctrine mingle together in one . The most fundamental truths respecting God and Christ and the way of life , come out in forms of prayer and praise , of confession and worship . To many this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been offended . They had thought that they were doing God and the church service , by recasting the truth into philosophic molds , and our pulpits consequently have been made to resound with the din of rival systems and philosophies : each claiming to present the very substance of Christianity and to be a more lucid and convincing exposition of it than the Gospel itself . The result has been that the Gospel has been presented to the people under human aspects , a speculative spirit has been engendered , and in the train have followed schisms , heresies , and all uncharitableness . Is it not reasonable to refer this sad experience of the church in no inconsiderable measure , to the administration of a scientific theology from the pulpit , in place of a simple Gospel ? And is there not in this experience a lesson , which , if it were properly heeded , might hush the angry contention of Christian churches , and join in a living union those who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity ? The unity of Christ 's church is better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by professions . The worship of Christ is at once the least objectionable , and the most evangelical m6de of confessing Christ 's divinity . The truth , living in the practical issues of the Christian life , is a stronger and more flexible bond of Christian union than the bare truth itself in its spoken form . In the popular and ordinary administrations of religion therefore , we think the distinction ought never to be lost sight of , between the Gospel as we have it in the Scriptures , and as it is reconstructed , in our confessions of faith . He who imagines that the two are equivalents , is ignorant both of the lessons of experience and of the secret and inexhaustible energy of God 's word . The teachings of Scripture , when presented in their original form and pressure , can much more easily be turned into prayer and praise , than into questioning and disputation . Even many of those texts , which are the favorite weapons of controversalists , when examined in their places and under the limitations imposed by their connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the hazy line of speculation ; their meanings will come forth radiant with light and beauty , and carry them above the dust of controversy and the heats of passion , directly to the conscious wants of men . It has been justly observed , as an evidence of the superintendence of God over the sacred writers , how wonderfully they have avoided committing themselves , age after age , to any of the false theories , which were at the time most surely believed , but which modern science has exploded . Not less indicative is it of the power and presence of God , that the Scriptures throughout , are so true to their practical aims , and keep themselves free from mere matters of speculation ; matters upon which it is the nature of the human mind to differ , and more and more , as culture increases and those specific differences of character are developed which belong to families , to nations , and to races . The first , the original lessons of God are characteristically plain , practical and wholesome , level to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common wants . But when we come to apply the Scriptures to scientific purposes , to the determination of questions rather of interest and curiosity than of necessity and immediate use , we find ourselves in the midst of difficulties not less numerous and perplexing than those which obstruct our inquiries into the arcana of nature : and then , these secondary lessons , these inferences of science , are in spiritual uses as much less fruitful as they are remote and inaccessible to common minds . Says Bacon , in the chapter from which we have more than once quoted already , " as the wine , which runs gently under the first pressure of the grape , is sweeter than that which is expressed by the screw , arid thus made to taste of the seed and the skin ; so those doctrines are sweetest and wholesomnest which come to us most readily , as the first expressions of Scripture , // and are not drawn out into controversy or scientific propositions . * To draw this discussion to an end , it is obvious that the method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each end of the line : for it begins amid the acknowledged verities of Scripture , and regards them with profoundest reverence , as the sacred deposits of heavenly wisdom ; and it ends in a theology alone deserving of the name , which instead of being brought , like some philosophical theory , to the interpretation of Scripture , is derived from it , and is the philosophy of the facts and truths of Scripture . We do not believe that such a theology , a system , built upon the facts of revelation , and proceeding to generalities by the induction of particulars , would ever have awakened the suspicion and dislike , with which systematic theology is now regarded in many sections of the church and by numberless Christians . these feeJings are to be credited rather to a science , falsely so called , which enters the domain of revelation from without , and usurps dominion where it has no rightful authority , making the Scriptures to utter its language , and train behind it in bands of proof-texts , or else be silent . This a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its origin , not with the darkness and pupilage of those to whom revelation is sent , but with the light and prerogative of the great Revealer himself . Hence it has not scrupled to impart a meaning to the Scriptures , where it has failed to find one . True science on the other hand , is bumble in its beginnings and modest in its approaches towards a knowledge of the great Unknown and his works . It plants its foot firmly upon the things commonly acknowledged in every-day life , be they observations of nature , or declarations of Scripture ; it begins in cognitions or consciousness , and from these firm foundations it builds for itself the steps by which it ascends . As a consequence , a truly scientific theology , presupposes the spirit of piety toward God , and of a liberal and generous fellowship toward men . It recognizes communion with all who receive the dicta of Scripture , as the truth of divine revelation , just as the natural philosopher allies himself with all true observers of natural phenomena , and it advances as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a theology as this will silence and dissipate the wordy disputes of rival sects . It will begin its mission by laying the broad foundations of Christian union and communion in the common sympathies and plain lessons of Christianity , and it will consummate its work by binding together again in a better , because a more vital and lasting unity , the dissevered fragments of Christ 's body .
