LITTLE FERNS . WHERE IS LITTLE NELLY ? She is not in the garden ; I have searched under every bush and tree . She is not asleep in the summer-house , or in the old barn . She is not feeding the speckled chickens , or gathering buttercups in the meadows . Her little dog Fidele is weary waiting for her , and her sweet-voiced canary has forgotten to sing . Has anybody seen my little Nelly ? She had eyes blue as the summer heavens , hair like woven sunbeams , teeth like seed pearls , and a voice soft as the wind sighing through the river willows . Nelly is not down by the river ? No ; she never goes where I bid her not . She is not at the neighbors ? No ; for she is as shy as a wood-pigeon . Where can my little pet be ? There is her doll  --  ( Fenella she called it , because it was so tiny , )  --  she made its dress with her own slender fingers , laughing the while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is her straw hat ,  --  she made that oak-leaf wreath about the crown one bright summer day , as we sat on the soft moss in the cool fragrant wood . Nelly liked the woods . She liked to lie with her ear to the ground and make believe hear the fairies talk ; she liked to look up in the tall trees , and see the bright-winged oriole dart through the branches ; she liked to watch the clouds , and fancy that in their queer shapes she saw cities , and temples , and chariots , and people ; she liked to see the lightning play ; she liked the bright rainbows . She liked to gather the sweet wild flowers , that breathe out their little day of sweetness in some sheltered nook ; she liked the cunning little squirrel , peeping slily from some mossy tree-trunk ; she liked to see the bright sun wrap himself in his golden mantle , and sink behind the hills ; she liked the first little silver star that stole softly out on the dark , blue sky ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it folded its soft wings to sleep ; she liked to lay her cheek to mine , as her eyes filled with happy tears , because God had made the world so very fair . Where is our Nelly ? She is not talking with Papa ?  --  no ; he ca n't find her either . He wants to see her trip down the gravel walk to meet him when business hours are over , and he has nothing to do but to come home and love us . He wants her to ramble with ; he wants that little velvet cheek to kiss when he wakes each morning . Where is Nelly ? I am sure she loved Papa . It was she who ran to warm his slippers when his horse 's feet came prancing down the avenue . It was she who wheeled the arm-chair to its nice , snug corner ; it was she who ran for the dressing-gown ; it was she who tucked in the pockets a sly bit of candy , that she had hoarded all day for " poor , tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand upon his throbbing temples , when those long , ugly rows of figures at the counting-room , had given him such a cruel headache . It was she who kneeled beside her bed and taught herself this little prayer . " Please , God , let me die before my Papa . " Where is Nelly ? My dear little pets , the flowers shed dewy tears over her bright , young head long time ago . God did " let her go before Papa , " and then ... he took Papa , too . Here is a lock of raven hair , and a long , golden ringlet  --  all that is left of Nelly and Papa  --  but in that blessed land , where tears are wiped away , Aunt Fanny knows her " lost are found . " LITTLE GEORGE 'S STORY . My Aunt Libby patted me on the head the other day and said , " George , my boy , this is the happiest part of your life . " I guess my Aunt Libby do n't know much . I guess she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time she went to fly it got the tail hitched in a tall tree , whose owner would n't let her climb up to disentangle it . I guess she never broke one of the runners of her sled some Saturday afternoon , when it was " prime " coasting . I guess she never had to give her biggest marbles to a great lubberly boy , because he would thrash her if she did n't . I guess she never had a " hockey stick " play round her ankles in recess , because she got above a fellow in the class . I guess she never had him twitch off her best cap , and toss it in a mud-puddle . I guess she never had to give her humming-top to quiet the baby , and had the paint all sucked off . I guess she never saved up all her coppers a whole winter to buy a trumpet , and then was told she must not blow it , because it would make a noise . No  --  I guess my Aunt Libby do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ,  --  all the difference is they dare n't complain . Now , I never had a " bran new " jacket and trowsers in my life  --  never ,  --  and I do n't believe I ever shall ; for my two brothers have shot up like Jack 's bean-stalk , and left all their out-grown clothes " to be made over for George ; " and that cross old tailoress keeps me from bat and ball , an hour on the stretch , while she laps over , and nips in , and tucks up , and cuts off their great baggy clothes for me . And when she puts me out the door , she 's sure to say  --  " Good bye , little Tom Thumb . " Then when I go to my uncle 's to dine , he always puts the big dictionary in a chair , to hoist me up high enough to reach my knife and fork ; and if there is a dwarf apple or potatoe on the table , it is always laid on my plate . If I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellows all say  --  Get out of the way , little chap , or we shall knock you into a cocked hat . I do n't think I 've grown a bit these two years . I know I have n't , by the mark on the wall  --  ( and I stand up to measure every chance I get . ) When visitors come to the house and ask me my age , and I tell them that I am nine years old , they say , Tut , tut ! little boys should n't tell fibs . My brother Hal has got his first long-tailed coat already ; I am really afraid I never shall have anything but a jacket . I go to bed early , and have left off eating candy , and sweet-meats . I have n't put my fingers in the sugar-bowl this many a day . I eat meat like my father , and I stretch up my neck till it aches ,  --  still I 'm " little George , " and " nothing shorter ; " or , rather , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know much . How should she ? She never was a boy ! MATTY AND MABEL ; OR , WHO IS RICH ?  --  WHO IS POOR ? There , Puss ! said little Matty , you may have my dinner if you want it . I 'm tired of bread and milk . I 'm tired of this old brown house . I 'm tired of that old barn , with its red eaves . I 'm tired of the garden , with its rows of lilacs , its sun-flowers , and its beds of catnip and penny-royal . I 'm tired of the old well , with its pole balancing in the air . I 'm tired of the meadow , where the cows feed , and the hens are always picking up grass-hoppers . I wish I was a grass-hopper ! I ai n't happy . I am tired of this brown stuff dress , and these thick leather shoes , and my old sun-bonnet . There comes a nice carriage ,  --  how smooth and shiny the horses are ; how bright the silver-mounted harness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white gloves . How nice it must be to be rich , and ride in a carriage ; oh ! there 's a little girl in it , no older than I , and all alone , too !  --  a RICH little girl , with a pretty rose-colored bonnet , and a silk dress , and cream-colored kid gloves . See  --  she has beautiful curling hair , and when she puts her pretty face out the carriage window , and tells the coachman to go here , and to go there , he minds her just as if she were a grown lady . Why did God make her rich , and me poor ? Why did he let her ride in a carriage , and me go barefoot ? Why did he clothe her like a butterfly , and me like a caterpillar ? * * * Matty , come here . Climb into my lap ,  --  lay your head upon my shoulder ,  --  so . Now listen . You are well and strong , Matty ?  --  yes . You have enough to eat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mother ?  --  yes . You have a crowing little dimpled baby brother ?  --  yes . You can jump , and leap , and climb fences , and run up trees like a squirrel ?  --  yes . Well ; the little girl with the rose-colored bonnet , whom you saw riding in the carriage , is a poor little cripple . You saw her fine dress and pretty pale face , but you did n't see her little shrunken foot , dangling helplessly beneath the silken robe . You saw the white gloved coachman , and the silver-mounted harness , and the soft , velvet cushions , but you did n't see the tear in their little owner 's soft , dark eyes , as she spied you at the cottage door , rosy and light-footed , free to ramble ' mid the fields and flowers . You did n't know that her little heart was aching for somebody to love her . You did n't know that her mamma loved her diamonds , and silks , and satins better than her own little girl . You did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her heart ached , that she had " no nice place to cry . " You did n't know that through the long , weary day , her mamma never took her gently on her lap ,  --  or kissed her pale face ,  --  or read her pretty stories , to charm her pain away ,  --  or told her of that happy home , where none shall say , I 'm sick . You did n't know that she never went to her little bed at night , to smooth her pillow , or put aside the ringlets from the flushed cheek , or kneel by the little bed , and ask the dear All Father to heal and bless her child . You did n't know that she danced till the stars grew pale , while poor little Mabel tossed restlessly from side to side , longing for a cool draught for her parched lip . " You wo n't be naughty any more ? "  --  that 's a darling . And now remember , my dear little Matty , that money is not happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness ;  --  and that even this bright , beautiful world , with its birds , its flowers , and its sunshine , is dark without a loving heart to rest upon . Thank God for kind parents and a happy home , ' T is you who are rich , Matty ; pray for poor Mabel . THE BABY 'S COMPLAINT . Now , I suppose you think , because you never see me do anything but feed and sleep , that I have a very nice time of it . Let me tell you that you are mistaken , and that I am tormented half to death , although I never say anything about it . How should you like every morning to have your nose washed up , instead of down ? How should you like to have a pin put through your dress into your skin , and have to bear it all day till your clothes were taken off at night ? How should you like to be held so near the fire that your eyes were half scorched out of your head , while your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a great fly light on your nose , and not know how to take aim at him , with your little , fat , useless fingers ? How should you like to be left alone in the room to take a nap , and have a great pussy jump into your cradle , and sit staring at you with her great green eyes , till you were all of a tremble ? How should you like to reach out your hand for the pretty bright candle , and find out that it was way across the room , instead of close by ? How should you like to tire yourself out crawling way across the carpet , to pick up a pretty button or pin , and have it snatched away , as soon as you begin to enjoy it ? I tell you it is enough to ruin any baby 's temper . How should you like to have your mamma stay at a party till you were as hungry as a little cub , and be left to the mercy of a nurse , who trotted you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How should you like , when your mamma dressed you up all pretty to take the nice , fresh air , to spend the afternoon with your nurse in some smoky kitchen , while she gossipped with one of her cronies ? How should you like to submit to have your toes tickled by all the little children who insisted upon " seeing the baby 's feet ? " How should you like to have a dreadful pain under your apron , and have everybody call you " a little cross thing , " when you could n't speak to tell what was the matter with you ? How should you like to crawl to the top stair , ( just to look about a little , ) and pitch heels over head from the top to the bottom ? Oh , I can tell you it is no joke to be a baby ! Such a thinking as we keep up ; and if we try to find out anything , we are sure to get our brains knocked out in the attempt . It is very trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know everything , and ca n't wait to grow up . LITTLE FLOY ; OR , TEARS AND SMILES . It was a very hot morning in August , when little Floy stopped to look in at a city fruiterer 's window . There were bright golden apples , nice juicy pears , plump bunches of grapes , luscious plums and peaches , and mammoth melons . In truth , it was a very tempting show , to a little girl , who lived on dry bread and milk , and sometimes had not enough of that . It was not , however , of herself that Floy was thinking , as the tears started to her large blue eyes , and she pushed back her faded sun-bonnet , and looked wistfully at the " forbidden fruit . " Floy once lived in a beautiful house in the country , with her papa and mamma . Grand old trees stood guard round the house , like so many sentinels , and many a little bird slept every night in the shadow of their drooping branches . Near the house was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and two little spaniels  --  named Flash and Dash  --  who were as full of mischief as little magpies . Then there were three horses in the stable , and two cows , and hens and chickens , and a bearded nanny-goat , besides a little pink-eyed rabbit , who darted about the lawn , with a blue ribbon around his snowy neck . The trees in the orchard drooped to the ground with loads of rosy apples , and long-necked pears , and tempting plums and peaches ; the garden bushes were laden with gooseberries raspberries , and currants , ( red and white , ) while under the broad green leaves the red ripe strawberry nestled . Those were happy days for little Floy . How she rode the horses to the spring , using their manes for a bridle !  --  how she ran through the fields , and garlanded herself like a little May Queen !  --  how she sprang at night to meet Papa , who tossed her way up high above his dear curly head ! * * * Now , though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , up four pairs of stairs , in a room looking out on dingy brick walls , and gloomy black sheds . Her mamma was dressed in black , and looked very sad , and very tired ; bending all day over that tiresome writing desk . Sometimes she looked up and smiled at Floy ; and then Floy wished she had not smiled at all  --  it was so unlike the old smile her face used to wear in dear papa 's life-time . Floy became very tired of that close room . There were no pretty pictures on the walls , like those in Floy 's house in the country ; the chairs were hard and uncomfortable , and little Floy had nothing to amuse her . Mamma could n't spare time to walk much , and Floy was not allowed to play on the sidewalk , lest she might hear naughty words , and play with naughty children . Mamma 's pen went scratch  --  scratch  --  scratch  --  from sunrise till sunset ,  --  save when she took a turn across the floor to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooping . Floy was weary of counting the bricks on the opposite wall ,  --  weary of seeing the milkman stop at seven o'clock , and the baker at nine ,  --  weary of hearing the shrill voice of Mrs. Walker , ( below stairs , ) of whom mamma hired her room . Still Floy never complained ; but sometimes when she could bear the monotonous , dull stillness no longer , she would slide her little hand round her mamma 's waist , and say , " Please , Mamma , put up that ugly pen , and take me on your lap . " Floy was always sorry when Christmas , and New Year , and Thanksgiving came round ; because it made mamma 's eyes so red and swollen , and because she was such a little girl that she could n't tell how to comfort her . She longed to grow up a big lady , that she might earn some money , so that mamma need n't work so hard ; and it puzzled her very much to know what had become of mamma 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their pretty country house , in papa 's lifetime , to eat strawberries , and to drink tea . She was quite sure she had met some of them once or twice , when mamma had taken her out to church  --  but somehow they did n't seem to see either mamma or Floy . Floy was very careful of her two dresses , for fear they would get soiled , ( ever since she woke one night , and found mamma washing them out , when she was hardly able to hold her head up . ) She was afraid , too , that mamma often wanted the bread and milk she made Floy eat ; and only said " she was n't hungry , " because there was n't enough for her , and Floy , too . Well , my dear children , it was the thought of all these things that sent the warm tears to Floy 's bright eyes , as she looked in at the fruiterer 's window that hot August morning . * * * Two years have gone by . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are singing  --  and little Floy 's tears are all dried up . Her cheeks are plump and rosy ; she has plenty to eat now ; and another pair of shoes , when she has danced her toes out of those she has on . And mamma ?  --  why , she can sit whole hours with her hands folded , if she likes , and go to sleep whenever she feels tired ; for she has earned plenty of money for herself , and little Floy , too . Floy is glad of this , because mamma smiles now , and looks happier  --  and because all her old friends , who forgot all about her when she was poor , are so delighted now whenever they meet her . Floy thinks it is very nice all round . Dear , innocent little Floy ! THE LAKE TRIP ; OR , GOING A FISHING . Oh ! Aunty , it has done raining ! The sun is shining so brightly ; we are going to the Lake to fish  --  Papa says so  --  you and Papa , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and our dog Bruno . Of course , Aunty , who was always on hand for such trips , was n't five minutes springing to her feet , and in less than half an hour Pat stood at the door with the carriage , ( that somehow or other always held as many as wanted to go , whether it were five , or forty-five ; ) " Papa " twisting the reins over hats and bonnets with the dexterity of a Jehu ; jolt  --  jolt  --  on we go , over pebble stones  --  over plank roads  --  past cottages  --  past farms  --  up hill and down , till we reach " the Lake . " Shall I tell you how we tip-toed into the little egg-shell boats ? How , after a great deal of talk , we all were seated to our minds  --  how each one had a great fishing rod put into our hands  --  how Aunty , ( who never fished before , ) got laughed at for refusing to stick the cruel hook into the quivering little minnows used for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her , she forgot all about moving it round , so beautiful was the " blue above , and the blue below , " until a great fish twitched at her line , telling her to leave off dreaming and mind her business  --  and how it made her feel so bad to see them tear the hook from the mouth of the poor fish she was so UN-lucky as to catch , that she coaxed them to put her ashore , telling them it was pleasure not pain she came after  --  and how they laughed and floated off down the Lake , leaving her on a green moss patch , under a big tree  --  and how she rambled all along shore gathering the tiniest little shells that ever a wave tossed up  --  and how she took off her shoes and stockings and dipped her feet in the cool water , and listened to the bees ' drowsy hum from the old tree trunk close by , and watched the busy ant stagger home , under the weight of his well earned morsel  --  and how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pluck some crimson lobelias , growing on the other side , and some delicate , bell-shaped flowers , fit only for a fairy 's bridal wreath ,  --  and how she wandered till sunset came on , and the Lake 's pure breast was all a-glow , and then , how she lay under that old tree , listening to the plashing waves , and watching the little birds , dipping their golden wings into the rippling waters , then soaring aloft to the rosy tinted clouds ? Shall I tell you how the grand old hills , forest crowned , stretched off into the dim distance  --  and how sweet the music of childhood 's ringing laugh , heard from the far-off shore  --  or how Aunty thought ' t was such a pity that sin , and tears , and sorrow , should ever blight so fair a world ? But Aunty must n't make you sad ; here come the children leaping from the boat ; they 've " caught few fish , " but a great deal of sunshine , ( judging from their happy faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing Agnes , the pensive Emma , the dove-eyed , tender-hearted Mary , the rosy Bell , the fearless Harry . In the green pastures by the still waters , may the dear Shepherd fold them . " MILK FOR BABES . " Once in a while I have a way of thinking !  --  and to-day it struck me that children should have a minister of their own . Yes , a child 's minister ! For amid the " strong meat " for older disciples , the " milk for babes " spoken of by the infant , loving Saviour , seems to be , strangely enough , forgotten . Yes , I remember the " Sabbath Schools ; " and God bless and prosper them  --  as far as they go . But  --  there 's your little Charles  --  he says to you on Saturday night ,  --  " Mother , what day is it to-morrow ? " " Sunday , my pet . " " Oh , I 'm so sorry , I 'm so tired Sundays . " Poor Charley ! he goes to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , has the most uncomfortable seat in the pew  --  used as a sort of human wedge , to fill up some triangular corner . From one year 's end to another , he hears nothing from that pulpit he can understand . It is all Greek and Latin to him , those big words , and rhetorical flourishes , and theological nuts , thrown out for " wisdom-teeth " to crack . So he counts the buttons on his jacket , and the bows on his mother 's bonnet , and he wonders how the feathers in that lady 's hat before him can be higher than the pulpit or the minister ; ( for he ca n't see either . ) And then he wonders , if the chandelier should fall , if he could n't have one of those sparkling glass drops ,  --  and then he wonders if Betty will give the baby his humming top to play with before he gets home  --  and whether his mother will have apple dumplings for dinner ? And then he explores his Sunday pocket for the absent string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidgety that he ca n't stand it , and he says out loud , " hi  --  ho  --  hum ! " and then he gets a very red ear from his father , for disturbing his comfortable nap in particular , and the rest of the congregation generally . Yes , I 'd have a church for children , if I could only find a minister who knew enough to preach to them ! You need n't smile ! It needs a very long head to talk to a child . It is much easier to talk to older people whose brains are so cobwebbed with " isms " and " ologies , " that you can make them lose themselves when they get troublesome ; but that straight-forward , childish , far-reaching question ! and the next  --  and the next ! That clear , penetrating , searching , yet innocent and trusting eye ! How will you meet them ? You 'll be astonished to find how often you 'll be cornered by that little child  --  how many difficulties he will raise , that will require all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must get off your clerical stilts , and drop your metaphors and musty folios , and call everything by its right name when you talk to children . Yes , I repeat it . Children should have a minister . Not a gentleman in a stiff neck-cloth and black coat , who says solemnly , in a sepulchral voice , ( once a year , on his parochial visit , )  --  " S-a-m-u-e-l  --  my  --  boy  --  how  --  do  --  you  --  do ? " but a genial , warm-hearted , loving , spiritual father , who is neither wiser , nor greater , nor better than he who took little children in his arms and said , " Of such is the kingdom of heaven . " THE LITTLE " MORNING GLORY . " Dear little pet ! She was going a journey in the cars with mamma ; and her little curly head could not stay on the pillow , for thinking of it . She was awake by the dawn , and had been trying to rouse mamma for an hour . She had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose stoical indifference was very provoking , especially when she knew she was going to see " her dear , white-haired old grand-papa , " who had never yet looked upon her sweet face ; although pen and ink had long since heralded her polite perfections . Yes , little pet must look her prettiest , for grand-papa 's eyes are not so dim , that the sight of a pretty face does n't cheer him like a ray of glad sunlight ; so the glossy waves of golden hair are nicely combed , and the bright dress put on , to heighten , by contrast , the dimpled fairness of the neck and shoulders ; then , the little white apron , to keep all tidy ; then the Cinderella boots , neatly laced . I can see you , little pet ! I wish I had you in my arms this minute ! Good bye ! How the little curls shake ! What a nice seat our tiny voyager has , by that pleasant open window , upon mamma 's knee ! How wonderfully fast the trees and houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? And how it makes her eyes wink , when the cars dash under the dark bridges , and how like the ringing of silver bells that little musical laugh is , when they dart out again into the fair sunlight . How cows , and horses , and sheep , all run at that horrid whistle . Little pet feels as though she was most a woman , to be traveling about , seeing so many fine things . On they dash !  --  it half takes her breath away  --  but she is not afraid ; no , indeed ! What little darling ever could be afraid , when its hand was in mamma 's love clasp ? Alas ! poor little pet ! Grand-papa 's eye grow weary watching for you , at the little cottage window . Grand-mamma says , " the cakes will be quite spoiled ; " and she " knits to her seam needle , " and then moves about the sitting-room uneasily ; now and then stopping to pat the little Kitty , that is to be pet 's play-fellow . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dew is falling , the stars are creeping out , and the little crickets and frogs have commenced their evening concert , and still little pet has n't come ! Where is the little stray waif ? Listen ! Among the " unrecognized dead " by the late RAILROAD ACCIDENT , was a female child , about three years of age ; fair complexion and hair ; had on a red dress , green sack , white apron , linen gaiters , tipped with patent leather , and white woolen stockings . Poor little pet ! Poor old grand-papa ! Go comfort him ; tell him it was a " shocking accident , " but then " nobody was to blame ; " and offer him a healing plaster for his great grief , in the shape of " damage " money . THE CHARITY ORPHANS . " Pleasant sight , is it not ? " said my friend , glancing complacently at a long procession of little charity children , who were passing , two and two  --  two and two  --  with closely cropped heads , little close-fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not , Fanny ? " Yes  --  no  --  no , said I , courageously , it gives me the heart-ache . Oh , I see as you do , that their clothes are clean and whole , and that they are drilled like a little regiment of soldiers , ( heads up , ) but I long to see them step out of those prim ranks , and shout and scamper . I long to stuff their little pockets full of anything  --  everything , that other little pets have . I want to get them round me , and tell them some comical stories to take the care-worn look out of their anxious little faces . I want to see them twist their little heads round when they hear a noise , instead of keeping them straight forward as if they were " on duty . " I want to know if anybody tucks them up comfortably when they go to bed , and gives them a good-night kiss . I want to know if they get a beaming smile , and a kind word in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in pain ; and if they dare say so , when they feel lonely , and have the heart-ache . I want to see the tear roll freely down the cheek , ( instead of being wiped slyly away , ) when they see happy little ones trip gaily past , hand in hand , with a kind father , or mother . I want to know if " Thanksgiving " and " Christmas " and " New Year 's " and " Home " are anything but empty sounds in their orphan ears . I know their present state is better than vicious poverty , and so I try to say with my friend , " it is a pleasant sight ; " but the words die on my lip ; for full well I know it takes something more than food , shelter and clothing , to make a child happy . Its little heart , like a delicate vine , will throw out its tendrils for something to lean on  --  something to cling to ; and so I can only say again , the sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GET ANGRY . " I hate you , " Aunt Fanny , said a little boy , pouting and snapping his boots with the little riding whip in his hand ; you laughed to-day at dinner , when I burned my mouth with my soup , and I never shall love you again  --  never !  --  said the little passionate boy . Now , Harry , what a pity !  --  and my pocket handkerchiefs all in the wash , too ! That 's right  --  laugh ;  --  now I 'll tell you a story . I 've been to the State Prison to-day , and I almost wish I had n't gone  --  such a sick feeling came over me when I saw those poor prisoners . Oh , Harry ! how pale and miserable they looked , in those ugly , striped clothes , with their heads closely shaven , working away at their different trades , with a stout man watching them so sharply , to see that they did n't speak to each other ; and some of them very young , too . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at them , for fear it would hurt their feelings , and I longed to tell them that my heart was full of pity , and not to get discouraged , and not to despair . Such little , close cells as they sleep in at night ,  --  it almost stifled me to think of it ,  --  and so dismal and cheerless , too , with an iron door to bolt them in . On Sunday they stay in their cells nearly all day , and some of the cells are so dark that they can not see even to read the Bible allowed them : and there they lie , thinking over , and over , and over , their own sad thoughts . So you ca n't wonder that they dread Sunday very much , and are very glad to be put to hard work again on Monday , to get rid of thinking . Then we saw them march into dinner  --  just like soldiers , in single file , with a guard close beside them , that they should not run away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid on those wooden plates , but you or I would have gone hungry a long while first . In fact , I think , Harry , that PRISON food would choke me any how , though it were roast turkey or plum pudding . I 'm quite sure my gypsey throat would refuse to swallow it . Then we went into the Hospital for the sick prisoners . It is hard to be sick in one 's own home , even , with kind friends around ; but to be sick in a prison !  --  to lie on such a narrow bed that you can not toss about ,  --  to bear , ( beside your own pain and misery , ) the moanings of your sick companions ,  --  to see through the grated windows the bright , blue sky , the far off hills , and the silver streams threading the green meadows ,  --  to be shut in from the fresh breeze , that would bring you life and health ,  --  to pine and waste away , and think to die , without one dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the sick prisoners had a little squirrel . The squirrel was a prisoner , too . He was in a cage  --  but then sometimes he was let out ; and to please me , the door was opened for him . Did n't he jump ? poor squirrel ! He had no soul  --  so he was n't as miserable as his sick keeper ; but I 'm mistaken if he would n't have liked a nut to crack , of his own finding in some leafy wood , where the green moss lies thickly cushioned , and the old trees serve him for ladders ! On a bench in the Hospital was seated a poor , sick black-boy . " Pompey 's " mother was a very foolish mother . She had always let him have his own way . If he cried for anything he always got it , and when he was angry and struck people , she never punished him for it ; so Pompey grew up a very bad boy , because his mother never taught him to govern his temper . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sent him to the State Prison , where I saw him . And he grew sick staying so long in doors , and now he was in a consumption  --  all wasted away  --  with such hollow cheeks , that it made the tears come to my eyes to look at him . Oh how glad I was when the keeper told me that next Sunday his time would be up , so that he could go out if he liked . The keeper said , " He had better stay there , because they could take good care of him , and he had no friends . " I guess the keeper did n't think that poor Pompey had rather crawl on his hands and knees out to the green fields , and die alone , with the sweet , fresh air fanning his poor temples , than to stay with all the doctors in the world in that tomb of a prison . Harry ! I wanted so much to go and shake hands with Pompey , and tell him how happy it made me to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I hoped the sun would shine just as bright as ever it could , and all the flowers blossom out on purpose for him to see ; and then I hoped that when his heart was so full of gladness he would feel like praying ; and then I hoped no cruel , hard-hearted person would point at him and say , " That is a State Prison boy , " and so make his heart all hard and wicked again , just as he was trying to be good . * * * And now , Harry , shake hands with me , and " make up . " You know if poor Pompey had n't got so angry , he would n't have been in prison ; and as for Aunt Fanny , she must learn to be as polite as a French woman , and never laugh again when you burn your mouth with a " hasty plate of soup . " " LITTLE BENNY . " So the simple head-stone said . Why did my eyes fill ? I never saw the little creature . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry shout , or listened for his tripping tread ; I never pillowed his little head , or bore his little form , or smoothed his silky locks , or laved his dimpled limbs , or fed his cherry lips with dainty bits , or kissed his rosy cheek as he lay sleeping . I did not see his eye grow dim ; or his little hand droop powerless ; or the dew of agony gather on his pale forehead ; I stood not with clasped hands and suspended breath , and watched the look that comes but once , flit over his cherub face . And yet , " little Benny , " my tears are falling ; for , somewhere , I know there 's an empty crib , a vacant chair , useless robes and toys , a desolate hearth-stone , and a weeping mother . " Little Benny ! " It was all her full heart could utter ; and it was enough . It tells the whole story . A RAP ON SOMEBODY 'S KNUCKLES . It is very strange my teacher never says a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lessons well . I have n't had an " error " since I came to school six months ago . I have n't been " delinquent " or " tardy . " I have never broken a rule . Now there 's Harry Gray , that fat boy yonder , with the dull eyes and frilled shirt-collar , who never can say his lesson without some fellow prompts him . He comes in half an hour after school begins , and goes home an hour before it is done , and eats pea-nuts all the time he stays ; he has all the medals , and the master is always patting him on the head , and smiling at him , and asking him " if the room is warm enough , " and all that ; I do n't see through it . My dear , honest , conscientious , unsophisticated little Moses ! if you only knew what a rich man Harry Gray 's father was ; what nice old wine he keeps in his cellar ; how easy his carriage cushions are ; what nice nectarines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the master " is comforted in his inner and outer man thereby , you 'd understand how the son of such a nabob could n't be anything but an embryo " Clay , " or " Calhoun , " or " Webster , "  --  though he did n't know " B from a buzzard . " Are you aware , my boy , that your clothes , though clean and neat , are threadbare and patched ?  --  that your mother is a poor widow , whom nobody knows ?  --  that no " servant man " ever brought your satchel to school for you ?  --  that you have positively been seen carrying a loaf of bread home from the grocer 's ?  --  and that " New Year 's day " passed by , without your appropriating any of your mother 's hard earnings to make " a present " to your disinterested and discriminating teacher ? How can you be anything but the dullest and stupidest boy in the school ? It is a marvel to me that " the master " condescends to hear you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't cry ; hold on a while . If your forehead tells the truth , you 'll be President of the United States by and by . Then , " the master " ( quite oblivious of Harry Gray , ) will go strutting round , telling all creation and his cousin , that he had the honor of first teaching your " young ideas how to shoot ! " Wo n't that be fun ? Oh , I tell you , Moses ! Fanny has seen some strange specimens of human nature . Still she tells you , ( with tears in her eyes , ) that the Master above is the " friend of the friendless ; " and you must believe it too , my little darling , and wait , and trust .

Wish she would let me lay my cheek to hers , ( if I would not tumble her curls , or her collar . ) Wish she would not promise me something " very nice , " and then forget all about it . Wish she would answer my questions , and not always say , " Do n't bore me , Freddy ! " Wish when we go out in the country , she would n't make me wear my gloves , lest I should " tan my hands .

Wish I could go over on that high hill , where the bright sun is going down , and just touch it with my finger . Wish I did n't keep thinking of things which puzzle me , when nobody will stop to tell me the reason for anything . If I ask Betty , she says , " Do n't be a fool , Master Freddy !

Now I am going to tell you a story about little Clara . Those of you who live in the city will understand it ; but some of my little readers may live in the country , ( or at least I hope they do , ) where a beggar is seldom seen ; or if he is , can always get of the good , nice , kind-hearted farmer , a bowl of milk , a fresh bit of bread , and liberty to sleep in the barn on the sweet-scented hay ; therefore , it will be hard for you to believe that there is anybody in the wide world with enough to eat , and drink , and wear , who does not care whether a poor fellow creature starves or not ; or whether he lives or dies . But listen to my story . One bright , sunny morning I was walking in Broadway , ( New-York , ) looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fine as peacocks , and just about as silly  --  gazing at the pretty shop windows , full of silks , and satins , and ribbons , looking very much as if a rainbow had been shivered there  --  looking at the rich people 's little children , with their silken hose , and plumed hats , and velvet tunics , tip-toeing so carefully along , and looking so frightened lest somebody should soil their nice clothes  --  when a little , plaintive voice struck upon my ear  --  " Please give me a penny , Madam  --  only a penny  --  to buy a loaf of bread ? " Illustration : ONLY A PENNY . I turned my head : there stood a little girl of six years ,  --  so filthy , dirty  --  so ragged , that she scarcely looked like a human being . Her skin was coated with dust ; her pretty curly locks were one tangled mass ; her dress was fluttering in strings around her bare legs and shoeless feet  --  and the little hand she held out to me for " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeleton 's . She looked so very hungry , I would n't make her talk till I had given her something to eat ; so I took her to a baker 's , and bought her some bread and cakes ; and it would have made you cry ( you , who were never hungry in your life , ) to see her swallow it so greedily , just like a little animal . Then I asked her name , and found out ' t was " Clara ; " that she had no papa ; that while he lived he was very cruel , and used to beat her and her mother ; and that now her mother was cruel too , and drank rum ; that she sent little Clara out each morning to beg ,  --  or if she could n't beg , to steal ,  --  but at any rate to bring home something , " unless she wanted a beating . " Poor little Clara !  --  all alone threading her way through the great , wicked city  --  knocked and jostled about ,  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to steal , ( not because God saw her  --  for she did n't know anything about Him , ) but for fear of policemen and prisons  --  so she wandered about , hour after hour , saying pitifully to the careless crowd , " Only a penny  --  please give me a penny to buy a loaf of bread ! " Yes  --  Clara 's mother was very cruel ; but God forbid , my little innocent children , that you should ever know how hunger , and thirst , and misery , may sometimes turn even that holy thing  --  a mother 's love  --  to bitterness . Poor Clara ! she had never known a better home than the filthy , dark cellar , where poor people in cities huddle together like hunted cattle ; her little feet had never pressed the soft , green meadows ; her little fingers had never plucked the sweet wild-flowers ; her little eyes had never seen the bright , blue sky , save between dark brick walls . Her little head often pained her . She was foot-weary and heart-sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of heaven , " where the weary rest . " Was n't it very pitiful ? Well , little Clara kissed my hand when she had eaten enough  --  ( it was so odd for Clara to have enough )  --  and her sunken eyes grew bright , and she said  --  " Now I shall not be beaten , because I 've something left to carry home ; " so she told me where she lived , and I bade her good bye , and told her I would come and see her mother to-morrow . The next day I started again to find little Clara 's mother . I was very happy going along , because I meant , if I could , to get her away from her cruel mother ; to make her clean and neat ; to teach her how to read and spell , and show to her that the world was not all darkness  --  not all sin , and tears , and sorrow ; and to tell her of that kind God who loves everything that He has made . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun looked so bright to me  --  the sky so fair ,  --  and I could scarcely make my feet go fast enough . Turning a corner suddenly , I met a man bearing a child 's coffin . I can not tell you why I stood still  --  why my heart sank like lead  --  why I could not let him pass , till I asked him what little form he was bearing away ,  --  or why my heart told me , before he answered , that it was my poor little Clara . Yes  --  it was she ! I was too late  --  she was in the little coffin ! No hearse  --  no mourners  --  no tolling bell ! Borne along  --  unnoticed  --  uncared for  --  through the busy , crowded , noisy , streets . But , dear children , kind Angels looked pitying down , and Clara " hungers no more  --  nor thirsts anymore  --  neither shall the sun light on her , nor any heat . " A LITTLE BOY WITH A BIG HEART . Such a rich man as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shops , and farms as he owned ; so many horses and carriages ; such a big house as he lived in , by the Park , and so many servants as he had in it ,  --  but he loved little Georgey better than any of them , and bought him toys enough to fill a shop , live animals enough to stock a menagerie , and jackets and trousers enough to clothe half the boys in New-York . Georgey was a pretty boy ; he had a broad , noble forehead , large , dark , loving eyes , and a form as straight and lithe as a little Indian 's . His mother was very proud of him ,  --  not because he was good , but because he was pretty . She was a very foolish woman , and talked to him a great deal about his fine clothes , and his curling hair ; but for all that she did n't make out to spoil Georgey . He did n't care an old marble , not he , for all the fine clothes in Christendom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curl on his merry little head clipped off . Georgey had no brothers or sisters . He was so sorry for that  --  he would rather have had such a playmate than all the toys his father bought him . His little heart was brim full of love , and his birds , and rabbits , and ponies were well enough , but they could n't say , " Georgey , I love you ; " neither could he make them understand what he was thinking about ; so he wearied of them , and would often linger in the street , and look after the little groups of children so wistfully , that I quite pitied him . I used to think that , with all his money , he was n't half as happy as little Pat and Neil Connor , two little Irish brothers who played hop-scotch every day under my window . * * * It was a very cold day in January . Jack Frost had been out all day on a frolic , and was still busily at work . He had drawn all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and flowers , and great towering castles , and tall-masted ships , and church spires , and little cottages , ( so oddly shaped ) ; beside birds that " Audubon " never dreamed of , and animals that Noah never huddled into the ark . Then he festooned all the eaves , the fences , and trees , and bushes with crystal drops , which sparkled and glittered in the sunbeams like royal diamonds  --  then he hung icicles on the poor old horses ' noses , and tripped up the heels of precise old bachelors , and sent the old maids spinning round on the sidewalks , till they were perfectly ashamed of themselves ; and then he got into the houses , and burst and cracked all the water pitchers , and choked up the steady old pump , so that it might as well have been without a nose as with one , and pinched the cheeks of the little girls till they were as red as a pulpit cushion , blew right through the key hole on grandpa 's poor , rheumatic old back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cloaks , and shawls , and furred wrappers , till they shook as if they had an ague fit . I verily believe he 'd just as quick trip up our minister 's heels as yours or mine ! Oh , he is a graceless rogue  --  that Jack Frost ! and many 's the time he 's tipped Aunt Fanny 's venerable nose with indigo . Georgey did n't care a penny whistle for the fellow , all muffled up to the chin in his little wadded velvet sack , with a rich cashmere scarf of his mother 's wound about his neck , and a velvet cap crushed down over his bright , curly head . How the sleighs did fly past ! with their gaily fringed buffaloes , and prancing horses necklaced with little tinkling bells . How merry the pretty ladies peeped from out their gay worsted hoods ! Oh ! it was a pretty sight ,  --  Georgey liked it  --  everybody moved so briskly , and seemed so happy ! What ails Georgey now ? He has crossed the street , stopped short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks quite beautiful . Ah ! he has spied a little apple girl , seated upon the icy pavement . The wind is making merry with her thin rags ,  --  her little toes peep , blue and benumbed , from out her half-worn shoes ,  --  and she is blowing on her stiffened fingers , vainly trying to keep them warm . Georgey looked down at his nice warm coat , and then at Kate 's thin cotton gown . Georgey never was cold in his life , never hungry . His eyes fill  --  his little breast heaves . Then quickly untwisting the thick , warm scarf from his little throat , he throws it round her shivering form and says , with a glad smile , That will warm you !  --  and bounds out of sight before she can thank him . Old Mr. Prince stands by , wiping his eyes , and says , " God bless the boy !  --  that 's worth a dozen sermons ; I 'll send a load of wood to little Kate 's mother . " MAY MORNING . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She will smile on you one minute , and frown on you the next  --  toss you flowers with one hand , and hail stones with the other . I know her . Many 's the time she has coaxed me out of a good , warm bed , wheedled me into the fields in a white dress and thin shoes , and then sent me home wet as a drowned kitten , with a snapping headache , to a cold breakfast . Yes  --  I used to " go a-Maying . " Such a watching of the clouds and weather-cock the night before ; such a fixing of sashes , and wreaths , and hats , and dresses ; so many charges to Betty , the cook , to wake us up by daylight ; such a wondering how mother and father could lie a-bed of a May morning ;  --  such a tossing , and twisting , and turning , the night before ; such a putting aside of muslin curtains , to see if it was n't " most daylight ; " such surprise when Aunt Esther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it was only ten o'clock ! " Such broken slumbers as we had  --  such funny dreams  --  and such a galvanic jump out of bed the next morning , when Betty gave us one of her pump-handle shakes . Then such a time washing , and combing , and dressing ! such long faces when a great thumping rain drop fell upon the window ! such a consultation as to the expediency of wearing our " best clothes ; " such clapping of hands when the sun finally shone out again ; such fears lest Anna Maria and Sarah Sophia 's mother would n't let them come to meet us as they promised . Such a tip-toeing over wet sidewalks , out into the country ; such a talk after we got off the brick pavements , as to which was the prettiest road ; such a wondering what had become of all the flowers ; such regrets that we did n't think to fill our pockets with crackers ; such a picking out of pebble stones from thin shoes ; such a drawing up of thin shawls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black cloud emptied itself down on our " best clothes ; " such congratulations when our good-natured , rosy-faced , merry milkman meeting us , stowed and wedged us away amid his milk-cans , to bring us safely back to the city . Such a creeping in the back way , lest " that torment of a Tom " should laugh at us ; such a coaxing of Betty to cook us a good , hot breakfast ; and such a gaping and yawning in school for a week after . Oh ! you know all about it ,  --  everybody knows that it is just as sure to rain on a May morning , as it is to thaw when your schoolmaster attempts to treat himself and you to a sleigh-ride on your hoarded ninepences ! So take my advice and turn your back on May  --  she is a fickle little gypsey . Ask the first Irishman you meet if June is n't the month to go a-Maying ?  --  June , with her light , green robe , and violet-slippered feet , and sweet , warm breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go a-Maying ! Pat will tell you so . THE LITTLE DANDELION MERCHANT . Tattered straw hat , buttonless jacket , and shoeless feet . That is a large basket for so young a lad as Jemmy to carry . He brushed the dew from the grass this morning by daylight ; his stock in trade consisting of only a jack-knife and that basket ; but " Uncle Sam " owns the dandelions , and Jim is a Yankee , ( born with a trading bump , ) and ninepence a basket is something to think of . To be sure he has cut his bare feet with a stone , but that 's a trifle . See , he is on his way to the big house yonder , for the old housekeeper and her mistress have both a tooth for dandelions . Jemmy swings the tattered part of his hat round behind , and using a patch of grass for a mat , steps lightly up the avenue . How still and mirror-like the little pond looks . How gracefully the long willow-tips bend to kiss the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is not air enough to shake the perfume from out the locust blossoms , and old Bruno has crawled into the shade , although the sun is not two hours high . What a fine old house ! and how many dandelions somebody must have dug to buy it !  --  Jemmy 's arithmetic could n't compute it ; and that fine statue , too , on the brink of the pond , with its finger on its lip ; ( it 's no use , is it Jemmy ? ) the birds wo n't " hush " for the daintiest bit of marble ever sculptured ; nested to their minds ; no taxes to pay ;  --  nothing to do but warble . May no sportsman 's gun send them quivering through the branches . Now Jemmy has reached the kitchen door , and gives a modest rap . Smart " Tim , " the footman , opens it , and with one application of his aristocratic toe , sends the dandelion basket spinning down the avenue ! Jemmy 's Yankee blood is up ; his dark eyes flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory teeth together , and brings his little bare foot down on the gravel-walk , with an emphasis ; but he sees it is no use , he is no match for the pampered footman ; and great rebellious tears gather in his eyes , as he picks up his scattered treasures , saying ,  --  " Ninepence would have bought my book . " " Would it , Jemmy ? Well  --  here it is  --  ' the fairies ' have sent it you . " What a pretty picture he makes , as he pushes back his thick locks , and flashes those great , dark , Italian eyes  --  it is worth a hundred ninepences to see such a beaming face . After all , dear reader , one need not be a " Rothschild , " to make a fellow creature glad . Happiness is a cheaper thing than we are apt to think . WALTER WILLET . Did you ever live in a hotel ? I dare say you may have , ( some time or other , when you have been on a journey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope not ; because a good , cozy , quiet house of one 's own , away from noise and bustle , is so much better for little children  --  and grown people too . Walter lived in a hotel , with his father and mother and two little sisters . Walter was very tired of it . His mother never staid in the nursery ; she was always down in the drawing-room , talking to finely-dressed ladies ; and , when his father came home from the store , he never played with his little boy , but went into the gentlemen 's room , to smoke cigars . The nursery was very small , and Walter 's two little sisters cried a great deal  --  sometimes from pain , and sometimes because Betty , the nurse , got cross and shook them roughly , and took no pains to amuse them when their mother staid away such a long , long while . So , little Walter did n't fancy staying in the nursery much , and as he was not allowed to go into the drawing-room , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on awry , or his boots have a mud speck on them , the poor child had nothing left to do but wander round the hall and lobbies , and see the chambermaids sweep the rooms , and hear the waiters swear at each other , and watch the stages and trunks and passengers come and go . When Walter wearied of this , he 'd creep into the " bar-room , " and watch the clerk pour out brandy , and wine and whiskey for the gentlemen to drink . Walter liked to see them drink it , because it made them laugh so hard , and clap each other on the back , and tell such funny stories ; and then , sometimes , they would call to him and feed him with the sugar and brandy in the bottom of the tumbler ; and Walter thought it very sweet and nice , and made up his mind that when he grew to be a man , he 'd have just as much brandy as ever he could drink . Walter 's mamma did n't think , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll , that her little curly headed Walter was learning how to be a drunkard ; no , she was a careless young mamma , and did n't think , ( perhaps she did n't know , ) how closely little children must be watched , to make them grow good men and women . Sometimes Walter went down to peep into the kitchen . There is always a great deal going on in a hotel kitchen ,  --  so many turkeys and chickens and birds and fish to fix for dinner . Walter liked to see them roast a little pig whole , and then put an ear of corn in his mouth and lay him on a plate  --  or make a lobster salad look like a turtle , or a boiled ham like a pork-upine ! Then Pietro , the cook , was worth looking at , himself . He was a great six-footer of an Italian ; with eyes  --  ( my senses , how big and how black they were ! ) Walter thought he must look like the robbers that his uncle John , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , Pietro had such big , fierce whiskers , too , and always wore a bright scarlet cap , with a long gilt tassel , and altogether , for a cook , he looked very picturesque  --  ( Aunt Fanny knows that 's a long word , but you must look it out in the dictionary . ) When Pietro got angry with any of the waiters , I promise you he 'd make his frying-pan fly across the kitchen as if it were bewitched , and then poor little Walter would fly up stairs as fast as his little fat legs could carry him . But Pietro was not always cross , for all he looked as though he had been fed on thunder ; no  --  he often tossed Walter a bunch of raisins , or a rosy apple ; and it was quite beautiful when he did smile , to see his white teeth glitter . Sometimes , when he was waiting for some dish to cook , he would take Walter on his knee , and tell him of his own beautiful bright Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes , and where ( if we might believe Pietro ) one might dance and sing and eat grapes forever , without working for them ; but when Walter looked up innocently and said , " then why did n't you stay there , Pietro ? " Pietro would drop him as if he had been a red-hot potatoe , and hiss something in Italian from between his teeth , that poor little Walter could not begin to understand ; but as he was a pretty sensible little boy , he always took himself off till Pietro felt better natured , and asked him no more questions . One rainy day Walter had wandered all over the hotel , trying to get amused . The nurse had a friend call to see her , and she had given his little sisters all Walter 's playthings , to keep them quiet , that they need not trouble her ; and Walter 's mamma told him , when he put his little head into the drawing-room , that " she did n't care what he did , if he did n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his wits ' ends to know what to do with himself . Finally it struck him that it would be fine fun to " play fish . " So he went to one of his mother 's drawers and got a long string , on the end of which he fastened a crooked pin ; then he went way up  --  up  --  up  --  so many flights of stairs , to the very highest entry he could find , way to the top of the house ; from there the stair-case wound round , and round , and round , like a cork-screw , down into the front entry , far enough to make you dizzy to look over . Well , Walter let down his line , and then he reached over his little curly head to see how far it went . Poor , merry , bright-eyed little Walter !  --  how can I tell the rest ? Over he went , beating and bruising his little head  --  down  --  down  --  till he reached the marble floor in the lower entry , where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ,  --  but that did n't bring back her poor , neglected little boy ; but it made her a better mother . She loves to stay in the nursery now , with Walter 's little sisters nestled in her lap ; and sometimes when they smile , she will part the sunny curls from their little foreheads , and the tears will fall like rain drops on their rosy faces , as she remembers her poor , darling , mangled , little Walter . CHILDREN , DID YOU EVER HEAR OF MR . " THEY SAY ? " I sha n't ask you if you ever saw him , because I know that , like other cowards , he generally skulks out of sight ; but I 'm very sure if you could get a peep at him , you would find that he had a " cloven foot . " But if I ca n't tell you who Mr. " They Say " is , I can tell you what he is . It quite drives him frantic to see any person happier than himself , or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , or more money , than he has , he will knit his ugly brows to contrive somehow to give them the heart-ache . Sometimes he will do it in one way , and sometimes in another ; sometimes he will do it by shrugging his shoulders , shaking his head , and looking as if he could say something dreadful bad about a person , if he only had a mind to . He has made many a poor woman , who had no brave arm to strike the coward down , weep her bright eyes dim , till she longed to lay her aching head with the silent company in the quiet church-yard . You 'd suppose that nobody who owned a heart , would ever choose the society of such a wicked villain . You 'd suppose nobody who loved God , would ever listen to him , or repeat his false sayings ; but , alas ! people are so fond of hearing " something new , " that they ca n't make up their minds to turn their backs upon him ; so they sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more to tell , and then they draw down their faces , and tell him he " ought not to talk so ! "  --  just as if Mr. " They Say " did n't see that they were perfectly delighted with him ? Certainly , he goes off laughing in his sleeve to think they suppose him such a fool . Mr. " They Say " is a very great traveler . It is astonishing how much ground he can get over without the help of steamboats , cars , stages , or telegraph wires . He may be found in a thousand places at once  --  in every little village in the United States  --  in every house and shop and hotel and office . Editors are very fond of Mr. " They Say . " They always give him the best chair in the office , for he is an amazing help to them . In fact , it is Aunt Fanny 's opinion , that their newspapers would die a natural death without him . To be sure , he sometimes gets them into shocking scrapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist and turn out of it . Yes , Mr. " They Say " is a cowardly liar ! He could n't look an honest man straight in the eye , any more than he could face a cannon ball . He would turn as pale as a snow-wreath , and melt into nothing just about as quick . Oh ! Aunt Fanny knows all about him . So when he comes on her track , she looks straight at her inkstand , and minds her own business . She knows that nothing plagues the old fellow like being treated with perfect indifference . That 's the way to kill him off ! THE LITTLE MARTYR . How brightly the silver moon shines in that little bow window ! Let us peep in . What do you see ? A little girl lies there sleeping . She is very fair  --  tears are upon her cheeks  --  she sighs heavily , and clasps a letter tightly to her little bosom . She is young to know sorrow . Life 's morning should be all sunshine ;  --  clouds come at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one glides gently into Nettie 's room . It is a very old lady , but her form is drawn up as straight as your own , though her face is seamed with wrinkles and her hand trembles with age . She is stern and hard-featured . Should you meet her anywhere you would feel a chill come over you , as if the bright sun were clouded . You never would dare to lay your head upon her lap , and you would not think of kissing her , any more than you would a stone post . See ! she creeps up to Nettie 's bed , and a heavy frown gathers on her wrinkled face as she spies the letter on her bosom . Now she draws it from between the child 's fingers , reads it , mutters something between her closed teeth , and then burns it to cinders in the candle ; then she shakes her head , and frowning darkly at little Nettie , glides , spectre-like , out of the room . * * * The same bright moon shines in at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a lady sits there , toiling , toiling , toiling , though her lids long ago drooped heavily , and the candle is nearly burned to the socket . Why does she toil ? Why does she sigh ? Why does she get up and walk the floor as if afraid that sleep may overtake her ? Ah ! a mother 's love never dies out . That lady is Nettie 's mother . She has something to work for ;  --  she is trying to earn money enough ( cent by cent ) to bring home , and clothe and feed that poor little weeping , home-sick Nettie , who cried herself to sleep , with her mother 's letter hugged to her bosom . The old lady whom you saw burning Nettie 's letter , was her grandmother . She was very jealous of Nettie 's mother , because her son ( Nettie 's father , ) loved her so well ; and after he died she revenged herself upon her , by giving her all the pain she could . She promised if Nettie would come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Nettie 's mother and little sister Ida had n't enough to eat , Nettie had to go and live with the old lady . She cried very hard , and her mother cried too , and so did Nettie 's little sister Ida ; but the old lady promised that Nettie should come often and see them , and that they should come and see her . But she only said so to get Nettie away . After she got her she was very unkind to her , and used to tell her that her mother " was a foolish woman  --  not fit to bring her up "  --  and when Nettie got up to leave the room , because she could n't bear to hear her talk against her dear mother , the old lady would shake her , and bring her back , and sit her down on the chair so hard as to make her cry with pain , and then force her to hear all she had to say . You may be sure that all this made poor little Nettie feel very miserable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to drive hoop , because it was " boy 's play ; " she was n't allowed to go to walk , for fear she would " wear her shoes out ; " she was n't allowed to read story-books , for fear she " would n't study ; " she was n't allowed to play with dolls , because " it was silly ; " she must n't go visiting , because " it was n't proper ; " she must n't have a playmate come to see her , because " it made a disturbance ; " she could n't have a kitten , because " animals were a nuisance ; " she must n't talk to her grandmother , because " little girls must be seen and not heard . " So she sat there , like a little automaton , and watched the clock tick , and counted the times her grandmother put on and took off her spectacles , and thought of her mother and little sister till she bit her finger nails so that they bled . Once in a great while , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave to go and see her mother . Then her grandmother always put on her worst clothes , to try to make her ashamed to go , and when she found that Nettie did n't care for her clothes , if she could only see her mother , she scolded and fretted and worried her , and gave her so many charges to come home at a particular hour , else she should be punished , that poor Nettie did n't enjoy her visit at all , but would start and turn pale every time she heard a clock strike , and get so nervous as to bring on a bad headache ; and then , when she got home , the old lady would say that it was just like her mother to make her sick , and that she should n't go again . Perhaps you 'll ask if Nettie 's mother never went to see her . You know it costs money to go in the cars , and Nettie 's mother had no money , though she tried hard to earn it . Once in a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but she always had to carry something in her pocket for little Ida and herself to eat , for the old lady would n't offer them even a glass of water , because she did n't want them to come and see Nettie . When they got there poor little Nettie would meet them at the door , with a troubled , frightened look upon her face ; and without speaking a word , would lead them through the entry by the hand into her own little room ; then she 'd close the door , and after looking timidly about the room , jump into her mother 's lap and kiss her hands and face , and cry and laugh , and hug little Ida ; and Ida and her mother would cry too , and then Nettie would ask , sobbing , " if her mother had n't earned money enough yet to take her away , " and say that she 'd rather starve with her mother , than live there , she was so wretched . And Nettie 's mother would kiss her , and soothe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toiling to get money ; and then Nettie would cry for fear her mother would get sick , and then they 'd all kiss each other , and almost wish that God would let them die ( then ) just as they were  --  together . * * * Again the silver harvest-moon shines down upon the silent city . Through a curtained window its rays fall softly upon a bed , where lies a lady sleeping . See ! she smiles ! What ! Nettie 's mother smile ? Ah , yes ; for Nettie 's golden head is pillowed on her breast . Nettie 's loving arms are twined about her neck . God is good ;  --  the " barrel of meal " does not fail , nor the " cruse of oil . " Well may Nettie 's mother smile , now that all she craves on earth is in her clasping arms . SELFISH MATTHEW . Such a selfish boy as Matthew was ! You would n't have given a fig to play with him . He had carpenters ' tools and books , and chequers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kites , and little ships and skates , and snow-shovels and sleds . Oh ! I could n't tell you all he had , if I talked a week . Well , if you went in of a Saturday afternoon to play with him , he 'd watch all these things as closely as a cat would a mouse ; and if you went within shooting distance of them , he 'd sing out ,  --  " D-o-n-'t ; t-h-a-t- 's m-i-n-e ! " Of course it was n't much fun to go and see him . You 'd got to play everything he wanted , or he 'd pout and say he would n't play at all . He had slices of cake , that he had hoarded up till they were as hard as his heart ; and cents , and dimes , and half dimes , that he used to handle and jingle and count over , like any little miser . All the beggars in the world could n't have coaxed one out of his pocket had they been starving to death . Then Matthew was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go screaming to his mother if he got a scratch , as if a wild tiger were after him ; and if you said anything to him about it , he 'd pout , and stick out his lips so far that you might have hung your hat on ' em ! It was like drawing teeth to get him to go across the room to hand you a newspaper . He ought to have had a little world all to himself , had n't he ? Well , I used to pity him  --  there was nothing child-like about him . He always seemed to me like a little wizzled-up , miserly old man . He never tossed his cap up in the air , and laughed a good hearty laugh ; he never sprang or ran , or climbed or shouted ; no  --  he crawled round as if he had lead weights on his heels , and talked without scarce moving his lips , and wore a face as long as the horse 's in your father 's barn . Such a boy as he was ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some life into him somehow . When his mother was told of his faults , she 'd say , " Oh , he 'll out-grow them by and by . " I knew better . I knew that his selfishness would grow as fast as he did ; and that when he came to be a man , he would be unfeeling to the poor , and make hard bargains with them , and wring the last penny out of their poor , threadbare pockets . Poor Matthew ! he 'll never be happy ; no  --  he never 'll know the luxury of making a sad face bright , or of drying up the tear of the despairing ; and when he dies he ca n't carry his money with him  --  he has got to leave it at the tomb door ,  --  and who , do you suppose , will come there to mourn for him ? Oh , dear children , be generous  --  if you have n't but half a stick of candy , give somebody a bite of it . Perhaps some child will say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a mistake ; that boy or girl is n't living who has nothing to give . Give your sympathy  --  give pleasant words and beaming smiles to the sad and weary-hearted . If a little child goes to your school who is poorly clad , patched , darned ; nay , even ragged ;  --  if the tear starts to his eye when your schoolmates laugh , and shun , and refuse to play with him  --  just you go right up and put your arms round his neck ; ask him to play with you . Love him ;  --  love sometimes is meat and drink and clothing . You can all love the sad and sorrowful . Then never say you have " nothing to give . " CITY CHILDREN . I wonder where all the little children are ? I ca n't find any here in New-York . There are plenty of young gentlemen and ladies , with little high-heeled boots , and ruffled shirts , who step gingerly , carry perfumed handkerchiefs , use big words , talk about parties , but who would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jump rope  --  little pale , candy-fed creatures , with lustreless eyes , flabby limbs , and no more life than a toad imbedded in a rock ,  --  little tailor and milliner " lay figures , " stiff , fine and artificial . No ; there are no little children here . I 'm very sorry ;  --  I love little children . I used to know some once , with broad , full chests ; plump , round limbs ; feet that knew how to run , and hands that could venture to go through an entry without drawing on a kid glove ,  --  blithe , merry little children , who got up and went to bed with the sun ; who fed on fresh , new milk , and stepped on daisies , and knew more about butter-cups and clover blossoms , than parties and fashions ,  --  little guileless children , who danced and jumped and laughed for the same reason the birds sing  --  because they could n't help it ,  --  who did n't care any more than the birds , whether their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they could dart and skim and hop where they liked , warble when they had a mind , and fold their wings where they pleased , when weary . But these little city hot-house plants , shivering , shrinking , drooping  --  I had almost said dying , every time the wind blows  --  it quite makes my heart ache . I think I must go hunt up their mammas , and beg them to give their little sensitive plants more air and sunshine , to make them hardy . Dear me ! the mammas here are never at home . Some are in the great ladies ' saloon ( bright with gilding and mirrors , ) in Broadway , sipping red " cordial , " eating sugared wine drops and French cakes , and chattering with the gentlemen ; some are at Madam Modeste 's , planning a new ball dress , and talking about feathers and fashions ; some are looking at a set of diamonds at the jewellers ; and some are still in bed , although it is high noon , because they danced themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose you must stay in your heated nurseries , bleaching like potato sprouts in a dark cellar , till Molly or Betty think best to let you out . Well , Aunt Fanny would be so glad to tie a little sun-bonnet on your head , put on a dress loose enough to run in , and take you off into the country a while . She 'd show you little cups and saucers , made of acorns , that would beat all they have in the Broadway toy-shops , ( and cost you nothing , either ) ; and soft , green seats of moss , embroidered with little golden flowers , much handsomer than any the upholsterer could put in your mamma 's drawing room , ( and which never fade in the sunlight ) ; then she 'd show you a pretty picture of bright green fields , where a silver stream goes dancing through , where little fish dart beneath , where the heated cattle come to drink , and the little birds dip their wings , then are off and away ! Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the purple geranium grows ; where the bright scarlet columbine blushes , and where the pale wax plant hides under its glossy green leaf . I know where the blue eyed anemone blossoms ; I know where the bright lobelia nods its royal scarlet head ; ( I know how to pull off my shoes and wade in after it , too ) ; and I know how to make a wreath of it for your pretty little head . Oh , I know how to make your eyes shine  --  and your little heart happy . So tie on your sun-bonnet , and come with me ,  --  the more the merrier . I do n't believe your mammas will ever know you , when I bring you back . ROSALIE AND BETTY . Everybody called Rosalie a beauty . Everybody was right . Her cheeks looked like a ripe peach ; her hair waved over as fair a forehead as ever a zephyr kissed ; her eyes and mouth were as perfect as eyes and mouth could be ; no violet was softer or bluer than the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became Rosalie , and whatever she did was gracefully done . Yes , everybody thought Rosalie was " a beauty . " Rosalie thought so herself . So , she took no pains to be good , or amiable , or obliging . She never cared about learning anything , for she said to herself , I can afford to have my own way ; I can afford to be a dunce if I like ; I shall be always sought and admired for my pretty face . So , Rosalie dressed as tastefully as she and the dress-maker knew how , and looked up to show her fine eyes , and down to show her long eye-lashes , and held up her dress and hopped over little imaginary puddles , to show her pretty feet ; and smiled to show her white teeth ; and danced to show her fine form  --  and was as brilliant and as brainless as a butterfly . Now , I suppose you think that Rosalie was very happy . Not at all ! She was in a perfect fidget lest she should not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the while , for fear some prettier face would come along , and eclipse hers . If she went to a party and every person in the room ( but one ) admired her , she would fret herself sick , because that one did n't bow down and worship her . Never having studied or read anything , Rosalie could talk nothing but nonsense ; so , everybody who conversed with her , talked nonsense , too , and paid her silly compliments , and made her believe that all she needed to make her quite an angel was a pair of wings ; and then she would hold her pretty head on one side , and simper ; and they would go away laughing in their sleeves , and saying , " What a vain little fool Rosalie is ! " Now , Rosalie 's cousin Hetty was as plain as a chestnut-bur . She had not a single pretty feature in her face . Nobody ever thought of calling Hetty a beauty , and she knew it ! She was used to being overlooked ; but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ,  --  not she . She just put her mind on something else . She studied , and read books , and learned a great many useful things ; so , she had a great deal in her mind to think of , and went singing about as happy as could be , without minding whether anybody noticed her or not . So she grew up sweet-tempered , amiable , generous and happy . When she went into company , strangers would say , " What a plain little body Hetty is . " If they could not find anybody else to talk to , they 'd go speak to her . Then Hetty would look up at them with one of her quiet smiles , and commence talking . She would say a great many very sensible things , and some queer ones , and they would listen  --  and listen  --  and listen  --  and by and by look at their watch and wonder what had made time fly so ; and then go home , wondering to themselves how they could ever call such an agreeable girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody learned to love her when they found out what a beautiful soul she had ; and while Rosalie was pining and fretting herself sick because her beauty was fading , and her admirers were dropping off one by one , to flatter prettier faces , Hetty went quietly on her way , winning hearts and  --   --  keeping them , too . THE CRYSTAL PALACE . How many of my little readers have seen the Crystal Palace , in New-York ? Those of you who have , can skip these pages , while I talk to some of your little bright-eyed country cousins , who have never been there . You know , my dear little daisies , that poor city children , who have to walk on brick pavements , and breathe bad air , ought to have something by way of a sugar plum , now and then , to make up for it . So , you must n't pout because they have seen the Crystal Palace , and you have not . You know John Bull got up a Crystal Palace in England , some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own making ,  --  not to sell , but to show the great crowd who came to look at them what they could do when they tried . It was a grand thing , because it made them anxious to finish off everything in the best possible manner ; and as many of the articles were very useful , it did a great deal of good . Then , it brought thousands of people to see it , and that made Adam 's sons and daughters better acquainted , and more sociable , and happier ; so , it was a very excellent thing on that account . Well , you know that we Americans are a very smart people , ( ask your grandfather if we are not , ) and we made up our minds that we would show John Bull , and Sandy , and Pat , a Crystal Palace of our own ; and when an American says he will do a thing  --  it is done ! So , I was not at all astonished at what I saw last night ;  --  such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  such a blaze of light , ( for it was evening ) my eyes were almost put out ! I could n't begin to tell you all the pretty things there were in it , but if you wish to know what I wanted more than anything else , it was a little marble statue ( I suppose you would call it " an image " ) of a sleeping child . It had the prettiest , plumpest little dimpled limbs , you ever saw , and such an innocent little cherub face ; I wanted to catch it up and run away with it . There were a great many very beautiful statues there , some of which would have made you cuddle very close up to your mother , and hold her hand very tight ; for instance , one statue representing a dead mother with a live baby lying on her breast , and a great , strong eagle fastening its claws in the little baby to carry it off . And then , there was a statue of an enormous bear , giving a poor man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; he would n't have had to squeeze you at all to kill you , for the very sight of such a grizzly monster would have scared you to death in an instant . Then there was a glass case full of swords , and dirks , and daggers , and all sorts of instruments to kill people ; and you would have been as glad as I was , had you seen them hanging up there so harmlessly , instead of making widows and orphans , on the battlefield . Then , there were beautiful pianos with silver keys , and rich sofas , and bedsteads , and chairs , and tables , and bureaus ; and pretty , tempting work-boxes , full of all sorts of knick-knacks to tempt ladies to be industrious ; and such dainty little writing desks !  --  oh , I can tell you , it was very hard work not to covet those . Then the diamonds , and amethysts , and emeralds , and pearls , and rubies , fit for a queen 's diadem ;  --  they flashed in my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had that little image of the sleeping baby than the whole of them . Then there were silks , and satins , and gauzes , and embroideries , and worsted jackets , and tippets , and gloves , and shoes fit for Cinderella . Then there were dolls , ( boys and girls ) dressed up to show off the fashions . I should be sorry to see you finified up so . Then , there was a beautiful baby 's cradle , lined with soft , white satin , with a rich lace curtain , fit for Queen Victoria 's baby , or your mother 's ; and a tiny little robe and cap lying near it , delicate as a lily leaf . Then there was a tall wax lady dressed in deep black , ( black eyes too ) to show off the mourning goods ; and between you and me , I think she mourned quite as much as a great many persons who put on black . Then there was a pyramid of perfumery  --  done up in bottles  --  enough to sweeten the handkerchiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there were silver and gold tea-sets , and dishes and trays , and knives and forks , for rich ladies who like to be tied to a bunch of keys , and sleep with one eye open . Then there were beautiful pictures , which many a poor artist had toiled and sighed over , and which I should like to give him a good bag of money for , and then hang them up in my parlor . Pictures are such pleasant , quiet company . Then there were a great many machines , and instruments , and engines , of much importance , which grown up people would be interested in , but which I will not describe to you . Well , these pretty things I have told you about were not all on the lower floor of the Palace . No ; part of them were in the galleries . You could sit there and look down below upon the great statue of General Washington on horseback ; upon Daniel Webster ; and then , upon the Lilliputians that were walking around looking at them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music , and fancy you were in some enchanted region , for it was quite like a fairy tale , the whole of it . KIZZY KRINGLE 'S STORY . I am an old maid . Perhaps I might have been married . Perhaps not . I do n't know as that is anybody 's business . I have a little room I call my own . There 's a bedstead in it covered with a patched quilt , made of as many colors as " Joseph 's coat , " and an old-fashioned bureau with great claw feet , and a chair whose cushion is stuffed with cotton batting ; a wash-stand , a table , and a looking-glass over it . At the side of the looking-glass is a picture of Daniel Webster , which I look at oftener than in the looking-glass  --  for I am an ugly old maid , and Daniel was one of a thousand . Old maids like to have a good time , as well as other folks ; so , I do n't shut myself up moping in my little salt-box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight round me , there are four or five families where I go visiting , sometimes to breakfast , ( for I 'm an early riser , ) sometimes to tea , sometimes to dinner , and sometimes to all three ;  --  sometimes I stay all night . Everybody is glad to see me , because I pay my way . If the baby has the colic , I tend it ; if Johnny wants a new tail to his kite , I make it ; if Susy has torn her best frock , I mend it ; and if Papa comes slily up to me and slips a dicky into my hand , I sew the missing string on , and say nothing . I have lately made the acquaintance of a new family , by the name of Tompkins ; and very pleasant people they are , too . They have a whole house full of children ,  --  not one too many , according to my way of thinking . Louisas and Jennys , and Marthas and Marys , and Tommys and Johnnys , besides a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love to watch little children . I love to hear them talk when they do n't think I am listening . I love to read to them and watch their eyes sparkle . I love to play with them , and walk with them . They are often much pleasanter company than grown people  --  at least , so Kizzy thinks . But that is only an old maid 's opinion . I had n't visited at the Tompkins ' long , before I noticed that little " Luly , " as they called her , was one by herself ; that is , she was not a favorite with the rest of the family . At first I did n't understand how it was , and I felt very much like saying I did n't like it ; for Luly seemed to be a nice little girl , and playful as a little kitty . She was always laughing , singing , and dancing  --  now in at one door , and now out at the other , like a will-o ' - the- wisp , or a jack-o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could n't see . Being an old maid , of course I could n't rest easy till I found out the reason of this ; and I soon did it , as you 'll see , if you read on to the end of my story . One day Luly came to me saying , " Tell me a story , there 's a good Kizzy , I am tired of running round . " Well , I knit to my seam needle , and then I took her up on my lap and began : Once there was a little girl whose name was Violetta . She had never kept still five minutes since she was born , and I suppose the shoemakers were very glad of it . She was as much like a little squirrel as a little girl could be  --  nibbling and scampering , scampering and nibbling , from sunrise to sunset . When Violetta came into the room , everybody looked uneasy . If her papa was writing , he 'd lay one hand over his papers , and push his ink-stand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mamma would catch up her work-basket and put it in her lap ; her little brothers and sisters would all scrabble up their playthings , and run ; even the little baby would crawl on its hands and knees as fast as it could , and catch hold of its mother 's gown . You might be sure if you laid a thing out of your hand , you never would find it in the same spot where you left it , if Violetta were in the room . She would run off with your scissors , your bodkin , your needlebook , and your spool of cotton ; she would stuff your handkerchief in her pocket by mistake ; she 'd break the strings of your bag , trying to open it ; she 'd try your spectacles on to her kitten , and tie your new tippet on the dog Ponto 's neck . Then she would run into the kitchen and dip her fingers into the preserves , and upset the egg-basket , and open the oven door and let the heat all out when the pies were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dip into the milk to feed her kitty , and disturb the cream , and nibble round a loaf of fresh cake , just like a little mouse . Well , of course everybody disliked her , and hated to see her come where they were . She never got invited anywhere , because nothing was safe from her little Paul Pry fingers ; and when company came she generally got sent out of the room . It was a great pity , because she was really a pretty little girl , and a very bright one , too . " Oh , Miss Kizzy , " said Luly , " I never will do so any more , I  --   --  " Why , Luly , I did n't say you did so ; I was talking about Violetta . " Oh , but it is just like me , " said the honest little girl ; " I have done all those things , Miss Kizzy  --  every one of them ; but I did n't think it would make everybody hate me . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how dreadful hard it is for a little girl to ' keep still . ' " Yes I do , Luly ; and you need n't " keep still , " as you call it , but you must n't meddle with what do n't belong to you . I see how it is : you are a very active little girl , and want something to do all the time . I 'll ask your mother to let you go to school  --  ( Luly frowned )  --  to me , Luly ! " Oh , that 's so nice , " said Luly . " Do n't get a bench  --  will you ? Do n't make me set up straight . Do n't make me fold up my hands and keep my toes still , will you , Miss Kizzy ? " Well , Luly came to my school , and stood up or sat down , just as she liked . She was the only scholar I had , so I was not particular about that ; but after she had learned to read , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , if you 'd only give her a book . Poor little Luly ; she did n't mean to be naughty ; she only wanted something to do . She is one of the best little girls now that ever carried a satchel . NEW-YORK IN SHADOW . My dear little readers : But a step or two from the famous Broadway , in New-York , where one sees so much riches and splendor , is a place called the " Five Points , " where the wicked poor live , huddled together in garrets and cellars , half starved , half naked , and dirty , and wretched , beyond what you , in your pure and happy homes , ever could dream of . They were recently so numerous , so strong , and so cunning , that even the police were afraid to go among them , for fear they should get killed . A good man by the name of Mr. Pease heard of this dreadful place , and went down there to see what he could do to make the people better . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went down to the Five Points to see for myself . Oh , I could n't tell you half the misery that stared me in the face , as I passed through those streets . Slatternly women , huddled round cellar doors ; dirty children , half naked , playing in the muddy gutters , and hearing words that may never , never be written for you to read . Then , there were drinking shops , with such shocking odors issuing from doors and windows ; and red-faced , blear-eyed men , half drunk , leaning against the barrels , and sitting on the side-walks ; and decayed fruit , in windows so thick with dirt that one could scarcely see through them ; and second-hand , faded dresses and bonnets for sale , swinging from out the doorways ; and girls with uncombed hair and bare feet and bold faces , fighting and swearing ; and old , gray-haired men , smoking pipes and drinking . I was quite sick at heart , and was glad to get into Mr. Pease 's house , and find something doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible man , as well as a kind hearted one . Some people who had always had enough to eat , drink , and wear themselves , wished him only to pray for , and talk to these poor creatures , and give them tracts ; but Mr. Pease knew that many of them were willing to work , and only stole because they could not get work to do , and must either steal or starve . So he knew it was no use to talk and tell them they must be good , so long as he did n't show them any way by which they could earn their living honestly . So , like a sensible man , in the first place he took a shop , and got a great many coarse shirts to make , and told these poor women if they would come in and make them , he would pay them money , and then they need n't steal . And they came , too ; for many of them were weary enough of such a wretched life . Nobody likes to be dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of loved ; nobody likes a police-man 's hand on his throat , instead of the twining arms of the good and pure . No , indeed ! Nobody likes to be afraid to look up at the holy stars , lest their bright eyes should see into their dark souls ; nobody likes to drink till they are senseless as a beast , to stifle the sweet voice of conscience ; nobody likes to be hungry , or thirsty , or sick and diseased , or so miserable that death would be a blessing . No , no  --  no , no ! my dear children . So , these poor creatures came flocking to Mr. Pease 's shop , glad to work ,  --  glad of a chance to be honest ,  --  glad to see somebody , like Mr. Pease , who would reach out his hand and pull them out of this SEA OF SIN , instead of standing on shore , with his hands folded , while they were drowning , reading them a tract . They saw that he was in earnest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to come right down and live in that dreadful neighborhood , if he only could help them . And then , when he had shown them how to put honest bread in their mouths ,  --  when he had found the way to their hearts , ( for these wretched creatures have hearts , )  --  then he talked to them of God and Heaven , till the tears rained down their cheeks ,  --  then he asked them to promise him to " go and sin no more ; " and they have kept their word , too . Is n't that good ? Another good thing Mr. Pease has done : he opened a school in this house of his , for the children in the neighborhood , and I asked him to take me in to see them . So , he opened a door , and there sat the little creatures on low benches ;  --  some black as " Topsy ; " some white as you are ; some barefoot ; some with shoes ; some so small that their little feet did n't touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pallid ; some rosy and bright ; but all with clean hands and clean faces . At a signal from the lady teacher , they all began to sing , " A brighter day will dawn to-morrow . " I had to cry . I could n't help it . Some of the children had such pure , sweet faces , that as they sat there singing , with their soft eyes looking upwards , I felt as if I had almost rather they would die there , than go home through those dreadful streets , into those wretched cellars , and hear the shocking words I had heard , as I passed along through them . I was so glad to learn from Mr. Pease , that some of these little children , who had no parents , lived there in the house with him , and that he kept the others in the day time , giving them their dinners at noon . Poor , little innocent children ! I looked at one little face after another , and I could n't make it right that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  where they are taught to be wicked ,  --  where they are whipped and beaten for not being wicked ,  --  because rich people love silks and jewels too well , to give Mr. Pease money to find them bread and shelter , and take them away . Oh , if the rich ladies and gentlemen who live in fine houses , had only seen those poor children as I did , and heard their sweet voices , I ca n't believe that they would suffer them to remain in such a sinful and wretched condition . Some of them have sent money , which has helped Mr. Pease to buy a place in the country , where he means to carry all the children he can get , away from that vile neighborhood . Is not that nice ? How I should like to see them running over the fields , when work is done ; tumbling about under the trees , growing brown and rosy and healthy ; listening , not to curses and oaths , but to the warble of some dear little bird , praising God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and air and sunshine ! And now , as you sit in your happy homes , where you hear only kind , good , pure words ,  --  where you never tremble at your father 's footfall , or creep under the bed for fear of your own mother ,  --  where you are never hungry , or thirsty , or cold ,  --  where you meet only loving smiles , and go to sleep with the hand of blessing on your bright young head ,  --  oh , remember the poor little outcast ones still forced to live at the Five Points ; and if you can not give them money to help them away , fold your hands and pray God every night to " keep them from the evil that is in the world . " HATTY 'S MISTAKE . " I am so glad it is Saturday afternoon ! "  --  and little Hatty tossed off her bonnet , and shook out her hair , and skipped up to her mother , who sat making the baby 's new red frock ,  --  " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of going to school , and I wish I never had to look into a book again ; " and down little Hatty jumped , two stairs at a time , into the kitchen , to ask Bridget for an apple . Bridget 's red arms were up to the elbows in flour , making pies , and Hatty said she should like to help her . Bridget smiled at the idea of " helping " her . But she liked Hatty ; so she tied a great check apron round her , tucked her curls behind her ears , and gave her a bit of paste , and a little cup-plate on which to make herself a pie . So Hatty rolled out the paste , keeping one eye all the while on Bridget , to see how she did hers ; and then she greased her little plate so that the pie need not stick to it . When that was done , she filled up the inside with stewed apple , then she tucked it all in with a nice " top crust , " then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key she had in her pocket : then she looked up and said , " Bridget ! I wish I were you ; I should have such a good time tasting the apple-sauce , to see if it were sweet enough . I should like to go out to service , Bridget , and never see that hateful school any more . " Bridget did n't answer , but she turned away and took a long-handled shovel and poked her pies into the hot oven , and then Hatty heard her draw a great long sigh . " What is the matter , Bridget ? " said Hatty . " Is your crust heavy ? " " No , " said Bridget ,  --  " but my heart is . I was thinking how I wished I knew how to read and write . There 's Patrick , my brother , way over in Ireland  --  the last time I saw him I was n't taller than that butter firkin . Father and mother are dead , and Pat is just the pulse of my heart , Hatty ! Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ca n't for the life of me read a word of it ; and if I get Honora Donahue to read it , I 'm not sure whether she gets the right sense of it ; and then a body wants to read a letter more than once , you know ; and so I take it up , my darlin ' , and turn it over and over , and it 's nothing but Greek and Latin to poor Bridget . And so many 's the time , Hatty , I 've cried hours over Pat 's letters , for reason of that . Then I ca n't answer them  --  cause you know I ca n't write  --  and in course I do n't want to turn my heart inside out for anybody else to write it to Pat for me ; and so you see , my darlin ' , it 's a bother all round entirely , "  --  and Bridget shut to the oven door , and wiped her eyes with the corner of her check apron . Hatty was a very warm-hearted little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she threw down the bit of paste in her hand ; then starting to her feet , as if a sudden thought had struck her , ran quickly up stairs into the parlor , where her mother was sitting , talking with two ladies . Hatty forgot that her face , and hands , and check apron , and even her curls , were all over flour , when she burst into the room , saying , " Oh , Mamma !  --  Bridget and I have been talking , and Bridget  --  ( great big Bridget ! )  --  do n't know how to read and write ! and she has nobody to love but Pat  --  and Pat is in Ireland ; and when he writes her a letter she ca n't read it , and she ca n't answer him , because she do n't know how to write ; and she has n't seen Pat since  --  since he was as little as a butter firkin  --  and she is so unhappy  --  and , Mamma , may n't I have an A-B-C book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " And little Hatty stopped  --  not because she had no more to say , but because she was out of breath . Hatty 's mamma smiled , and said , " There was a little girl just your size , in here about an hour ago , who ' did n't see the use of going to school , and wished she might never look into another book so long as she lived . ' Have you seen anything of her ? " Illustration : HATTY 'S MISTAKE . Hatty blushed and said , " Oh , Mamma , I never will be so foolish again . I see now how bad it is not to learn when one is a little girl . " Well , the A-B-C book was bought , and very funny it was to see little Miss Hatty looking so wise from under her curls , and pointing out the letters to Bridget with a long knitting needle . It was very slow work , to be sure ; but then Hatty was patient , for she had a good , kind heart ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Pat 's letters ! and prouder yet when she learned to answer them ! and you may be sure that Hatty never was heard to say again that " she did n't see the use of going to school . " MIN-YUNG . Did you ever see a China-man ? I used to know one . His head was quite shaved , except a long braid , which hung down below his waist behind . I suppose it was n't all his own hair ; but that 's none of my business . He had as much right to tie on a false tail , if he liked , as the gentlemen in Broadway have to wear false whiskers , and false moustaches . Perched on the top of his head was a little skull-cap , just about big enough to fit your little baby brother . On his feet were wooden shoes , curled up at the toes like the end of an Indian canoe . He also wore blue and white stockings , and a blue Canton-crape wrapper . Min-Yung ( that was his name ) had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coaxed away from China , with many others of his countrymen , by some Americans , who imagined that they could make money by exhibiting them over here , in their different Chinese dresses , and making them play tricks , like so many monkeys . When they got them here , they found " it did n't pay " ; that is , people did n't care to give money to go to see them . So they ran off , and left the poor Chinese , without a cent , to take care of themselves in a strange country . Was not that very mean ? Poor Min-Yung had pawned one of his dresses after another to pay for things he needed , till they were all gone , and he looked quite worn out and miserable . He could n't speak but a word or two of our language , and I could n't speak Chinese ; but I saw that he was sick and unhappy . So I shook hands with him , and pointed to his forehead , and looked as pitiful as I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled up his sleeve , that I might feel his pulse , and leaned his head on one side , to show me how forlorn and weary he felt . I thought that , perhaps , he might be faint , and need something to eat , or drink ; so I said " Tea ? " for I knew that a China-man would be sure to understand that word . You should have seen what a horrid grimace he made , and how he lifted up both his hands , as if to wave off an imaginary cup of tea ! I always thought that the tea sent over to this country from China was a miserable humbug ; so poor Min-Yung 's horror at being asked to drink a cup of it , quite upset me , and I laughed immoderately . Min-Yung laughed , too ; and understood by the way I shook my fore-finger at him , just as well as if I had said , " You know very well , my dear Min-Yung , that your countrymen make us swallow and pay for any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of ' tea . ' " However , Min-Yung ate some nice jelly , without being poisoned , and pocketed some money which was given him by a gentleman present , and then he dropped on one knee very gracefully , and kissed first the gentleman 's hand , and then mine ; and his little huckleberry eyes twinkled , as much as to say , " You see , I 'm very grateful . " With good , careful nursing , Min-Yung got better . I think it made him almost well to speak kindly to him , for he had a good , affectionate heart . When he got quite well and strong , he wanted to " be my servant . " I liked Min-Yung , but I had nothing for him to do ; beside , I like to be my own servant . It would make me as nervous as a cat in a china closet , to have anybody always standing behind my chair . So , the gentleman who gave him the money , said he was going to California soon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait upon him . Was n't that kind ? It did not take the poor China-man long to pack his trunk , for the very good reason that he had nothing to put in it . So , in less than a week 's time , his wooden shoes walked on board the ship " Dolphin , " and away he went to California , and I did n't hear of him again for many a long day . It seems that after his master had got through all his business in California , he asked Min-Yung if he would like to go back to his own country and see his old father and mother , and his sisters , with the twinkling little feet ;  --  and Min-Yung said yes . So the gentleman gave him some money , and he started off , in his little skull cap , for the " Celestial City . " I often used to think of him , and wonder if he found his old father and mother alive ; and if they were glad to see him ; and often , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud to think of poor Min-Yung 's horrid grimace , when I offered him some . One day a huge box came for me , directed " United States of America . " I could n't imagine what was in it . I thought of mummies , and stuffed monkeys , and " infernal machines ; " and walked round the box at a respectful distance , with one eye on the door . By and by the lid was knocked off ; and now , what do you think I found in it ?  --  a chest of " tea ; " none of your sham doses , but tea that a Chinese Mandarin would n't have turned up his celestial nose at , and a lovely little Chinese work-box , and a pretty scarlet , Canton-crape scarf , all from that comical , good , affectionate Min-Yung . Wo n't you and I call on him , when we go to China ? TOM , THE TAILOR . Tell you another story , Charley ? Bless your blue eyes , how many stories high do you suppose I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A tailor . " Do you like to see a man sewing , Charley ? I do n't . I do n't believe that their great muscular arms were intended to wield a needle , especially when so many feminine fingers are forced to be idle for want of employment ; so I never like to see a tailor .  --  Oh , yes , I do , too . I came very near forgetting Tom Willcut . Who was he ? I do n't know , any more than you do . The first time I saw him , was in an old tumble-down building , where the wind played hide and go seek through the timbers ; and where more men , women , dogs and children were huddled together , than four walls of the like size ever held before . In one of the smallest of these rooms , I first saw Tom ; sitting , with a white cotton cap upon his head , cross-legged on the floor , stitching away by the dim light of a tallow candle . A line stretched across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had finished , while at his side stood a rough table , with the remains of some supper , and two unwashed cups and saucers . Two cups and saucers , thought I : pray , who shares this little room with that poor , pale tailor ? Ah , I see ! In yonder bed , which I had not noticed , lies a woman , and on her breast a little wee baby . Well may Tom sit drawing out his thread , hour after hour , by that dim candle . 1 coughed a little bit . Tom shaded his eyes with his hand , looked up , and invited me in . That was just what I wanted , you know . Then , he dusted off a chair with the tail of his coat , and I sat down . " Is that your baby ? " said I. " It is ours , " said he , looking over , with a proud smile , at his wife . I liked Tom from that very minute . Of course , his wife wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first one , too  --  and it was very gallant of tailor Tom , to say " ours , " instead of " mine : " it showed he had a soul above buttons . Ask your mother if it did n't . Then I asked Tom if he got good pay for making those jackets . He clipped off his thread with his great shears , and , shaking his head , said , " My boss is a Jew , Missis . " What did he mean by that ? Why , " boss " means master , and Jew , I am sorry to say , is but another name for a person who gets all the work he can out of poor people , and pays them as little for it as possible . Tom 's answer made me feel very bad ,  --  he said it in such a quiet , uncomplaining way , as if , hard as it was , he had quite made up his mind to it , for the sake of that new baby and its mother . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and say , " Tom , you are a hero ! " but , I dare say he would n't have understood that . Your father , Charley , would probably call him a " philosopher , " but you and I , who ca n't afford to use up the dictionary that way , will say he is a clever , good-hearted fellow . When Tom was first married , he had a little shop of his own , and was " quite before-hand , " as he called it ; but one unlucky night it caught on fire , and burned up all his coats , and trousers , and jackets , and all the stuff he had laid in to make them of ; and then his wife was taken sick ; and , what with doctoring , and one trouble and another , although poor Tom was honest , temperate and industrious , he came down to that poor , miserable little room , after all . But Tom was not a man to whine about his bad luck . No ; he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever , and wore a cheerful smile for his sick wife , beside . That 's why I called him " a hero ; " for , Charley , anybody can be courageous and endure a great deal when all the world are looking on and clapping their hands , and admiring them ; but it is another thing , in an obscure corner , without food , without friends , without hope , to struggle  --  struggle  --  struggle on , fighting off Temptation , fighting off grim Want , day after day , with none to say , " God speed you . " That 's why I said the poor tailor had a good , brave heart ; that 's why I honored him ; that 's why I prayed God a brighter day might dawn for him . Did it ? Yes ! I tell you , Charley , never despair ! no matter how dark the cloud is overhead , work on , and look up ; the sun will shine through , by and by ;  --  it did for poor Tom . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to go with him and look at some cloth for making jackets . Tom thought it was very odd ;  --  he did n't remember that anybody ever asked his opinion before ;  --  he did n't know what to make of it . However , he dropped his shears , pulled off his cotton cap , kissed his little baby , and followed the gentleman . They went along through a great many streets , till they came to the business part of the town . The gentleman opened the door of a small shop , and Tom followed him in . There were cloths of all kinds on the shelves , and the gentleman took some down and asked Tom if they were the right sort for such jackets as he had been making ; and Tom said it was " prime cloth . " And then the gentleman showed him a little room , divided off at the end of the shop , and asked Tom if it was light enough to work in , and Tom said it could not be better ; and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to work in it as soon as he pleased , for these were his goods , and that was his shop ! Poor Tom looked as if he were dreaming . He tried to speak two or three times , but failed . Then , great tears dropped over his cheeks , and he said , " God bless you , sir , but I do n't know what to say . " " I 'm very glad of it , " said the gentleman , smiling ; " because I do n't want you to say anything ; only go home and bring your wife and baby , because there is a nice parlor and bed-room overhead , and I want to see how they look in it . " Well , the amount of it was , that the poor tailor 's wife was as crazy as the tailor himself ; the baby crowed , and the little terrier dog barked ; and , altogether , they had a moving time of it , that day . I ca n't tell you the kind gentleman 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published ; but , sure I am , the recording angel has written it in the " Book of Life . " BETSEY 'S DREAM . It was very weary , lying there so long . Betsey had counted all the squares , and three-cornered pieces , and circles , in the patch-work quilt upon her bed ; she knew there were six more red than green ones , and that one of the circles was pieced seven times . Yes , poor lame Betsey was very tired ; not that she was unused to lying there , day after day , while her mother went out washing ; but , somehow , this day had seemed longer and more tedious than any which had gone before . To be sure she had last year 's almanac , and a torn newspaper , but she knew them both by heart . Betsey wished she " only had a little book , " but she knew mother could n't buy books , when she had not money enough for bread ; so she twisted and turned , and rubbed her lame foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pewter lamp , and the shelf with its two earthen bowls , and its wooden spoons and platters , and the bench with her mother 's wash tub on it and a square of brown soap , and the brown jug full of starch , and the old worn-out broom and mop . Betsey could have seen them just as well had her eyes been shut , she had looked at them so many times . Did I tell you Betsey was " alone ? " Oh no  --  there were four or five families in the some entry . There was Mrs. O'Flanigan with her six red-headed , quarrelsome children and a drunken husband , who beat her everyday till she screamed with pain ; and then the six little Flanigans all screamed , too , till Betsey would put her fingers in her ears to shut out the dreadful sounds . Then , there was Mrs. Doherty , who had twin babies and one room , and took boarders in the corners . Then , there was black Dinah , who got her living by scraping the gutters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her back , and emptied the old bones and rugs and papers on the floor of her room , and kept a broom handle to whip the little Flanigans , who ran in to steal them , when she went to the pump in the alley to get a drink of water . Then , there was little Pat Rourke , who lived up the alley , and kept a little black dog named Pompey . When Pat did n't know what else to do , he would open Betsey 's door , and put the dog in to worry her cat , and enjoy Betsey 's fright . Pompey would chase Pussy all round the room , and then Pussy would spit at him , and hump up her back and hide behind the wash-tub ; and then Pompey would turn over the wash-tub , and seize Pussy by the neck ; and then her eyes would turn all green ; and then Betsey would scream and beg Pat to drive Pompey off ; and then Pat would point to her lame foot and say , " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Betsey would hide her face under the coverlid and cry ; and then Pat would run off , leaving the door wide open , and the cold air blowing right upon the bed . Yes , Betsey had all this to amuse her , besides the torn newspaper and the old almanac . But why did n't her mother come home ?  --  that was the question . It must be late in the afternoon ;  --  Betsey knew that , for the sun had crept round to the west window long since . They must have a great wash to do up at the big house . Betsey hoped the lady would n't go out to ride in her carriage , and forget , as she sometimes did , to pay her mother ; and she hoped the cook would give her some cold tea to warm for their supper , and perhaps a bit of meat , or some potatoes . The lady herself never gave Betsey 's mother anything , except an old gauze ball dress " to make over for her little girl , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some tea . And then Betsey wondered if rich people were always born without hearts , and if her foot would always be lame , and she should never be able to help her mother , but must always be a burden ; and then she thought it would be better if she died ; and then she thought not , because when her mother came home at night ever so weary , she remembered that she always kissed her cheek , and called her " a little darling , " and divided her piece of bread with her , and smiled just as sweetly as if she had n't worked ever since the sun rose , for a mere penny . Then Betsey was so weary that she fell asleep , and dreamed she was an angel . She was not lame any longer ; she had bright wings , and a pure white robe , and a golden harp . There was no misery there , and night and day she sang , " Worthy , worthy , worthy the Lamb ! " and thousands of bright winged angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke , crying because it was only a dream , and found herself again in the little old room all alone ,  --  all but Pussy , who was rubbing her lank sides against the bed post and the wicker chair , and looking wistfully up into Betsey 's face , as much as to say , ai nt you very hungry , Betsey ? * * * " Rein up  --  rein up ! Stop your horses , I say ! It 's no use  --  she 's down . " " Move your omnibus , "  --  " Get out of the way , there , "  --  " Go ahead "  --  " What do you block up the street , for ? "  --  " What 's to pay ? "  --  " Who 's killed ? " " Only a beggar woman , " said the omnibus driver , gathering up his reins ; " she slipped on the wet pavements , yonder , and the horses went over her , and killed her . Ca n't be helped , you know ,  --  there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whipped up his horses , and drove on . Then a police-man picked up Betsey 's dead mother and carried her to the watch house ; while some little Irish boys ran off with her basket and ate up Betsey 's supper . There was nobody to take care of lame Betsey , so she was carried to the poor-house . It did n't matter much to her , when she found her mother was dead , where they took her . She was used to seeing misery ; so the groans of the poor creatures on the hospital cots about her was nothing new . But she grew very weak , day by day , and could n't eat the food they brought her ; and one morning the old nurse found her lying with her little cheek in her hand , and a smile upon her face . Betsey 's dream had come true : she was an angel ! SCOTT FARM . What a blessed thing it is to have a good grandmother ! Sophy had one . Sophy loved to go and see her . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant ride from Sophy 's home ; in a good , old-fashioned farm-house , with green moss growing out of the sloping roof , shaded by trees that looked a century old . It is autumn there now ; so you see on the cellar door and under the front windows , crooked necked squashes and round yellow pumpkins , mellowing in the warm sunbeams . Strings of dried apples are festooned from chamber windows ; and paper bags of catnip and spearmint and thoroughwort and penny-royal and mullen hang drying on the garret walls . On " the buttery " shelves are broad pans of fresh , new milk , crusted with cream that would make a New-Yorker stare ; and great round cheeses , and little pats of golden butter , stamped with a rose , and jars of pickled cucumbers , and pots of preserved plums , and peaches , and barberries , tied down with tissue brandy papers ; and loaves of " riz cake , " and plates of doughnuts , and pans of apple dowdy , beside an earthen jar of rich English plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the bright sun shone in , on a picture of General Washington , and a sampler of Grandma Scott 's , representing a woman crying over a tombstone shaded by a pea-green willow ; and black profile likenesses of all the Scott family cut by a traveling artist , hanging in spots over the fire place ; and an old-fashioned clock , standing guard in the corner , with the picture of the rising sun on it , and Grandpa 's spectacles , and loose copies of the " Scott-town Daily Bulletin " tucked in round the wood work at the sides ; and great , comfortable-looking arm-chairs , with patch cushions ; and a sideboard with a silver pitcher on it , presented to Grandpa Scott by the Agricultural Society and a china mug with a gold rim round it , and " Betsey " on the side , given by the minister to Grandma Scott when she was a little girl , for learning her catechism right ; and a great big china closet , with a glass door , to show off the rows of china cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister or the President should come to tea . Then , out of doors , was n't there a great barn for the children to play in ?  --  with piles of hay , and ladders reaching up to the roof ; and old Dobbin nibbling and munching oats in his stall ; and Brindle , and her little two-day old , red and white calf cuddled down in a straw bed in the corner ; and the little field mice darting over the barn floor ; and the swallows twittering overhead among the beams and rafters ; and the old grindstone that the children liked to turn ; and the scythe and pitchfork that Grandpa charged them " not even to look at ; " and the yellow ears of corn peeping out of their dry husks , in a pile in the corner , and the old rooster strutting round it , ( followed by his hen wives , ) now and then stopping short , with one foot lifted up , and cocking his eye at them from under his red cap , as much as to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal ! " Oh , I can tell you , that barn was a grand old place to play in , to frolic in , or to read and think in . Then , there was the pig-stye under it , with such lazy great pigs , and such frisky little ones , with their tails curled up so tight that they lifted their hind legs right up , jumping round and tumbling heels over head over their mother , who lay half-buried in a mud-puddle , winking her pink eyes at the bright sun , and looking just as happy as if there was n't a butcher in the world , or as if " the Governor and council " would n't sign her little piggies ' death warrant with the Thanksgiving proclamation . Thanksgiving ! Oh , was n't that an affair ? Grandma Scott would mount her silver-bowed spectacles , strip her arms to this elbows , tie on a check apron , pin up her cap strings , and stew pumpkins and squashes and apples and quinces , and pound spices , and chop meat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven , and turn out so many pies and tarts and " pan-dowdies , " and loaves of cake , that it would make your apron strings grow tight just to look at them ! Then , the first thing the hens in the barn-yard knew , they did n't know anything ! but lay on the kitchen table with their yellow boots kicked up in the air , waiting to be singed , stuffed , and skewered . Poor things , they had laid their last egg , and swallowed their last kernel of corn , every rooster 's daughter of ' em ! What a party of horses stamped their iron shoes in Grandpa Scott 's barn on Thanksgiving morning ! What a party of little children in bright autumn-leaf dresses and white aprons , went scampering through the house ! What a fuss they all made over the littlest baby ! What a fire ( big enough to roast an ox whole ) blazed in the great , wide , sitting-room fireplace ! How Grandpa Scott walked round , not knowing whether to laugh or to cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the chin , and tossing a third up to the wall . How he looked all round , with his arms a-kimbo , and said if any grandpa in the United States had a prettier set of grandchildren than that , he 'd like to see them ; and how Grandma said , " Pshaw ! Grandpa , " because she was so proud of them herself that she did n't know what else to say ! And how Grandma looked as if she never would grow old , with her nice lace cap , and her own brown hair , with scarce a silver thread in it , curling round her happy face ; and how Grandpa would whisper slily to the boys , " After all , your mother is handsomer than any child she ever had ! " How contented and satisfied Grandmamma looked , sitting at the head of her Thanksgiving table ; plenty of chickens and turkeys boiled and roasted before her . What a time she had getting all the little Scott-ites seated to her mind , and napkins tucked properly under each chubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , when Grandpa got busy talking , he cut off the wings before he did the legs ! How she insisted upon " all just tasting some of that chicken-pie , " when it was quite impossible to stow away another mouthful , because " she had no idea of making it for nothing . " How she would give the little wee baby a " wish-bone , " though it could not hold it one minute in its limpsy little fingers ; and how she would keep on passing round nuts , and oranges , and grapes , and apples , and wonder what had become of all their appetites . And then how all the family would go back into the sitting-room after dinner ; and how Tom , the family " Mozart , " would sing " Home , Sweet Home ; " and how Grandma Scott would rub her eyes with her handkerchief , and declare that the room smoked ! And how all the grown-up boys and girls would begin to look hysterical ; and how Maggie , who believed in " a time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter by the waist , and waltz round the room with him ; and how Grandmamma would smile and say , " Will anything ever tame that girl ?

" A TRUE STORY . People say that it is a sign of good luck to tumble up stairs . I am glad of it ; for , what with my long skirts , and what with the broken stairway , and the pitch darkness , I did nothing but tumble . However , it 's my motto never to give up ; so , of course I gained the top at last , and , opening a door , found myself in a garret , piled up as high as my waist with old rags , and old papers , and old bits of bones . " Go down , I say ! Do n't want you ,  --  do n't want anybody . I 've got a dreadful pain  --   --  . Go down ,  --  there 's nothing here ;  --  go down , I say , " growled a voice , from a pile of rags in the corner . I passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the middle of the room was a woman , ( oh , so miserable a looking creature ! ) with her hands crossed hopelessly in her lap , and so buried up in the piles of rags about the floor , that I could see nothing but her head and shoulders . She was quite young ,  --  not more than twenty . She was not that old man 's wife , nor his daughter , nor his sister  --  but that was her home ; and every day she went out with him and scraped the gutters , and refuse barrels , for old rags and papers ; and then came back and emptied them out upon the garret floor at night , to pick them over . One whole year she had lived in that dirty den . How came she here ? Listen , and I will tell you . Mary once lived in the country , amid sweet , green fields , and clustering vines , and shady trees , and murmuring brooks . Her father was a good old farmer , as happy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Great Britain . Mary was his only child . Her mother died when she was a very little girl . Mary could not even remember how she looked ; but her father often used to part her hair away from her white forehead , and say , " You are so like your mother , Mary "  --  and then Mary would run to the little mirror , over the dresser , and see a sweet pair of hazel eyes , and clusters of rich , brown hair falling over rosy cheeks and snowy shoulders ; and then she 'd toss her curls , and run back again to her father . Mary knew that her mother must have been very pretty . Mary had an uncle , named Ralph . He was a bad man ; but Mary 's father was so good and honest himself , that it was hard to make him believe anybody was dis-honest . So he lent his brother large sums of money  --  ( Ralph all the while promising to pay him at a certain time . ) By and by , Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , with all the cows and horses , and sheep and oxen ; and then Mary 's father worried so much that it made him very sick , and he soon died , leaving poor Mary without a penny in the world . Uncle Ralph told her to go to the city , and he would find employment for her . But , after he got her there , he left her , and ran off ; and poor Mary wandered about , quite heart-broken , till finally she found some coarse work to do , for which she was paid a trifle . She worked on with a brave heart , from day to day , for some weeks , till her employer died ; and then , poor Mary knew not what to do ,  --  nobody would employ her ; and wicked people came and tempted her to sin , but Mary was good , and would not listen to them ; and so she had to sell her clothes , one after another , as poor people do , till she had nothing left but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were gone , to pay the woman where she lived for her lodging . Alas ! then poor Mary said , despairingly , " It is of no use for me to try to be honest any longer , "  --  and wicked people came again and tempted her , and nobody said , " Mary , struggle on , and I will help you ; I will give you work to do . " No ; nobody said that ; and everything looked dark and gloomy , and she forgot the little prayer she used to say at the old farmhouse , and made her home with wicked people ; and the sweet , innocent look faded out from her soft blue eyes , and her heart grew hard  --  and wrong seemed right to poor Mary . But sometimes Mary would wake at night , when all was still , and think of her childhood 's home , under the linden trees ; and of her good old father sitting in the porch , with the Bible on his knee , and the soft wind gently lifting the gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old church-yard , where her mother lay buried ; and then she would press her hands tightly over her eyes , as if in that way she could shut out the torturing picture . Mary could not bear such thoughts ; they drove her almost wild . So , she drank wine ( when she could get it ) to drown her misery , and passed from one place of shelter to another , till at last she was glad of a home in the wretched garret where I found her . When I spoke to Mary , she would not answer me ; but looked me in the face as if she had been a stone image . She seemed to be afraid of the old man with whom she lived in the garret . Finding , after many earnest attempts , that I could do Mary no good , I left her ; and soon after I heard that the old man had died , and that Mary had found a great many dollars in gold and silver , hid away in the garret , that he had earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old miser 's money . But did it bring back the sweet , innocent look to her eyes ? or take the misery out of her heart ? No , no . She 'd count over her gold , and say , with a horrid laugh , " It comes too late  --  too late ! " Oh ! how I wished that all who give only  --   --  good advice ! to a poor , tempted , starving , fellow creature , could have heard those dreadful words : " Too late ,  --  too late ! " THE LITTLE EMIGRANTS . Tell you a story , Harry ? Do you like to hear about poor people ? Well , jump up into my lap . So ;  --  now look straight into my eyes . Last night I went to see some poor Italian emigrants . I threaded my way through dirty streets and alleys , and up rickety old staircases , where it was so dark that I had to feel my way , and where I coughed and choked at every step , with the tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door of a small room , lighted with one window , where were a dozen persons  --  men , women and children . Some were seated on straw beds , which were lying upon the floor ; some were sitting upon old boxes , and others were looking out the window ( as if bewildered ) upon the strange scenes in the street below . Crouched upon the hearth , was a very old woman , with thin , gray locks , toothless gums , and bare bosom . She was stretching out her skinny hands over a few shavings that she had kindled into a blaze ; while a little baby lay in a shawl beside her , rubbing its eyes , and crying at the smoke that was every instant puffed into its little face . On the opposite side of the hearth , was a little boy and girl , quite naked to the waist from whence hung a little dirty tunic to their bare knees . A tin pan of raw potatoes lay between them , which they were slicing off with a great knife , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what do you think of that ? How should you relish a raw potato for supper ? How should you like to come from a warm , sunny country , into a cold , chilly climate , and be obliged to go half-naked because you had no money to buy clothes ? How should you like not to be able to understand a word anybody there said to you , or not to be able to make them understand you ? How should you like to have your mother , or your father , go wandering round , day after day , making signs to people , to try to get employment , and have to keep giving away one article of their poor clothing after another for a loaf of bread ? How should you like to be turned out ( even of that miserable room ) into the street , some stormy night , by a cruel landlord ? How should you like to see your mother sit down on a door step , in the dark , dark night , and droop her weary head upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to the poor little boy and girl who were eating raw potatoes at the hearth . They were poor little orphans , and that old woman was their grandmother . They had all wandered about , from place to place , ever since they left the ship that brought them out . They were pretty children , with great dark eyes , and curly hair , and such a bright smile when we spoke kindly to them . Their grandmother was all they had now to love ; and she , poor woman , could n't live long to take care of them , for the cold , and exposure , and anxiety , had almost killed her , too . So , she felt very anxious about what would become of little Pietro and Annita , when she was dead ; and she kept patting them on the head , as if she was determined to make them as happy as possible while she lived . Well , do you know , Harry , it struck me that Mrs.  --   --  , who lives in New-York , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of her own , and she loves children . That 's why I took her with me to see the poor emigrants last night . How she did cry when she saw the poor things eating raw potatoes ! She turned round to me , and said , " Fanny , I must have those children . I 'll take them right home , and I 'll  --   --  " then she could n't stop to tell me the rest , but ran up to the grandmother , and asked her , in Italian , if she might not have Pietro and Annita . At first , the poor old grandmother looked at them both , and said she could n't give them up . Then she looked round that dismal room , and drew her torn shawl up over her shoulders ; and then she called them both to her , and hugged and kissed them ; and then , with the tears rolling down her cheeks , she took them by the hand and led them up to Mrs.  --   --  , and told her to be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pietro and Annita clung to their grandmother , and kissed her wrinkled face , and hung round her neck , and hid their little curly heads in her lap , for they had seen so many strange faces , and so much misery , that it had made them as shy as little rabbits , and they were afraid to venture away from grandmother . Mrs.  --   --  spoke to them in Italian , and tried to coax them with promises of all sorts of pretty things . But it was of no use ; they only shook their little curly heads , and ran back to their dear old grandma , who patted them both , and laughed and cried together . Then , Mrs.  --   --  said " she would take grandma , too : " and that she should help her to take care of Annita and Pietro . When the little rogues heard this , they wiped away their tears , and smiled , and showed their little white , glittering teeth , and kissed Mrs.  --   --  ' s hands , and said , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took them all in , to Mrs.  --   --  ' s house in Fourth street , where they were washed , and dressed , and ate some nice hot supper ; and before I came away , they were asleep in a cunning little trundle-bed , with their little curly heads nestled on the same pillow , and their little cheeks close together , and just as rosy as if they had never shivered , half naked , in that old smoky room . And Mrs.  --   --  ' s husband , who is an artist , stood there over them , with his pencil in his fingers , taking a sketch of their little Italian faces ; and by and by he will finish a beautiful picture of Pietro and Annita , in the old ragged dresses in which they were found ; and if he paints their little dimpled shoulders and cunning little legs and feet half as pretty as they really are , I know you will say with me , that the " Little Emigrants " are worth looking at , and worth loving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's anything I hate worse than a dandy , it is tobacco . Such a headache as I have this morning , all for that vile pipe that Bridget Dolan 's husband was smoking , when I went over to see her . Charley , I believe if an Irishman had n't a potato to put in his blarney-ing mouth , he would own a pipe and a puppy . Jim Dolan had both . Now , Bridget Dolan was full clever enough to have been a born Yankee , and , of course , was a great deal too good for Jim Dolan . She had more children than you could count , if you were in a hurry , and a baby in her arms , year in and year out . For all that , she is never out of patience trying to keep their elbows and knees and toes in , and make up for what Jim wastes in smoking and drinking . I verily believe Bridget would fight anybody who said he was not the best husband in the world ,  --  black and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she has patience to put up with it , it is no affair of yours or mine ; all I have to say is , that her name ought to be Job , instead of Dolan . Last night I thought I would go over to see her ; so , I lifted up my dress and waded through the alley , and after getting away from a drunken woman , who insisted upon having my bonnet , I reached Bridget 's door in safety . There they were , all in a heap , as usual ,  --  Michael and Johnny , and Sammy and Pat , and Fanny and Katy , and Mike and the baby . Bridget 's face shone like a new milk-pan , when I opened the door ( she knows I pity her ) ; she flew round and got me a wooden chair , scrubbed the baby 's face with her apron , put one hand on Mike 's hair to make it lie down , sent Snip , the dog , yelping under the bed , and asked me how I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twitched a lock of hair that hung over his forehead , and scraped out his hind foot , by way of a bow . Presently Johnny began to whisper to Sammy , and Sammy whispered to Mike , and Mike whispered to his mother ; and then his mother got up and gave them something out of the closet , which they came and laid in my lap , with their eyes shining like a cat 's in the dark . And when I held it up to the light , it turned out to be two new jackets , one for Sammy and one for Johnny , that their good , thrifty mother had made out of an old coat that somebody had given her . Of course , I admired them ; and of course , I buttoned the little boys up in them ; and of course , they strutted round , as smart as little corporals ; and Sammy shook his red head , and said he would " like to hear Brian Doherty call him a beggar now ! " Bridget smiled , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads happy ; " and then , Johnny pulled at my gown again , and pointed up in the corner , and right between the windows , where nearly every pane of glass was broken out , stood a brand new cooking stove , with all its shining pots and pans and kettles , set in order on the top , as if the most magnificent dinner that ever was dreamed of , was hissing and stewing and broiling and baking and roasting inside . As to Sammy , he lifted up all the lids , and poked his nose in , as if he could already smell the dinner . Mike spread out his little blue hands , as if some time or other they would get warm over it ; Johnny shouldered the poker and showed me how they were going to rattle the coal out when somebody should give mother work enough to earn money to buy it , and the baby got well enough to let her do it . Then Sammy held the light , and we all walked in a procession , round and round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But how did they get it ? That 's what I wanted to know . Stoves cost money . Sammy saw I was dying to know , so he whispered in my ear , loud enough to be heard in South America , " Mammy earned it shaking carpets , she did . " I turned round and looked at Jim Dolan . If I could have had my own way , I would liked to have put a petticoat and a bonnet on him , and marched him up to the looking-glass !  --  a great , able-bodied , idle six-footer ! I do n't think much of a man that will let his wife support him . Do you ? All the way home I was thinking over what poor Bridget said : " It takes so little to make the poor lads happy . " I want you to think of that , children , when you pout because the potato is not put on the right side of your plate ; or , because little Minnie has climbed into your chair at the table ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dainty little tooth ; or , because the tailoress put six buttons instead of seven , on your new overcoat . Johnny and Sammy would toss their caps up in the air and go wild with joy , if they had all the nice things you have . Poor little fellows ! I loved them , because they were so proud of their mother . Oh , children ! there 's nothing in the wide earth like a mother . All the friends in the world could n't make up to you for her loss . There 's no arm but God 's so true and safe to lean upon ; there 's no heart but His so full of love and pity , so long-suffering and forgiving . Love your mother , little ones . FRONTIER LIFE : OR , MITTY MOORE . " Frontier life ! " I think I hear my little readers echo , knitting their brows ; " frontier life ,  --  I wish FANNY FERN would n't write about things we do n't understand . " Suppose I should tell you a story to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mitty Moore 's father took it into his head that he should like frontier life . So he traveled hundred and hundreds of miles  --  way off where the sun goes down , to find a place in which to settle . The roads were rough and bad . Sometimes it would be a long while before they reached a place where travelers could get drink and food ; and Mitty 's little bones would ache , and she began to think with " Paddy , " that the end of the journey was cut off . At last Mr. Moore found a place to his mind ; and they all halted , with the old baggage wagon , in the woods ; and Mitty , and her little brothers and sisters , jumped out and stretched their limbs , and looked way up into the great tall trees to try to see the tops , which seemed to pierce the clouds . They made a sort of pic-nic dinner , out of some provisions stowed away in the old wagon ; after which Mitty 's father and eldest brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to work to make a " clearing , " as they called it , for a log house  --  felling the trees , and cutting and burning the underbrush . It took them a long while to hew down those fine old trees . I 'm glad I did n't see it done , for I should have sung out , with General Morris , " Woodman ! spare that tree ! Touch not a single bough , "  --  for , a house , you know , can be put up by any carpenter who owns a set of tools , but it takes many a long year of dew and sunshine to make those grand old trees tower up to heaven . However , it was all fine fun for Mitty , who sat on an old stump , with her chin resting in her hands , watching to see the stout old trunk stand like a rock against their heavy blows ; then lean a little ; then creak , as if it were groaning with pain that its green branches must so soon wither ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the " giant " before little " David . " Mitty liked it , though it was rather dangerous sport ; for , if the tree had fallen upon her pretty little head , she never would have tossed back her bright curls again . Mitty was just the right sort of a Mitty for a little frontier girl . She seemed to know just when to hand her father the axe , or the hatchet , or the pick-axe ; and just when they could rest a minute to take a drink of water , or a mouthful of bread and cheese . She did n't talk to them when they were busy , but amused herself making little log houses , with chips , for her dolly . She did n't scream or run , if a snake or a rabbit went over her foot ; she was not all the time conjuring up bears , and tigers , and raccoons , or catching hold of her father every time she heard a little squirrel squeal ;  --  not she  --  she loved everything ; and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if pain and danger and death had never followed the Serpent into Eden . Now , I suppose you are wondering what people so buried in the woods did for stores , and shops , in which to buy things , and for meeting-houses and newspapers . In the first place , when they went there , they made up their minds that silk dresses and ice-creams did n't grow on frontier bushes ! and they soon became astonished to find how many things there were that were not at all necessary to their happiness , which they had always felt they could not do without . They kept a cow , and she found them in milk ; they kept hens , and the hens kept them in eggs ; they kept a pig , and the pig made no objection to being cut up , whenever they got ready to eat him ; then , they brought meal and flour enough with them , to last till they could plough the land , and raise corn and wheat of their own , which they intended doing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . Oh , they got on famously . It was good , healthy work , this digging , and hewing , and ploughing . It made the muscles on their arms stand out like whip cords ; it bronzed their pale faces , and made their eyes bright , and gave them a good appetite for their bread and milk ; and when they went to bed , they did n't stop to see if the seam of the sheet was exactly in the middle , or to count the feathers in the pillows under their heads . They had neighbors ( off in different directions ) ; some four miles away ; some two ; some six , and some eight . Not city neighbors who shut themselves up in their great jails of houses , and would n't care if a hearse stood before your door every day in the year . No , indeed ! They were warm-hearted country folks , with hearts as big as their pumpkins . If you were out of meal , or molasses , or sugar , or tea , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send to " the settlement " for some . That 's the way they lived . The men folks had too many trees to cut down to keep tackling up the old oxen every five minutes , and go " gee-hawing " over to the stores , every time the women wanted an Indian cake . No ; they borrowed of each other till somebody had time to go to the store or to mill ; and then , whoever went , took all their errands and did them up in a bunch , to save time . They went by the " golden rule . " People who live in the woods , where the trees are all the time whispering of God , and the little birds singing of Him , do n't feel like being quarrelsome , and disobliging , and ugly ; no , they leave that to city people , who live in such a whirl that they never remember they have a soul till Death comes after it . Well , as I was saying , they helped one another . Orphy Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn one day , to carry it to mill . Mitty was very glad , because they had been out of meal some days , and she was rather tired of potatoes . So she made up her mind , and her mouth , that when Orphy came back , they would all have " a prime supper . " But Orphy did n't come back that night , or the next morning , either ; but , late the next afternoon , he came crawling back , with the meal , and told them that " he should have been home with it long ago , if that pesky wheel had n't come off his wagon , and it had n't taken such a powerful long time to blacksmith it on again . " How glad little Mitty was to see that bag of meal ! and what a nice time she had of it that night , sitting on a little cricket before a blazing hickory fire , and eating the buttered cakes that her mother handed down to her from the table . Oh , you city children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fricassees , and mince-pies , if you tried a lifetime . " They did n't have any newspapers there . " Ah ! there you have me ! More especially as I had as lief go without my breakfast as without my newspaper ; but , then , I can tell you , that there were things all the time happening there on the frontier , that many a newspaper editor would have given his scissors and easy chair to have got hold of , for his paper . I 'll tell you about some . One night Mitty lay in her little bed of straw and husks , almost asleep , when she heard her father at the door , singing out , " H-a-l-l-o-o ! h-a-l-l-o-o ! " as loud as ever he could ; and then a faint voice , way off , caught it up , and echoed back , " H-a-l-l-o-o ! h-a-l-l-o-o ! " Then Mitty 's father lit a great bright torch , and moved it , flaming , back and forth before the door ; and in a little while a poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark woods , heard the voice that had answered to his , and saw , by the torch , where to come to find Mr. Moore ; and in less than an hour after , he was snoring away under Mr. Moore 's roof , with a good , comfortable supper tucked under his ribs while the bears had to go without any . Bears ? Certainly !  --  I did n't mention the gentlemen before , for fear it would make your mother trouble when it came your bed-time ; but , nevertheless , it is a naked fact that bears live on the frontier . One day a woman came in to Mr. Moore 's , crying and " taking on " in a most pitiful manner . Mitty could n't understand ( the woman sobbed so much ) what it was all about ; but she concluded that something special was to pay , because her mother let her brown bread all burn to a crisp in the oven , while she was listening to her . Then her mother ran out in the cornfield , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Moore dropped his hoe , ran to the house and caught up a great tin horn , and stood at the door , blowing with all his might ; " Too  --  hoo  --  too  --  hoo  --  too  --  hoo ; " and then Orphy Smith , the next neighbor , caught up his horn , and blew , too ; and then the next , and the next ; and , in a very short time , all the neighbors knew that Mr. Moore wanted them to come to his log house , just as fast as their horses legs could carry them . So , in they flocked ,  --  Orphy Smith , and Seth Jones , and Pete Parker , and Jesse Jenkins , and Eph . Ellet , and a whole host more ; and Mitty 's father told them that Desire Dibden 's child ( whose father had been killed by the Indians , ) was lost in the woods ; and that was enough to say ;  --  every man of them started off through the door , as if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child . Certainly ;  --  did n't I tell you that " farmers had hearts ? " When a child gets lost in the city , the fat old town crier ( if he is paid for it ) " takes his time " and his bell , and crawls through the street , whining out sleepily , " C-h-i-l-d l-o-s-t ; " and the city folks pay about as much attention to it , as if you told them that a six-days ' kitten had presumptuously stepped into a wash-tub . You did n't catch the nice , big-hearted farmers acting that way ; they did n't say it was none of their business ,  --  that their corn wanted hoeing , and their hay wanted stacking , and their meadows wanted ploughing ! The sight of that poor weeping mother was enough . They started right off in companies , to scour the woods for the poor , little , lost boy , hoping to find him before night-fall . There sat poor Desire , in the chimney corner , sobbing and wringing her hands , and rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though good , kind , motherly Mrs. Moore , baked , on purpose for her , some of her most tempting cakes ; she would n't drink , though Mrs. Moore handed her a nice hot cup of tea . She did nothing but cry fit to break her heart ; while sensible little Mitty whispered to her mother to know " if she had n't better go out of the way , for fear the sight of her , safe in her mother 's log house , might make poor Desire cry the harder . " Dinner time came ; but the men did n't come back . Supper time ;  --  then evening came on , dark and chilly , and Desire 's lips grew paler every minute : still , no tidings yet of the boy . Through the long night she listened  --  listened  --  listened , till every gust of wind made her tremble like the leaves . Morning dawned ,  --  noon came again ,  --  then night . Then , indeed , at last they heard the tramp of heavy feet . Desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then back again to her seat , with her hands pressed tightly on her heart ; then back to the door , as if her straining eye could pierce the darkness . It did , God pity her ! What did she see ? Her little Willy , quite dead , lying on a litter , carried by Mr. Moore and Orphy . Poor little Willy ! They had tracked him to an old shanty , in the woods , where he had gathered some dry leaves and slept . There was the mark of his little form upon the leaves . Then they tracked him out into the woods , along , along , farther than one would have thought his little feet could have carried him ; and then they found him , with his little head leaning against a tree , quite dead from exhaustion and hunger . Poor Desire ! There was n't one of those nice old farmers who would n't have given his farm to bring that little sleeper back to life . They took his mother 's cold hands in theirs , and chafed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong men as they were ) to think of the bitter waking she would have . But God was merciful ;  --  she never did wake in this world . In Heaven she found her boy . UNCLE JOLLY . " Well , I declare ! here it is New Year 's morning again , and cold as Greenland , too , " said Uncle Jolly , as he poked his cotton night-cap out of bed  --  " frost an inch thick on the windows , water all frozen in the pitcher , and I an old bachelor . Heigho ! nobody to give any presents to  --  no little feet to come patting up to my bed to wish me ' A happy New Year . ' Miserable piece of business ! Wonder what ever became of that sister of mine who ran off with that poor artist ? Wish she 'd turn up somewhere with two or three children for me to love and pet . Heigh-ho ! It 's a miserable piece of business to be an old bachelor . " Illustration : UNCLE JOLLY . And Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers , and buttoned his dressing gown tightly to his chin ; then he went down stairs , swallowed a cup of coffee , an egg , and a slice of toast . Then he buttoned his surtout snugly up over them , and went out the front door into the street . Such a crowd as there was buying New Year 's presents . The toy-shops were filled with grandpas and grandmas , and aunts and uncles and cousins . As to the shopkeepers , what with telling prices , answering forty questions in a minute , and doing up parcels , they were as crazy as a bachelor tending a crying baby . Uncle Jolly slipped along over the icy pavements , and finally halted in front of Tim Nonesuch 's toy shop . You should have seen his show windows ! Beautiful English dolls at five dollars a-piece , dressed like Queen Vic 's babies , with such plump little shoulders and arms that one longed to pinch ' em ; and tea sets , and dinner sets , cunning enough , for a fairy to keep house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping Jennys , and " Topsys , " and " Uncle Toms " as black as the chimney back , with wool made of a raveled black stocking . Then , there were little work-boxes with gold thimbles and bodkins , and scissors in crimson velvet cases , and snakes that squirmed so naturally as to make you hop up on the table to get out of the way , and little innocent looking boxes containing a little spry mouse , that jumped into your face as soon as you raised the lid , and music boxes to place under your pillows when you had drank too strong a cup of green tea , and vinaigrettes that you could hold to your nose to keep you from fainting when you saw a dandy . Oh ! I can tell you that Mr. Nonesuch understood keeping a toy shop ; there were plenty of carriages always in front of it , plenty of taper fingers pulling over his wares , and plenty of husbands and fathers who returned thanks that New Year 's did n't come every day ! " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry , " said the elder of two little girls ; " I thought you said it would make you happy to come out and look at the New Year 's presents , though we could n't have any . " " I did think so , " said Susy ; " but it makes me think of last New Year 's , when you and I lay cuddled together in our little bed , and papa came creeping up in his slippers , thinking we were asleep , and laid our presents on the table , and then kissed us both , and said , ' God bless the little darlings ! ' Oh ! Katy  --  all the little girls in that shop have their papa 's with them . I want MY papa , " and little Susy laid her head on Katy 's shoulder and sobbed as if her heart were breaking . " Do n't , dear Susy , " said Katy , wiping away her own tears with her little pinafore ; " do n't cry  --  mamma will see how red your eyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't cry , Susy . " " Oh , Katy , I ca n't help it . See that tall man with the black whiskers , ( do n't he look like papa ? ) kissing that little girl . Oh ! Katy , " and Susy 's tears flowed afresh . Uncle Jolly could n't stand it any longer ;  --  he rushed into the toy shop , bought an armful of play-things helter-skelter , and ran after the two little girls . " Here , Susy ! here , Katy ! " said he , " here are some New Year 's presents from Uncle Jolly . " " Who is Uncle Jolly ? " " Well , he 's uncle to all the poor little children who have no kind papa . " " Now , where do you live , little pigeons ?  --  got far to go ?  --  toes all out your shoes here in January ? Do n't like it ,  --  my toes ai n't out my shoes ;  --  come in here , and let 's see if we can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting them both to a pair , ) that 's something like ; it will puzzle Jack Frost to find your toes now . Cotton clothes on ? I do n't wear cotton clothes ;  --  come in here and get some woolen shawls . Which do you like best , red , green , or blue ?  --  plaids or stripes , hey ? " ' Mother wo n't like it ? ' Do n't talk to me ;  --  mother 's do n't generally scratch people 's eyes out for being kind to their little ones . I 'll take care of that , little puss . Uncle Jolly 's going home with you . ' How do I know whether you have got any dinner or not ? ' I 've got a dinner  --  you shall have a dinner , too . Pity if I ca n't have my own way  --  New Year 's day , too . " That your home ? p-h-e-w ! I do n't know about trusting my old bones up those rickety stairs ,  --  old bones are hard to mend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , and Uncle Jolly walked in ,  --  their momma turned her head , then with one wild cry of joy threw her arms about his neck , while Susy and Katy stood in the door-way , uncertain whether to laugh or cry . " Come here , come here , " said Uncle Jolly ; " I did n't know I was so near the truth this morning when I called myself your Uncle Jolly ; I did n't know what made my heart leap so when I saw you there in the street . Come here , I say ; do n't you ever shed another tear ;  --  you see I do n't , "  --  and Jolly tried to smile , as he drew his coat sleeve across his eyes . Was n't that a merry New Year 's night in Uncle Jolly 's little parlor ? Was n't the fire warm and bright ? Were not the tea cakes nice ? Did n't Uncle Jolly make them eat till he had tightened their apron strings ? Were their toes ever out of their shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did cruel landlords ever again make their mamma tremble and cry ? In the midst of all this plenty , did they forget " papa ? " No , no ! Whenever little Susy met in the street a tall , princely man with large black whiskers , she 'd look at Katy and nod her little curly head sorrowfully , as much as to say  --  " Oh , Katy , I never  --  never can forget my own dear papa . " A PEEP UNDER GROUND . THE RAFFERTYS AND THE ROURKES . I have made up my mind , that there is nothing lost in New-York . You open your window and toss out a bit of paper or silk , and though it may be no bigger than a sixpence , it is directly snatched up and carried off , by a class of persons the Parisians call , " Chiffoniers " ( rag-pickers ) ! You order a load of coal , or wood , to be dropped at your door ;  --  in less than five minutes a whole horde of ragged children are greedily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that are left after the wood or coal is carried in and housed ; and often locks of hair are pulled out , and bloody noses ensue , in the strife to get the largest share . You will see these persons round the stores , looking for bits of paper , and silk , and calico , that are swept out by the clerks , upon the pavement ; you will see them watching round provision shops , for decayed vegetables , and fruits , and rinds of melons , which they sell to keepers of pigs ; you will see them picking up peach stones to sell to confectioners , who crack them and use the kernels ; you will see them round old buildings , carrying off , at the risk of cracked heads , pieces of decayed timber , and old nails ; you will see them round new buildings , when the workmen are gone to meals , scampering off with boards , shingles , and bits of scaffolding . I thought I had seen all the ingenuity there was to be seen , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't then seen Michael Rafferty ! Michael Rafferty , and Terence Rourke , who was a wood sawyer by profession , lived in a cellar together ; the little Raffertys , and little Rourkes , with their mammas , filling up all the extra space , except just so much as was necessary to swing the cellar door open . A calico curtain was swung across the cellar for a boundary line , to which the little Rourkes and little Raffertys paid about as much attention , as the whites did to the poor Indians ' landmarks . At the time I became acquainted with the two families , quite a jealousy had sprung up on account of Mr. Rafferty 's having made a successful butter speculation . Mrs. Rourke , in consequence , had kept the calico curtain tightly drawn for some weeks , and boxed six of the little Rourkes ' ears ( twelve in all , ) for speaking to the little Raffertys through the rents in the curtain . All this I learned from Mrs. Rafferty , as I sat on an old barrel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , " she said , " if a body got up in the world , there were plenty of envious spalpeens , sure , to spite them for it ; " which I took occasion to remark to Mrs. Rafferty , was as true , as anything I had ever had the pleasure of hearing her say . Just then the cellar door swung open , and the great butter speculator , Mr. Michael Rafferty , walked in . He nodded his head , and gave an uneasy glance at the curtain , as much as to say " calicoes have ears . " I understood it , and told him we had been very discreet . Upon which he said , " You see , they 'll be afther staling my thrade , your ladyship , if they know how I manage about the butther . " " Tell me how you do it , Michael , " said I ; " you know women have a right to be curious . " Well , " said he , speaking in a confidential whisper , " your ladyship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these poor neighborhoods , where they sell onions , and combs , and molasses , and fish , and tape , and gingerbread , and rum . Most of them sell milk , ( none of the best , sure , but it does for the likes of us poor folks . ) It stands round in the sun in the shop windows , your ladyship , till it gets turned , like , and when they have kept it a day or two , and find they ca n't sell it , " ( and here Michael looked sharp at the calico curtain , ) " I buys it for two cents a quart , and puts it in that churn , " ( pointing to a dirty looking affair in the corner , ) " and my old woman and I make it into butter . " And he stepped carefully across the cellar , and pulled from under the bed , a keg , which he uncovered with a proud flourish , and sticking a bit of wood in it , offered me a taste , " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , if Michael had shot me ; but I told him I dare say he understood his trade and hoped he found plenty of customers . " I sell it as fast as I can make it , " said he , putting on the cover and shoving it back under the bed again . " What do you do with the buttermilk ? " said I. He looked at Mrs. Rafferty , and she pointed to the bright , rainbow ribbon on her cap . " Sell it ? " said I. " Sure , " said Michael , with a grin ; " we are making money , your ladyship ; we shall be afther moving out of this cellar before long , and away from the likes of them , " ( pointing in the direction of the curtain ) ; " and , savin ' your ladyship 's presence , " said he , running his fingers through his mop of wiry hair , " Irish people sometimes understhand dhriving a thrade as well as Yankees ; " and Michael drew himself up as though General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Just then a little snarly headed boy came in with two pennies and a cracked plate , " to buy some butther . " " Did n't I tell your ladyship so ? " said Michael . " Holy Mother ! " he continued , as he pocketed the pennies , and gave the boy a short allowance of the vile stuff , " how I wish I had known how to make that butther when every bone in me body used to ache sawin ' wood , and the likes o ' that ,  --  to say nothing of the greater respictability of being in the mercantile profession . " Well , well , thought I , as I traveled home , this is high life under ground , in New-York . " BALD EAGLE ; " OR , THE LITTLE CAPTIVES . Do you like Indians ? Our forefathers did n't admire them much . They had seen too many scalps hanging at their belts , and had heard their war whoops rather too often , to fancy such troublesome neighbors . They never felt as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going to meeting without a loaded musket . I suppose that 's the way the fashion originated for men to sit at the bottom of the pews , and women and children up at the other end . The men wanted to get on their feet quickly if a posse of Indians yelled at the door . Ah ! men were men , then , from the tips of their noses to their shoe-ties ; they did n't wear plaid pants , and use perfume and Macassar , as they do now-a-days . And the women , too ! they were not ashamed to be seen in calico dresses , and did not go about the country making orations and wearing dickeys . I had rather see an Indian , any time , than such a woman . Sometimes the men were obliged to go away from home , and then they left a loaded gun where their wives could use it , in case the Indians came while they were absent . The Indians are very cunning . They used to watch their chance ; and often , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it a pile of smoking ruins , and his wife and children killed , or , what was worse , carried away captives . You would n't have relished living in those days , would you ? What do you think you would have done had the Indians come into your door ?  --  scampered under the bed , or seized the gun and defended your mother ? It is hard telling , is n't it ? I 'm very glad you are not obliged to live in such days . The poor Indians had also their story of wrong to tell . God will judge both rightly . The sun shone brightly one autumn afternoon into a room where two little children were playing , in a pretty little village in the State of South Carolina . " Robert , " said little Nina , to a dark-eyed boy of twelve years , " I 'm tired of staying in this unfurnished room ; it is n't pretty . Has n't mother most done baking , Robert ? Ca n't we go into the kitchen ? I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert took his little sister in his arms , and stroked her little black head , and kissed her cheek , and then he drew himself proudly up , saying , " Nina ? Do you see that gun ? Well , it is loaded , and I know how to use it . " " Oh , Robert ! " said Nina , " hush ! Is not that mamma screaming ? Oh , Robert , hide me  --  the Indians  --  the Indians ! " Robert had just time to seize his gun , when a tall Indian opened the door , and receiving the contents of it in his face , fell , quivering , to the floor . Bald Eagle , the chief of the party , heard the report of Robert 's gun , and rushed in with a dozen Indians . Robert , with his eye flashing , was standing over the dead Indian , with one arm round his little sister , who was clinging to his jacket . Bald Eagle admired bravery ; so , when the other Indians seized Robert by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " No ;  --  the pappoose is brave enough to make a chief . He shall go home with Bald Eagle and be his son . " The Indians frowned , for they thirsted for somebody 's blood . They seized hold of Nina 's long curls to kill her ; but Robert clung to the old chief 's knees , and , though he did n't think much of girls or women , Bald Eagle said , " She shall live  --  to please the boy . " The Indians lowered their tomahawks , for they did n't dare to disobey Bald Eagle , and led Nina and Robert out of the house , which had been set on fire and was beginning to burn . As they passed the kitchen door , Nina gave a loud scream , for there lay her mother , across the threshold , quite dead . The old chief lifted his tomahawk , frowning at her fiercely from beneath his nodding plume , and Robert whispered , " Hush , Nina , or they will kill you , too ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead her away . What a weary , weary march they had of it , through the forest ; and how Nina shrunk when the Indians lifted her up to carry her in their arms ; how she looked imploringly at Robert , and how he smiled and nodded , and tried to make her feel as if he would protect her always . How frightened she was when Bald Eagle tied a cord to Robert 's hands every night , and fastened the end of it to his wrists before he went to sleep ; and how she used to lie awake and look at those grim old Indians , sleeping there on their blankets , and think of her mother , till it seemed as though God must be dead , or such wicked men would n't be alive . After many , many miles had been traveled over , they reached the Indian camp , where the squaws and pappooses and old men lived . The old squaws walked round Nina , and turned her about , and then they gave her some food which she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they gave her a blanket , to wrap round her , and taught her how to sew beads on bags and moccasins , and put a pair of pewter earrings in her ears , and combed her hair all back , and named her " The Little Fawn , " and tried to make a little Indian of her . Bald Eagle was very fond of Robert . He named him " The Young Eagle ; " and gave him a bow and arrow , and a gun ; and took him out hunting ; and every time he shot a bird , or wounded a deer , he would pat him on the head and say : " Good ,  --  by and by scalp the pale faces . " Robert never contradicted Bald Eagle , but appeared as if he were quite contented , and tried to shoot as well as he could , to please him ; and so Bald Eagle gave him much more liberty to run about , and thought every thing he did was about right . But Robert had a great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bald Eagle knew very little about . He could n't look at Nina 's little pale , sorrowful face without resolving to get away as soon as he could . It made his heart ache to see her wrapped in that ugly blanket , sitting there sewing beads , instead of learning to read and spell and write ; and whenever he got a chance he would whisper something in her ear that would make her smile , and nod her little head , and press his hand confidingly . Bald Eagle had a brother-in-law named " Winged Arrow , " because he could run so fast . He was a white man that had been taken captive by the Indians some years before , and had married Bald Eagle 's sister . Robert liked him ,  --  perhaps , because he was a pale face ; perhaps , because he thought he might pity him and Nina enough to help them get away some time ; so , he used to stay all he could with Winged Arrow , and bring him game that he shot ; and Nina worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrow was a very good friend to them . One day he and Robert were out hunting together , and Robert told him how much he wanted to get away with Nina ; and then Winged Arrow told him that he was getting tired of Indian life , too ; and that very soon there was to be a hunting party , when all the Indians would go away for two days , leaving Nina and Robert with the squaws and some old chiefs , and that he ( Winged Arrow ) was to go , too . But he said that he would pretend to hurt his foot just as they started , so as to be left behind ; and then he would manage to get away with Nina and Robert . Robert did n't jump up and down and clap his hands ;  --  no ; he had lived among the Indians too long for that ; he just nodded , as gravely as if he were sitting with Bald Eagle over a council fire , and they separated and went into the wigwam . Well , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left ; and after the Indians had all gone , Nina , who sat making moccasins , asked the old squaw to let her play with Robert outside the wigwam . At first , she said no ; but Winged Arrow said he would watch them ; so she gave them leave . They played about some time , running in and out of the wigwam , and then going off , gradually , farther and further . By and by Winged Arrow joined them , and getting out of sight , he caught Nina in his arms , and made good his name never stopping to breathe till they were miles and miles away from the encampment . Toward nightfall of the second day , they halted for a few minutes , when a dog bounded past them , that belonged to the tribe . Winged Arrow knew that unless the dog was instantly killed , he would run back and betray them . He did not dare to shoot him with his rifle , on account of the noise ; so he told Robert to fire an arrow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head with his gun , and hid him under the bushes . Then Winged Arrow put his ear to the ground and listened ; then he caught up Nina and ran ( telling Robert to follow ) till they came to a stream in which they all waded for some distance , to throw their followers off the trail . Then Winged Arrow stepped out and put Nina up in a great tree , and Robert and he got up in another . Before long Bald Eagle and several other Indians came along , listening and peeping , and finally halted under the very trees where they were ; and some of the Indians proposed building a council fire and staying there all night , but Bald Eagle objected ; so they rested a while and then moved on . You may be sure that the children were in a dreadful fright , and very glad , when they came down , to be on the Indians ' trail , instead of having them on theirs . Winged Arrow made up his mind to take the children to Charleston , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , not meeting any more Indians , till they reached the American camp in safety . Robert and Nina were so glad to get among white people again , even though they were strangers . The General was very kind , and promised to protect them . It was not long before Bald Eagle found them out . He really loved Robert , and was quite determined to have him back . When he saw him again , although he was an Indian , he almost cried for joy . The General asked Robert if he wished to go back with Bald Eagle . Robert put his arms around Nina and said , " No ! " Bald Eagle looked very sorrowful , but the General would n't let him have the children ; so he had to go away home , to his old squaw , without ' em . Winged Arrow found kind friends who gave him some work to do , and he and Robert and Nina lived together very happily . You never would have guessed , had you seen Nina in her little calico dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , that she had ever made moccasins , or worn a blanket in an Indian wigwam . As to Robert , if your father could have heard his speeches , he would n't have been sorry that " a chief " was spoiled , to make a lawyer . A STREET SCENE . I was taking a walk , some mouths since , when I saw a carriage driving at a furious rate over the pavements . Inside was a woman , with a handkerchief bound under her chin , spotted with blood , and in her lap a little girl with her arm in a sling , and drops of blood upon her collar and face . The woman was pretty , spite of the blood-stained handkerchief about her face , and was caressing the frightened girl upon her lap in such a gentle , womanly way , that I concluded she must be her mother . On the box , with the coachman , was a police officer . What could it all mean ? I will tell you . Some years ago , in one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , and a little girl named Rosa . They had plenty of money , plenty of servants , and , of course , plenty of friends . They had a fine carriage and horses , and every day you might have seen Mrs. Simon , dressed like a queen , seated upon the velvet cushions , with black John , the coachman , upon the box , and black Peter , the footman , standing behind , while little Rosa , as gay as a little paroquet , peered out from her little plumed hat , laughing merrily at all the fine sights she saw . The shop-keepers flew round as if they had St. Vitus ' dance , when Mrs. Simon 's carriage stopped at their door , with the glossy , sleek-coated horses and their silver-mounted harness , and the liveried servants . They bowed and smirked , and skipped round , and pulled little " Cash 's " ears for not getting her " change " quicker , and offered to send home any , and all , and every bundle she chose to order , quicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of No. 6 needles . When she got into her carriage again , and rode down Broadway , whiskered gentlemen on the pavement hoisted their beavers , and bent themselves as low as their corsets would possibly allow , and ladies nodded , and showed their pretty little teeth , and declared that Mrs. Simon was " a perfect little love . " From all this show and luxury , she came down to an empty purse , and a widow 's weeds . Her husband lost all his property at once . Money was all the poor man had ever cared for . He had not the courage to live and look his misfortune boldly in the face , but took his own life , ( like a coward , ) and left his dainty wife and child to bear alone the cross that his manly shoulders could n't carry . Well , Mrs. Simon buried her husband , and then looked about her for her friends ; but alas ! they had all fled , like butterflies , with the sunshine . Her fine house , furniture and carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay her husband 's debts ; and she wandered forth , no one knew whither . My dear children , it is a very sad thing to be proud and poor . Mrs. Simon was very proud . She could not make up her mind to work . She fancied , poor mistaken woman , that it would degrade her . She did n't see that all whose opinion is worth caring for , would respect her the more , for her striving to earn bread for herself and her child . So she sat and cried , and worried herself almost sick , instead of looking at little Rosa , and then stepping out , with a brave heart , and saying : I have been rich ; I am now poor :  --  I want some work to do . She could n't bring her mind to that ; so , as I told you , she disappeared , nobody knew whither , and the world went on just the same without her . Other gay carriages rolled up and down Broadway , with the glittering harness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay and as pretty as Mrs. Simon . None of them asked what had become of their old friend ; they were all too busy about their own affairs ; frolicking and dancing away their lives , just as if they were to live that way forever . Where was Mrs. Simon ? If you had looked into a house where wicked people dwell , who live by breaking all God 's commandments , there you would have found her and little Rosa . Was she happy there ? Can any body be happy who makes up his mind to do wrong ? No ; poor woman ; she dreaded nothing so much as her own thoughts ; and sometimes when Rosa bounded into the room , she would start us if a serpent had stung her . She did n't think when she went there , that sickness and death would come to her in that wretched place ; but they did . And what was to become of little , innocent Rosa ? Must she die and leave her there ? The thought of it made great drops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her . There were none there who feared either God or man , and her moments were fast numbering . She called to her bedside one of the inmates who had been kind to her  --  a young girl , whose heart was not hard and stony . She said to her , with her hands clasped , " Promise me , before I die , that you will get Rosa away from this wretched place  --  quick  --  promise ! " " I will , I will ! " said the young girl , wiping the death-damp from her forehead . The grave closed over poor Mrs. Simon and her errors ; and poor little Rosa sobbed as if she had been the best mother in the world ; and then the young girl , of whom I have spoken , whispered to Rosa that she would be kind to her ,  --  and so she was ; for Mrs. Simon 's death had made her think of a great many good thoughts , and she wanted to get away , too , and live where God was feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driving away with the police officer . It was that young girl and little Rosa . The man in whose house she lived , caught her going away with the child , and cut her with a knife that such people always carry . That 's why the blood was on her cheek , and on Rosa 's dress . And then , in the struggle to get Rosa away , he broke her little arm with his rough grasp ; so she had it " in a sling . " Perhaps they might not have got away at all , had not a police-man heard their screams and helped them off . The man in whose house they had been , was sent to " The Tombs " ( a place in New York for such people , ) and then he was sentenced to the Penitentiary ; and Rosa was very glad to hear that , because she trembled all over for fear he would get her again . Dear little Rosa ! the fright , and her grief , and the broken arm together , threw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feared she would die ; but you will be glad to know that she got well , and that I have seen her since , with her face as full of sunshine as if a cloud had never passed over it ; and that I have heard her , with some other little children , in a school , saying : " Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not ; " and you ca n't tell how happy this made me , after hearing her sad story . Are you not glad that there are good , true , kind hearts left in the world , who remember that Jesus said , " Feed my lambs " ? LETTER FROM TOM GRIMALKIN TO HIS MOTHER . MY DEAR MAMMA GRIMALKIN : How could you let Miss Nipper take me away from you ? I am so miserable , that I have not run around after my tail once since I came here . There 's nothing here to amuse me , not even a fly in the room to catch , for Miss Nipper wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  knitting  --  knitting  --  in the chimney corner . If she 'd only drop her ball now and then , it would be quite a pretty little excitement for me to chase it round , you know ; but she never drops her ball , nor her handkerchief , nor even leaves an old shoe round for me to toss about  --  and as to playing with her apron strings , I should as soon think of jumping into the cradle of Queen Victoria 's baby . I should like to hop up in the chairs now and then , by way of variety , but I do n't dare ,  --  or up on the window seats , to see what 's going on in the street ; but she wo n't let me . Goodness knows she need n't be afraid my paws are dirty , for I have n't been over the threshold since I came here , for a breath of fresh air ; beside , every morning she souses me head over heels in a tub of water , till I hear all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then roasts my brains out drying me between the andirons . Ah , it 's very well for people to talk about " leading a dog 's life of it . " I say , let ' em try a cat 's . Now I am about old enough to begin to go into society a little , and there are a plenty of well-bred cats here in the neighborhood , with beautiful voices , who give free concerts every moonlight night , but Miss Nipper wo n't let me stir a paw . I do n't think I shall stand it much longer ; for the other day , when she went out of the room , I hopped up on the table , and noticed that my whiskers had begun to grow considerable large , and that set me to examining my claws . You understand ! How does Tabby do ? Have you weaned her yet ? Do n't she ever feel sorry , now I am away , that she used to nurse so much more than her share ? She needs to have you cuff her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any sisterly affection for me , although one of my eyes was a week longer getting open than hers . I sha n't forget it in a hurry . I often think it over , as I lie here on the hearth-rug , listening to the everlasting click , click of Miss Nipper 's knitting-needles . Oh , it 's a very hard case , Mother Grimalkin , for a kitty with such a warm heart , and such a frisky disposition as I have , to do nothing but think such miserable thoughts , and lie here staring the ashes in the fire-place out of countenance . Miss Nipper is so stingy of her milk , too , that my ribs are all pricking through my fur ; besides , you will be concerned to learn that I 'm growing up as ignorant as a young Hottentot : for how can I learn to catch mice , boxed up in a parlor without any closets ? Answer me that , and please write soon to your afflicted son , TOM GRIMALKIN . WHAT CAME OF AN OMNIBUS RIDE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago , ( no matter when ;  --  little folks should n't be curious ! ) I was riding in an omnibus with some half-dozen well-dressed ladies , and white kidded gentlemen . At a signal from somebody on the sidewalk , the driver reined up his horses , and a very old man , with tremulous limbs and silvery locks , presented himself at the door for admission . The driver shouted through the sky-light , " Room for one more , there , inside ; "  --  but the gentlemen looked at the old man and frowned , and the ladies spread out their ruffled skirts , for his hat was shabby , and his coat very threadbare . He saw how it was , and why there was " no room , " and meekly turned about to go down the steps , when a fine-looking young man , who sat next to me , sprang to the door , and seizing him by the arm , said , " Take my place , sir ; you are quite welcome to it . I am young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and kindly leading the old man to the vacant seat , he leaped from the steps and walked briskly down the street , while I looked admiringly after him , saying to myself , " That young man has had a good mother . " We drove on , and the more I looked at the old man 's silver hairs , and fine , honest face , the more indignant I felt , at the way he had been treated . Whether he read my thoughts in my countenance , or not , I ca n't say ; but , after most of the passengers had got out , he moved up to me and said , " Good boy  --  good boy  --  was n't he ? My dear , ( and here his voice sunk to a confidential whisper , ) I have got money enough to buy out all the upstart people that filled this omnibus , twenty times over , but I like this old coat and hat . They are as good as a crucible . Help me to find out the true metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pity , just as much as if I needed it "  --  and the old man pulled the strap , got out of the omnibus , and hobbled off down street . Some time after , I advertised for lodgings , and was answered by a widow lady . I liked the air of her house , it was so neat and quiet ; and then , the flowering plants in the window were a letter of recommendation to me . Your cold-hearted , icicle people never care for flowers ; ( you may write that in the fly-leaf of your primer . ) But what particularly pleased me , at Mrs. Harris ' , was the devotion of her son to his mother . I expected no less , because the minute he opened the door , I saw that he was the same young man who gave up his seat in the omnibus to the old gentleman . John did all the marketing and providing as wisely and as well as if he were seventy , instead of seventeen . He wheeled his mother 's arm-chair to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spectacles ; offered her his arm up stairs and down , and spent his evenings by her side , instead of joining other young men in racing over the city to find ways to kill time . It was a beautiful sight , in these days , when beardless boys come stamping and whistling into their mother 's presence , with their hats on , and call her " the old woman . " I spent a pleasant autumn under Mrs. Harris ' quiet roof . And now , winter had set in , with its nice long evenings . John came in to tea , one night , with his bright face over-clouded . His mother was at his side in an instant . John 's master had failed , and John was thrown out of employment ! Then I learned , that it was only by the strictest economy , and hoarding of every cent of John 's small salary , that the house rent was paid and the table provided . And now , so the widow said , the house must be given up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; clerkships were so difficult to obtain ; and they must not think of running in debt . It was such a pity . We were all so comfortable and happy there , in that cozy little parlor , with its sunny bow window full of flowers , and its bright Lehigh fire , and softly cushioned chairs ; that cozy parlor , where the little round table , with its snowy cloth , had been so often spread ; and the fragrant coffee , and delicate tea-biscuit , and racy newspaper had been so often discussed ; where John , in his slippers and dressing-gown , with his dark hair pushed off his broad forehead , read to us page after page of some favorite author , while the wind was welcome to whistle itself dumb outside the threshold , and old Winter to pile up the snow at the door till he got tired of it . It was hard ! John walked up and down the floor , with his hands crossed behind , and Mrs. Harris went round the room , hunting after her spectacles , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman nose . A knock at the door ! A note for John ! " Enclosed , find $500 , to pay Mr. John Harris ' house rent for the coming year . A FRIEND . " John rubbed his eyes , and looked at his mother ; his mother looked at me ; and I looked at both of them ; and then we laughed and cried , till we nearly had regular hysterics . But who was the " Friend " ? That was the question . We were all born Yankees , and did our best at " guessing ; " but it did n't help us . Well , at any rate , it was very nice , all round . I had n't to be routed . No , nor John , nor his dear old mother . And pussy purred round as if she had as much reason to be glad as any of us ; and the canary trilled so sharp a strain that we were obliged to muffle his cage and his enthusiasm , with John 's red silk pocket-handkerchief . Mrs. Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day , when John came back , in the middle of the forenoon , with another riddle , to drive our womanly curiosity still more distracted . He was requested to call immediately  --  so a note , he had just received , read  --  at Mr.  --   --  &amp; Co 's , and " accept the head clerkship , at a salary of $1,400 a year ; being highly recommended by a person whose name his new employers decline giving . " That was a greater puzzle still . John and his mother had rich relations , to be sure ; but , though they had always been interfering in all their plans for making a living , they never had been known to give them anything except  --  advice , or to call on them by daylight ; and it was n't at all likely that the " leopard would change his spots , " at that late day . No ; it could n't be John 's rich relatives , who were always in such a panic lest upper-tendom should discover that their cousins , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dined at one o'clock , and noticed trades-people and mechanics . We were too sensible to believe in fairies , and who the mischief was emptying the " horn of plenty " in that way at our feet , was the question . When we woke the next morning , we found in the back yard , a barrel of apples , a barrel of flour , a keg of butter , and a bag of buckwheat flour ; labelled , " For Mr. John Harris ,  --   --  street . " John declared , ( after pinching himself to see if he were really John , ) that he fastened the gate inside the very last thing before he put on his night-cap . Mrs. Harris said somebody must have climbed over and unfastened it ; and I jumped right up and down , for a bright thought had just struck me , and I was determined to hold on to it , for I did n't have a bright thought every day . " What now ? " said John , as I capered round the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only it takes a woman , after all , to find out a secret  --  and to keep it , too , " I added , snapping my fingers at him . That day I thought it would do me good to ride about in an omnibus . I tried several . It did n't make much difference to me whether they went up street or down , or where they finally stopped . I was looking more at the passengers . By and by I saw the person I wanted . Said I , in a whisper , sitting down beside him , " House rent  --  clerkship  --  flour  --  butter  --  crackers and buckwheat ; all for giving you a seat in an omnibus ! " Did n't I know that " the fairy " was the nice old man with silver locks ? Did n't he bribe me to hold my tongue , by telling me that he would come and drink tea with me , so that he might get a peep at John and his mother ? Did n't he come ? and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had n't been all settled two days previous ? But how was I to know that Mrs. Harris would turn out to be an old love of his ? How was John to know , when he felt such an irresistible impulse to be kind to the old man , that his hair had grown white loving his mother ? How was the old man to know why he loved John so well , and thought him one of the finest young men he had ever seen ? How was I to know that I was to turn out to be what I always so mortally hated  --  a feminine match-maker ? LITTLE GERTRUDE 'S PARTY . Little Gertrude wanted to have a party . Sarah and Julia Smith had had one , and Eliza Doane , and the twin Smith girls , and their little cousin Mary Vose ; ( parties were very delightful things , why should n't she have one ? ) Gertrude 's mother was a sensible woman ; she did not approve of children 's parties ; but she had found out that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by experience , that her mother always knew best ; so Miss Gertrude had leave to " have a party ! " How her tongue did run ! " She should not ask Louisa Loft because she did not invite her ; she should not ask Louisa Thompson , because she borrowed her ' Arabian Nights ' and tore out one of the pictures ; she should not ask Janie Jones , because she heard her call her new bonnet ' a perfect fright ; ' she should not ask George Sales , because he was such a glutton he would eat up all the bon-bons . " As to " supper , " she would like oysters , of course ; " escalloped oysters , " with wine in them , and two pyramids of ice cream , one vanilla and one lemon ; and some Charlotte Russe , and some Jersey biscuit , and all sorts of cakes , and sugar drops with " cordial " inside , and " mottoes " for the little beaux to give the little belles , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , &amp;c . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her pink dress was too shabby to be thought of a moment ; her blue one had neither tucks , nor flounces ; ( and who ever heard of a party dress with a plain skirt ? ) her buff one was not gay enough ; in short , she had been seen in all those dresses  --  she ought to have a bran new one  --  a cherry silk , for instance , with swan 's down round the neck and shoulders ; that would be charming . Mary Scott told her , that her Philadelphia cousin had a dress like that , and looked lovely in it . As to the time for the party she thought a week from that day would suit all the dress-makers  --  next Thursday week ; then there were the notes of invitation  --  should they be written on plain or embossed paper ? gilt-edged or not gilt-edged ? These important questions puzzled Gertrude hugely . Thursday came  --  and so did " the cherry dress and the swan 's down . " The dress-maker pinched Gertrude into it , and Gertrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " it fitted beautifully ; " the little satin slippers were also laced and rosetted to her mind , and her kid gloves properly ruche-d and bow-d and her hair curled by Mons. Frizzle , till she looked like his wife 's little poodle dog " Apollo . " The bell began to ring ! Gertrude ran once more to the glass before the door should open ; it was all right , all but one curl on the left temple that had veered round a little too much to the north-east , and which had to be re-arranged . In they came . The two Misses Tarleton first , dressed in a cerulean blue , to set off their " lint locks " and fair complexions , with their two hands encased in white kids , crossed over their two sashes , and an embroidered pocket-handkerchief , starched very stiffly , between their little fingers . Close upon their satin slippers came Miss Jenny Judkins , whose father was " rich . " Miss Jenny wore a black velvet waist trimmed profusely with black bugles , that sparkled under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt was pink satin trimmed with black lace flowers , and her hair was drawn back tightly from the roots at her forehead , and confined by tri-colored bows with long streamers like the pennants of a ship . Gertrude felt very much afraid that Miss Jenny would be voted " the belle . " Time would " give out " should I undertake to do justice to all these young ladies , beside I must not omit the young gentlemen . I am not quite sure that I have done right to keep them so long in " the gentleman 's dressing room . " In the first place , allow me to introduce you to Mr. Augustus Anthony , who has been in the hands of Mons. Peruke for the last hour , as you will perceive by his perfumed locks ; the bows of his little silk necktie , you please notice , are of the proper fashionable size , and his jacket richly embroidered . His brother John , " just from college , " fixed his watch chain ; so there 's no use in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jr. , with his patent pumps and silk stockings , and his sister Jane 's diamond ring outside his buff glove on the third finger . He has frequent occasion to point about the room with that hand , you notice ! Next comes Master Simpkins , who is very bashful , and stood tweeddling his thumbs , all of a cold sweat , before he ventured in ; he knew that his toes ought to turn out , instead of in , but that was a defect that could n't be rectified in a minute , and so he made up his mind to shuffle in behind Peter , the black waiter , who just passed in to arrange the candelabras . Well , they commenced dancing and all " went merry as a marriage bell " for an hour , when Miss Tarleton was discovered crying , because " Master Simpkins had trod on her blue dress and torn off one of the flounces "  --  and Miss Jane Judkins was very red in the face , because one of Mr. Augustus Anthony 's jacket buttons had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little gold cross had snapped off , nobody knew where , that belonged to her sister Julia , who made her promise " certain true not to lose it ; " and Miss Smith had burst her kid glove right across the hand , and could n't think of dancing after such a disaster . Gertrude ran to her mother in great trouble , proposing that harmony should be restored by the supper table . It looked very gay  --  that supper table , with its lights , and bouquets , and fancy confectionary ; it seemed almost a pity to put it in confusion ; but Mr. George Sales did not incline to that opinion ; so he very quietly seized a dish of oysters and commenced helping himself out of it , quite oblivious of " the presence of the ladies . " Master Anthony was more gallant  --  he , under the influence of Miss Jane Judkins ' tri-colored bows and velvet spencer , valiantly attacked , knife in hand , a fortress of ice-cream , and having freighted a gilt-edged saucer with it , was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing-school bow , when he unfortunately lodged the contents of the saucer on her pink skirt and lace flounces . Gertrude retired to the dressing-room with the afflicted Miss Jane , offering her all the sympathy that such a melancholy occasion called for . When Gertrude returned to the supper room she had the pleasure of hearing Miss Taft remark , that it was " the stupidest party she ever attended ; and as to the supper , it was positively shabby  --  only two pyramids of ice-cream ! but then she had heard her mamma say that Gertrude 's mother had never been to parties much , so she supposed she really did n't know any better ; she ( Miss Taft ) intended to have a party herself , when she was twelve years old , which event was to come off in a month or two , and then they 'd see a party worth dressing for . " Poor Gertrude , after all the pains she had taken , her pretty supper table " shabby , " her party " stupid , " and her mamma  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly miserable  --  her head ached violently , and had it not been for shame , she would have cried outright . The " ladies and gentlemen " having surfeited themselves at the " shabby supper table , " had one more dance , in which nobody was suited with their partners , and several declared , pouting , that they would not dance at all , " because the music was so miserable ; " and then they cloaked and hood-ed themselves , and the " rich " Miss Judkins rolled off in her father 's carriage , much to the dissatisfaction of some of the other young ladies , who walked home with their little pinafore admirers , cutting up Miss Gertrude 's party in a manner that showed they had not listened in vain to the remarks of their mammas about the parties they had attended . As to Gertrude herself , when the last little foot had pattered out of the entry , she threw herself , weeping , into her mamma 's lap , quite worn out with excitement and mortification . Gertrude 's mother considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the " cherry silk dress , " as one of the most profitable investments she ever made ; for , although Miss Gertrude is now a wife and a mother , with a house of her own , she has never been known since that night , to " have a party , " or to express the least desire to go to one . For , my dear children , " grown-up parties " are not a whit more profitable or satisfactory than the little miniature one that caused Gertrude so much trouble and unhappiness . FERN MUSINGS . Morning again ! and New-York is beginning to stir . Lazy creatures ! they should have been up hours ago . That old rooster over the way has crowed himself hoarse , trying to start them all out : and he is not as smart as he might be , for I saw the first streak of dawn myself , before he was off his perch . Now the carts begin to rumble by , with " fresh sweet milk , " labelled on the sides . Lucky they tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ourselves by tasting . There go the dray-carts , with baggage from the just-arrived cars ; then follows a carriage with the owners of the baggage . How hollow-eyed they look , traveling all night . They are evidently thinking of eggs and hot rolls . There go the boarding-house women , basket in hand , to secure their dinner : hope they wo n't spoil it with bad cooking-butter ! There go the shop girls , shrouded in thick brown veils : poor things ! they got up late and could n't stop to comb their hair . There come the market carts from the country , laden with cabbages , and turnips , and beets , and parsnips , and apples , and nobody knows what else beside . There comes a little boy , screeching " R-a-d-i-shes ; " and a little girl just behind him , shouting " Bl-a-ck-ber-ries , " and a man in the middle of the street , yelling " Tin-tin-tin  --  tin ware for sale . " Oh dear ! I shall have to stuff my ears with cotton wool . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech . There come some business men , chewing the last mouthful of their breakfast as they button the first button of their overcoats and hurry down street . There go the laundresses with their baskets of clean clothes ,  --  hope they have n't ironed off all the shirt-buttons . There 's a man with a parcel of old umbrellas on his back : it would puzzle " a Philadelphia lawyer " to find out what he is shouting . Never mind , he makes a noise in the world ; so I suppose he is satisfied . There go two or three women with slip-shod feet ;  --  ugh ! And there 's a little girl fresh from the country , ( you may know that ) for her eyes are as bright as stars , and her cheeks look like June roses . She has a bunch of flowers in her hand , but they are no prettier than herself ;  --  she is a perfect little rose-bud ( if her shoes are clumsy and her bonnet old-fashioned . ) If you 'll excuse me I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I declare ! she says her name is " Letty Hill , " and she has come into town to see Aunt Hopkins ; and her aunt , and she , and her little cousin Meg Hopkins , are all going to Barnum 's Museum , ( Uncle Hopkins is n't going with ' em , because he says Burnum 's a humbug ; ) and she is going to wear a clean white apron , that is stowed away safe in her carpet bag , with blue ribbon strings on it . She do n't know whether she shall stay over night , or not ; her mother told her she might , if Aunt Hopkins asked her , and she hopes she will ask her , because she and Meg Hopkins want to tell ghost-stories , and play " tent " with the sheets after they get into bed . She has a whole ninepence in her pocket , which Jake ( the man on the farm ) gave her , and she intends to buy out some of the Broadway shop keepers with it before she sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mince pie for dinner , and make it real sweet , too ; and she hopes Cousin Tom Hopkins will be at home , because he always gives her sixpences . There she goes , tripping along . God bless her ! She do n't care whether there 's a revolution in Europe or not . Look over there at that street pump ; is n't that a pretty sight now ?  --  that little girl in the short frock , with bare legs , and feet as plump as little partridges . She has set down her basket , and stopped to get a drink of water . The pump handle goes very hard . She concludes to put it to a better use ,  --  she will make a swing of it . So she lifts it way up , and then seizing hold with both hands , swings herself down upon the sidewalk . Ah ! she has alighted in a puddle ! She looks at her little fat feet , and makes up her mind she will take a bath ; so she pumps out the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the other , till they are as white and polished as marble , and her little pink-tipped toes look all too dainty to touch the dirty sidewalk . Now , she sees me looking at her , and blushing scampers off . " Sweep , ho  --  sweep , ho ! want any chimneys swept , ma'am ? " " No , indeed ! not if that poor child behind you has got to crawl up the chimney to do it . Why , he ca n't be more than five years old . " " He 's used to it  --  it do n't hurt his complexion . " Very like , poor little African ; but it would hurt my feelings ; besides I have n't got any chimney  --  no , nor a house ;  --  do n't own anything , I 'm happy to say , but a bandbox and a tooth-brush ; do n't care a snap of my thumb for the " first of May " in New-York ; it do n't move me ! There 's a little boy , under the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trying to cry ; but it is very hard work . Never mind , Johnny , or Sammy , or whatever your name is , do n't shed a tear for me , for mercy 's sake ; but there 's a penny for making up such an awful face . I 'll send you to puzzle the barber in the avenue , who advertises to " cut hair to suit the countenance ! " CRAZY TIM . What in the world is that ?  --  a poor old man , almost bent double , drawing a little wooden horse upon the pavement , and laughing and talking to it as if he were seven years old , instead of seventy ! How white his hair is ; and see  --  his hat is without a crown , and one of the flaps of his coat is torn off . Now one of the boys has pelted him with a stone , that has brought the blood from his wrinkled cheek ; another asks him " how much he will take for his hat , " while all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  old crazy Uncle Tim ! " Come here , boys , wo n't you ?  --  and let poor Uncle Tim go home , while I tell you his story . Uncle Tim used to be the village shoemaker , hammering away at his lap-stone in that little shop with the red eaves , as contentedly as if he owned a kingdom . He always had a pleasant smile and a merry story for his customers , and it was worth twice the money one paid him , to see his sunshiny face and hear his hearty laugh . Illustration : CRAZY TIM . But the light of Uncle Tim 's eyes was his little daughter Kitty . Kitty was not a beauty . No  --  her little nose turned right up , like a little dogs ; her hair was neither soft nor curly ; and her little neck and arms were almost as brown as the leather in her father 's shop ,  --  still , everybody loved Kitty , because she had such a warm , good heart , and because she was so kind to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been dead many years . I should n't wonder if Uncle Tim did n't grieve any , for she was a very cross , quarrelsome , disagreeable person , and made him very unhappy . Little Kitty was his housekeeper now , although she was only seven years old . She and her father lived in a room back of the shop , and Uncle Tim did the cooking , while Kitty washed the dishes , made the bed , and tidied up the small room with her own nimble little fingers . When she had quite done , she would run into the shop , steal behind her father , throw her chubby brown arms about his neck , and give him a kiss that would make him sing like a lark for many an hour after . While his fingers were busy at his lap-stone he was thinking  --  not of the coarse boots and shoes he was making , but of little Kitty  --  how he meant to send her to school  --  how he meant she should learn to read and write , and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was young  --  and how he meant to save up all his money in the old yarn stocking , till he got enough to put in the bank for Kitty ,  --  so that when he died she need n't go drifting round the world , trying to earn her bread and butter among cold , stony-hearted strangers . Uncle Tim found some time to play , too . When it came sundown , he and Kitty , and the old yellow dog Jowler , would start off on a stroll . It was very funny to see little Kitty fasten down the windows with an old nail , before she started , like some old housekeeper , and put the tea-kettle in the left-hand corner of the fire-place , and take such a careful look about to see if everything was right , before turning the key . When they got out into the fields they both enjoyed the fresh air as only industrious people can . Every breath they drew seemed a luxury ; and as to Uncle Tim , I do n't know which was the younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over fences and stone walls like a squirrel ; and as to Kitty , her merry laugh would ring through the woods till the little birds would catch it up and echo it back again . Then , when they reached home , they had such a good appetite for their brown bread and milk . Oh ! I can tell you , Uncle Tim and Miss Kitty would n't have thanked Queen Victoria for the gift of her scepter , they were so happy . One day Kitty asked Uncle Tim to let her go huckleberrying . She said she knew a field where they were " as thick as blades of grass . " Uncle Tim could n't go with her , because Sam Spike , the blacksmith , was in a hurry for a pair of boots to be married in , and of course Sam could n't wait for all the huckleberries in creation ; so Tim staid at home , humming and singing , and singing and humming , while Kitty tied on her calico sun-bonnet , slung her basket on her little brown arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good company . Kitty and he used to have long conversations about all sorts of things . Kitty always knew by the way he wagged his tail whether he agreed with her or not . When any other dog came up to speak to him , he 'd look up into Kitty 's little freckled face , to see if she considered the new dog a proper acquaintance , and if she shook her head , he 'd give him a look out of his eyes , as much as to say , " It 's no use , " and trot demurely on after Kitty . Well , Jowler and she picked a quart of huckleberries , and then Kitty started for home , Jowler carrying the basket in his mouth part of the way , when Kitty spied any flowers she wished to pick . When she had plucked all she wanted she concluded to take a shorter cut home across the fields , and down on the railroad track . So they trotted on , Kitty singing the while . By and by they reached the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as she could see . To be sure there was a curve in the road just behind her , ( round which the eye could n't look , ) but she was n't afraid . Just then Jowler dropped the basket and spilt her huckleberries . Kitty was so sorry ,  --  but she stooped down to gather them up , when a train of cars whisked like lightning round the curve on the road , and poor little Kitty was crushed to death in an instant ! Jowler was n't killed  --  faithful Jowler ,  --  he trotted home to Uncle Tim , who sat singing at his work , and leaped upon him , and whined , and tugged at his coat , till Uncle Tim threw down the blacksmith 's boots and followed him , for he knew something must be the matter . Perhaps Kitty had fallen over a stone wall , and lamed her foot  --  who knew ? So Jowler ran backwards and forwards , barking and whining , till he brought Uncle Tim to the railroad track . Was that crushed mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  all he had in the wide earth to love ? Uncle Tim looked once , and fell upon the earth as senseless as a stone . Ever since he has been quite crazy . All he cares to do is to draw up and down through the road that little wooden horse that Kitty used to play with , hoping to coax her back to him . Poor old Tim ! Would you throw another stone at him , boys ? Would you hunt the weary old man through the streets like some wild beast ? Would you taunt , and sneer , and shout in his ears , " Old crazy Tim "  --  " Old crazy Tim ? " Oh , no  --  no ! Pick a flower and give him , as Kitty used ; take his hand  --  poor , harmless old man  --  and walk along with him ; maybe he 'll fancy that you are little Kitty , ( who knows ? ) and smile once more before he dies . Poor Uncle Tim ! CICELY HUNT ; OR , THE LAME GIRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's love ! Every morning , about eight o'clock , I have noticed , limping past my window to school , a little lame girl . A woman goes with her ; supporting her gently by the arm and carrying her satchel of books . The girl is very poorly clad . Sometimes her dress will be patched with two or three different colors ; but it is always very clean ; and I have observed that her stockings , though coarse , are always whole , and that her shoes are neatly tied up . The woman who goes with her looks tidy , too ; though she wears a rusty black bonnet , of an old-fashioned make , and a faded shawl . Cicely 's little school-mates bound past her ; skipping , hopping , jumping and running , as if they could not exercise their legs enough . The lame girl looks at them , smiles a sad , quiet smile , and looks up tearfully in her mother 's face . The mother answers back with a look so full of love , and lays her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " I love you all the more , because you are a poor , little helpless cripple . " And so they travel over the icy pavements to school ; ( stepping very carefully , for it would be a sad thing if Cicely should slip and fall ; ) until , at last , they reach the school house . What a blessing are free schools ! What a difference it makes in the life of that poor girl , to be able to read ! How many weary hours of pain will a nice book beguile ! And , beside , if one has not a cent in the world , if one has a good education , it is worth as much as money in the bank ,  --  and more , too , because banks often turn out great humbugs , and then people lose all the money they have placed in them . Cicely was not always poor . She can remember ( just as you can a dream , when you first rub open your eyes in the morning ) a great big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rich sofas and curtains , and gilded mirrors , and silver vessels , and black servants . She remembers that her father carried a gold-headed cane , that he used to let her play horse with ; and that he used to sit a long while at the table with gentlemen , drinking wine and eating fruit after dinner ; and that often , he would ring for the nurse to bring her in , to show her to the gentlemen when her curls had been nicely smoothed and her little embroidered frock put on ; and that then he would stand her up on the table and make her sing a little song , and that the gentlemen would clap their hands and laugh , and grow very merry about it . Then she remembers that one day there was a great running to and fro in the house ; and she saw her father lifted from a carriage in the arms of two gentlemen , and that blood was flowing from his side ; and then her nurse caught her up , and carried her into the nursery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her papa again for many days ; and she remembers that one day , getting tired waiting for him to come up and see her , she crept down by herself to his room , and found him lying on the bed , with his hands crossed over his breast , and only a linen sheet thrown over him , though it was very cold weather ; and she said , " Papa ? "  --  but he did n't answer ; and she got a chair and climbed up in it to put her hand on his face , to wake him , but he was as cold as the marble image in the hall ; and then her nurse called , " Cicely !  --  Cicely ! " and seemed frightened , when she found her there ; but would n't tell her why her papa laid there so still , or why he would n't speak to his little girl . And then she remembers going away from the big house , and bidding good-bye to her black nurse ; and ever since that they had lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though her mamma never answered them back , she sighed heavily , and sometimes leaned her head on her hand and wept . And one night it snowed in on the bed , and Cicely caught cold and had a fever , which left her with the dreadful lameness that I told you about ; and then Cicely 's mother groaned because she had no money ; for she thought some of the great doctors , if they were well paid for it , might think it worth their while to try and cure Cicely . Cicely 's limb was less painful now than it had been for two years , although it was quite useless ; but her mother , as I told you , helped her to limp to school . Cicely kept hoping it would get quite well , and she wanted to learn as fast and as much as she could ; because she thought if she got all the medals , the Committee might say , " Cicely , we must have you for a teacher here , some day . " Yes ; why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , perhaps , she could earn enough to ( and here Cicely had to stop to think , because there were so many things they wanted , )  --  earn enough to buy a pair of warm blankets for their bed ; and enough to have a cup of tea Sunday nights ; and enough to keep a fire and a light through the long winter evenings , and not have to go to bed because they were so cold , and because candles were so dear . Yes ; Cicely was looking forward to all that , when she limped along to school . She thought it would be so delightful to empty her purse in her kind mother 's lap , and say : " Dear mother , you need n't work any more . I will support you , now . " Oh , what a nice thing hope is ! Sometimes , to be sure , she leads us a long dance for nothing ; but I am very certain that were it not for hope , we should n't be good for much . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made him leap to his feet and set his teeth together , and spring over obstacles as if he had on " seven league boots . " She is a little coquettish , but I like her . She has helped me out of many a hobble . Well , as the great speakers say , this is a digression . Do you know what that is ? It is leaving off what you are about , to dance off to something else  --  just as I did up there about hope . Now I 'm going on ! One day the committee came to Cicely 's school , to hear the scholars recite ; and Cicely stood up in her patched gown as straight as she could , and recited her lessons . One of the gentlemen who came in with the committee asked , " Who is that young girl who said her lessons so well ? " " Cicely Hunt ? " he repeated , after the teacher ,  --  " Cicely Hunt ! She was not lame ; and then  --  why  --  no  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he leaned back in his chair , and looked at Cicely . After school was over he said to her , " Do you sing , Cicely ? " " Not now , " said Cicely , blushing . " I used to sing , a long while ago , when I was little . " " When , Cicely ? " " I sang to  --  to  --  my papa , " said Cicely  --  tears springing to her eyes . " I used to sing , ' Blue eyed Mary , ' for the gentlemen who dined with papa . " Then the gentleman ( pretending to look out the window ) wiped his eyes , and turning to the teacher , they whispered a long while together , now and then looking at Cicely . That evening , when Cicely and her mother were warming their fingers over a fire of shavings , somebody knocked at the door . Cicely blushed , when she saw the same gentleman she had seen at the school coming in , and looked anxiously about the room . But Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he saw anything , his eyes were so full of tears ; but he held Cicely 's mother by the hand several minutes , without speaking , and led her back to the chair with as much deference as if she had been a Duchess ; and then Cicely found out , as they talked , that he was one of her father 's old friends , and that , as sometimes happens , even between friends , they had a quarrel , and that then they were both mistaken enough to think that the most gentlemanly way to settle it , was to fight a duel ; and that Mr. Raymond wounded her father , and had to go away as fast as possible , because there was so much noise about it , and that he had been very unhappy ever since , and would have given all he had to have brought him to life again , and that when he returned to his native city he had searched everywhere for Mrs. Hunt and Cicely , without finding them . Well , now he wanted to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . She forgave him the sorrow he had brought upon her because he had suffered so much ; but she did not wish to be supported by him . However , she allowed him to find her a better place to live in , and get her some scholars to teach , who paid her high prices , and by and by Cicely helped her , and so they supported themselves ; which is a far pleasanter way of living than to be dependent . Cicely was never entirely cured of her lameness ; but a physician made her much more comfortable ; so she could walk by herself , with the help of a crutch ; and Mrs. Hunt 's last days , after all , were her best days ; for , we should never know , my dear little pets , how brightly the sun shines , if it were never clouded . THE LITTLE TAMBOURINE PLAYER . I was sitting at my window one fine morning , at a farm house in the country , enjoying the sweet air , the soft blue clouds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , straw hats , as they tossed the hay about , piled it upon the cart , or " raked after , " or drove along home through the meadow , crushing the sweet breath from the clover blossoms that lay scattered in their path ; and enjoying the song of the little robin in the linden tree opposite , who was thrilling my heart with his gushing notes . * * * A hand organ ! What a nuisance ! I fancied I had left them all behind me in the city , where one has such a surfeit of them . A hand organ in the country ! where the little birds never make a discord , or charge us a fee , either ! I 'll get up and shut the window , or run off into the back woods , where such a thing as a hand organ was never heard of . I got up to put my threat into execution , when my eye was attracted by the musicians . There was a coarse , stout , sun-burned Irish woman , with an immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gaudy ribbon under her three chins , singing , " I 'd be a butterfly ! " At her side , stood a little girl about six years old , holding an inverted tambourine , to catch windfalls in the shape of pennies . The little creature was as delicate as a rose leaf ; her eyes were large and of a soft hazel ; her skin fair and white , and her hair waved over her graceful little head as sweetly as your own . Her hands were small and white , and her coarse shoes could not hide her pretty little feet . She was not that woman 's child ; I was sure of if ; for her voice was as sweet as a wind harp . " How far have you come , to-day ? " asked I of the Irish " butterfly . " " From the city , sure , " said she ; " would your leddyship give me a saxpence ? " I 'd have given her five times that amount , if she would n't have sung to me again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if the child had walked from the city ( four miles ) too ? " Sure , " said the woman , looking a little confused . " Biddy would be afther going with her mother wheriver she went . " Her mother ? I did n't believe it . That child had been delicately brought up , as sure as my name was Fanny . All my motherly feelings were roused in an instant . " If that is the case , " said I , carelessly , " I suppose she is hungry , and her mother , too ; if you will let her go down in the orchard with me , I will bring you back some nice ripe apples . " The little girl looked timidly at the woman , who took a good look at me out of her bold , saucy , black eyes , and asked , " Is it far you 'll be going ? " " Just to yonder tree , " said I , pointing down the meadow ; " but if you think it will weary her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You can go with the lady , " said the woman , giving her a look that the child seemed to understand , " and I will just sit on the fence and look afther ye . " " Is that your mother ? " said I , stooping to pluck a daisy at the little one 's feet . " Y-e-s , " she said slowly , but without looking me in the face . " No she is not , " said I. " Do n't be afraid of me ; if you want to get away from her I can help you . Did n't she steal you away ? " The child nodded her head , without speaking , and looked timidly over her shoulder , to see if any one was near to hear me . " Is your own mother alive ? " I asked . She nodded her head again , and her sweet little lip quivered . " Hush ! " said I , " do n't cry . I 'll get you away from her . Keep quiet . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pears in your apron , that I knock off this tree . " I climbed the pear tree and peeping over the fence , saw good honest " Jim , " the " man of all work " at the farm , sitting down in the shade to rest , with old Bruno curled up at his feet . I tossed a pear at his red head . Jim looked up . I put my finger on my lip , saying , " Creep round by the fence , Jim , and get up to the house ; go in at the back door and wait till I come up . Do n't say a word to anybody . I 'll tell you why when I get back . " Jim gave me a sagacious nod , and commenced going on all fours behind the fence . Little " Biddy , " as her pretended mother called her , filled her apron with the pears and we started across the field to where Bridget still sat , perched upon the garden fence , with her hand organ unstrapped at her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thanked me in her uncouth way , between the big mouthsful , and sat down on the grass with Biddy . Presently I asked her if she would like some ginger beer ; of course she said yes , and of course I had to go into the kitchen to get it , and of course I found Jim there , and telling him my story in a dozen words , he brought his hand down with a thump on his waistband , exclaiming , " Je-ru-sa-lem ! " When Jim said that you might know he was going to do something terrible ! Well , I went back with the beer , and just as Bridget was tipping the glass up to her thick lips , Jim bounded behind her like a panther , and held her arms tight while I took little Biddy and scampered into the house . Having locked little Biddy safe in my chamber , I returned and picked up off the grass , two silver spoons of Jim 's mother 's , that Bridget had taken from the parlor closet while we were getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up in jail  --  to say nothing of her carrying off poor little Biddy  --  and you may be sure that Jim was not long in sending her there , spite of her vociferations that , " If there was law in the counthry she 'd have the right of him yet , for meddling with an honest woman like Bridget Fliligan . " " Thank you for telling us your name , " said Jim , coolly ; " it is just what we wanted to know . " But it is time I let out my little prisoner , poor little Edith , ( that was her real name . ) " Is she gone a great way off ? Ca n't she get me ever ? " said the frightened child , peeping round the room as if she expected to see her jump out of the closet , or spring from under the bed . " Will you keep hold of my hand all the time when it comes night ? Ca n't they get me then ? " " No , no , my darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knee . Now , tell me , how came you to live with Bridget ? " " I was going to school , " said Edith , " and I stopped to look at some pretty pictures in a shop window , when this Bridget came up to me and said , ' Which of them do you like best , dear ? '  --  and I said , ' The little boy asleep on the dog 's neck ; ' and she said , ' If you will come round the corner with me , I will give you one just like it ; ' and I said , ' No ; I shall be late at school , and my mamma would n't like it ; ' and then she said it would n't take but a minute , and she led me into an alley , and when she got there she threw her shawl over my head , and ran with me ; and when she took the shawl off , I was in a house with some Irish people , and Bridget said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure , to play the tambourine . Wo n't the pretty face of her bring the shillings ? ' " And then I cried , and begged them to take me back to mamma ; and Bridget held up a great stick , and said , ' Do you see that ? ' and then she took off the clothes I had on , and put on these , and brought the tambourine , and told me how to play it ; and when my fingers trembled so that I could n't , she shook me , and pulled my hair , and said I should have nothing to eat till I learned to do it ; and I begged and begged her to take me home . I told her mamma would cry all night , and papa , too , and little Henry ,  --  but she hurt me with the stick so ( pulling up her sleeve , and showing me the blue spots on her arms ) ; and then I was afraid she would kill me , and so I tried to learn , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me see mamma ;  --  but she never did ; and I slept in the cellar with her nights , and in the day time , before light , she takes me out into the country to play . See , my feet are very sore "  --  ( and she pulled off the heavy , coarse shoes and showed me the blisters on them . ) " Wo n't you take me to see my mamma , quick ? " said Edith , putting her little arms round my neck , as if she were afraid I would feel hurt because she wanted to leave me so soon . " Just as fast as old Dobbin can carry you , my darling , " said I , " if you will only tell me where to find her . " Little Edith began to cry . " Perhaps she is dead , " said she , sobbing . " Oh , I hope not , " said I , ( the thought of restoring the little one had been so delightful to me ) ; " cheer up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father . What does he do for a living , Edith ? " " He has a shop , " said Edith , " and knives , and forks , and scissors , and iron things in it . " " Oh , I know ; he is what we call a hardware merchant . " " Yes , " said Edith , " that 's it . " " Well , where 's the shop ? " " In the city , " said Edith , " in  --   --  street . My papa 's name is  --   --  Grosvenor , Esquire . " " Well , we 'll find him , Jim and I. Here 's the horse and wagon , my little musician , so jump in . " Jim whipped up , and away we jolted into town , little Edith clinging tightly to my arm , for fear of Bridget . Two hours and we were in  --   --  street . I went into a confectioner 's with little Edith , while Jim drove to her father 's store . Edith grew very impatient  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she walked often to the window and looked out . In about half an hour I saw Jim coming back up the street , and at his side a fine looking , tall man , of thirty . " There 's Jim , " said I to Edith  --  " And papa ! and papa !  --  oh , it is papa  --  my own papa "  --  and she rushed to the door with the speed of an antelope . How can I describe to you that meeting , when I could n't see it for my tears ? but I heard kisses and sobs , thick and fast , and the words , " Dear papa , " and " My blessed , lost Edith . " Well , nothing would do , but Jim and I must go home and see mamma , too , who had never been outside of the door since her poor little girl was taken away . We drove to the house  --  Edith , and I and Jim , staying below stairs , while Mr. G  --   --  went to prepare his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy fall upon the floor . The joy was too intense . Edith 's mother had fainted ! She opened her eyes  --  it was not a dream ! There was her little lost darling before her ! She held her at arm 's length  --  she clasped her to her breast  --  she kissed my hands  --  then she ran weeping to her husband  --  then back to Edith , till the pantomime became too painful . " Je-ru-sa-lem ! " said Jim . THE BROKER 'S WINDOW BY GASLIGHT . Last evening I was walking in Broadway . The shop windows were brilliant with gas , and bright silks , and satins , and jewels were all spread out in the windows in the most tempting manner ; all was gayety , bustle , hurry , drive , and confusion ; omnibuses , carts , carriages , drays , military , music ; people flocking to concerts , shows , and theatres ; people flocking in town , and people flocking out ; fashions in one window  --  coffins in the next ; beggars and millionaires , ministers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sauntered along dreamily , looking at them all , and wondering where all those myriads of people ate , and drank , and slept ; how they had all laughed and wept ; how soon they would all die off , one by one , without being missed , while strangers , just as busy , would fill their places , and die in turn , to give place to others . Over my head the stars shone on , just as brightly as they did ages ago , when Bethlehem 's babe was born  --  just as they will ages hence , when nobody will know that you or I ever thrilled with joy , or sighed with sorrow , beneath them . But I am not going to preach to you ;  --  the panorama made me think ; that 's all . Well , I sauntered along , and presently came in sight of a broker 's window , ( ask your papa what a broker is , ) in a basement , quite down upon the pavement . The window seat was covered with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , in gold and silver ;  --  some quarters  --  some half-dollars  --  some dollars  --  some five dollar and some ten dollar pieces . I should n't have looked twice after them , but , crouched down upon the sidewalk , so close to the broker 's window that his face almost touched it , was a little boy about ten years old . His ragged little cap was pushed carelessly back ; his long , dark hair fell round his face , and his eyes were fixed upon that money with an intensity of gaze , that seemed to render him perfectly unconscious of the presence of any one about him . I touched my companion 's arm , and we stopped and looked at the boy some moments , and then passed on . But I could n't go away , I wanted so much to know what that little boy was thinking about . So we went back again , and watched him a few minutes longer . He had not moved from his position . There he sat , with his little chin in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about , dear ? " said I , touching him gently on the shoulder . He started , and the bright color flushed to his very temples . I fancied that I had frightened him , or wounded his feelings . Perhaps he imagined that I thought he was trying to steal that money . So I said quickly , " Do n't be afraid of me ; I only felt curious to know what your thoughts were . I love little children . Now tell me  --  you were wishing all that bright money was yours , were you not ? " " Yes , " said he , veiling his great dark eyes with their long lashes . " I thought so , " said I ; " and now , supposing you had it , what would you do with it , my darling ? " Now , very likely you think he told me of the kites , and tops , and balls , and horses , and marbles that he would buy with it . No  --  he looked up earnestly in my face for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then he said , with his great eyes swimming in tears , " I would give it all to my mother . " I did n't care whose boy he was  --  he was mine then . So I just kissed him , and tried to keep from crying myself , while I asked him where he lived . He told me in  --   --  Court ; and then we took hold of his hands and went home with him . Such a home ! A little low room , with one small window , and no furniture in it , except an old rickety bedstead , upon which lay a woman about thirty years old , wasting away in a consumption . Her large eyes glittered like stars , and on each cheek burned a bright red fever-spot . An old shawl was thrown on the bed for a counterpane . She had neither sheets nor blankets , and the chill night air blew through the broken window-panes , making her cough so fearfully that I thought she must die then . Little Angelo crept to my side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I wanted the money . " Well , this was her story , which ( in broken English ) she told us ( between her coughing spells ) : About a year before , she came over to this country from Italy with her husband . He was a very bad man , and as soon as he landed from the ship he ran off with all their money , and left his wife to take care of herself and little Angelo . They wandered all about , and came near getting into some very bad places , ( which was what her naughty husband wished her to do , I suppose . ) Sometimes they slept in old sheds , and behind barrels , or anywhere where they could find a shelter for the night out of harm 's way . Poor Mrs. Cicchi was delicate , and could not bear such cruel exposure . She took a violent cold , and that brought on a quick consumption ; and now there she lay , in that miserable room , in a strange country , dying ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money in the broker 's window . Mrs. Cicchi told us that Angelo was a good boy , and would much rather work than beg , if he could get anything to do . She said his father made images in Italy , and that Angelo was always trying to do it too , whenever he got a bit of clay ; and sometimes she thought he could get a living in that way when she was dead , if he had any friends ; but , " poor boy ! " she said , and turned her face to the pillow . " Poor boy ! oh , how can his father forget him ? " We comforted her , and told her that Angelo should be taken care of , and then she wiped away her tears , and said she " could die happy "  --  and she did die a few days after ; for cold , and hunger , and trouble had done more mischief , than the doctor who was sent to her could undo , with all his skill . How poor Angelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and face , and sobbed , " My poor , poor mother ! " He grieved so much that we almost feared he would die too . By and by he listened to me . I told him that his mother was always near him , though he could not see her ; and that every time he thought a good thought , or put away an evil one , she sang a sweeter song . Angelo liked that ! His great dark eyes glittered through his tears ; he smiled and kissed my hand ;  --  often he sits still and listens , as if he heard his mother 's song . Angelo is a good boy . When he is out of school he works with an image maker . It is all play to him , he likes it so much . The old man stares to see him go on , but do n't say anything . I know very well what he is thinking : he thinks that one of these days Congress will send Angelo an order for a statue for the Capitol ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father will be very glad to own him by and by . Oh , I can tell you , good luck is an excellent " town crier , " to find people with bad memories ! BLACK CHLOE . I wonder how you treat the servants in your mother 's house ? Do you order them round , as if they were so many dray-horses ?  --  or do you speak pleasantly to them when you desire they should wait on you ? I know there are a great many bad servants , but there are a great many good ones , too . I am going to tell you about one . Her name was Chloe Steele . She lived with a lady by the name of Mrs. Kumin . Fannie Kumin was fifteen years old when Chloe came to live with her mother . Chloe loved to do little services for Fannie , because she was so smiling and good natured . She never rang the bell , just to warn Chloe that she was her mistress ; and when she called her for anything , always tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not make her take any extra steps , up and down stairs . Chloe noticed this , and felt grateful for it , and was always very careful to regard all her little wishes . She tidied up her little bed-room very carefully , and always ran out in the garden and cut a little bouquet to place in the vase upon her toilette table , to make her room sweet and pleasant for her . Fannie did n't require much waiting upon ; she preferred being her own waiter , ( like a sensible little girl . ) It was very well she did so , because in a couple of years after Chloe went there to live , she was left an orphan , and when the estate was settled up , it was found that little Fannie had no money to live upon . Chloe said , " do n't be troubled , Miss Fannie ; I am used to work . I 'll find you a boarding place , and then I 'll go out to service , and pay your bills . I can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will live like a lady . It would break my heart to see Master 's daughter work for her living . " Fannie said , " You are a dear , good Chloe , but I could not be happy to live that way ;  --  no  --  I must go to work , and that will keep me from thinking of my troubles . I should become very miserable if I sat still , with my hands folded , and thought only of so many sorrowful things . No , no , dear Chloe  --  I shall teach in Mrs.  --   --  ' s school ; and you will see , the education that my dear mother has given me will be just as good as so much money . " So Chloe said no more about supporting her , because she saw that she really would be happier to support herself ; but she insisted upon washing and ironing her clothes for her , and the day that she carried them home , all nicely folded in a basket , was the happiest day in the week to poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cooked her own food . All blacks are born cooks , I believe , and many a tempting little dainty she stowed away of a Saturday night , to take up to school to Fannie . Sometimes it would be a loaf of cake ; sometimes a pie or two ; sometimes a few oysters , nicely cooked ; for she said " it was poor fare enough teachers had in boarding schools , and who knew but Miss Fannie might get quite run down , on that and the hard work together . " Then she would go round her room , picking up the stockings and mending them , and brushing her little gaiter boots ; and then she would take the comb out of her long hair and part it nicely , and brush it and dress it all over as well as Madame Marmotte , the French hair dresser , could do . If Fannie took cold , she 'd come and make her some hot tea , and soak her feet in mustard water , and leave her some nice hot lemonade to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to put in the post-office , or was expecting one , then Chloe was on hand to do the errand , just as promptly as an express man . Now she did all this out of sheer love for Fannie , and because she had been kind to her in her mother 's house , and never put on airs and ordered her about , as some children do . By and by , Miss Fannie took it into her head to get engaged to be married . Chloe did n't half like it ;  --  she was jealous . She was " afraid Massa Hale would n't make a good husband enough . Miss Fannie ought to have a very nice one , because she was such a fine young lady ; " and Chloe shook her woolly head , till her gold hoop ear-rings rung again , and advised Miss Fannie to " wait a leetle longer . " " Time enough yet , when she was only eighteen , plenty more gemmen ; no hurry yet for Miss Fannie . " But Fannie had her own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " and when Chloe found there was no help for it , she said she would go and be her cook , " just to look after the dear child a bit , and see that she had everything she wanted , " and that nothing was wasted . You ought to have seen her in " Miss Fannie 's " kitchen , ( for she still kept on calling her Miss Fannie ; ) with her gay bandanna handkerchief twisted round her wool , and her neat check apron tied round her waist , moving round among the shining pots , and pans , and kettles , as important as if she were the great Mogul ; turning out pies and hoe cakes , and flap-jacks , ( and every other Jack , too , for Chloe had no beaux dangling after her , I promise you . ) If " Miss Fannie " put her head into the kitchen , she 'd tell her it was no place for her ,  --  to go right up stairs , and sit in the parlor like a lady , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such matters ; that she 'd send up a dinner pretty soon that would make Massa Hale open his eyes ; and she did n't care if he brought the President home with him to dine ! Chloe was scrupulously honest ;  --  she took care of everything just as carefully as " Miss Fannie "  --  never wasting , never giving slily away tea or sugar , or bread , or meat , or coal , to her acquaintances , as I 'm sorry to say many unprincipled servants do . So " Massa Hale " began to like her , as well as " Miss Fannie , " and many a nice calico dress , or handkerchief turban , found its way mysteriously into Chloe 's trunk . After a while , Chloe had another Miss Fannie to look after . Was there ever a baby like that ? Certainly not  --  except the original Miss Fannie . Chloe forgot her pots , and pans , and pickles , and preserves , and hoe-cakes ; and said that " somebody else must do the cooking , or else that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about babies , she would like to know ? " So Chloe washed her hands , and walked up into the nursery , and when she said that little Fan must have some peppermint , she had it ; and when she objected to its wearing caps , they were taken off ; and when she said it was time for her to go to sleep , she went to sleep , as a matter of course . Chloe sent its mother out to take the air , and told her it was no use for her to trouble her head about the baby , because it was a thing she knew nothing about ;  --  in fact " Miss Fannie " never was allowed to peep into its cradle without Chloe 's express permission . But the time was coming when Sorrow 's dark shadow should cross the happy threshold . Death laid his icy finger on the little baby 's lip , ( with scarce a moment 's warning , ) just as it had twined itself round all their hearts with its winning little ways . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dainty little limbs for burial ? Who placed the tiny flowers between its waxen little fingers ? Who folded away from the weeping mother 's sight the useless caps and robes ? Who spoke words of cheer , while her own heart was breaking ?  --  who , but Chloe ? Ah , dear children , never say that servants are without feeling ; never say it spoils them to treat them like human beings . They all have their trials  --  humble though they be  --  and ( often , God knows , ) few joys enough . A PEEP FROM MY WINDOW . " Oh , stop ! stop ! Pray do n't beat that child so , " said I to a strapping great woman in front of my window . " What has she done ? What is the matter ? Do n't strike her . " " Well , then tell her not to meddle with me again , " said the virago , shaking a stick at the child . " I got to that barrel of cinders on the sidewalk , first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could get anything out worth saving ; of course , if I came first , I had the first right to what I could find ; and then she came up and put her stick in it , without saying ' by your leave . ' I 'll teach her better manners "  --  and the stick descended again on the child 's shoulders . " Run in here , run in here , " said I. " I 'll take care of you ; " and I opened the door for her . Poor little thing  --  all tears , and rags , and dirt ; her little bare feet cut and bruised with the stones , and her hair streaming all over her face . You would have pitied her , too . She gazed about the room , looked at the fire , then wistfully at the breakfast table , from which I had just risen . " You shall have some , " said I , giving her a cup of hot coffee and some egg and roll ; " eat away , as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second invitation , but swallowed the food as if she were famished . She put on the shoes and stockings I gave her , and then she told me that her father was killed on the railroad ; that her mother had four little children beside herself ; that they lived in a cellar in  --   --  street , where the water often came in and covered the floor ; that her mother had a dreadful bad cough ; that her baby brother was very sick , and that they had nothing to eat except what they got begging . " Why did you hunt in that old barrel ? " said I. " To find bits of coal , to burn . Sometimes the servants in the big houses do n't sift it , and then we find a great many pieces to carry home and burn . Oh dear ! that was such a nice barrel , that the women beat me for coming to ! " " Never mind the barrel , " said I ; " do you want this ? and this ? and this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and this loaf of bread , and this bit of money for your mother ? " " Oh yes  --  yes . She will be so glad ! " And off she skipped , down street , drawing her ragged shawl over her head . Directly after , thinking of an errand I wished to do , I put on my bonnet and walked out . I had passed several blocks , when I came to an alley where I heard voices . The speakers had their backs turned to me , but I could see them . It was the child who had just left me , and the woman who had beat her for meddling with the barrel of cinders . " You did it well , " said the woman . " I could n't have made believe cry better myself . I knew she 'd call you in . Did she give you all these ? and these ? and these ? " ( holding up the dresses . ) " That 's good . I can sell them to the second-hand clothes shop there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money she gave you , to buy yourself a string of beads , because you cried so well . Which story did you tell her , hey ? " " The one you told me this morning "  --  said the child ; " all about the cellar , and the water in it , and how father was killed on the railroad track . Did n't she give me a good breakfast , though ? " And the child stretched up her arms and yawned . * * * Well , I was not sorry that I gave her that breakfast , or those clothes , or that money ; I was sorry to see a little child so deceitful ; but , do you know it is better sometimes to be mistaken than never to trust ?  --  better sometimes even to lose a little , than with icy words to crush from out a despairing heart , the last hope of a tempted , starving , fellow creature ! That 's the way I comforted myself , dear children , as I walked along home . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drops come down ! I wonder if anybody beside myself will get out doors to-day ? Ah , yes ! There 's a little boy , not much bigger than Tom Thumb . He 's a little merchant , as true as the world , and has a box strapped on his back . Now he wants to sell me something . " Corset lacings ? " Never use such things , my dear . " Paste blacking ? " Wear patent leather . " Ear-rings ? " I leave those to the Indians . " Combs ? hooks and eyes ? pins ? needles ? tape ? scissors ? spools ? " Oh , you little rogue  --  come in here ; where did you come from , hey ? " I am an Englishman . " No , you are not . " Well , my father was . I was born in Hamburgh . " That 's it ; now , how came you to be selling these things ? " I 'm doing it to try to pay my own board . I pay ten shillings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By and by , perhaps , he will come home , and send me to school . Buy anything , to-day , ma'am ? " Of course I shall . I have n't seen such an enterprising young man since I left off pinafores . I 'll buy all the pins you have ; for since I came here to New-York , I see so many things to make me sigh , that my hooks and eyes keep flying off like Peggotty 's buttons . There  --  run along , now , and do n't you come this way again , with that little glib tongue , and those bright eyes , or you 'll empty my purse entirely ! * * * Oh dear ! oh dear , he is knocked down crossing the street ; he 's killed ! No he is not !  --  Yes he is !  --  No  --  he 's up  --  safe and sound . Now he rubs the mud out of his eyes , and says , just as coolly as if he had not barely escaped with his skin . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " say the crowd , " as long as you are not hurt . " " But I do , " said the little Dutchman , " for that 's the way I get my living , selling these things . Oh dear  --  the box is broke , and everything is spoiled . " " Make up a purse for him , " says a gentleman , passing round his hat . Coppers , and shillings , and quarters , and half dollars flow into the hat , and finally a dollar bill . " There , " said the gentleman , smiling , " now take that home to your mother , my boy . " " My mother is dead , " sobbed the child . " Pass round the hat again , " said the gentleman  --  a tear in his eye . The crowd responded with another handful of coppers and shillings and quarters . Ah , little Hans , who is it who saith , " Leave thy fatherless children with me ; I will preserve them alive ? " THE NEW COOK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , and how she starts every time the bell rings , as if somebody were coming to catch her , and what a wild look she has in her eyes . She makes good cake , though , do n't she , Louise ? a great deal better than black Sally 's ;  --  and then Sally had such a temper ! Do you remember how she sent the gridiron across the kitchen , after the chamber-maid , because she had mislaid the dish-cloth ?  --  how I did laugh ! " " I remember it . But what do you suppose makes this new cook act so oddly when the bell rings ? I heard Mamma say she was ' one of the nervous sort . ' It would be good fun to play a trick on her and frighten her ; would n't it ? You know the dark entry by the parlor door , Louise ? " " Yes . " " Well , you know there are plenty of old clothes , and things , hanging up there , and she has to pass by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " " Well , suppose we hide behind those coats , and just as she comes along , both of us make a spring at her ?  --  wo n't that be fun ? " " Capital ! " said Louise , " but wo n't Mamma punish us ? " " Of course , if she finds us out ; but we must n't get found out . What is the use of having feet , if you ca n't scamper with them ? Betsey of course will be too frightened to see who did it , and before anybody else comes , we shall get out of the way . " The new cook , " Betsey , " whom these two little sisters were talking about , was a widow . Her husband was an industrious , temperate man , a carpenter by trade . He loved Betsey very much , and they lived in a snug , comfortable little house , which they hoped to be able to buy some day , when Tom had earned money enough at his trade . Betsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shop , she worked hard in the house . Everything was just as neat as a new pin . You might have eaten off her floors , they were scrubbed so white and clean . There were no finger marks on her doors or windows , no broken panes of glass , with paper or rags stuffed in , to keep out the air , and her closets and cupboards would bear looking at , in the brightest sunlight that ever found its way into a kitchen . Her dishes and tumblers never stuck to your fingers ; her table never had on soiled table-cloths ; her walls were never festooned with cobwebs ; her hearth never was littered with ashes . Well might Tom work cheerfully for such a wife ; for he knew that every penny he saved , and gave her , was put to the best possible use . It did n't go for tawdry finery , I can tell you ; and she knew how to turn a coat for Tom , or re-line the sleeves , or seat a pair of pants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking fellow . He had a fine broad chest , and a straight , well formed figure ; a large , clear , black eye , and a fine Roman nose , besides a set of teeth that would have made a dentist sigh . The truth was Tom was one of Nature 's gentlemen ; he always did and said just the right thing , and made everybody about him feel perfectly satisfied with the world in general , and himself in particular . Well , they lived together as contented as two oysters . Tom did n't grit his teeth when a carriage rolled by with a rich man in it , or when another man passed him in a finer suit of broadcloth than his own . Not he . He stepped off to his shop , on the strength of Betsey 's nice coffee and biscuit , as grand as the President . Why not ? He owed nobody a cent , and that 's more than many a man can say , who would knock you down as quick as a flash , if you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom proposed to Betsey to go a fishing , he said she needed something of that sort , by way of change , for she was quite worn out . Betsey said , " No , Tom , I am well enough ; besides , the water will make me sick ; but I want you to go ; you and Phil Dolan ; you need it more than I , a great deal . " Tom did n't like to go without Betsey ; he did n't believe in husband 's frolicking about , and leaving their poor tired wives to mend their old duds , at home . No ; he knew that there is no woman , be she ever so kind and good , who does not sometimes want to see something beside a mop , a gridiron , and a darning needle ; so Tom said , " No , I 'll think of some pleasure you can share with me . " But Betsey persuaded him to go without her . She fancied , ( good kind soul , ) that Tom was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting sick , made her quite miserable ; so Tom said he 'd go . Then Betsey got Tom his fishing tackle , and put him up some biscuit , for he and Phil intended to get out on a little island to make some chowder ; and then Tom  --   --  kissed her ; ( as true as you are alive , though she was his wife ! ) and then he went for Phil , and they got into a little boat , and floated off down the river . Betsey worked away , thinking all the time how much good the fresh air on the water was doing Tom . She got along very well through the forenoon ; cleaning up the house , and putting things in place , till dinner-time ; then how lonesome it was not to have Tom 's handsome face opposite her ! and nobody to say , " Betsey , dear , here 's your favorite bit ; " or , " Betsey , dear , where 's your appetite to-day ? " It made her so dull , that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Betsey had no darling little girl or boy , to climb up in her lap , and talk to her about papa . Betsey was sorry too , and so was Tom . Well , the afternoon wore away . It was five o'clock ;  --  time Betsey had begun to get tea , for Tom would soon be home . Let 's see !  --  she would make some flap-jacks . Tom was fond of flap-jacks . She 'd make him a real strong cup of coffee : he liked that better than tea . She would cook him a bit of beef steak too , for she knew that fishing always gave people a good appetite . So she stepped around briskly , and spread her snow-white table-cloth , and put on her cups and saucers , and plates , and the castor  --  ( yes , the castor on the tea table ! for they did n't care a pin for fashion ) ; and when she had cooked her supper , she looked at the clock . Yes , it was quite time he was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as if she could look him home . An hour went by  --  an hour after the time he said he 'd come ; and Tom always punctual to the minute , too . Betsey grew nervous . Somebody rang the bell . She flew to the door . ( Tom never rang the bell . ) It was only a boy inquiring for the next neighbor . Betsey pulled a little wrinkle out of the table-cloth , set Tom 's chair up to the table , and peeped into the coffee-pot . It was all right . He would soon be there . But somehow she could n't keep still a minute . She had a great mind ( if she were not afraid of being laughed at ) to run down to Phil Dolan 's brother 's , to see if Phil had got back . There 's the bell again ! Betsey trembled so she could hardly get to the door , though she could n't tell why . It is Phil 's brother . Why do n't Betsey speak to him ? Why do n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white ? Poor Betsey ! she knew it all ; though he has not spoken a word . Tom is drowned . Phil lifts Betsey from the floor , chafes her hands , and speaks to her pitifully . Betsey does not answer : she does not even hear him . By and by she comes to herself and opens her eyes . She sees the little supper table . She looks at Phil , and then she puts her hand over his mouth , and says , " Not yet , not yet . " Phil 's kind heart is wrung with pity . He knows they will soon bring in Tom 's dead body . He loved Tom . Everybody loved him . It was only that very morning that he left home so bright , so full of life . Poor Tom ! Dear children , you can imagine how poor Betsey hung , weeping , over her husband 's dead body ; how dreadful it was to see the earth close over it , and to leave her dear little happy home , and go out among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bread . She heard that Minnie 's mother wanted a cook ; she called and Minnie 's mother engaged her ; and now , perhaps , you 'd like to hear the end of the trick the two little girls were planning to play on poor , heart-broken Betsey . You know now why she started whenever a bell rang , and why her nerves were in such a state . " Now is the time , " said Minnie ; " Betsey has just gone in after the tea-waiter . Quick ! get behind the coat , Louise . " Betsey soon came out with the tea-tray of dishes , and Minnie and Louise jumped at her , from behind the coats , seizing rudely hold of her arm . Betsey uttered a loud scream , and fell to the bottom of the stairs , with the tray of dishes ; while Minnie and Louise , terrified at the broken dishes , ran off up chamber , to hide under the bed . Minnie 's mother had not gone out , as she supposed , and was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broken dishes , and who was taken up quite senseless . The doctor came and bandaged Betsey 's head , and said she might die . Their mother nursed her through a brain fever , and in her delirium , Betsey raved about her husband , and told , in fragments , all that her poor heart had suffered . Minnie 's mother , without saying a word to her little girls about their naughtiness , led them into the room and let them hear poor Betsey call for " Tom  --  dear Tom , " to come and " pity and love her , and take the dull , weary pain out of her heart . " And then they wept , and wanted to do something for Betsey , if it were only to bring her a glass of water to moisten her lips . After a long time , when their kind mother got nearly worn out with watching and nursing , Betsey got better . When she had quite recovered , their mother took her for a sempstress , and gave her a nice little comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to herself ; and Minnie and Louise used to sit and read to her , and tell her over and over again , with their arms around her neck , how sorry they were they had been so wicked , and gave her nice books to read evenings , and tried to make poor Betsey 's lonely life as happy as ever they could . LETTY . Did you ever hear of an Intelligence Office ? Well , it 's a place where servant girls go , to hear of families who wish to hire help . They pay the man who keeps the office something , and then he finds a place where they can work and earn money . In one of these offices , one pleasant summer morning , twenty or more servant girls were seated ,  --  some of them modest looking and tidily dressed , others bold and slatternly . Wedged among them , in a dark corner , was a little girl about thirteen years old . Her face was pale , and her features , which were small and delicate , were half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands were small and white , and from under her dress ( which had evidently been made for some one else , as it was much too long and too wide for her ) peeped as cunning a little pair of feet as you ever saw . Little Letty  --  for that was her name  --  looked frightened and distressed . She had never been in such a place before , and it made her cheeks very hot to have those rude girls stare at her so . Then , the air of the room was very close , and that made her head ache badly ; and she felt afraid that nobody would hire her , because she was so little . Her mother had died only a week before , and Letty had a drunken father ,  --  so , you see , that , young as she was , she had to earn her own bread and butter . Illustration : LETTY . By and by , a woman came in . Some people , I suppose , would have called her a lady , as she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chains and pins . Letty 's mother was a lady , although she was poor . She had sweet , gentle manners , and a soft , low voice . Letty did not like Mrs. Finley 's looks ; she wore too many bows and flounces ; and then her voice was loud and harsh , and her forehead had an ugly frown on it , that did n't go away even when she smiled and tried to look gracious . No , Letty did n't like her , and she almost hoped she would n't take a fancy to her , much as she needed a place to live in . But Mrs. Finley liked Letty 's looks ; so she sailed across the room , with her six flounces , and asked her so many questions , in such a loud voice , that Letty was quite bewildered ; then she heard her say to Mr. Silas Skinflint , who kept the office , that she would take her , and that it was a very nice thing that her mother was dead , for mothers were always bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poor , little , desolate Letty could n't bear that . She hid her little face in her hands , and began to sob pitifully ; but Mr. Skinflint tapped her on the shoulder with his cane , and told her that nobody would hire a cry-baby ; so Letty sat up straight , and choked her tears down , and at a signal from Mr. Skinflint took up her little bundle and followed Mrs. Finley . On she went , past a great many fine shops and fine houses , Letty keeping close behind her . Letty 's head felt quite giddy , and she was very faint , for her naughty father had gone off , and poor Letty had had no breakfast that morning . After turning a great many squares , Mrs. Finley went down a very narrow street , where a great many noisy , dirty children were playing on the sidewalks ,  --  where a great many women were leaning ( on their red elbows ) out of the windows , and a great many coarse , rough men were sitting on the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these houses Mrs. Finley stopped , and Letty followed her up the steps , through the entry , and into the parlor . A table stood in the middle of the floor , covered with dirty breakfast dishes , where myriads of flies were making a meal . A little baby with a pink nose and bald head , was playing on the floor with a head-brush and a skillet ; while a boy , about Letty 's age , was mopping out a sugar bowl with his fingers , and two little girls , in yellow pantalettes and pink dresses , were trying to hide away a dress cap of their mother 's , which they had been cutting up for their dollies . On a side table were Mr. Finley 's " shaving things , " a dirty dickey , and sundry little bits of paper with floating islands of soap-suds , left there by his razor . " Well  --  here we are at last , " said Mrs. Finley , fanning herself with a great newspaper . " You see , Letty , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs , to put on a calico long-short , and take a nap ; and you are to wash these dishes , and put them in the closet ; clear away the table ; sweep the room and dust it ; wash these children 's faces , and keep them quiet ; put some water in the tea-kettle and set it boiling ; tend the door , and keep a look out for the milk-man . " Ma'am ? " said Letty , looking bewildered . " M-a-'a-m "  --  mocked Mrs. Finley , " where 's your ears , child ? let 's see if I can find ' em , " and she gave Letty 's little ear a smart pull . " Please , ma'am , it is all so new to me , " said Letty , trying to keep from crying ; " will you please tell me where to find the broom to sweep with , or the water to wash the dishes , and which closet I am to put them in , and where 's the towel to wipe the children 's faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Finley , " what a little fool ;  --  use your eyes a little more and your tongue less , and you 'll find things , I guess ; and now let me see every thing right end up when I come down stairs . Do you hear ? " " Yes , ma'am , " said Letty , drawing a long sigh as Mrs. Finley closed the door . " Came from the poor-house , did n't you ? " said Master John Finley , cracking a whip over Letty 's head . " Well , I 'm glad you 've come here at any rate ; I have n't known what to do with myself all vacation . It will be prime fun , I 'm thinking , to tease you , you little scared rabbit ; and I 'll tell you , to begin with , that my name is Mr. John Finley , and that I 'm my mother 's pet , and that whatever I say is pretty likely to be done in this house ;  --  so you 'd better be careful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wicked boy , as he gave her arm a knock , and sent the waiter of dishes out of her hand upon the floor . " Oh ! Master John , " said Letty ; " see what you have done  --  oh ! "  --  and Letty wrung her little white hands . " See what I 've done ? " said John . " I like that , Miss Letty , or Hetty , or whatever you call yourself ; but what 's that string round your neck for ?  --  what 's on the end of it , hey ? "  --  and he gave it a rude twitch , snapped it in two , and picked up a little locket that Letty wore in her bosom . " Oh , Master John , " said Letty , " give it back , do ,  --  it 's all I have to make me happy now ,  --  my mamma gave it me when she died . She used to wear it once when she was rich . Oh , Master John , do n't , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! cry-baby , " said John , putting the locket in his jacket pocket , " you never 'll see that locket again . I shall say , too , that you broke all those dishes , and if you contradict it , I 'll take that locket to a police-man , and tell him you stole it . Wo n't you look pretty going to jail with your long black curls ? Answer me that , Miss Hetty Letty ? " Letty only answered by her sobs . " What 's all this ? " said Mrs. Finley , opening the door ; " one might as well try to sleep in Bedlam . Merciful man ! who broke all those dishes ? John Madison Harrison Polk ! who broke all those dishes , I say ? " " I told her she 'd catch it , mother , when you came down , " said John ; " see if she dare deny it ? " " Letty , " said Mrs. Finley , seizing her by the shoulders and giving her a shake , " did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the police-man , and the jail , and was silent . " John , " said Mrs. Finley , " go bring me your father 's horse-whip from behind the kitchen door . " " Oh , Mrs. Finley , " said Letty , growing very white about the mouth , and trembling violently all over ; " do n't whip me ; my mamma never whipped me . Oh , mamma  --  mamma ! " Down came the heavy whip on Letty 's fair head and shoulders ;  --  " There  --  take that , and that , and that ! " said Mrs. Finley , " and remember that I did n't take you into my house to quarrel with my children , and break up dishes ; and now take yourself up into the dark garret , and get into bed , and do n't you get up till Mr. Finley comes home to dinner , and let 's see if he can manage you . " Letty pushed her hair from before her eyes , and staggered to the door ; then , up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , she groped her way to bed ; then , she laid her head on the pillow ; but she did n't cry  --  no  --  not even when she thought of her mamma ,  --  the tears would n't come ; but her head was very hot , and her hands burning . There she lay , hour after hour , talking to herself about a great many things ; and had it been light enough you would have seen how flushed her cheeks were , and how very strangely her eyes looked . * * * " The child has a brain fever , " said the Doctor to Mrs. Finley . " No wonder , " said the wicked woman , " she had such a dreadful fall down the cellar stairs . You see how she bruised her face and neck . " The Doctor looked very sharp at Mrs. Finley  --  so sharp that she stooped down , pretending to pick something from the floor , that he need n't see her blush . " I do n't know how I am to nurse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's John Madison Harrison Polk , and Sarah Jenny Lind , and Malvina Cecelia Victoria , and Napoleon Bonaparte , four children of my own to look after . It 's a hard case , Doctor . " " Not so hard a case as little Letty 's , " said the kind Doctor . " Those bruises never came from falling down stairs , Mrs. Finley ; that child has been cruelly abused . I may tell of it , and I may not ,  --  that depends upon whether she lives or dies ; but I am going to take her home to my own house , and see what good doctoring can do for her . She looks like my little dead Mary , and for her sake I 'll be a father to her . " So Letty was carried on a litter to Doctor Harris ' house ; and there , for a great many weeks , she lay in her little bed , quite crazy  --  her beautiful hair shaved off , and her little head blistered to make her well . The Doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , too , that " Letty looked like her little dead Mary , " and often , when she held her little burning hand , the tears would come to her eyes , and she would pray God to let her live , for she had no child to love now , and she wanted Letty for her own little girl . Well , after a long , long while , Letty 's senses came slowly back . She put her little hand to her forehead and tried to remember what had happened ;  --  she did n't know what to make of the nice , pretty room , and soft bed with its silken curtains ;  --  she thought she was dreaming , and rubbed her eyes and looked again , and then hid her face in the sheet for fear she should see Mrs. Finley , or John , or the police-man ;  --  and then Mrs. Harris put her finger on Letty 's lip and told her not to talk now , because she was sick and weak , but that she was always going to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her own dear little girl ; and then Letty kissed Mrs. Harris ' hand , and shut her eyes , and went to sleep as quietly as if she were on her mother 's bosom . By and by , little by little , she got strong and well again ; her checks grew plump and rosy ; her hair came out in little black , curls all over her head , and she was just the happiest little girl  --  as happy as you are when you climb on your mother 's lap and kiss her , as if you never wanted to stop . She had a little room of her own , close by her new mother 's , with a cunning little bed , and wash-stand , and bureau , and rocking chair . She had plenty of playthings , too ,  --  ( not little Mary 's , for mothers ca n't give away their little children 's playthings when they are dead . ) Letty had playthings of her own ;  --  but sometimes , Mrs. Harris would unlock a little trunk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the marks of tiny little teeth in it ; and a slate on which was a word left unfinished by little Mary ; and a little chest of doll 's clothes , with such nice little womanly stitches in them ; and a little fairy thimble ; and then the tears would fall into the trunk as she locked it up again , and then Letty would throw her arms about her neck and say , " Do n't cry  --  Letty loves you . " And now , my little darling readers , there is one verse in the Bible which Aunt Fanny wants you to remember ; it is this : " When thy father and thy mother forsake thee , then the Lord will take thee up . " FRONTIER STORIES . " Joseph , " said his mother , " I want you to run over to Aunt Elsie 's and borrow a pair of flat-irons ; she said she would lend them to me , till I could get some from the settlement . " " Yes , mother , " said little Joe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid Bill Sykes will get his arrows made first ; and if I ai n't but eight years old , he sha n't beat me at anything . " So Joe perched his cap on the top of his head , and started off through the woods , with his jack-knife for company . " Aunt Elsie " was a widow , who lived just half a mile from Joe 's mother 's . Everybody loved her , she was so motherly , and so ready to do a kindness ; every man , woman and child in the neighborhood , would have run their feet off for her , if it would have done her any good . Yes , Aunt Elsie was a regular sunbeam ; and yet she had known sorrow and trouble enough , for , as I told you , she was a widow ; but she looked forward to a better home than any this world can furnish , and so she bore her trials just as one would the little wearinesses and discomforts of a journey , when every hour is bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its loving hearts . Well , little Joe went whistling and whittling along , thinking of Bill Sykes and his arrows . Half a mile was no great distance to go ; he might finish one arrow going along ; that is , if his jack-knife did n't break , or if he did n't whittle off one of his fingers by mistake . He wished the wood was n't quite so hard : he wondered whether Bill Sykes would make his arrows of hickory : he wondered whether Bill 's brother Tom , would n't make them for him  --  just as like as not , now , he would , and then Bill would be sure to have the best ones : too bad ! Joe wished he had a brother , too ; he wished  --   --  ph-e-w ! What 's that ? A bear ! as sure as you are alive ! ( and may not be long . ) What 's to be done now ? Joe was a nice fat little boy , and the bear might be hungry . He was n't afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid ? They are made of different stuff than the little ruffled-collar boys that tag about with the nursery maid at their heels , in Broadway . Joe examined his jack-knife , and took another look at the bear , as he lay behind the bushes . Old Bruin was fast asleep . All right ;  --  Joe 's mother would n't have to wait for her flat-irons ; so he stepped carefully along ( not to disturb Bruin 's nap ) and reached Aunt Elsie 's , with a whole skin . Aunt Elsie was very glad to see Joe , for she loved children , and always ran to the cupboard to get them a piece of wholesome frontier pie , or gingerbread , or bit of hoe-cake ; but Joe said he could n't stop ; because his mother had her clothes already sprinkled and folded ready for the irons , and had told him to hurry back as fast as ever he could . Did he tell Aunt Elsie about the bear ? Do you suppose a frontier boy would take refuge under a woman 's apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing to him , he would tuck up his pinafore , roll up his jacket sleeves , and show you his little brown fists , in a trice ! No , sir ; he never alluded to the bear , but taking a flat-iron in each hand , went whistling along as if no such animal had ever walked out of Noah 's ark into the back woods . Well , he had got through " Hail Columbia , " and " Auld Lang Syne , " when he spied Bruin again ; and this time he was wide awake , too . He began whistling Yankee Doodle ; first , to show his independence , and secondly , because he knew if anything would take the nonsense out of the letter B , it was Yankee Doodle ! " I 'll iron him with these flat-irons , anyhow , " said Joe to himself , " if he comes here to eat me . " But whether the bear was n't hungry , or whether he did n't like the looks of the flat-irons , or whether Joe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all three , I ca n't say ; all I know is that he never touched a paw to him , and Joe and his flat-irons arrived home in perfect safety . " I 'm so glad you are come , Joe , " said his mother , taking the irons and putting them over the fire to heat . " I 've a heap of work to do , and besides I felt uneasy like , after you went off alone through the woods , for fear you might possibly meet a bear . " " I did , " said Joe , quietly whittling away at his arrow . " Did ? Sakes alive ! Where ? how ? when ? Did he bite you ? " and she caught him up by the waistband and held him up to the light , and turned him round to see where he was damaged . Joe told her all about it , and she flew and bolted all the doors , and every now and then she 'd set down her flat-iron , and putting her arms a-kimbo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ate him up ? " That night she insisted on his eating a whole pie for supper , gave him two lumps of white sugar , and put an extra blanket on his bed , and all night long she was traveling back and forth in her night cap , from her bed to his , to feel if Joe was safe between the sheets . Now , while Joe 's asleep , if you like that story , I will tell you another about Aunt Elsie . * * * One day she went to her door and blew her horn , as if all creation was let loose ; ( you know I told you that when frontier folks want to call the neighbors together that 's the way they manage . ) Well , there was a general stampede to see what was to pay with Aunt Elsie . Some said the bears must have run off with her little girl ;  --  some said an Indian might have strayed into her log hut , and frightened her ;  --  some said the house might be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Elsie as long as there was a timber left of them , whatever was to pay . Zeke Smith said , ( Zeke was an old bachelor , ) that " he 'd thought for a great while , that it was n't safe for Elsie to live there alone without some man to protect her ; " and Jim Brown who was a widower , said " it was a lonesome piece of business and no mistake ; " and they all rushed through the woods to see which should pitch into the house first and help her the fastest . Well  --  what do you think was to pay when they got there ? Her old cow was choking with a turnip ! Now I 'm going to tell you one more backwoods story while I 'm about it . * * * A great roaring fire was burning in Zeke Smith 's log house ; and all the Tims , and Joes , and Bills , and Jacks , and Sams had come in to see him . They peeled chestnuts and threw the shells into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blaze lit up all their weather-beaten , bronzed faces , and they drank cider out of a great mug , and talked about one thing and another that you and I do n't care about ; and then Zeke Smith said he lost a sheep last night . " So did I , " said Pete Parker . " I lost two hens , " said Joachim Jones . " I lost a ram , " said Bill Bond . " Do n't say so ! " said Zeke . " Well , that is a loss . There 's a bear about ,  --  that 's certain ; and it 's just as certain that we are the boys to kill him . I should like to see a bear get out of the way of my rifle ! " " Or mine "  --  " Or mine , " said they all . Well , they agreed to start the next morning , by daylight , to hunt up the bear . They fixed their rifles the night before , and in the morning got up bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttoned up their coats and strided off , with provisions in their pouches , for they were determined not to come back without him . On they tramped , over bush and bog and briar ; the dogs running before and scenting round among the bushes . All day , no luck . Night came on , and still no luck ; so they " camped out , " and started fresh again the next morning . About dark the dogs scented the bear , sure enough ,  --  and what a monstrous fellow he was  --  black as Topsy , too ! Never mind , his time had come now . He ran up an old stub , and sat perched on the top . They pointed their rifles  --  took aim  --  not a rifle went off ! and Bruin sat grinning at them . Wer n't they furious ? I would n't undertake to repeat what they said , ' cause it would n't answer . The bear came down from the stub , and ran off into a swamp ; so they had the hunt all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flints ( for percussion locks had not then been invented , ) so that their rifles would be sure to go off ; for you may be certain that they would n't have that story told in " the settlement , " for a barrel of their best cider . So taking their newly-primed rifles , off they started again , with their teeth set together , looking as fierce as so many Hospidars . If Bruin had understood what stuff a disappointed backwoodsman is made of , he would have kept out of their way  --  but he did n't ; and as their rifles this time had the genuine " stand and deliver " in ' em , there was nothing left for him to do , but to cross his paws and surrender . Did n't they drink cider and crack nuts over the old fellow 's remains ? Certainly ; they never would have showed their heads at " a raising " again , I can tell you , had n't they captured him . A PEEP THROUGH MY QUIZZING GLASS . Well , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window any longer . Bricks and mortar , mortar and bricks ! and little strips of yards not big enough to swing a cat round in . You may , perhaps you will , ask with the Frenchman , " Vat for you want to swing a cat round ? " But there 's a choice even in those yards . Now just look at them  --  there is one , that , small as it is , has its little circular grass plat , with a hedge of china asters about it , and a little vase in the middle , from which hang tendrils of the pretty mountain myrtle ; a woodbine creeps over the fence and my favorite tree ( the willow ) is struggling for life in yonder corner , and prettier than all , out dances a little fairy , with shining locks neatly parted , and a clean white pinafore tucked round her chubby little figure . See her tip-toe round the grass plat , with eyes as blue as the morning glories she is plucking . How glad I am she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provides her that pretty little garden . Now just look in the next yard  --  it is just the same size as the other , but poor mother earth lies buried under great flat paving stones ; while strewed over them are old bits of china , and carpeting , and old keg covers , and old barrels with the hoops dropping off , and an old tail-less rocking-horse , and a child 's chair , trying in vain to stand on three legs , and a Buffalo skin that is sadly in need of some of " Bogles Hyperian . " There 's a little child dancing out that door , too ; now he stands poised on one foot , and takes a survey of the yard ; unpromising , is n't it , dear ? Nothing pretty to look at , is there ? Aunt Fanny is sorry for you ; if she could get you up here she 'd tell you a story . I know very well what you would tell her ; that mamma lies in bed asleep  --  although it is ten o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the store ; and that Betty and Sally have it all their own way , not only in that slovenly looking yard , but all over the house , ( so long as they do n't trouble your mamma . ) Poor little fellow  --  I hope some country cousin will have mercy on you , and introduce you to her cows and hens and chickens and hay and flowers  --  yes , and to her brown bread and milk , too , for you look like a little hot-house plant . I wonder who lives over there ? I 'll just look at them through my quizzing glass . In the first place , that 's a " single lady 's " room ( I am afraid she 'll box my ears if I call her " an old maid , " and if there is anything I am afraid of it is a mouse and a mad woman . ) Just look over there . There 's a little tin , pint pail out on the window sill , and a stone pot . I 'll bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody finds old maids ) . There now , did n't I tell you so ? See ,  --  she moves a little table up to the window and holds the table-cloth close up to her eye-lashes , to see if there 's a speck of dirt on it , and then twitches , and pats , and pulls it into line and plummet order ; then she places thereon a small tea tray , with only one cup and saucer . I declare it makes me feel quite melancholy ! Then she throws up the window , lifts the cover off the tin-pail , and turns about a thimble full of milk into a lilliputian pitcher ; then she nips out a bit of butter about the size of a nutmeg , and puts it on a little cup plate ; and placing a small roll and a little black teapot on the table , she sits down to her solitary meal . Now she clasps her hands and bows her head  --  and now I am sorry for what I 've said about her , because I see she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask a blessing . I hope she will get it ; and I hope somebody will ask her out to tea two or three times a week , and take her now and then of a long evening to a lecture , or a concert , or a panorama , or anywhere else she fancies going . Do n't you ? There 's an old bachelor 's room ;  --  fussy old thing ! he has been one good hour trying to tie that cravat bow to suit him ; now he has twitched it off his neck in a pet , and thrown it on the floor ; if his wash woman do n't " catch it , " for not putting more starch in it , my name is n't Fanny . Just see him trim his whiskers  --  ( red ones , too ! ) I could warm my hands by them , freeze me if I could n't ! Now that breastpin has got to find its latitude ; that you see will be a work of time . He has got it in the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will get down to his store , by the time he has lost a dozen customers , or so  --  he is too busy shaving himself , to go down there to shave them ! that 's a settled point . Look now at that window !  --  a young mother comes to it with a little new baby ,  --  its little neck is as limpsy as your doll 's ; and its hands look just like those your cook fries when she makes fancy doughnuts . She loves it , though ; just as well as if it was n't as red as a brick , and bows up its little worked sleeves , and combs its five hairs , and thinks it a " perfect beauty . " She has got her work cut out for the winter , has n't she ? The times that baby will have to be taken up and put down  --  washed  --  dressed and undressed  --  nursed , rocked and trotted  --  laid on its back , and laid on its stomach  --  and laid on its side . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her a great many things she do n't know about taking care of that baby . Young mothers are very experiment-y . Do you know what that means ? Well , they worry a baby out of a year 's growth , for fear it will worry ; your mother knows all about it  --  ask her if she did n't do just that way with you till Grandma and Aunt Charity taught her better ? First babies are poor little victims . I can remember how I used to be plagued ! Stifled alive for " fear I should get cold ; " trotted up and down when there was a great pin sticking into my shoulder  --  and held so close to the candle to be looked at , that I came near being blind as a mole . It 's a wonder to me that I am here now , writing this juvenile book ; if I had n't been a baby of spirit , I should have keeled over , and died of sheer torment long before I got into short clothes . Well , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not so very old , either , for she 's as brisk as a musquito . Her head flies round if any one opens the door , as if it were strung on wires . I do n't believe she has any fire in her room , for she keeps hitching round after the sun all day  --  and when he bids her good afternoon , she comforts her shoulders with a blanket shawl ; then , her lamp is always out long before I go to bed , and nobody who has a good fire , ever wants to go to bed and leave it ; they 'll find a thousand things to do  --  a letter to write , or a book to read , or some chestnuts to eat ; or , if they have n't anything else to do , they will sit and look at the fire . I am sure I 've been forced to look at more disagreeable objects than that , for many an hour . There 's a woman at another window , writing , or rather she has got her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen between her fingers ; all that she wants is a few ideas ; see , she rolls up her eyes like a pussy in a fit , and looks up , and looks down , and makes a love knot on the paper with her pen , and coaxes her temples with her fingers ; but it 's no use , there 's nothing there ! So she may as well get off her stilts and darn her stockings . There are two little girls at another window playing with their dollies . Now I like that  --  it 's a good thing  --  it teaches them how to sew , and to cut out little garments , and to contrive and fix up things , so that when they have live dollies it will come handy to cut out their frocks . I always like to see little girls play with dollies , and big girls , too , if they want to ; it is better than a novel ; better than a thousand other things that girls do now-a-days , who fancy themselves ladies as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it makes me sigh to think there are so few children in 1853 . Over there at another window in the same block , is a very sad sight . A drunken husband ! See how patiently his poor wife is trying to coax him not to go out . She is fearful he may fall in the street , and get hurt , and then she feels ashamed to have him seen in such a plight ; now she gently removes his hat  --  then he puts it on again ; now her arm is about his neck  --  but only to have it rudely pushed aside , poor woman . I hope she believes in God , and knows how to lean upon Him . Now her husband has gone , and she sits down and covers her face with her hands , and weeps . They are bitter tears  --  she thinks of the time he took her proudly away from a happy home , and promised she should be dear to him as his own life blood . Perhaps she can not go to that home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ) have not lived to see her joy so soon turned to sorrow ; or , if she could go there , she loves her husband still too much to leave him . She hopes each morning that he will come home and love her at night  --  and she tidies up the hearth , and makes the fire bright , and keeps his supper warm , and wipes away her tears , and braids her hair in shining plaits as he once loved to see it , and looks often at the little mantel clock , and then out the window . By and by she hears his step ; oh , it is the same old story  --  he reels , cursing , into her presence  --  perhaps aims at her a blow . Her little child lies there sleeping . She is glad he is not old enough to know his father 's shame . Sometimes she even prays the babe may die . She knows , were she taken away , how much it must suffer . Then , she remembers the time when its father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who roll about in carriages , on the money taken from her husband 's pocket , and that of other poor victims like him . And then the angry flush mounts to her temples , and she says , " Is there no law to punish these wicked rumsellers ? " Poor thing ! that wailing cry has gone up from Maine to Georgia  --  from many a houseless wife and shivering child ! God hears it ! I had rather be in their place than the rumseller 's . Well , now it is quite dark , and I must light my lamp and shut my shutters , or some of those folks may be peeping in and taking notes of me !  --  who knows ? Would n't that be a joke ? THE ENGLISH EMIGRANTS . It was very weary on ship board . Julien and Victor had spied out all there was to be seen the first week they set sail , and the sailors had told them all the stories they could possibly think of . Mrs. Adrian ( their mother ) was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were getting very impatient to reach shore . How would America look ? What sort of houses did they have there ? What sort of children ? Would they be good play-fellows ? These were the things little Julien and Victor were thinking about . Their father was thinking of the price of provisions , and about house rent , and the probabilities of his finding customers for his tailoring work ; and whether they should all have to live in the shop , and whether his sickly wife would thrive under the changeable climate , and whether they should make a home , or always be like " strangers in a strange land . " And their mother ; she was thinking of the gray-haired old father who had blessed her for the last time , and of the sunny homes of England , with their wealth of shrub and tree and blossom , and of a dear little girl whom she left sleeping in a quiet church-yard , between whom and herself the swift blue waves were building up a wall of separation . Land ho ! shouted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . And this was America ! this New-York ! How very odd and strange everything was ! How anxious the people all looked ! How slender !  --  how pale !  --  and what a hurry they all seemed to be in ! How they jostled about , as if they were afraid they should n't get their share of terra-firma ! How the cab-men and porters and hack-drivers were just as independent as the gentlemen and ladies they worked for ! and how showily and gaily the ladies dressed , just to take a promenade . It was all very funny . The children and their mother looked with all their eyes ; they could not make up their minds whether they should like it or not ; but that was not the first thing to be considered ; they must first decide where to live . Mr. Adrian concluded to go to B  --   --  , about two days ' journey by the railroad . So their trunks were taken from the ship and carried to the baggage cars . Little Julien and Victor had nice seats by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green fields after having seen nothing but the dashing billows for so many weeks . They felt as glad as Noah 's dove did , when she spread her wings from the door of the ark , after " the waters were abated . " They threw their limbs about , whenever the cars stopped for the great " iron horse " to lay in some wood for his supper , as if they were determined to make up for the time they had been cramped on ship-board . " Things are not so very cheap after all , over here in America , " said Mr. Adrian , with a sigh , as he took possession of the room that was to serve them for shop , parlor , kitchen and bed-room . " Well , we must be patient and industrious ; I will put up my sign to-day , and if you and the children ( turning to his wife ) are only in good health , I shall have courage to work . " So the sign was put up : " John Adrian , tailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then John took out his shears and " goose , " crossed his legs and seated himself with a jacket to make , in front of the window , where pedestrians could see that he was at his post , ready for orders . Julien and Victor , the rosy little Englishmen , did n't fancy much the small room they lived in . It was almost as much of a prison to them as the vessel ; they liked better to play in the streets . Their mother looked out the window at them , with a sigh , for her children had been carefully brought up , and she shuddered at the bad words they were hearing , and the groups of idle , noisy , vicious children , swarming about the neighborhood . Oh , how should she keep her little boys pure and unspotted ? Three weeks had passed by . Little Julien came in , one day , from his play , when his mother met him at the door , saying , " Run , Julien , quick  --  quick  --  for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find him ? " " Oh ! I do n't know , " said the distracted woman , chafing her husband 's temples ; " ask somebody  --  quick , dear Julien , for the love of God !  --  the death dew is on your father 's forehead . " " Cholera , " said the doctor . " I can do nothing for him , my poor woman ; the disease is raging fearfully here ; he can not live an hour . " " Nothing to be done ? " said the poor wife , fixing her eyes on her dying husband , and watching his spasms ; " nothing to be done ? Oh , sir , do n't tell me that . " But even while she spoke the dark shadow fell . The loving eyes grew glassy ; the hand she held relaxed its hold , and that " change , " so subtle , so fearful , ( that all have seen yet none may tell , ) flitted over his face . Death came for more than one victim , to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , then the soft eyes closed , and the little lip said , quiveringly , " It is all dark ; kiss us , dear mother ; " and Mrs. Adrian was a childless widow . Dear children , God be praised that the world is not all a desert  --  that there are hearts that feel , eyes that weep , and hands that minister to the sorrow-stricken . Mammon has left some hearts that he has not shrivelled , some eyes that he has not blinded , some hands that he has not fettered . Poor Mrs. Adrian ! She knew that there were strangers about her , and that their voices were kind , and their hands busy straightening the dear limbs , and smoothing the cherished locks , and placing them reverently in " the narrow house ; " she knew that the hearse came at their bidding , and bore her dead away ; she knew that they led her back to that forsaken room , and held the tempting morsel to her grieved lip , and she felt their warm tears drop upon her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was all like a dream to her . Oh , my dear children , where could she have turned in that dark hour if not to Heaven ? What if she had said , with the unbeliever , " There is no God ? " How could she try to lean on reeds that bent and broke beneath her ? Oh , no , no ! when sickness and trouble come , our hearts must have a God . Heaven only can bring healing to a heart so stunned with pain ; and there the poor English woman sought it . Did God ever forsake those who threw themselves on His great loving heart for comfort ? Never ! If Mrs. Adrian could not smile , she did not weep . True , she looked for rosy little faces she never more might see ; listened for tripping little feet she never more might hear ; but , dear children , peace came gently down upon her heart , like dew upon the closed flowers , and she said , with bowed head , " ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the bell for church ; but Sunday is not Sunday , here in New-York . I wish I were going to church in the country with you , where everything is quiet , and sweet , and holy ,  --  where people go to church to worship God , and not to see and to show the fashions . No , it is not Sunday here , if the bells do say so . Why ? Because there 's a woman , at the corner of that street , spreading out on her stall , apples and candy , and bananas , and oranges , and cookies , and sugar-toys , and melons , and cocoa-nuts , and ginger beer ; because there 's a cigar shop  --  ( the shutters , closed to be sure , ) but with the door wide open , and the owner already beginning to trade with customers ; because , there 's a man selling bouquets , and a confectioner 's saloon open , and people eating ice-creams in it ; and little ragged news boys , who have been screeching ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despatch  --  dreadful collision and lass o ' life  --  Times , Despatch , and Herald "  --  and drunken men whom you meet at every few blocks , and people going everywhere but into the church doors . Well , you go into a city church ,  --  it is not like yours in the country , where the blessed sunlight shines cheerfully in , and the sweet breeze wafts through the open windows the breath of clover blossoms and new mown hay ; where the minister preaches to poor people , who are not forced to carry a dictionary to church ; where people do n't frown and hastily button the pew door when a stranger comes in ; where neighbors smile kindly on each other , and never gather up the folds of their dress lest it should sweep against a shilling de-laine ; where good " Old Hundred " and " St. Martins " are sung , instead of twistified , finical , modern tunes , that old-fashioned folks ca n't follow ; where the minister is not too stately to pat the little children on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant smile to make them feel that they are part of his parish ; where they all walk home , not over crowded , dusty pavements , but under the leafy trees , with hearts filled with a quiet joy , seeing " the cattle on a thousand hills , " the springs which run among the hills , " and the birds which build their houses in the branches ; " where the golden sun goes down , not on the bloated drunkard and noisy Sabbath breaker , but on the hale old man " of silver hairs , " teaching the cherub on his knee to lisp the evening hymn  --  upon kneeling groups under cottage roofs , where envy and hatred and ill-will find no resting place for their swift and evil feet . That is what Aunt Fanny calls Sunday . Children , there is one thing I like in New-York : almost all the churches have " the ivy green " clambering over the windows and turrets , and pretty willow trees drooping their graceful branches about the doorways . I love to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pleasant to get even a glimpse of nature in the artificial city . But I do n't like the stained glass windows . I do n't like to see the congregation with green eyes and pink noses and blue cheeks and yellow lips . It excites my troublesome bump of mirthfulness , ( and that 's wrong , you know , in church ; ) beside , I catch myself examining the windows , to see if there are any two of them alike , and counting the red and pink and blue diamonds , and squares , and wondering whether , were they transposed this way and that way , the effect would not be better . And then I know that most of those windows are so arranged that they ca n't be opened , to let in the fresh air , and that gives me a stifled feeling , and I involuntarily untie my bonnet strings , and draw a long breath , to see if my breathing apparatus is all right ! No , I do n't like these modern improvements ( ? ) in churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had rather worship , like the old Covenanters , among the green hills  --  the blue sky for a roof , the gnarled old tree trunks for pillars , the branches for galleries , and the birds for an orchestra ; and unless the minister preached because his heart was so full of love to God that he could n't help preaching , I should rather hear my Maker preach to me , in the soft whisper of the leaves , the happy hum of the tiny insect , and the low , soft murmur of the stream . Now , my dear children , do n't mistake me . It is our duty to go to church ; and it is wrong to think of anything else in church but worshipping God ; but there 's so much display , and show , and fashion now-a-days , in the churches  --  so much to distract the thoughts  --  so much hollow pretension to piety , that I sometimes feel , as I told you , that I would rather worship amid the green hills , like the old persecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! they sang every hymn as if they might sing the next one in Heaven . So ought we ! Are you tired of my sermon ? Well , what do you think I saw here in New-York to-day ? A boy of eight years old walking in the street , with his hands in his jacket pockets , smoking a cigar ! I did n't know whether to laugh or to cry at the little monkey . Finally , I laid my hand on his shoulder and said , " You do n't like that nasty cigar , I hope , my dear child . " He blushed , and taking it out of his mouth , said , " Yes , I do , but I 'll throw it away if you want me to . " " Thank you , " said I , " for your politeness , but it is not of myself I was thinking . I can easily get out of the way of it , you know , but it is such a shocking bad habit to get into ; so young as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea how much it costs to smoke . You must always offer a friend one , else he will call you ' a stingy fellow . ' Why , my dear boy , only think , it will take all your pocket money to buy cigars . You forget that by and by , you will want a store in Broadway , full of goods , and clerks to sell them , and a house to live in , and may be a wife , too ; ah , you need n't laugh , for I do n't believe you 'll be able to get a wife if you keep on smoking till you get old enough to be engaged . By that time you 'll be so stupefied , that nobody will have you ! " Yes , and many a time when you want a pair of new boots , you 'll have to do without them because you ca n't possibly go without your cigar , and you have n't money enough for both . Now , I 'd just like to know if a smart little fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of , by a miserable little dirty roll of tobacco ? " Well , he said he would not smoke any more , but I 've been afraid ever since to turn a corner , for fear I shall see the precocious young man walking behind a cigar . Oh , the country is the place for boys ,  --  on a nice farm , where there is ploughing , and hoeing , and digging , and sowing , and reaping going on ; where they can jump upon a horse , without any saddle , and ride him to water , with his mane for a bridle ; where they can help build fences , and help make hay , and help milk cows , and drive them to pasture ; where they can go blackberrying , and strawberrying , and chestnuting , and everything but bird-nesting . I would n't like to leave my purse in the way of a boy who went bird-nesting . I should know he had a bad heart . Yes , the country is the place for boys . There are no oyster saloons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no gangs of bad , idle boys to teach them all sorts of mischief ;  --  plenty going on in the country to amuse them innocently  --  terrible rattlesnakes to be slaughtered ; woodchucks to be hunted ; hawks to be shot ( who make mince-meat of the poor little chickens ) ; maple sugar and cider to make ; husking frolics to go to . Just as if I did n't know what was best for boys , if I am a woman . I tell you , some of the greatest heroes in the world have had women for mothers . THE BOY WHO LIKED NATURAL HISTORY . Hal Hunt lived at the " Seven Corners ; " he was just six years old last Fourth of July ; and as " independent " as you might suppose , with such a birth-day to boast of . He was on the gun-powder order , I can tell you ; bound to make a fizz wherever he went , always popping up in odd places , and frightening nervous old ladies , and little two-year-olders , who had ventured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dog , for ten miles round , made for the nearest port when Hal and his torn straw hat loomed up in the distance . Hal never was in a school room in his life ; but it did n't follow that he did no studying for all that . On the contrary , he sat there , on the steps of his father 's grocery store , with his chin between his little brown palms , doing up more thinking than the schoolma'am would have allowed , except in recess . Hal was very fond of Natural History ;  --  in fact , he had about made up his mind , that as soon as he owned a long-tailed coat , he would own a menagerie . Pigs , geese , hens , ducks , cows , oxen , nothing came amiss to him that went into Noah 's ark . He expected to have a grand time when he got that menagerie  --  setting them all the cars , and hearing them growl behind their bars . One day he sat on the door-step running it over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hens , marched in a procession past the door . There was the speckled hen , black and white , ( with red eyes ) looking like a widow in half mourning ; there was the white one that would have been pretty , had n't she such a turn for fighting that her feathers were as scarce as brains in a dandy 's head ; there was the black one , that contested her claims with the white hen , to a kernel of corn , and a place in the procession next the rooster , in a manner that would have delighted the abolitionists . Hal watched them all , and then it struck him , all of a sudden , that he had never seen a hen swim . He had seen ducks do it , and swans , and geese , but he never remembered to have seen a HEN swim . What was the reason ? Did n't they know how ? or would n't they do it ? Hal was resolved to get at the bottom of that problem without delay ; so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tore his jacket , and the hen flew up in a tree . Then he tried for the speckled widow ; she of course was too sharp for him . At last he secured the brown one , and hiding her under his jacket started for the " creek , " about a quarter of a mile off . He told the hen , going along , that if she did n't know how to swim , it was high time she did , and that he was going to try her any how ; the hen cocked up her eye but said nothing , though she had her thoughts . The fact was she never had been in the habit of going out of the barn-yard , without asking leave of the rooster , who was a regular old " Blue Beard ; " and she knew very well that he would n't scratch her up another worm , for a good twelve-month , for being absent without leave . So she dug her claws into Hal 's side , every now and then , and tried to peck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no use , for go into that creek she should . Well , he got to the creek at last , and stood triumphantly on a little bank just over it . He took a good grip of his hen , and then lifted up his arm to give her a nice toss into the water . He told her that now she was to consider herself a duck , instead of a hen , ( what a goose ! ) then over he went splash into the water himself . The question was not now whether the hen could swim , but whether he could ; he floundered round and round , and screeched like a little bedlamite , and was just thinking of the last fib he told , when his brother Zedekiah came along and fished him out . Hal prefers now to try his experiments on his father 's door-step ; as to the hen , poor chicken-hearted thing ! she did n't dare to show her wet feathers to her lordly old rooster ; so she smuggled herself into neighbor Jones ' barn-yard and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sake of her board . KNUD IVERSON . I suppose that every boy and girl who reads my " Little Ferns , " has heard or read of martyrs . You have all owned a primer with the picture of " John Rogers , " who was burned alive for being a good man ; then , you remember " Stephen , " of Bible memory , who was stoned to death , for the same reason . In 1853 , when Religion walks in satin slippers , perhaps you think that no martyrs can be found . Dear children , Aunt Fanny sees them every day ; bearing tortures worse than the fire , or the rack , and opening their burdened hearts to God alone . But it is not of these that I would speak now . I am going to tell you of a little boy martyr . " Knud Iverson " was a little Norwegian , a countryman of the famous " Ole Bull , " the great violinist . Knud 's parents had come over from Norway to this country , and settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look in your Atlas , and I should like to have you find it , because I want you to remember all about this dear little boy . ) Knud had been early taught how to be a good boy . His parents ' words did not pass into his ears to be forgotten . Knud remembered everything they said ; and , what was better , he practiced it . They were quite sure that when Knud was out of their sight , he behaved just as well as if their eyes were on him . Can your father and mother be as sure of YOU ? Knud loved to go to Sabbath school ; he never was absent from his class once . He was not frightened away by a drop of rain , or a warm sun ; he loved to go . His mother did not have to say to him , " Come , come , Knud ! do n't you know it is time you were preparing to go to school ? " or , " Come , come , Knud ! it is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; he was always ready ; his lesson in his head , and love for God in his heart ; and away he trudged , cheerful and happy , to gladden the eyes of his kind teacher by being promptly in his place . Perhaps you think because Knud loved to pray that he did n't love to play . Not at all . You did n't know that good boys enjoy play much better than bad ones , did you ? Well , they do ; because their consciences are not troubling them all the while , as those of bad boys are . Yes , Knud loved to play ; but he could never play with bad boys , or help them to do wrong . And he was n't a coward , either , as you will see . He spoke right up , and told them kindly what he thought , and begged them not to do evil , either . One day he was walking peaceably along , thinking happy thoughts , when a party of bad boys came up to him , saying : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit , and we want some , and what is more , we are determined to have some ; and we want you to go with us and help us to get it . " " What , steal ? " said Knud ; fixing his clear , pure eyes on the naughty boys . " Steal ! I would not do it for all the world . " " But you shall , " said a great , strong boy , bigger than Knud . " You shall ? " echoed all the other boys , " or , we will drown you , Knud ; yes , drown you in the river , just as sure as you stand there . " Knud looked at them . He saw that they were in earnest . They were stronger than he , and Knud knew that they could kill him , for there was nobody near to help him . His father and mother were not within call . Knud loved his father and mother ; he thought this world a very fair and pleasant one , with its birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tremble and drop on his knees before those wicked boys and say , " Do n't kill me  --  do n't  --  I will do anything if you wo n't kill me ! " No , no ; dear , noble , courageous little fellow ! He stood up and faced them all , and said , " I can not steal ; no  --  not even if you kill me ! " You would have thought that they would have put their arms about his neck and begged his forgiveness , but they were little monsters . I can not bear to think there are children with such bad hearts , because we look to see them innocent , and good , and pure . But you will weep when I tell you that they seized Knud and dragged him down to the river and plunged him in , and that the waters closed over the sunny little head , that is now wearing a martyr 's crown . You pity Knud ? I pity his murderers . Do you think that they can sleep peaceably at night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and see a pallid , upturned face , with pure and pleading eyes , from which they turned away ! Ever at their side , at golden morn , and busy noon , and dewy eve , a little form , unseen by other eyes , shall follow  --  follow  --  follow . Ever in their startled ears , a little childish voice , that no noise may drown , no earthly power may hush , shall ring , " Oh , I can not steal , not even if you kill me ! I can not steal ! " CHILDREN IN 1853 . I went with a friend , the other day , to look at some " rooms to let . " She liked the rooms , and the man who owned them liked she should have them ; but when she mentioned she had children  --  he stepped six paces off  --  set his teeth together  --  pulled his waist-coat down with a jerk , and said  --  " Never  --  take  --  children ,  --  ma'am ! " Now , I 'd like to know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know if children are to have their necks wrung like so many chickens , if they happen to " peep ? " I 'd like to know if they have n't just as much right in the world as grown folks ? I begin to feel catamount-y about it ! I 'd like to know if boarding-house keepers , ( after children have been in a close school-room for five or six hours , feeding on verbs and pronouns , ) are to put them off with a " second table , " leaving them to stand round in the entries on one leg , smelling the dinner , while grown people ( who have lunched at oyster shops and confectioner 's saloons ) sit two or three hours longer than is necessary at dessert , cracking their nuts and their jokes ? I 'd like to know if , when they have a quarter given them to spend , they must always receive a bad shilling out of it at the stores , in " change " ? I 'd like to know if people in omnibuses are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out of a nice seat , take it themselves , and then perch them on their sharp knee-bones , to jolt over the pavements ? I have a great mind to pick up all the children , and form a colony on some bright island , where these people , who were made up in a hurry , without hearts , could n't find us ; or if they did , we 'd just say to them when they tried to come ashore  --  Never take grown-up folks here , sir ! or , we 'd treat them to a " second dinner , "  --  bill of fare , cold potatoes , bad cooking butter , bread full of saleratus , bones without any meat on them , watery soups , and curdled milk  --  ( that is to say , after we had picked our nuts long enough to suit us at dessert ! ) How do you suppose they 'd like to change places with " children " that way ? Now here 's Aunt Fanny 's creed , and you may read it to your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and big slices of good plain gingerbread for children . I believe in making their clothes loose enough to enable them to eat it all , and jump round in when they get through . I believe in not giving away their little property , such as dolls , kites , balls , hoops , and the like , without their leave . I believe in not promising them a ride , and then forgetting all about it . I believe in not teasing them for amusement , and then punishing them for being " troublesome . " I believe in not allowing Bridget and Betty to box their ears because the pot boils over , or because their beaux did n't come the evening before . I believe in sending them to school where there are backs to the benches , and where the schoolma'am has had at least " one offer . " I believe no house can be properly furnished with out at least a dozen children in it . I believe little children to be all that is left us of Paradise ; and that any housekeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had better count up her silver , without loss of time !
