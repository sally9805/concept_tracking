HENRY C. CAREY . " POLITICAI. economy , " says Mr. Mill , - one of the most philosophical and candid of the modern school of foreign writers on this subject- " reasons from assumed premises - from premises which might be totally without foundation in fact , and which are not pretended to be universally in accordance with it . " It is not to be wondered at , that those who begin their reasoning from such points of departure , should fall out by the way ; and that occasion should be found for the frank declaration of Mr. MeCulloch , the highest living authority of that school " The differences which have subsisted among the most eminent professors of political economy , have proved excessively unfavorable to its progress , and have generated a disposition to distrust its best established conclusions . " It is ilot to depreciate the claims of the science that we have cited these humiliating confessions by its learned Doctors . They furnish us suffleicut explanation , and , in some measure , justifleation , for the indifference with which its present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being called practical men . It requires no small assurance , with such avowals staring them in the face , in enduring print , for the pundits of this distracted sect , to stand up , as they do , and call upon statesmen and legislators in the name of the whole , to listen to their voice , as if it were accordant and unanimous  --  to accept their guidance in the conduct of the most important operations of government , affecting the material , intellectual , and moral well-being of millions , as if they were all agreed ; and in this advanced stage of the world 's history , mankind ought to have become too wise to hesitate about deferring to their authority . If we would translate their conduct and their pretensions into language , it would be something like this : " We have started from various and confiietin* hypotheses , - each man of us framing his own ,  --  of what we regard as the way of the world 's going on , in the business of accumulating , distributing , and consuming wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are not pretended to be universally in accordance with it . We have discoursed of value , of profits , of rent , and the like general terms with which our science is conversant . We have not agreed at all in defining them , and the differences between us have not been merely verbal , but fundamental , reaching to the essential properties of things , and the widest consequences in action . We have found out , some of us , laws in virtue of which , the race of man is in a constant and fatal course of progressive deterioration , in those physical comforts which our studies concern themselves about . It is marching on to increasing famine and misery . This discovery is the peculiar merit of our modern school  --  the new Academy . This , which it was not given Adam Smith to see , has been reserved for our eyes , and it lies at the foundation of our recent teachings , shaping and coloring them all . We have , consequently , discarded as erroneous and heretical , much , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refrained from the exposure of many of his errors , lest we should impair the superstitious worship paid to his name , **that name in which we now call upon you to let things alone  --  to abstain from any effort to protect the industry of your people , against * Francis Homer , one of the first contributors to the Edinburgh Review , and a thorough-paced advocate of the so-called Free Trade policy , wrote , in 1803 , to a friend who had recommended to him to bring out an annotated edition of the Wealth of Nations . " I should be reluctant to expose Smith 's errors , before his work has produced its full effect . We owe much at present to the superstitious worship of Smith 's name , and we must not impair that feeling till the victory is more complete . " // the adverse legislation of foreign states , and the death grapple of foreign private competition . This we teach , with one accord , as a rule of universal application , attempt no protection , and let the world wag. ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economical writers . The plausibilities of each have vogue with his coterie of adherents . The practical truth that is in each has gained for him the support of a certain number of practical men - their speculations have ceased to be the occupation of mere students , and have passed into action . They come to us now from across the Atlantic , hacked by the authority of Sir Robert Peel and Lord John Russell , and with the weight which attaches to the strong common sense supposed to be the basis of the English character , and represented by the profession and example of the British Lords and Commons . There was a time when it might do for us , whigs and protectionists , to rely upon the instinctive detection by our people of the errors in fact , and fallacies in reasoning , which are involved in the defence of the Foreign Trade policy , which calls itself Free Trade . Every individual has his notions upon this general subject . It is impossible that he should have made his way to man 's estate , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his observation into certain formulas-little snatches of proverbial philosophy - by which he is governed in his private conduct , as well as in his judgment upon public measures . Time was , perhaps , when we might trust to these , for working sound conclusions in the general mind , and keeping it obstinately right , in spite of the lectures of the professors in our colleges , and the solemn treatises of the systematic economists . That time , we apprehend , has passed . The time never was , when we could rely upon contemptuous sneers at theorists , or the attempted refutations by members of Congress and editors of newspapers , who theorized equally with them , but less logically , and have struggled to maintain sound positions by unsound arguments , and brought weakness instead of strength to the cause they labored to serve . Of this there has been more than enoughmore than either business or policy will permit us to remark upon . What we have wanted was systematic instruction in true political economy , to meet and overcome systema tic instruction in false-When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our colleges into the arena of active life , to exercise the power which knowledge always possesses over ignorance , every one of whom has had carefully instilled in him the dogmas of the foreign economists , and the reasonings by which they arc supported , it is surely time that we should have an American system , presented equally , formally , fully , and logically . These young men can not well have a faith made ' up of shreds and patches . It must be a consistent whole . The hour has been crying out for the man who should do this great service , and , in our judgment , the man has come , in the person of Mr. Carey ,  --  the text-book , in his writings . The name of Mr. Carey is not a new one in economical literature , nor is its reputation merely American . On the contrary , as we shall have occasion to show before concluding this notice , it is quite as well known , and we regret to indulge a suspicion , more highly and worthily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the year 1837 , he published Part First , of his Principles of Political Economy , treating of the laws of the production and distribution of wealth . This was followed in 1838 by Part Second , " of the causes which retard increase in the production of wealth , and improvement in the physical and moral character of man , ** and , in 1840 , by Part Third , " of the causes which retard increase in the numbers of mankind , " and Fourth " of the causes which retard increase in the political condition of man . " The distinguishing characteristic of this work , in its manner , is the elaborate and extensive collection and comparison of facts . Travellers , Historians , Statisticians , are laid under contribution , and no principle is advanced without large citations , from every quarter , to prove or to elucidate its truth . Mr. Carey went upon the notion that the science could only deserve that name , in so far as it was founded upon the observation of facts and carried forward by induction from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show , not the versimilitude but the verity itself , of his statements-not that the conclusions were likely to be true merely , that they followed by just course of reasoningbut that the reasoning was just and complete , // because its results were borne out by visible experience in what we may style , the second series of facts . It is not difficult for us to reason with the precision of syllogism , if we can be absolutely sure , that all facts have been observed and taken into account ,  --  that have relation to the matter . But that we have , in point of fact , taken them into account , is only to be learned by bringing the conclusion from time to time to the test of comparison with facts , of as many different series , as there are stages in the process of ratiocination . The whole philosophy of the matter is involved in the remark that " truth is stranger than fiction . " Fiction must look like truth or it is feb de se . Truth is under no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , which have no prototype and consequently no similitude . We shall see pretty soon to what issue the habit of Mr. Carey 's mind has conducted him . Meantime , it occurs to our recollection , that in a series of the work published shortly after its appearance , this feature was deprecated as a fault . The reviewer thought it would have been better to lay down the principles in due method , and leave it to the reader to see that the facts must be in accordance with them . That course has been extensively pursued by other writers , and with striking results . It is a circumstance which Mr. Mill had in mind , probably , when he wrote the sentence which we began this article by quoting . The leading feature in which the doctrines of this work of Mr. Carey differs from those of Maithus , Ricardo , senior , and the modern school of foreign Economists in general are , 1 . The demonstration that land , like every other commodity , owes all its value to labor , and that rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that compensation which is paid to the owner of land for the use of its original and indestructible powcr5 , " is only interest upon the capital which has been expended upon and about it , in bringing it to its existing condition . That , consequently , the profits resulting from investments in land obey the same laws as those affecting capital in other forms . 2 . " That as population and capital increase , and as cultivation is extended over the inferior soils , labor becomes more productive , and there is a constant diininution in the proportion claimed by the owner of capital , whether applied to the improvement of land or to the transportation or exchange of commodities , accompanied by a constant increase in the proportion retained by the laborer , and a constant improvement of his conditio n . We have chosen the second law , in the words of Mr. Carey , from page 141 of his 1st volume , for the purpose of bringing distinctly into view the phrase which we have put into italics . It is repeated on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , with the addition , that further capital is accumulated with greater facility , and that though the proportion of the capitalist is diminished , yet that smaller proportion yields him a constantly increasing quantity of commodities , and thus a smaller amount of labor is required to recover a given amount of inc me . It requires but little reflection to convince one , that this is the permanent , inflexible , law of human progress . It is apparent that every improvement in the machinery of production is such in virtue of the fact that it diminishes the quantity of labor necessary to attain the possession of a given commodity . Let it be an axe , or a tin kettle , which will serve the purpose of illustration as well as any more complex and costly product of labor . It is equally plain that the improvement once achieved , axes and tin kettles of equal quality must henceforth forever command a less price in labor than before . A given amount of labor will , under the influence of competition , command more of them than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of their production ,  - -  including , of course , the distributive charge upon each axe or kettle requisite to compensate the interest , and wear of the capital or accumulated labor invested in the machinery ,  --  has decreased . But what is capital but the aggregate sum of the axes and kettles already in existence ? The relative power of labor , in respect to capital , the proportion which it can command of the fruits of their joint exertion and usethe value and dignity of man , as compared with things , is advancing in ceaseless progression with the increase of population and // 379 of wealth . That the return to the capitalists , for the use of the accumulated labor of himself , or those whom he represents , in virtue of purchase or inheritance , also increases absolutely , though relatively diminishing , is shown by considerations which we are not careful to reproduce here . In this day , when so many are attempting the artificial reconstruction of society , upon the notion that the physical and moral condition of the laborer is deteriorating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage , is the most interesting . In this very year of grace , 1850 , Mons. Fr . Bastiat , membre correspondant de l'Institute , representant du People , &amp;c. , one of the most prominent economical writers of France , who is glorified by his admirers as the French Cobden , has given to the world , at Paris , a book which he styles HARMONIES ECONOMIQUES . It is devoted , more than to any thing , to the elucidation and enforcement of the law of which we have been speaking , and which Mr. Carey gave to the world for the first time . Bastiat uses it , and the inferences manifestly deducible from it , with crushing force against the communists and socialists , who are perplexing his nation with fear of change . He writes , as Frenchmen are prone to do , in the heroic vein , and in a highly rhetorical manner , but it must be confessed , with general adroitness of argument and felicity of diction . On page 280 of his book , he comes to the formal annunciation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poser , comme in6branlable , quant a la distribution de ce bienetre , l'axiome * " A mesure que les capitaux s'accroissent la part absolue des capitalistes dans les produits totaux augmente et leur part relative diminue . Au contraire les trarailleurs , vojent augmenter leur part dans deux sens . " * * he continues , *IS THE GREAT* THE ADMIRAnLE , CONSOLiNG , NECESSARY AND INFLEXIBLE LAW OF CAPITAL . To demonstrate it , it seems to me , is to overwhelm with discredit the declamations which " I have dared to lay down as an axiom that can not be shaken , the following rule in relation to the distribution of wealth . In proportion as capital increases , the share of the capitalist in the sum of products , increases absolutely , while it diminishes relatively . The laborer , on the contrary , sees his share augmented , as well relatively as absolutely . " ' have so long assailed our ears , against the AVIDITY* the TYRANNY* of the most powerful instrument of civilization and of EQUALIZATiON , which human powers produce. ** Mons. Bastiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Mr. Carey had done no more in this world than supply that demonstration , he would have made as large a contribution to Political Economy , as any , the most eminent , of his predecessors ; larger than any of his contemporaries-one large enough , it might fairly be supposed , to draw an aclknowledgment from a man who has availed himself of his labors so extensively , and prizes them so highly , as Mons. Bastiat . He has copied his very arrangement from Mr. Carey-he has used his language , his illustrations , and tables of figures , repeatedly ; he has scarce an idea , which is not to be found in the work of which we are speaking , and yet the solitary reference to his creditor is this : At page 404 , he cites from Mr. Carey s book an extract from the proceedings of the South Australian Association , and proceeds , " The association , believing that this disaster , ( the ruin of the Colony of Swan River , ) arose from the cheapness of land , advanced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " adds Carey , from whom 1 have borrowed this quotation , " in his introduction , addressed to the Youth of France , he unblushingly arrogates for himself the entire originality of his views-compares them with those of Malthus , Ricardo , &amp;c. , and dismisses Carey 's among " a crowd of other systems of a less general scope , that I shall not mention . " It will have been observed , by the reader who is acquainted with the modern school of English economists , that the two laws we have noted , as the remarkable feature of Mr. Carey 's work , are sufficient to establish a wide discrepancy between his views and the speculations of Ricardo , Maithus , and their followers , although he was as yet so far misled by their autboiity , as to concede , that in the commencement of cultivation , when population is small and land abundant , the best soils are alone cultivated , and that with the progress of population men are driven to those of succesively inferior quality . The theory of Rent , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first promulgated , as the great // discovery of the age . A new school arose , all of whose theories were founded upon its truth , and who have corrected what they deem the errors of Adam Smith , by the fresh light , and broader vision , which this acquisition has afforded them . Ricardo taught that " the natural tendency of profits is to fall ; for in the progress of society and wealth , the additional quantity of food required is obtained by the sacrifice of more and more * He held , too , that rent being paid by reason of the necessity of resorting to soils of progressively lower degrees of fertility , and necessarily advancing as the difference between the best lands , thus first cultivated , and those last brought into use , increases , the share of the laborer in the products of agriculture will be diminished , while that of the landlord will be increased . That , consequently , as the average rates of profits and wages , in all employments , tends to a level , the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior to that of the landlords , with a continual tendency in both to become ultimately his slaves . Mr. Carey , examining the historical records of the long settled nations of the earth , and comparing the conditions of man , capital , and land , as described in reliable accounts of contemporary societies in different stages of industrial progress , discovered that their theories were at war with the facts . When his analysis had detected the law which governs the *vision , in different periods of the progress of national wealth , between the laborer and the capitalist , of the fruits of their co-operative action , it supplied him with a corrective , and demonstrated the existence of a counteracting force , the modifications due to whose influence did much towards harmonizing the results of error with observed facts . There was sufficient vitality in the partial trut*h , to preserve the falsehood mixed up with it from destruction . It enabled him , also , to fortify his faith against the dreary forebodings of Malthus , who , pursuing the doctrine of Rent , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its legitimate conclusions , proved that the Divine command , " increase and multiply and replenish the earth , " was but an injunction to the race to hurry on to starvation-an invitation to suicide . He found that the laws of capital provided for its growth in a more rapid ratio than that of population , and that the course of this world was so ordered , that its natural progress was towards ever increasing comfort , and virtue , instead of destitution , misery and vice . It was made clear to his comprehension that the cause of Rent was not that assigned-that land , instead of bearing a larger value than the labor expended in bringing it into its existing condition-a monopoly price-always represented a less value in exchange , and could at all times and in all places , be purchased by the equivalent of less labor than that which had been employed in its improvement . But , while thus discarding the theory of Rent in its formula and its consequences , he had not emancipated himself from the falsehood assumed as truth , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The soils first cultivated are very frequently not those of the highest fertility . It is well known that the rich bottom lands of the west , covered , as they are , with large timber , are not those most sought after . The settler prefers that which is somewhat inferior , but which is clear and ready for cultivation . Timber is , therefore , an objection to him , and be will take land of second or third quality , ready for use , rather than No. 1 , that requires to be cleared . " * But he every where impliedly treats such cases as exceptional and receives it as the general rule that men first cultivate the superior soils , and arc driven by necessity to those of successively lower fertility . The fiction is perpetually repeated , under circumstances , where , to one who , having under his guidance learned the truth , now reverts to his earlier work-it would almost seem to indicate a wantonness of perverse phraseology-an affectation of paradox . To recur to a former quotation : " As population and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior soils , further capital is accumulated with greater facility , " &amp;c . Substitute superior for inferior , in the italicised member of this sentence , and the // proposition carries conviction to the sense as soon as it strikes the eye or ear . What was before incongruous and discordant , becomes harmonious-almost self-evident and a truism . It was precisely to this substitution that Mr. Carey 's subsequent enquiries afterfacts conducted him . It is difilcult to conceive a proposition , which being sheer fiction , possessed more the appearance of truth , than that men in the midst of an ample supply of fertile and unappropriated lands , will always in the first instance subject to cultivation those only which are capable of yielding the largest return . It is not strange that the declaration should have been accepted so readily , as a manifest fact . Truth is stranger than fiction . The strong conviction with which it impressed the minds of the foreign economists , is evinced in the unflinching boldness with which they met and embraced every inference logically deducible from it . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reductio ad absurdurn signally failed . When it led them to an absurdity , they received the absurdity without hesitation , and incorporated it forthwith into their creeds . The more startling are the principles of doctrine and practice to which it conducts them , the more do they magnify the importance of the discovery . They have vindicated their honesty as well as their faith , in such measure as is seldom given to writers upon any matter of mere terrestrial concernment . In the year 1848 , Mr. Carey published THE PAs'r , THE PRESENT , AND THE FuTURE . His examination of history , and observation of contemporaneous facts , had satisfied him that the premise assumed by the modern school has no existence as a fact ,  --  that it never has existed in any country whatsoever ; and that it is contrary to the nature of things that it should have existed or can exist . On the contrary , he shows the original settlers " invariably occupying the high and thin lands , requiring little clearing and no drainage those which can yield but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills and clearing and draining the lower and richer lands , as population and wealth * all other of the necessaries of life , increases daily , and men consume more while accumulating wealth with constantly increasing rapidity . The danger of famine and disease passes away . Increased returns to labor and daily improving condition , render labor pleasant , and man applies himself more steadily as his work becomes less severe . Population in* creases , and the rapidity of its increase is seen to be greater with each successive generation , and with each is seen an increase of the power of living in connection with each other by reason of the power of obtaining increasing supplies from the same surface with each is seen an increase in the tendency to combination of action , by which their labors are rendered more productive - their wants increased  --  the desires and the facilities of commerce augmented : tending to produce harmony , and peace , and security of persoa and property among themselves , and with the world ; ace ompanied by constant increase of numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our purpose to make any citations from the beautiful and convincing demonstration by which this text is supported . It consists in elaborate historical examination of the progress of settlement and cultivation , in the United States , Mexico , South America , Great Britain France , Italy , Greece , India , &amp;e . This is the first and essential point in Carey 's method of treating a subject . That having been established it is proper to explain the rationsile of the phenomena , and to exhibit their consonance with what might be anticipated by theorizing , and how the facts could or should have been discovered by sagacious conjecture ,  --  reversing the method of the English economists ,  --  that of reasoning " from assumed premises which might be totally without foundation in Nor is it our purpose to detail the eonclusions to which this discovery has opened the way , with one remarkable exception , presently to be noticed . We pause here to give audible expression to the astonishment which can not well fail to be felt by every reader , that when the imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given such high reputation to its authors ; - should have founded a new school of economists , which continued for forty years with ever fresh glorification of the brilliancy and impor " Pas*ing thus , at every step , from the poor tance of the theory of rent ,  --  its refutation to the better soils , the supply of food , and of should have excited so little sensation , and // especially in the native country of the man to whom the world owes this great obligation . How comes it , that after being led astray for forty years in a wilderness of delusion , with perpetual beating of drums and sounding of trumpets in honor of our guides , the voice of congratulation and praise should be so low and feeble for him who restores us to safe paths ,  --  that after wandering among quagmires and pit-falls in Stygian gloom , broken only to reveal " gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire , " lowering upon the traveller-sights and sounds unholy , besetting him on every side-obedience to the very commandments of God , denounced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no thanks for him who leads us to cheerful scenes and bright prospects ,  --  who vindicates the ways of God to man , and opens to his race the vista of Hope and of Progress ? We can find no answer honorable to our countrymen . " The Past , the Present , and the Future , " which has found no reviewer in America , has found them in the Revue des deux Mondes , and elsewhere on the Continent and in England . The principles of poiitical economy introduced into no College in the United States , * have been translated into Swedish and made the textbook of the University of Upsal . A chapter on the philosophy of commercial crises from a continental author , ( M. Coquelin ) avowedly founded , and with due acknowledgment , upon Carey 's work , is translated and published in the Merchant 's Magazine , to be read by bankers and merchants of his own country , to whom the original is less known than the Koran . It has not yet been remarked , but such is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " The Past , Present and Future , " indeed until about half of that work had been written , Mr. Carey was with the rest of the economists , a zealous advocate of what they denominate Free Trade and an opponent of protection . The prepara * Since writing the above , we have been informed that " Carey 's Political Economy , " and " the Past , the Present and the Future , " have been adopted as text-books-in some New England Collegethink you , where the sons of the cotton manufacturers are educated , or in Pennsylvania , amidst the coal mines and the iron mills ? - not a bit of it , but in the University of Virginia , where the childreri of the Abstractionists are congregated . tion of this book opened to his mind the philosophy of concentration . It instructed him that in the natural progress of things , in the course of real Free Trade , the consumer of food takes his place side by side with its producer , and that both share the fruits of the common mother earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest profusion where there is the least waste in the machinery of exchange . That the loss from the use of the machinery of exchange , is in the ratio of the bulk of the article to be exchanged , f od standing first in the scale , which diminishes until we come to fine laces and cutlery . It became apparent to him that " In the regular course of human affairs , the man who makes the shoes eats the food provided by the man who desires to wear them ; and he does so because it is easier for him to bring the awl and the lap-stone , by aid of which he can make one thousand pair of shoes , than it is for the farmer to carry to him the food necessary for his support while doing it . This tendency struggles incessantly to develop itself , and is seen on every occasion making its appearance , but it has almost invariably been crushed ; the effect of which has been That the people of the United States are now far more widely scattered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have been compelled to use a vast quantity of inferior machinery of exchange , in the form of roads and wagons , in place of the superior machinery of steam-engines and mills ; and they have been driven to begin on poor soils in the west , yielding ten bushels of wheat to the acre , when otherwise they might have worked their way down into the rich soils of the river-bottoms further east , portions of which may , at all times . be bought for far less than the cost of production . Pennsylvania abounds in bottom-land that can be cultivated , when the farmer can find a market at his door for milk and cream and butter ; but , in the meantime , her citizens go west to seek other lands that may produce something that will bear carriage to the distant markets of the world . It is now obvious what has been the reason of this , ( the Tariff Policy , ) the single case in which the policy of the Union has appeared to depart from the direction of perfect freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erroneous , but are now satisfied that the error has been with us . " Man everywhere must commence with the poor soils , and the richer ones can not he cultivated until the commerce and produce are brought together . Whatever foreign interference tends to prevent this union , tends to corn- // pel men to scatter themselves over poor soils , to prevent increase in the reward to labor : and to prevent advance in civilization ; and resistarice to such inte ? ference is a necessary act of self-defence . The article of chief consurnption is food , of which rich soils would yield larger quantities in return to half the labor required on the poor ones ; and half the difference would convert into cloth all the cotton and wool produced , and make the iron used , in the Union . Such being the case , the exports required to pay for English labor are so much absolute loss , while the great machine itself , ( the earth , ) suffers in the loss of labor that would double it in product and in value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 117 and 118 . Here we have the philosophy of Protection , deduced in logical sequence , from the principles of Free Trade , by a writer on systematic economy , pursuing his investigations aijo intuito , and singular only in this , that he has sought to learn and to augment his favorite science in the true spirit of Bacon , and has the candor and courage , when accurate observation and sound induction have led him to the discovery of a previous error , to proclaim the fact and accept and enforce the antagonistic truth . Retaining all his former convictions , in favor of the justice and policy of Free Trade , he has found the way to attain it , and advocates Protection for the sake and in the spirit of Free Trade . He comes forth against the foreign economists , furnished at all points with weapons from their own armory and shouting their own battlecry - death to all interference with the liberty of man to employ his industry in such manner as his instinct of self-interest may dictate . The people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , not by the positive prohibition of their own Government , but by the refusal and neglect of that Government to interpose between them and the Colonial policy of England . That liberty must be recovered . We must conquer a peace . We must achieve perfect freedom of trade through perfect protection . Mr. Carey adopts , in this regard , the sentiment of the motto of Massachusetts : " Ense petit placidum sub libertate quietem . " He regards the whole system of indirect taxation as mere petty larceny . As a revenue system , it is the plunder of the poor for the sake of sparing the rich . He believes that if we desire to preserve peace , arrest the process of dispersion , and promote concentration upon rich soils , " it can only be done by increased protection , by aid of a tariff that is notfor revenue  --  a tam if whose direct object shall be that of establishing the right of every man to determine for himself where he will live and how he will esuploy his labor or his capital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus given , it has been our principal object to show the progress of an enlightened and honest mind towards the truth , and incidentally to do something towards redeeming the study of political economy from unjust obloquy , by showing that prosecuted in the right spirit , it conducts to conclusions in perfect harmony with their observation and experience . Such men will not undervalue the advantage of weaving scattered facts into a connected system , of exhibiting their relation to each other , and the rationale of their existence , of generalizing the history of the phenomena , connected with the production , distribution , and consumption of wealth in comprehensive laws . The progress of an iudividual in knowledge as well as his facility in making a ready application of it to the solution of the various practical questions which the exigencies of life present , depends upon the extent to which he has condensed it from particulars into generals . A man may learn and remember an indefinite number of the properties of the circle , and may be able to demonstrate them geometrically , or he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other possible properties , ( if any such there be , ) which have escaped attention , wrapped up in the brief formula 2 a x - X2Z=Z2 and evolve them when necessity requires . Every one can see which is the must convenient mode of packing away a given amount of knowledge . It need not be supposed that a work of economical instruction is necessatily dry because it is methodical . We know few books more entertaining than " The Past , the Present and the Future . " A young lady might read it , without suspicion that she was becoming indoctrinated in anything serious enough to be called scientific , and would probably be greatly surprised to discover that she knew more of political economy than is to be found in the armchairs of most Professors . A few extracts , // fice as a specimen of the style of the book : " In the good old times ' of Ivanhoe and Richard , when fertile land was abundant and people rare , the Saxon hogs roamed the fed upon the lands incapable of yielding grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine rich meadow was covered with wood and so saturated with moisture as to be inaccessible . Maids of honor then luxuriated on bacon , and laborers banqueted upon the strength of water-gruel , ' as did sixty years since many of the people of those northern counties , * which now present to view the finest farms in England , the rich soils composing which were then awaiting the growth of population and of wealth . A piece of fat pork was , in those days , an article of luxury rarely to be obtained by the laborer . Even within a century , the bread consumed by a large portion of the people was made of barley , rye , and oats , the consumption of wheat being limited to the rich ; the quantity produced being small . It is now in universal use , although so recently as 1727 an eight acre field of it , near Edinburgh , was deemed a curiosity . As late as 1763 , there was no such person as a public butcher known in Glasgow . It was the custom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt down the meat as the year 's supply of animal food . The state of things there , is an index to that which existed in the Lothians , and in Northumberland and other counties of the north of England , where may now be seen the most prosperous agriculture of Britain . At that time men cultivated , not the best soils , but those which they could cultivate , leaving the rich ones for their successors : and in this they did what is done now every day by the settlers of Illinois and *ATisconsin.

" Wealth tends to grow more rapidly than population , because better soils are brought into cultivation ; and it does grow more rapidly , whenever people abandon swords and muskets , and take to spades and ploughs . Every increase in the ratio of wealth to population is attended with an increase in the power of the laborer as compared with that of landed or other capital . We all see that when ships are more abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vice versa . When ploughs and horses are more plenty than ploughmen , the latter fix the wages , but when ploughmen are more abundant than ploughs , the owners of the latter determine the distribution of the product of labor . Eden . When wealth increases rapidly , new soils are brought into cultivation , and more ploughmen are wanted . The demand for ploughs produces a demand for more men to mine coal and smelt iron ore , and the iron-master becomes a competitor for the employment of the laborer , who obtains a larger proportion of the constantly increasing return to labor . He wants clothes in greater abundance , and the manufacturer becomes a competitor with the iron-master and the farmer for his services . His proportion is again increased , and he wants sugar , and tea , and coffee , and now the ship-master competes with the manufacturci , the iron-master and the farmer ; and thus with the growth of population and wealth there is produced a constantly increasing demand for labor ; and its increased productiveness , and the consequently increased facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of the laborer 's proportion . His wages rise , and the proportion of the capitalist falls , yet now the latter accumulates fortune more rapidly than ever , and thus his interest and that of the laborer are in perfect harmony with each other . If we desire evidence of this , it is shown in the constantly* increasing amount of the rental of England , derived from the appropriation of a constantly decreasing proportion of the product of the land : and in the enormous amount of railroad tolls compared with those of the turnpike : yet the railroad transports the farmer 's wheat to market , and brings back sugar and coffee , taking not one-fourth as large a proportion for doing the business as was claimed by the owner of the wagon and horses , and him of the turnpike . The laborer 's product is increased , and the proportion that goes to the capitalist is decreased . The power of the first over the product of his labor has grown , while that of the latter is diminished . " Nothing is more frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laborer obtained food more readily than at present , but no idea can be more erroneous . The whole quantity of food at this time consumed in England is at the lowest estimate sixty times as great as in the days of Edward III. , while the population is but little more than six times greater . Divided among the whole people , the average per head would be ten times as great , in quantity , without taking into account the difference of qualify . In those days of barbarous wassail , the waste among the nobles and their followers was prodigiously great . In our day economy prevails everywhere , and it prevails necessarily , for as the standard of living rises with the increase of production , the proportion that falls to the land , or to capital in any other form , tends to decrease . Increase of wealth tends therefore to beget economy , and economy begets wealth ; and the more fertile the soil cultivated the greater will be // 385 qwq peace is made , and the work of clearing is again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished , and the means of recommencing the work have again to he created . Meanwhile the best lands are covered with shrubs , and the best meadows are under water . With continued peace , the work , however , advances , and after a few years , population and wealth , and cultivation , attain the same height as before . New wars ensue , for the determination of the question which of the two chiefs shall collect all theso-called-rent . After great waste of life and property , one of them is killed , and the other falls his heir , having thus acquired both glory and plunder . He now wants a title , by which to be distinguished from those by whom he is surrounded . He is a little king . Similar operations are performed elsewhere , and kings become numerous . By degrees , population extends itself , and each little king covets the dominions of his neighbors . Wars ensue on a somewhat larger scale , and always with the same results . The people invariably fly to the hills for safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce , and famine and pestilence sweep off those whose flight had saved them from the sword of the invader . Small kings become greater ones , surrounded by lesser chiefs who glorify themselves in the number of their murders , and in the amount of plunder they have acquired . Counts , viscounts , earls , marquises , and dukes now make their appearance on the stage , heirs of the power and of the rights of the robber chiefs of early days . Population and wealth go backward , and the love of title grows with the growth of harbarism. * Wars are now made on a larger scale , and greater glory ' is acquired . In the midst of distant and highly fertile lands occupied by a numerous population , are rich cities and towns offering a copious harvest of plunder .

The highsounding titles of the East are in keeping with the weakness of those by whom they are assumed , as are the endless names of the Spanish grandee with the poverty of the soil cultivated by his dependents . The time is fast approaching when men of real dignity will reject the whole system as an absurdity , and when small men alone will think themselves elevated by the title of Esquire , Honorable , Baron , Marquis , or Duke . Extremes always meet . The son of the duke rejoices in the possession of half a dozen Christian names , and the little retailer of tea and sugar calls his daughter Amanda Malvina Fitzallan-Smith , or Pratt : while the gentleman calls his son Robert , or John . to arms , may be robbed with impunity , always an important consideration to those with whom the pursuit of glory ' is a trade Provinces are laid waste , and the population is exterminated , or if a few escape , they fly to the hills and mountains , there to perish of famine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich lands are overgrown : the spades and axes , the cattle and the sheep are gone : the houses are destroyed : their owners have ceased to exist : and a long period of abstinence from the work of desolation is required to regain the point from which cultivation had been driven by men intent upon the gratification of their own selfish desires , at the cost of the welfareand happiness of the people over whose destinies they have unhappily ruled . Population grows slowly , and wealth but little more rapidly , for almost ceaseless wars have impaired the disposition and the respect for honest labor , while the necessity for beginning once more the work of cultivation on the poor soils , adds to the distaste for work , while it limits the power of employing laborers . Swords or muskets are held to be more honorable implements than spades and pickaxes .
