PHANTOMS AND REALITIES-AN AL ' TOBIOGRAPHY. * PART THE THIRD-NIGHT . Iv . I *HE interval of suspense to which we were doomed before we received any tidings of Forrester seemed to us interminable ; and our speculations on the cause of his silence did not contribute to make our solitude the more endurable . We clung together , it is true ; but it was like people on a raft , with our heads stretched out , looking apart into the distance for succor . At last , at the end of a fortnight , there came a note in Forrester 's handwriting ( which I well remembered ) , signed only with an initial letter , requiring to see me alone in a roadside bostelrie about half a mile inland . The note was cautiously worded , so that if it fell into other hands , its purport would be unintelligible. thought this strange ; but Forrester was always fond of a little mystery , and on the present occasion there might be a necessity for it . I am ashamed to say , that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt some hesitation about giving him the meeting . The doubt was unworthy of us both ; yet I could not help aeking myself , over and over again , why he wished me to go alone - why he appointed to meet me at night - why he should act under a mask in an affair which demanded the utmost candor on all sides P  --  and a hundred other uncomfortable questions . Circumstances had made me anxious and distrustful ; and I was so conscious of the irritable state of my nerves , that , even while these suspicions were passing through my brain , I made an effort to do justice to my friend by recalling to mind the incidents of our former intercourse , throughout which he had displayed a fidelity and steadfastness that entitled him to my most implicit confidence . Even if it hail been otherwise , I had no choice but to trust to him ; it was indispensable that we should know the determination of our implacable enemy , and it was through Forrester alone we could obtain th' information . The night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little inn afforded me time to collect myself for an interview which I approached with no slight uneasiness . I had left Astrna behind me in a depressed and fretful mood . She could not comprehend why she was excluded from our councils , and seemed to regard it as a sort of coimspiracy to dishonor and humiliate her . Every trifling circumstance that affected her personally was viewed in the same light , with jealousy and suspicion . Poor Astraia ! Her life was already beginning to jar with mental discords , and the shadows of the future were falling thickly upon her , and darkening her path . The hostelrie at which I had the appointment with Forrester stood on the edge of a bleak common . In that part of the country there are many similar wastes , stretching a half mile or more into the interior , covered with a scant and sickly herbage , and presentingon the surface an arid * Concluded from Ibe July Number . 337 stones , and shells , as if these picture of sand , great , unprofitable pastures had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . There is a salt flavor in the air over these wild inland stretches ; the sea seems to pursue you with its saline weeds , its keen winds , and measured murniurs ; and the absolute solitude of a scene in which you very rarely meet a house or a tree , is calculated to make a dismal impression on a person otherwise out of humor with the world . I felt it forcibly that night . I thought the northeast wind that swept diagonally across the common was more wintry and biting than usual ; and the red light in the distant win dow of the " Jolly Gardeners " ( of all conceivable signs for such a spot ! ) looked as if it were dancincr away further and further from me as I advanced across the heath . At last I reached the inn  --  a low tiled house , with a tattered portico jutting out upon the road some ten or twelve feet , a few htticed windows , and a narrow passage , lighted by a single candle in a sconce on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bar " that looked like the inside of a cupboard , decorated with a variety of jugs , teacups , saucers , and other ware hung up in rows all round . The house was altogether a very tolerable specimen of what used to be called an ale-house in remote country disstricts ; a place suggestive of the strictest caution about liquors , but where you might repose with confidence on an impromptu entertainment of rashers and eggs . It was exactly the sort of house that Forrester would have preferred to a well-appointed hostel in the days of our summer vagrancy , when we used to wander toward Hamp. stead and Highgate , avoiding beaten tracks and crowded localities , and seeking out for ourselves , whenever we could find it , a secluded " Bailey Mow " shut up in a nest of orchards . He had not lost his early tastes-nor had I ! That little " bar , " with its innumerable samples of delft , threw me back sundry years of my life , to the time when I was free to dream or idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desert them at will . The incident was a trifling one in itself ; but it shot through my heart like a bolt of fire . It was the first time I had gone out and left Astrna alone behind me . I thought of her , seated in her lonely room , brooding over her desolation , and torturing herself with speculations upon the business in which I was engaged : while I h*I was out again on the high road , exulting in a man 's privilege to act for myself , with her destiny , for good or evil , at my disposal , and possessing the power of returning into the world from whence I had drawn her , and in which she could never acain appear ! I - I was at large once more , with the memories of the freedom and tranquillity I had relinquished tempting my thoughts into rebellion . And she h-alas ! she never seemed in my eyes so forlorn and lost as at that moment ! A single glance at the boxed-up " bar , " and the honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaped at me behind a complete breastwork of pewter and glass , awakened me ftc am the state // of reverie in which I had entered the house . I dare say I looked rather bewildered , like a man just shaking off a fit of abstraction , for the honest round face immediately started out of the chair which served as a socket for the body to which it belonged , and without waitin , , to hear me ask any questions , instantly proposed to conduct me to the gentleman up-stairs , who had been for some time expecting my arrival . I found Forrester in a small room which was reached by a flight of stairs , so sharp and precipitate , that they looked as if they were inserted on the face of the wall . Having lighted me into the room , the honest face disappeared , and left us alone together . Forrester stretched out his hand , as I thought , somewhat formally ; then motioning me to a seat opposite to him , waited in silence till the landlord had left the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come here , " he said . " No , " I replied , interrupting him , hastily ; " but I am surprised we did not hear from you sooner . In the name of Heaven , what can have been the cause of your silence ? " " How long is it since I saw you ? " " How long Upward of a fortnight , and we expected a letter every day . But the world forgets us when we forget ourselves . " " It might be well with some people , if the world did forget them , " he rejoined ; " but that is no a air of mine . I have not forgotten you , whatever you may have deserved from others . " This was uttered in a tone of asperity unusual with Forrester . But I felt that I had provoked it by the unacknowledging spirit in which I had met him after all the trouble he had taken on my account , and I was proceeding to make the best pology I could , when he cut me short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business that brought us together . " You were aware when I undertook to negotiate between you and the husband of Astrun , that I was his friend as well as yours . He had even stronger claims upon my friendship ; I had known him in our boyhood ; and when I returned , after an interval of years , and found him bereaved , as I had been myself  --  and by the same personyou can not he astonished that I should feel some interest in his situation . " " I do not blame you for that , " I returned , hardly knowing what I said , I was so amazed by the tone and substance of this unexpected opening . " Blame me ? " reiterated Porrester . " Blame me for sympathizing with an early friend , whose life , like my own , had been blasted to the root You must suppose my nature to he something ditferent from that of other men , if you imagine I could witness his sufferings unmoved . " " To what is this intended to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , your sympathies . were not so exclusive . You were then , Forrester , the friend of both ? " " Am I not so still What brings me here It is not exactly the sort of weather a man would select for a trip of pleasure into the country . What brings me here Your business . Does this look like a failure of friendship ? You are soured-isolation and self-reproaches , which pride will not suffer you to acknowledge , have turned your blood to acid . You are ready to quarrel for straws , and your whole care is how to escape the responsibility which passion and selfishness have brought upon you . " I leaped from my chair at these words , and looked fiercely at Forrester . He was perfectly calm , and continued to speak in a voice of freezing quietness . " Pray , resume your seat . It is sheer waste of time to lose your temper with me . Either I must speak candidly to you , or there is an end to our intercourse . " " Yes-candidly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chair , and , after giving it a very ill-tempered fling upon the ground , throwing myself into it . " How foolish it is in you to exhibit this humor to me , " he resumed after a short pause . *I imagine I have a right to speak to you exactly what I think , and that the interest I have taken in your concerns ought to protect me from the suspicion of desiring to insult you . Were it my cue to insult you , it is not in this affair I should look for the grounds of quarrel . But let that pass . I have seen the man whom you ha e made your mortal enemy , and have endeavored to prevail upon him to break the marriage . I have failed . " " Failed ? How ? Why ? What does he say ? He is a fiend " Strange that he should have just the same opinion of you . Beelzebub is rather a respectable and virtuous person in his estimation coinpared with you . Just possible both may be right I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as if he were determined to lacc ; ate my feelings and lay them bare ; and yet there was a certain eccentric kindness under this rough treatment , which helped to reconcile me to it . At all events , I was bound to endure it ; I knew that if I outraged him by any show of distrust ot violence , his lips would be closed forever . I felt , , too , that I had given him some provocation in the first instance by the temper I had betrayed ; and that the fault was at least as much mine as his . " Well , " I cried , " you must forgive me , Forrester , if I am a little chafed and galled , and , as you say , soured . Circumstances have pressed hardly upon me . Remember how long I have been shut out from communication with society  --  and the state of anxiety and suspense in which I have lived . You must make allowances fir me . " " Exactly . I must make allowances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , who has gone through sufferings a hundred-fold more acute , which you have inflicted upon him , what kind of response do I receive ? No matter . I do make allowances for you . If you are not entirely absorbed by selfish considerations you // will endeavor to comprehend the wrong you have committed , and do what you can to avoid making it worse . " " Wrong Premeditated wrong I never will admit . My conscience is clear of that . But I will not argue with you . What would you have me " Leave the country . You have no other alternative . " " What Fly from this demon , who first tempted me , and who now wants to triumph over my ruin i " " You say your conscience is clear of wrong . You have a happy conscience . But it deceives you . It is true , that when you first knew Astrna , you were ignorant of his rights ; but you were not ignorant of them when he found you together and claimed her . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was yet time to save her , yourself , and him . How did you act , then If we are to discuss this matter with any hope of arriving at a rational conclusion , you must rid yourself of the flattering deception that you have been doing no wrong . We are not children , but grown-up men and responsible agents . " " Well , I put myself in your hands . But that I should become an exile because this man chooses to pursue me with vindictive feelings , does seem something monstrous . " " From your point of sight , I dare say it does . Just change places with him . A man who desires to decide justly will always endeavor to look at both sides of a question . Put yourself in his position . He loves this woman . I am iatisfied he loves her more truly and tenderly , and less selfishly now than he ever loved her from the beginning . You sneer at th' t . You do not credit the possibility of such a thing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man loves as you do-that there is a leaven of earth in other men which mixes with their devotion and corrupts it . You have nursed this creed all your life , and it has grown with your rowth . You alone are pure and spiritual . I remember you had that notion once before . I remember how you exalted yourself on the intensity and endurance of your passion . Surely by this time you should have outlived that delusion ; for even then you might have seen men with hearts as- But I am wandering from the subject . " " I understand you . I was young , superstitious , ignorant- " " I will speak plainly . You are not capable of a great devotion . Your character is not strong enough . You have none of the elements of power necessary to the maintenance of the martyrdom of love . In a nature constituted like yours , passion burns up fiercely , and goes out suddenly . I have heard you say-some years gone by ! - that you were consuixied by a love which would end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved , too ; but I vailed my eyes , and spoke not , as the coffin which cont* med all I cherished in the world was lowered into the grave . Hope-affection  --  the desire of life , were buried with it . You see me now wasted , haggard , solitary , a wreck upon the waters . And you I find you plunged into the ecstasies of a new passion . And what of the old one l Where are the traces of it now Some men can not live except in this condition of excitement . You are one of them . But do not deceive yourself into the belief that others have not hearts , because they do not show them in spasms such as these . Do not despise the faithful agonies even of the dwarf ! " I felt the severe justice of the reproach less in Forresters words than in his pallid face , and the pangs he struggled to conceal . I was even secretly compelled to admit that there was a miserable truth in what he said about Mephistophiles ; yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of any sympathy in the sufferings of a man who seemed to have directed his whole energies to the pursuit of an insane and unprofitable vengeance . " The portrait is not flattering , " I observed . " But why do you thus put me on the rack What has all this to do with the matter that has brought us together V " It has every thing to do with it . The instability of your character  --  the certainty of re morse and disappointment , passion sated and exhausted , romance broken up , and nothing leli but mutual reproaches , which will not be the less bitter because they may not find expression in words  --  the certainty that such is the fate to which Astrisa is doomed under your protection , justifies me in laying before you those secrets of your nature which , without the help of some friendly monitor like me , you would never be able to discover. ** This was said in a tone of sarcasm . No man knows hiriself . With much modesty and humility in sinme things ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve ) , I had always overrated myself in others . I had a strong faith in my own constancy of purpose in the steadfastness of my principles and feelings . But it was true that I was self-deceived , if Forrester and Astrisa had read my character accurately . Their agreement was something wonderful . They used almost the very same words in describing the points on which my strength was likely to break down . I was beginning to fear that they were right ; but I owed a grave responsibility to Astr a , and could not yet be brought to admit , even to myself , that it was possible I should fail in it . " You judge from the rest of the world , and not from me , Forrester , " I replied . " But granted that it is as you say , how can that mend the business Believe me , you are ignorant of Astrisa 's character and mine . No matter-let that pass . Suppose we should hereafter find our lives wearisome and joyless , may we , not justly trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to redeem ourselves . " " Is your redemption , lmy the strength of youx own efforts , so sure , then ? Neither he whom // qwq can see nothing , in him but the evil which you have helped to nourish ; his sacrifices and ma ,  - -  nanimity are all darkness to you . " " I will listen no longer , " I said , starting up from my chair . " I see distinctly what is before me . Old friends fall from us in our adversities . Well ! new ones must be made . It is some comfort that the world is wide enough for us all , and that the loss , even of such a friend as you , is not irreparable . " " H-rn ! a successful epitome of your creed and character ! You can cast old affections and memories from you with as little emotion as a bird moults its feathers ; and having got rid of one set of sensations , you can begin again , and so go on , destroying and renewing , and still thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh indulgences . " " I will endure no more of this , " I exclaimed , seizin* my hat and going toward the door ; " let us part , before I forget the ties that once bound is together . " " Forget them V he echoed , and his face grew ghastly pale ; but , forcibly controlling his agitation , he went on , in a low voice : " Have you not forgotten them already Have you not shaken them off like dust from your feet Ay , let us part ; I am unfit to be your friend or companion . Leave me to mate with him you have bereaved , and whose heart is desolate like mine ! There , at least , I shall find a community of feeliug on one point  --  the blight which we both owe to you . Go ! Leave me-no words-no words Had I spoken it would have been angrily . But although my pride was wounded , and I was hit*erly mortified and disappointed at the result of a meeting , which , instead of alleviating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt that it would have been barbarous at that moment , had I given way to my own feelings . I stood and gazed upon him in silence while I held the halfopened door in my hand . The old feeling was all at once reviyed , and as be buried his head in his broad , shapeless bands , and bent over the table , the night when he related to me the singular history . with which he prefaced the introduction to Gertrude , came back upon me with all its agonies and terrors as freshly as if but afew weeks , instead of long and checkered years , had elapsed in the interval . His great anguish on that occasion , and the grandeur of the sacrifice he made to what he hoped would have been the foundation of the life-long happiness of her he loved , returned with painful distinctness . He was changed in nothing since , except in the haggard expression of his face and figure . His heart-his strong , manly heartwas still the same . His affections were in the grave with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been thrown into trying circumstances , and doubtless , like other men , had been exposed to many temptations , yet he had never swerved from his early attachment , and had brought back with him from his wanderings the same truthfulness and the same sorrow he had carried with him into exile . How strange it was that he , of all men , should be cast by the force of accidental occurrences into close communion with the dwarf ! that the only men on earth who in the depths of their hearts could-whether justly or unjustly , mattered little-find a cause for hating and denouncing me , should bc drawn together , not by any sympathy of their own , but by a common resentment against me ! these two men , so utterly unlike each other in every thing else , whose natures were as widely different and opposed as night and day ! And then in the midst of this rose up the memory of Gertrude , of whom I could recollect nothing but a macilent figure , stretched upon a sofa and scarcely breathing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reproach , and the gloom that had settled on the opening of my life , making all the rest wayward , fantastical , and unreasoning . I paused at the door , looked for the last time on Forrester , and noiselessly leaving the room , descended the stairs . In the next moment I was out again on the bleak heath . v. On my return , I found Astriea pacing up and down the room in a state of nervous irritation at my long absence . Her usual self-command was broken down . The grace and dignity that once imparted to her an aspect of calmness and power , were gone . Isolation was doing its work upon her ! Isolation and the feeling of banishment and disgrace which we struggled with darkly in our minds , but which were slowly and surely destroying our confidence in ourselves , and our trust in the future . She was impatient to hear what I had to relate to her , yet was so ruffled by it , that she constantly interrupted me by exclamations of scorn and anger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dwarf , which I stated simply , without colorin , , , or comment , affected her differently . She looked at me in silence , as I slowly repeated the words of Forrester , her lips trembled slightly , and a faint flush spread over her face and forehead . There was a great conflict going on , and I could see that her strength was unequal to it . Gradually the flush deepened , and tears sprang into her eyes . I shall never forget it ! A sob broke from her , and crushing up her face in her outspread hands with a wildness that almost terrified me , she ex-claimed : " I never was humiliated till now ! never till now ! till now ! 0 God ! what have I done that this bitterness should come upon me 3 " " Astrna ! for Heaven 's sake do not give wam to these violent emotions . After all , what does it come to ' ! " She threw back her head with an expresoion of fierce reproach in her eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are safe , free , unscathed ; but I-I-arid this is what women suffer whc sacridee themselves as I have done " Come , you are nervous and desponding , Astrrea . Why do you talk of suffering ' ! N* // body has the power to inflict suffering upon you now. , , " It is idle-idle-idle ! " she answered , moving to and fro ; " you can not comprehend it . Men have no sense of these things . Happy for them it is so . I believe you mean all in kindness-I believe your manhood , your pride would not allow you to see me unprotected , lost , degraded so early ! No ! do n't speak ! Let me go on . lie makes a condition that I should leave youthat I should violate the most solemn obligation of my life , and proclaim myself that which my soul recoils from , and my lips dare not utter ; then , when I shall have damned myself , he will protect me ! With a forbearance , for which I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants-take care that I am fed and housed ; and having secured my dependence on him , and broken my rebellious heart , he will take infinite credit to himself for the delicacy and ma*nanimity with which he has treated me . Oh man-man ! how little you know our natures , and how superior we are to you , even in our degradation ! I ask you , in what li0ht must he regard me who could presume to make such a proposition And in what light should I deserve to be regarded if I accepted it ! " " It is quite true , Astrraa . I feel the whole force of your observations . The proposition is an insult . " " Thank you-thank you , for that word ! " she exclaimed , throwing herself into my arms , and bursting into a flood of tears . " There is something yet left to cling to . Thank God , I am not yet so lost but that you should feel it to be an insult to me . It is something not to be yet quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , folding her tenderly in my arms , " compose yourself , and trust to me . We must trust to each other . There-there-dear Astrna " What a wretch should I be , " she replied , " if this were all-if it were for this I forfeited every thing ; no , no , you do n't think so . It is my last hold-self-respect !  --  and it is in your keeping . For you I gave up all  --  and would have given up life itself-it would be hard if I should perish in my sin by his hands for whom I sinned ! " Then releasing herself from me , she grasped my arm , and looking earnestly into my face , she demanded , " And what answer did you give to this proposal * " " Why , what answer should I give , but that I knew you would spurn it * " " That was right ! " she cried ; " right-manly - honest . We must let him know that I am not the defenseless outcast he supposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad as proudly in the open day as he or his . His vengeance What have we to fear Let us cast the shame from us and show ourselves to the world . We make our own disgrace by hiding and flying from our friends . You see how our forbearance has been appreciated , and what a i*haritable construction has been put upon our conduct . We owe it to ourselves to vindicate ourselves . I will endure those dismal whispers that carry a blight in every word no longer . I would rather die ! Come-let us decide ozu*e. and forever our future course ! " These were brave words , and bravely uttered . Toward the close , Astrsea had regained much of her original power ; the strength of purpose and towering will , which I remembered so well in former days , and which gave so elevated a character to her beauty , came back once more , and lighted up her fine features . It was late ; but what were hours to us Day or night made little difference . We had no objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day-it was immaterial whether we retired or sat up ; and so in this listless mode of life we always followed the in*-mediate impulse , whatever it might be . When we found ourselves weary , we betook ourselves to repose ; when we felt inclined to talk and maunder over the fire , we never troubled ourselves to ask what o'clock it was . In short , time had no place in our calendar , which was governed , not by the revolutions of the earth , but by our own moods and sensations . We discussed a great question that night . No theme before a debating club-such as the choice between Pe*ce and War , between Society or Solitude or any of those grand abstract antitheses that agitate nations-was ever more completely exhausted in all its details than the question-Whether we should leave England , or remain at home , and go boldly into public , with the determination to live down the persecutions of the dwarf . It was a question of life or death with us . We both felt that any fate would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned . We pined for human faces and human voices . We were sick at heart of eternal loneliness . We longed for free intercourse with educated people like Ourselves , who would sympathize with our intellectual wants , and talk to us in our own language . We had arrived at the discovery that the solitude we had colored so bri , *htly in those happy hours of romance which love takes such pains in filling up with delusions . would be rendered much more agreeable by an occasional variety , or an incidental shock from without-any thing that would stir the pulses and awaken the life-blood that was growing stagnant in our veins . We were not weary of each other ; on the contrary , anxiety had brought our hearts more closely together ; but we had drunk all the light out each other 's eyes , and our aspects were becoming wan and passionless from lack o* change and movement ; we yearned for the presence even of strangers , to break up the dullness and uniformity , and make us feel that we had an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet as it was in seclusion , was sweeter still as a bond that linked us to the great family , from which in our desolate retreat we felt ourselves entirely cut off . I need not detail the arguments by which our // final resolution was determined . To go abroad , *nd embrace a voluntary banishment , would have looked like an admission of guilt , which Asti*iea persisted in repudiating . Whatever verdict society might choose to pronounce , Astriea would be governed only by her own . Her justice adapted itself expressly to the occasion , setting aside the larger views which laws designed for the general security must include . But such is woman 's logic ever -circumstantially sensitive , clear , and narrow ! Her voice was for war . I had no motive for opposing her ; my pride agreed with her-my reason took the other side ; but , in reality , I saw no great choice either way . I knew , or felt , that society would never be reconciled to us . Men have instincts on such points ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called natural law , never can see these things in the same light . This was a matter I could not argue with Astrna . I merely told her that in our anomalous situation , we must not look for much sympathy or consideration ; that , in fact , I had known similar cases ( perhaps not quite so peculiar , but that made no difference in the eyes of society ) , and that the issue of the struggle to get back always ended in increased humiliation ; yet I was , nevertheless , ready to adopt any plan of life that would satisfy her feelings . I was bound to think of that first , and perfectly willing to take chance for the rest . It was settled at last , at the close of our long council , that we should adopt a sort of middle course ; and before we returned to London , which we now fully resolved to do at the opening of the season , we projected a visit to Brighton , and one or two other places on the coast . vi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reasoning faculties of man ! We are the most inconsistent of all creatures ; we are perpetually contradicting ourselves , perpetually involved in anomalies of our own making . It is impossible to reconcile half the things we do with the exercise of that reason which we boast of as the grand distinction that elevates us above the horse , the dog , the elephant . We never find any of these animals doing unaccountable things , or practically compromising their sagacity . For my part , looking back on my life , I feel that it is full of contradictions , which , although apparent to me now , were not so in the whirl of agitation out of which they sur*ed . Here , for example , after a flight from the world , and nearly six months ' burial in the severest solitude , behold us on a sudden in the midst of the gay crowds of Brighton . The transition is something startling . It was so to us at the time ; and I confess that at this distance from the excitement which led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of signal temerity , considering the circumstances in which we were placed . Astrwa 's spirits grew lighter ; she cast off her gloom and reserve , and surrendered herself to the full tide of human enjoyment in which we were now floating . Whatever might have been he terror or misgiving at either of our hearts , we did not show it in our looks . We wore a mask to each other  --  a mask of kindness , each desiring to conceal the secret pang , and to convey to the other a notion that all was at peace within ! We were mutually conscious of the well-meant deception , but thought it wiser and more generous on both sides to affect entire confidence in the gayety we assumed ! Upon this hollow foundation we set about building the superstructure of our future lives . We had a cheerful lodging facing the searather a handsome and extravagant lodging ; for being intent , upon our project of asserting ourselves in the eyes of the world , we resolved to test any friends we might happen to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a respectable widow , was one of the most civil and obliging persons in the world . Her whole establishment was at our disposal , and she never could do too much to make us feel perfectly at our ease . Emerging as we had just done from utter loneliness , with a strong fear that the hand of the world was against us , all this attention and kindness touched us deeply . Slight an in cident as it was , it made us think better of our species , and look forward more hopefully for our* selves . There was yet something to live for ! There always is , if we will only suffer our hearts to explore for us , and find it out . Any person who has moved much in the London circles is sure to find a numerous acquaintance at Brighton . We met several people we had known in the great maelstrom of the Virest End . It was pleasant to us to exchange salutes with them . It was like coming back after a long voyage , and finding one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were intimate with none of these people ; and as our knowledge of them did not justify more than a passing recognition , which was generally very cordial on both sides , we used to return from our drive every day , exulting in the success of our experiment upon society . The world , after all , was not so bad as we supposed . One day , sauntering on the sands , Astrna saw a lady at a distance whose figure seemed to be familiar to her . She was an old schoolfellow of hers , who had been recently married . They flew into each other 's arms . The meeting , indeed , was marked by such affectionate interest on the part of the lady , who was a stranger to me , that I apprehended she was entirely ignorant of our story . Almost the first question that passed between them determined that fact ; and as they had a great deal of news to communicate to each other , it was arranged between them that they should meet the next morning for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away half the day . She returned to me full of glee . Her friend had listened to her history with the deepest interest , and entirely agreed with her that she could not have acted otherwise , adopting , at the same time , without hesitation , Astrmea 's opinion of the sanctity of our union . It was not our fault that we had not been married in a church // and this generous lady , seeing the embarrassment of our situation , enthusiastically declared that the world might take its own course , but that she , at least , would never abandon a friend under such circumstances . This was very cheering . I must remark , however , that this lady was several years younger than Astram , under whose protection she had been taken at school , where Astrna had been a resident for convenience , rather than a pupil , when she entered it . In this way their attachment originated . It would have been difficult for any young person to have been placed in such close and endearing intimacy with Astrna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She always inspired that sort of feeling  --  a deep and passionate love , great admiration of her intellect , implicit respect for her judgment . In the eyes of her schoolfellow she was the model of all human excellence . As easily would she have believed in an error of the planetary system , as that Astrrea could commit an aberration of any kind . Whatever Astrrea did , appeared to her unimpeachable . A feeling of veneration like this carried away from school will stand many severe shocks in the mind of a true-hearted girl before it will give way . This was all very well so far as the lady herself was concerned ; but how could we answer for the view her husband might take of the matter She volunteered in the most courageous way to take all that upon herself . She could a:iswer for her husband . She was very young . and very pretty , and very giddy , and only just married , and her husband never denied her any thing , and she ruled him with as queenly an influence as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor did she reckon without her host , as the event proved . Her husband , in the most good-humored way , fell into her view of the case . He was one of those easy-natured souls who , when they marry school-girls , feel themselves called upon to marry the whole school , and to take its romps , and its vows , and its bridesmaid pledges , to heart and home along with their wives . He had heard her speak of Astrna a thousand times , and professed to be very curious to see her ; and so it was arranged that we should all meet , and make the merriest double-bridal party in the universe . The reunion was curious between these open-hearted , innocent young people , with their track of bright flowers before them , and those who sat opposite to them , with a terrible conviction that the path which lay before them was covered with ashes . Our new friends had a large acquaintance at Brighton , and saw a great deal of company ; yet they were always glad to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . Her husband entered into our meetings with an ease and friendliness that were quite charming . lie was an indolent man , taking no trouble to look after pleasure , but ready to be pleased in a passive way with any thing that other people enjoyed . As for his wife , she was always in the highest spirits with Astr*a . The chatter they made together was quite an ecstasy . It seemed as if there was no end to the things they had te talk about . Poor Astraia had been shut up fron ! her own sex so long , that the delight with which the companionship of this young creature inspired her appeared to me extremely pathetic and affecting . One morning we were walking on the Parade as usual . Among the carriages that were flying about , we recognized the open phaeton of our friends . It passed quite close to us-so close that we could have shaken hands with them as they swept by . We expected that they would have stopped as usual , and we stood and put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hasty bow from the lady , and then her head was quickly turned aside , as if something had suddenly attracted her attention . Astrna looked at me , and asked me what I thought of it ? I evaded her question , by saying that they had other friends , and that we must not be too exigcant . Astrna made no remark , but merely shook her head and walked on . In the afternoon we met them again . There was a gay crowd of people walking , and our friends , in the midst of a group , were coming up toward us . There was no possibility , at either side , of avoiding the meeting , for the place was narrow , and we were compelled to pass each other slowly . I could perceive , from the way in which Astrna 's cheeks kindled , that she was resolved to put her schoolfellow 's friendship to the proof at once . I anticipated the result , but thought it best not to interfere , lest Astrs*a might suppose I shrank from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew very white , and then red , and then white again , and caught her husband by the arm , and moved her lips as if she wished to appear to be speaking to him , although she did riot utter a word . Astrna looked full into her eyes . Had the young wife seen a spectre from the grave , she could not have been more effectually paralyzed . That look seemed to turn her to stone . Not a single expression of greeting took place between them . Upon the husband 's part , the feeling was even less equivocal . There was a dark , scowling frown upon his face as we came up ; he looked straight at us  --  and walked on . These insouciant men , who take the world so indifferently on ordinary occasions , are always the most fierce when roused . They hate the trouble of being obliged to act with decision , and when compelled to do so , they cut it short by an energetic demonstration , that they may fall back the sooner upon their habitual lassitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our position . Galled as I was on my own account , I felt it a hundred times more acutely on account of Astrwa . Here was her young friend and enthusiastic disciple , who had always looked up to her with confidence and admiration , who had heard her story , and clung all the more lovingly and protectingly to her in pity for the unhappy circumstances in which she was place it , and this friend had now abandoned and disows *d her  --  a blow under which some women would // tiave sunk at once , and which would have made others recklevs and desperate . Upon Astrien it acted slowly and painfully . Externally it did not seem to affect her much ; but I could perceive from that time a tendency to lapse into fits of silence , and a desire to be alone , which I had not noticed before . Whenever she alluded to lxcr friend , she spoke of her as a weak person , who had never been remarkable for much character , with a kind heart and no understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her inconsistency on this occasion to the influence of her husband , we agreed to dismiss the subject-not from our thoughts , that was impossible  --  but from our conversation . Astrnea was bruised and hurt ; and through all her efforts to conceal it , I saw that she suffered severely . it was the first touch she had directly experienced of the ice of the world 's contumely , and it had struck in upon her heart . A few days passed away , and we were reconciling ourselves by daily practice to the personal humiliation of passing and being passed in the streets by the friends with whom we had been recently on terms of absolutely hilarious alliance ; vvheni , on one occasion , on returning to our solitary lodging , we were received at the door by our obliging landlady in a manner which plainly showed that her opinion of us had undergone a most singular change during our absence . Her quiet , sleepy eyes scintillated with anger ; her face was hot with excitement , and instead of the civility she had hitherto invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tirade which I will spare the reader the unpleasantness of hearing : there can be no difficulty in guessing what it as all about . This worthy woman had heard our history-falsified in detail , and blackened by the most venomous exaggeration ; and being a very pure lodging-house keeper , standing upon the whiteness of her morals and her caps , and trusting much to the patronage of the rector , who allowed her to refer to him for the proprieties and respectabilities of her establishment , she thought that the best way to vindicate her own reputation was to assail 5urs in the most open and public manner . Accordingly , she took care that every word she said should be overheard by every body vvithin reach , so that the whole neighborhood should know of her indignation , and report it to her friend the rector . There never was such a change in a woman ; it was a saint turned into a demon . I demanded her authority for the injurious aspersions she cast upon us , and threatened her with a variety of tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no effect . She desired us to leave the house , and take our remedy ; she vvculd give us no satisfaction ; she had good grounds for what she said ; that was enough for her ; she knew what " kind " we were ; and a great deal more to the same purpose . We were deeply ao*rieved at discovering that our private affairs were talked of in this scandalous way . As to the vulgar violence of this woman , we thought no more of it after the imVo1 , . 111. - No. 15. -Z mediate irritation of her assault on us was over . It was one of those coarse incidents , which , like striking against an awkward person in the sti eets , happen to us all in life , and are forgotten with the momentary annoyance . But these reports of our situation being afloat , rendered it impossible to remain in Brighton ; so that very night we moved down the coast to Worthing . Jn this dull little watering-place , where the people always seem bent on avoiding each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was late when we arrived , and we put up at the hotel , which , like every thing else in Worthing , has an air of languor and idleness about it . We liked the tone of the house . An eternal twilight brooded over the rooms and passages . Every chamber was occupied , yet the place was as still as a church . If you heard a footstep , it went stealthily as if it were muffled , or " shod with felt ; " and the only signs of life you caught from the adjoining apartments , were when some noiseless lady in a morning dress glided into the balcony , and after a side-long look at the sea , glided back again . Out of doors , the order of the day was vigorous promenading , but even this was conducted almost speechlessly , except when a friendly group happened to collect and stop short , and then you could hear an occasional joke and burst of laughter . The promenade was the grand thing . It was not sauntering for relaxation , but brisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirits . In the course of a week , we came to know every face in Worthing by the introduction which this lusty amusement afforded us , and every body in *ATorthing knew our faces . SAfe were all out at a given hour , tramping up and down at a swinging pace , and passing and repassing each other so often , that we were as familiar with the whole guest population of the place , arid the whole guest population with us , as if we had known each other all our lives . Every body had acquaintances there except ourselves . We could see them making up little parties for excursions , soiries , and other amusements ; trifles that aniused us as lookers-on , but , nevertheless , made us feel our loneliness . We were in the crowd , but not of it . Yet it was better to be in the open air among stramigers than to dwell in the desert . But it was not to be . Our story followed us . We began to perceive , after a little time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to turn and look after us . This was the first hint we received of what was now becoming rather an alarming fact to us-that we were known . To be known wi h us , was to be shunned , or impertinently gazed at , as if we were either great criniinals , or notorieties of no very respectable order . At last , it became difficult for us to walk about , from the universality of the notice we attracted ; and at the hotel there was no possibility of mistaking the nature of the curiosity , not of the most respectful kind , which tracked us up th stairs and down the stairs , and penetrated even to our rooms , in the person of a sinister-looki waiter , who had the oddest c&amp;rn // ceivable way of looking at us out of the corner of one eye , which he pursed up and concentrated into a focus expressly for the purpose . This sort of persecution was wearing us out . It was like water dropped , drop by drop , upon a stone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no escaping it ; and I began to suspect that there must be some mark upon us by which we were known and detected . I believe there is more truth in this than most people imagine . The habit of evasion and reserve , the apprehension of being watched , and the secret consciousness of having something to conceal , doubtless give an expression to one 's entire action and physiognomy which is likely to suggest unfavorable speculations . The world is apt to think ill of the man who does not look it straight in the face ; and , upon the whole , perhaps the world is right . This doom pursued us wherever we went . We tried two or three other places on the coast with the same result . Within a week we were sure to be found out , and avoided or gazed at . The sight of human beings enjoying themselves , and the right of looking on at them , were dearly purchased at such a price as this . Our spirits were beginning to give way under it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we daily endured , that when we got into strange quarters , where we were as yet unknown , we fancied that all eyes were upon us . A little more of this sort of racking suspicion , mixed with fear and rage , and I think I should have ( rone mad . Astrisa bore it more heroically . She was tolerr Ay calm , and used to smile while I was glowover with and er . I frequently felt inclined to rush upon some of the people who stared at us , and demand of them what they meant ; but Astrrea always checked me , and reminded me , that in these small watering-places scandal was the entire occupation-that the visitors had , in fact , nothing else to do all day long ; and that if every person who was tormented by their vicious curiosity were to indulge in resentment , threefourths of the time of the community would be wasted in endeavoring to patch up the reputations that had been torn to bits in the remaining fourth . Notwithstanding the courage with which she set herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sides , and the light , yet earnest and fearful way she talked about it , her health was rapidly declining . Her color was gone . She was growing thin ; there was a slight cough hovering upon her nerves ; and she had become so fanciful , that she could not bear to go out in the dusk of the evenings , although that was the only time when we could walk out at our ease . These changes brought others . Her temper was altered ; she tried to subjugate herself , but could not ; a notion seemed to have taken possession of her that she was a weight upon me , and that the necessity of sharing disgrace and xclusion with her was preying upon my mind . In the first few months she was jealous of every hour I was absent from her , and used to consider it a slight , and a proof that I was becoming weary of her . Then all was new , and the gloss cf novelty and enthusiasm was yet upon her feelings Now it was totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was all for me . The dream of love had been dreamed out , and she had ceased to regard herself as the object of a devotion which was ready to incur shame and suffering for her sake . She had seen that delusion to an end ; and , having a real fear that , being pent up continually with her , contracting the man 's activity within the sphere of the woman 's limited range , would make our way of life hateful to me at last , she now used to urge me to go out for long w'dks in the country , or to visit the reading-rooms , and keep myself an courant with the events of the day . Exercise , mental and physical , was healthful for me , and she would not have me moped to death in the house . For her own part , she would say to me , she rather liked having a little time *o herself ; a woman has always something to do , and is never at a loss for occupation ; and while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-she was so busy ! These professions and entreaties were kindly and judiciously meant , but the difficulty was to act upon them . She could not endure solitude . She always dreaded to be left alone , and , only that it was a greater dread to her to make a prisoner of me at the risk of rendering my existence wretched , nothing could have induced her to go through the hours of misery she suffered in my absence . This conflict made hei temper unequal and sometimes unreasonable ; but in such a situation , what else could be ex* pected We were haunted by shadows that were forever falling about our path ; move whert we would , these dark phantoms pursued us . Our lives were not like the lives of other people : we had no kindred , no associations , no stir in the sad stagnation of day and night . Time seemed to be mantling over us , and the breath of heaven to be becoming less and less perceptible in our dreariness . Astrun was like a person who was dying from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to my help , I felt it no easy task to lift myself out of the dismal depression which occasionally seized upon me . At last we agreed that our scheme of traveling about had disappointed our expectations , and that , after all , London was the best of all places for people who sought either of the extremes of society or seclusion . A.nd so to London we forthwith repaired . vii . The heart of the town , or the suburbs The question was speedily decided in favor of a small detached house , not very far from the Regent 's Park . We had the whole park for a pleasureground , a little scrap of verdure of our own , and an open space and airy situation to regale our lungs in . We entered upon our new locality with sensations of security we had felt nowhere else . We seemed to have left behind us the // PHANTOMS AND REALiTIES . gloom and terror that had been so long dogging our footsteps . Even Astriea brightened , and grew better ; her fretfulness was disappearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We were each of us more free in our movements , and the dread of observation which had so long kept us in a state of perpetual alarm , was gradually passing away . But what had become all this time of the vengeance of the dwarf* Had he abandoned his great plan of revenge Had he thought better of it , and , finding that Astrna was imniovable , addressed himself to some more sensible pursuit than that of plaguing us I sometimes touched upon the subject to Astrica , but could not extract from her what her suspicions were . She did not like to talk about him . She seemed to ba ruled by a superstitious fear of reviving the topic . It was like the old wives adage , " Talk of the devil , and hell appear ! " I can not exactly remember how long this lasted , or when it was that I first detected in Astraaa the return of the nervousness which had in some degree abated upon our arrival in town . It could not , however , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house . that I observed a striking change in her . Haggard lines seemed all of a sudden to have been plowed round her eyes and cheeks , and her look had become wild and unsettled . I never saw any body so completely shattered in so short a time , and the transition from comparative tranquillity to a state of excessive nervous excitement was so alarming , that I thought there must have been some cause for it beyond that of mere physical illness . I questioned her upon it , but always got the same unsatisfactory answers , ending by entreating of me not to notice her , but to let her go on in her own way . I can not recall what there was about her manner-some strangeness in the way she looked at me or spoke to me-that aroused the most painful suspicions . I confess I did not know what to suspect ; but there was a mental reservation of some kind , and I was resolved to ascertain what it was . I had the utmost confidence in Astrica ; love with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved me sincerely-at least , she had loved me enthusiastically in the beginning . What revolutions had since taken place in her heart , I could not answer for . She had passed through a chaos in the interval that might have destroyed the capacity of loving . That there was something more in her thoughts than she had revealed , I felt sure ; and the first shape my suspicions took-natural enough in our circumstances , although not the more just on that account-was a shape of jealousy . My alarm immediately flew to the defense of my pride or , as Forrester in his cauterizing way would have called it , my selfishness ; I resolved to observe her closely , and I did so some time without being able to glean any thing further . At last the secret of her wasting frame and pallid face was suddenly divulged . One evening , toward the close of the summer . she remained out longer and later than usual . Her walk , sometimes alone and sometimes with me , was through the more secluded parts of the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had not returned . With a dark awl sulky apprehension brooding in my mind , I resolved to go out in search of her . We had not been confidential with each other of late ; the old dreariness had come back upon us , embittered with a captiousness and acerbity which extracted all the sweets from our intercourse . A new element had found its way between us : we had thoughts which we concealed from each other : my distrust-her secret , whatever it was . This was a great evil ; it filled every hour of the day with lurking jealousies on both sides , which one word would have dispelled forever . I seized my hat , and was about to leave the house , when I heard a sudden noise at the streetdoor , and a flurry of agitated steps up the stairs . Immediately afterward , the door of the room was thrown violently open , and Astrica rushed in , pale and disheveled . She was evidently in a state of great alarm and consternation , and turning wildly round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could not speak , drawing her breath hysterically , like a person laboring under the effects of a serious fright . " Tranquilize yourself , Astraaa , " I cried ; " there is nothing to fear here . What is it 1 What has alarmed you W " It is he , " she replied , fixing her eyes wildly upon me- " he is coming . " " Who * " " He who has been upon our track ever and ever-who has never quitted us-who never will leave us till we are dead . " I did not dare to ask in words , but I asked with my eyes if it was the dwarf she meant . " Ay , it is he . Be calm . It is your turn now to show your strength of mind  --  to show whether you value the life I have devoted to you . I hoped to have concealed this from you . We have suf. fered enough , and I hoped to have hidden from you what I have suffered . But it is too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do not hear it-I do ! It rings through and through my brain . He is here-he has followed me . If you ever loved me  --  and I know you did once - prove it to me now . Go into the next room , and promise inc to stay there whatever happens . Listen ; but speak not-stir not . He is on the stairs - will you not give me your promise Trust all to me-rely on me-be sure of me . Let go the door-he is here ! " I made no answer , but conveying to Astrisa by a searching look that it was my purpose to watch the issue , I withdrew by one door , while the dwarf entered by the other . His voice , as he approached her , sounded in my ears like the hiss of a serpent . " 1 have found you , then , at last  --  and alone , Astrica ! " " Why do you follow me thus * " exclaimed .. strna , who stooil niotionless in the centre of // tire room , making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neath . ing in every fibre be " Why do I follow you What should I do else 3 " " Live like other men . Seek occupationany thing , rather than plunge your own life and mine into this eternal horror . " " Have I not occupation Am I not attending you every where Have I not enough to do in waiting upon you from place to place 3 " " Abandon that fiendish mockery , and speak like a human being . What is it you want 3 " The dwarf coiled himself up at this question , as if he were distilling all the venom out of his black heart into the answer . " Revenge ! It was for my revenge I hung upon your track , showed myself to you at all times and in all places , letting you know that the destroyer was at hand , so that you might go home and blast iris happiness by your broken spirits and shattered nerves . I have seen it work ; I see it now , in your quivering lip and emaciated hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the secret blisses 3 " Here , then , was poor Astruas secret ! The monster had been upon her steps wherever we went ; and , as I afterward learned , used to start up suddenly before her in her solitary walks , to terrify her with threats of sleepless vengeance , knowing that her fear of consequences would prevent her from revealing to me the persecution under which she was sinking . This ghastly pur " uit of us ( to which we were also indebted for the scorn and obloquy we suffered ) had gradually broken up Astruas health , and made the strong mind almost weak and superstitious . But I must hasten on . " And this , " cried Astrna , " is the generosity I was to have received at your hands-this the magnanimity your friend gave you credit for " There was a condition to my magnanimity which you have forgotten . Had you fulfilled that condition , I would have poured out my hearts blood at your feet ; could it have made you more secure and happy . Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T No ; you clung to him . You maddened me , and left me nothing but-revenge . Did you suppose he could escape me I have no other life but this  --  to follow you as the executioner follows the condemned to the scaffold , and make Iris life a curse to him , as he has made mine to me . There 's justice in that-call it cruel , if you please ; t is just-just-just " T is monstrous , and will draw down the punishment of Heaven on your head . " " Heaven will judge strictly between us . What am I What have I to live for You have poisoned the earth for me . Every spot where we have been together is accursed to me . I dare not look on the old haunts . I dare not seek new scenes , for my soul is lonely , and no pleasure or delight of nature can reach it . I should go mad were I not near you ; it supplies me with work-something to employ me  --  to keep my hands from self-destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time all day , day aftet day , patiently , to execute them . I have but one purpose to fulfill , and when that is done , life is over . If I live long enough to drive him mad as he has maddened me , I shall be content , and go to my grave happy . And I will do it ; every hour gives me more strength . I see the end nearer and nearer-it grows upon me . I awaken to my business early ; it is my first thoughtmy last ; it never leaves me . Day after day I have watched you , and have tracked you borne at last . And here it is you live-you , Astrna , whom I loved-whom I still-no , not that ! You live here with him-his wife ! You call yourself his wife ? Ha ! ha ! That is good-his wife ! I wonder to see you living , Astrna . I should have looked for your corpse in this room rather than the living Astrara  --  the proud , soaring , ambitious Astrisa ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you 3 " During the latter part of this speech , Astrara , who had made a great struggle throughout to sustain the attitude she had " taken " in the first instance , grew weak from terror and exhaustion , and sunk or tottered upon a chair . The inflections of voice with which these inhuman taunts were delivered , ending in a tone that came apparently , if I may so express it , laden with tears from the heart of the speaker , were so ingeniously varied and so skillfully employed , that it would have been impossible , even for an indifferent listener , to have heard them without being alternately agitated arid enraged . For my part , a kind of frenzy possessed me . I restrained myself as long as I could . I tried to obey poor Astrara 's injunction , for , seeing how much I had wronged her in my thoughts , and what misery she must have suffered and concealed on my account , I felt that I ought to spare her any further alarm my forbearance could avert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance-my self-control gave way at last , and bursting open the door of the room in which I was concealed , I rushed out upon the malignant wretch , who , to do him justice , courageously turned upon me , and met me with his eyes glaring fiercely as of old . " Devil ! " I exclaimed , " what do you do here ? What do you want Revenge ? Take it-in any shape you will . Only rid me of your presence , lest I spurn you with my foot , and traniple upon you. ** " You should have told me , " he said , turning with an air of mockery to Astrara , " that he was listening in the next room . I would have dressed my phrases accordingly . " " Again , I ask you why you come here ? Answer me , or leave the room at once . " " Why do I come here ? To gladden my*&amp;f by looking at your wretchedness . You are worse than I am-sunk below me a thousand fathoms deep in degradation-every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathed . I came to see this . It makes me suprenmely happy . " // " Go-there is the door , " I cried , the blood tingling in my ears , and in the tips of my fingers . Astrna saw that the excitement was rising , and tooked at me imploringly ; but it was too late to attend to her scruples The dwarf looked at the door superciliously , and almost smiled when I repeated my warning . " You will not leave the room Be advised . I am not responsible for what may happen after this . I am not master of myself . Go-it is the last time I will utter the word . Go  --  or I will kill you on the spot ! " He did not move , but looked at me wonderingly and incredulously . I rushed upon him and grappled him by the neck . Astrna sprang up , and begged of me to desist , for I was hanging over him , with my hand upon his throat . " Let him go-let him go ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . loosen your hold-there-there-have mercy or * - , for my sake-for the love of God , spare himremember , we have injured him enough already - remember that I would not loosen my hold ; passion had given me the power and the cruelty of a demon . There was a brief strug0le , in which I flung him heavily to the ground . I had seized his handkerchief , and twisted my hand in it-he was nearly choked-his face was growing black ; but I was hardly conscious of all this , for the room was swimming round me as I knelt over him . Astrna saw the change in his color , and with a shriek of horror fell upon my arm . This action made me relax my hold . She had fainted on his holy . cONcLUsION . VVh* 5hould I dwell any longer on these painful events 3 , lIad I known then , as I afterward discovered , that the unhappy object of my wrath and hatred had , ever since the flight of Astrma , betrayed symptoms of ai ) erration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the stratagem of a disordered brain , I should have treated him with mercy and compassion . But I was ignorant of the real condition of his mind , and dealt with him as I should have dealt with a responsible being . The violent excitement of that scene brought on a crisis , which en ( led in a seizure of insanity . He still lives ; if that may be called living in which all memory of the past is extinguished , and the present is a mere tangled skein of day-dreams . Astrnas health was utterly broken . it was not her physique that died , but her heart , her spirits , her self-reliance , and her hope of the future . She felt that there was nothing for her in this world but remorse . The desolation that was round her killed her . She braved it earnestly at first . Her noble heart and her true love she thought were proof against the world and its hollow scorn . Alas ! for true love and noble hearts ! They can not stand up alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun with theit allies round them , like frailer loves and meaner hearts , or they will perish in their strength !
