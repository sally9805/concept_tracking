ART . VII . A Memorial of IREY . JOHN SNELLING PoPKIN , ID . ID. , late Eliot Professor of Greek Literature in liaryard University . Edited by CORNELIUS C. FELTON . his Successor in Office . " JJikic* * i*trArotutv c*uu*v . " Cambridge : John Bartlett , Bookseller to the University . 1852. i6mo. pp. lxxxviii &amp; 392 . IN literature , there are by-ways as well as high-ways , and he , whose feet do not range willingly over the former as well as the latter , is but a cold lover of books and reading . We believe it is Warton who has somewhere recorded , that , if he wished to ascertain whether a young man had a natural and genuine love of poetry , he would put Milton 's " Lycidas " into his hands . In like manner , we would try whether a person had a strong taste for literature by applying the test of such a book as Nichols 's Literary Anecdotes - that mild constellation of lights of " pretty considerable magnitude " - that kindly record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent , and yet deserving of remembrance . The book before us , in which Professor Felton has gathered up the broken fragments of the life and works of his predecessor in office , is one of those from which the modest and laborious scholar , who shall hereafter do for American literature in this century what Nichols did for English literature in the last , xviii draw his materials . It is the record of a man of merit and learning , who fell short of the distinction to which his abilities and industry seemed fairly to entitle him , from the black drops of melancholy , shyness , and self-distrust which were mingled with the currents of his blood . Of success , as that word is commonly understood , he had but little ; and indeed , when we compare the brilliant hopes which seem to have been awakened by the college career of Dr. Popkin , with the modest obscurity in which his declining years were past , his life must be pronounced to have been iii some sort a failure . But there is something at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the lot appointed unto him was borne . If there were the sense of disappointment and short-coining to add its shadow to the loneliness of his age , it was never proclaimed by bitterness or querulousness . If he 40 // failed of distinction , he at least attained peace . He was free from the tyranny of that restless ambition , which makes the prizes of success worthless the moment they are grasped . And who shall say that his was riot the better part ? Who shall say that the flower , heart's-ease , which we stoop to find , is riot well worth the laurel which we climb to grasp ? Nothing cau be more genial , graceful , arid appropriate than the biography which Professor Felton has prefixed to this volume . It tells us all that we want to know , and no more . It brings out the individual traits of a shy and eccentric scholar , with distinctness and yet with tenderness . The style , we need hardly say , is ripe , flowing , and mellow , with here and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fairly pronounced to have been one of the felicities of Dr. Popkin 's life , that he found such a biographer to record it . The only exception that we can take to the sketch is , that it falls somewhat into the almost universal habit of overstating the claims and merits of its subject . We should hardly call Dr. Popkin " an admirable classical scholar , ** even " after the old fashion * nor can we think that he had " the abilities of a great man . " But we should probably differ with Professor Felton less in his estimate of Dr. Popkin 's learning and talents , than in the force of the language he uses to characterize them . Lives so uneventful as that of Dr. Popkin are rare any where , and very rare in our country . He was a settled clergyman in Boston and in Newbury , from his twentyeighth to his forty-fourth year ; then a Professor in Cainbridge till his sixty-second year ; and for the remainder of his life , which was protracted to nearly eighty-one years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost exclusively with books . He rather avoided than sought opportunities for public display , and his morbid self-distrust led him to decline many duties and responsibilities which inferior men were found competent to discharge . And as his outward life was barren of incidents , so his inner life was not marked by those restless excitements and agitations to which men of more fervid temperament are exposed . Books , and the conscientious perforinance of his modest duties , rounded the circle of every // day . He never depended much upon the sympathy and companionship of others , and during the latter half of his life , his habits were of almost monastic seclusion . He was never married , - a piece of abstinence rare among the clergymen of New England- nor is it certain that his heart was ever disturbed by the intrusion of love . In our time , there ran a rumor among the students - to which we see Professor Felton has alluded - that he had met with a disappointment early in life , and that a single flower of romantic memory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report were true or not , it added to the interest which his character and habits awakened among his pupils . Of the sixteen or seventeen classes who sat under the instruction of Dr. Popkin , there was not a single member who did not feel an interest in him , and who would not have esteemed it a privilege to serve him . There was something marked and individual about him , which took hold of a youthful fancy , and strongly stamped his image upon a youthful memory . Traditionary stories of him , in great number , were handed down from class to class ; and there was a certain flutter of expectation awakened before coming into his presence . His appearance and manners were peculiar , and betrayed the seclusion of his life . His movements were awkward , and his looks abstracted . There was a cast-iron gravity in his face , which was rarely broken by a smile , though the general expression was not harsh or repulsive . The portrait , prefixed to this volume , is rather more grim and austere than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt , hurned , nervous way of speaking , or rather of ejaculating his words , in a tone of monotonous roughness which sounded something like the notes of a bassoon . He had also some awkward personal tricks - such as a habit of suddenly seizing one of his legs , and rubbing it with great energy , as if it were a duty he had too long neglected , and of sucking the air through the corners of his mouth ; - besides some clumsy movements of his arms and shoulders , which were the more conspicuous , as he was a man of tall and large frame . These peculiarities often awakened a smile in the recitation-room at the good man 's expense , and caused his // name to be sometimes lightly taken upon the lips of the students ; but , at heart , there was a sincere feeling of respect for him . This respect rested upon a perception rather of his moral than his intellectual qualities , and especially of his sincerity and uprightness . A truer man never lived . Jt was equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak what he did not think . In Mad . de Genlis 's temple of truth , his conversation would have remained unchanged . Neither fear nor favor could have induced him to swerve from the strictest standard of verbal integrity . The young men who approached him were conscious of an influence which they could not analyze , and which gave something of dignity to his oddities and eccentricities . They felt that a virtue went out from the presence of this shy , uncouth , reserved , but brave-hearted , and true-hearted man . His reputation for scholarship was the growth of a period when there was " little Latin and less Greek " in the community , and was , to say the least , quite as high as it deserved  --  to be . He was certainly a respectable scholar , and his range of reading in Greek was quite extensive . He understood the osteology of the language well , and with good opportunities and exact training in early life , would have been an excellent philologer . But he did not seem to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his own mind was not Greek enough in its mould to feel and interpret all the power and beauty of its literature . He was content to keep the strings of that fine harp in tune , and left to more skilful , or at least , bolder hands , the task of waking its slumbering music . He had one trait of a true scholar , - a high standard and a keen sense of how far he fell short of it . No one would have set so low an estimate upon his attainments as he himself . No one was disposed to scan with severity the claims of a scholar who had so little pretension and so much self-distrust . Nor can we , in candor , yield him the praise of having been a good teacher . He was exact and conscientious , and perfectly cempetent to teach the elements ; but he never seemed to forget that he was not teaching the elements . With the young men who read Sophocles , there was the same verbal drilling that they had experienced in // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he those natural endowments of mind and character which qualified him to be a , successful teacher . His manner was not cordial or magnetic . His reserve and self-distrust placed a barrier between him and his pupils . He was naturally sensitive , and , like most men who have lived in seclusion and had no children of their own , he gave to the thoughtless petulance of youth a significance which it did not deserve . His mind was not flowing or diffusive , but concentrated and brooding . His speech was marked by a laconic and impatient brevity , and he seemed to have a truly Spartan contempt for much talking . Of that fervid enthusiasm , which melts the cold and quickens the torpid , he had nothing . The selections from Dr. Popkin 's writings are made with good taste , and no one will say that they are too long or too numerous . His style is manly , vigorous , and unpretending , animated with here and there an odd or quaint expression , which will bring the writer vividly be fore his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings , and he holds his subject with a strong grasp . His earnestness and sincerity of feeling inspire at times a tone which is almost eloquent . We confess that our estimate of Dr. Popkin 's abilities has been raised by these writings . The contents of the volume are three lectures on Liberal Education , originally published in 1836 , some selections from lectures on Greek literature , and a few passages from sermons , published and unpublished . From the second lecture on liberal education , we extract a characteristic passage on the study of the ancient languages . " The Greek and Latin languages have always been esteemed by the learned as peculiarly adapted to instruct us in the nature and power of language and expression ; and they contain works which sustain the most powerful and finished expression , and invite and reward the attention of the studious by their intrinsic excellence . The Greek is acknowledged to be the most philosophical and elegant language known in the world . The Latin strikes my ear and my mind as the most smooth in its sounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ruling nation of the world . But the Greek appears at once the most forcible and flexible , the most copious and expressive , adapted to every subject , to the vehement eloquence of freedom , to the copious flow of history , to // the polished elegance of poetry , and to the deep and acute discussions of philosophy . It was the language of a people of animated genius , of restless activity and fervent energy ; who , when they were not engaged in arms or the forum , or thronging the scenes of rival strength and skill , repaired to the walks and the conversations of philosophy , or gave themselves up with delight to the entertainments of wit and the Muses . The language itself is a philosophical study , for its artful structure and polished composition . It is a subject of admiration , and an inquiry of difficult solution , how this people had formed a language so copious and various , rich and expressive , so ingeniously constructed , and so easily and gracefully flowing into all the forms and powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the age which Homer had made illustrious . " But the works which signalize these languages are the objects which are to be proposed as the highest recommendation . These have always held the first rank in poetry and oratory , and in all the strength and beauty of secular writings , in the estimation of those who may be deemed competent judges , and of those who are entitled to the best credit of being impartial . It is not merely the solitary student in his closet , pleased with private studies , and proud of peculiar knowledge , who commends them . Men of letters who are also men of business , engaged in the business of the state , or of the world , who have been trained in these and other pursuits , and can judge of their value and their influence , - these patronize and uphold them , and recommend them as the groundwork of the higher systems of education . They have especially been considered and maintained as the most suitable introduction . This study is particularly adapted to the season of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arguments of science . It affords an improving and invigorating exercise , requiring exertion , yet not overtasking the faculties . It promotes habits of close attention , accurate investigation , and just discrimination . But it is not the exercise and discipline of the mind alone , which is to be considered as the beneficial result of this study . It produces an habitual knowledge of the principles of language in its most exquisite forms and richest variety , of the precise meaning of words , of the structure and force of sentences , of the distiuction of things and the shades of difference , of the composition of discourse both free and measured , of the grace and power of ornament , and of the harmony of modulation . It does more ; it opens an acquaintance with the knowledge , the sentiments , the expressions , the productions , the history , and the politics of those ancient nations , who were most famous in their time , and in all succeeding times , and who had attained to a highly cultivated state of understanding , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vast advances have been made in Science by the studies and discoveries of later ages . But the faculties which pertain to the social nature and relations of man appear to come sooner to maturity ; and perhaps sooner to decay , probably by the process of moral and literary corruption . Our Indian eloquence is often celebrated . And the Book of Job is probably the oldest book in the world , and the grandest in its conceptions and expressions ; excepting some which are contained in the same sacred volume . " pp. 41 - 43 . In his lectures on Greek literature , he treats of the Homeric poems at considerable length , and in a plain , earnest manner , which , though not resembling the tone of modern composition , nor quite coming up to the standard of modern criticism , is not without interest . After discussing the principal characters in the Iliad , he goes on to say : - " The work grows on my hands , or rises and spreads before my eyes , like a magical palace . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are taken as texts and maxims . The language is flowing , smooth , clear , and harmonious , adapted to the subject , yet sustained and elevated , often rising to grandeur , and sometimes dissolving in tenderness , yet without any sickly affectation or inflated exaggeration . The descriptions are frequent , often beautiful , and often sublime . The speeches are exactly characteristic , and almost continual ; for the form of the poem is nearly dramatical . If the warriors stop to make speeches in the midst of the battle , this I suppose is more suitable to the poem than to the action described . It varies the monotonous din of arms . And if there is more of this din and danger than suits our civil ears , we must yield the privilege to the time and to the people , to whom it was the noblest song and the grandest music . " The visit of Hector to his mother and wife in the sixth book is a most touching scene of domestic affection and patriotic devotion . I think the poet sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this scene , and to interest us the more in his future struggles , and honor , and fall . The embassy to Achilles in the ninth book is another scene of peculiar power and interest . There is the artful , insinuating address of Ulysses ; and the keen , vehement , and indignant eloquence of Achilles , displaying a depth , and strength , and compass of thought and feeling , and a keenness of invective and irony , which is equal at least , to the highest effort of Demosthenes . And then the long address of the aged Phenix , his foster-father , recounting the misfortunes of his youth , and his attentions on the youth of his foster-son , and then telling // a long , winding , perplexed story of Meleager , with sentence involved in sentence , and parenthesis in parenthesis , all this appears tome a most studied and finished piece of imitation . And finally , the abrupt conclusion of Ajax , Let us go , for there is no end to all this talk , ' is the sentence of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep than do either ; and yet he briefly exhibits a rude dignity , a strong argument , and a manly resolution . " But the poet , having shown his power throughout the work , has collected and exerted all his strength in the conclusion . This is described in the words which we read in Longinus . You see , ' says he , that , the earth being broken up from the foundation , and Tartarus laid open , and the world receiving a subversion and disruption , all things together , Heaven and Hades , mortals and immortals , are engaged together in the contest and peril of this battle . But , ' he adds , these things , if they are not understood as an allegory , are unworthy of the gods , and not preserving propriety or decorum ; for he has made gods of the men , and men of the gods . ' Herodotus says , that Homer and Hesiod formed the Grecian theology . I rather think that Homer took the popular theology as he found it , which was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably modified it to his purpose ; and introduced it into his poem , to give it amplitude and elevation . The Iliad was not designed for historical truth , but as a work of imagination . It may be interpreted in an allegorical sense ; but I think it was agreeable to public opinion , to consider the gods as acting in the manner of men , and in the concerns of men , though with vast superiority of power . We must place a picture in the proper light , and take a right point of view , that we may see it in its perfection . And we should consider the poem in its proper time and circumstances , that we may see the art and power of the poet . " pp. 117 - 119 . In his lecture on the Lyric Poets , he thus speaks of Pindar and the form of poetry in which he excelled . " The Odes , as we call them , have the title of * a Form , or Species , of which name I know not the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pastorals of Theocritus are named Ehb*XXw , Little Forms or Species . The victors in the games were held in high honor ; they were received with great ceremony , distinguished with peculiar privileges , and thought worthy of signal celebration . But the poet soon passes from his hero to other heroes or the gods , or to remarkable passages of mythology or history . Thus he avoids the monotony of similar characters and exercises , and at the same time he connects them with subjects of dignity or celebrity . The original subjects might have been very untractable , having nothing to recommend // but bodily strength or skill . But by introducing higher subjects he reflects an honor upon them , which they could not sustain by their own splendor . " The transitions appear sudden and rapid ; but they are not utterly disjointed . They are the associations of a rapid and fervid mind . The strokes of his lyre he often calls arrows and darts , which may express the swift glances and flights of the ima* , ination . Indeed , the lyric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised above the colloquial and prosaic language . Rare words and phrases and combinations are sought out ; and the poet impresses by quick and living sentiment rather than by slow and formal reasoning . It is so in modern song ; but it is more so in the ancient . The hearers were accustomed to this high-wrought style , and it was within the limit of their habits , and associations , and quick perception . But to us at first it appears hard in construction , and difficult of interpretation , till it has become familiar by frequent perusal . But those to whom it was familiar and native expected in their festivals something elevated above their daily business and conversation . The lyric style is more raised , condensed , and pointed than the copious , flowing epic , or the urgent iambic of the drama . The chorus of the drama is commonly lyrical , and often rises in odes of lofty or fervent sentiment . " But though the diction of Pindar is thus raised above the common language , his sense is not so remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . On the contrary , it is often very good , and sound , and strong sense . In a few words he brings out a great thought , which may be expanded over pages . Ia a conc&gt;e sentence he expresses a sentiment , which may stand as a principle and rule of life and action . " pp. 204-206 . The subject of dramatic literature is very briefly treated , but the remarks upon it are discriminating and just . The great masters are thus sketched . " A*schylus flourished in the times of the Persian wars ( 01. 71 , B. C. 460 , ) and was a soldier of Liberty , and was present in her great battles . His brother Aniieinias obtained the first prize of valor ; and when iEschylus was accused for impiety in his tragedies , this brother defended him by virtue of his own merit , - and by showing his wounds . " This author , I think , may be fairly esteemed the father of tragedy , which received not only its form , but its spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious , and ardent , and sublime . The times also were in the highest degree conducive to such exercises and productions ; for they were an // awful and tremendous struggle for liberty and for life ; which was successful beyond all calculation . The minds of men were wrought up to the highest energy and the most daring conceptions . We may believe that they could no longer descend to the ludicrous sports of the old exhibitions . The Tragic Muse was born , like her patron , in lightning and thunder . And it is said that her author lived like her patron , and wrote under his inspiration . He certainly wrote with great ardor , and in a lofty style of language , - lofty to excess , and sometimes to extravagance , - yet not empty sound , but full of thought and energy . This high-wrought expression , doubtless , flowed from the fervor and fulness of his own mind ; but it appears also to have been excited and sustained by the spirit and tenor of the lyric and dithyrambic composition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art newly invented , or as the first natural effort of a mind laboring without example to express itself with power and dignity . The work appears rather to be raised on previous preparations , and to rise above them to higher degrees of invention , without yet being subdued by a sound and correct judgment . We should suppose that the forms and use of the words , and the structure of the sentences , were as remote as possible from the common language of men , unless that people always spoke in studied and labored diction and hyperbole . It remained for Sophocles to temper the elevated dramatic strain with a just discernment , and correct judgment of propriety . It is said that , the young poet winning the prize from his senior , the veteran retired to Sicily , and ended his life there . Seven tragedies remain , and fragments , and the titles of as many as a hundred others . " pp. 217 - 218 . " Sophocles is considered as having carried the ancient tragedy to its highest perfection . This improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted , perhaps , by the observations of his literary companions . While they rendered all justice to the power of JEschylus , they might perceive wherein his works were defective , and wherein his schemes were capable of improvement . But it requires genius to execute what the judgment perceives and approves . And both these powers , in just proportion , appear to have constituted the mind of Sophocles . " His language is justly tempered with discretion , yet poetical and elevated , and adorned with the forms and colors of imagination . He appears to be the best judge of decorum , or propriety , of that which is most suitable to the subject , the occasion , and the character . He gives to his persons their distinctive character and expression . He produces his sentiments in due proportion , without overloading his action with impertinent or un // necessary reflections . Indeed , he expresses his sentiments rather in the course of the action and the dialogue than in formal and proverbial sentences . " He may he peculiarly called the poet of action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , the principal thing , which he pursues with constancy and without deviation . He has a precise plan and end in view , to which he makes all the parts and incidents and circumstances conducive . He has made his persons more numerous , and his combinations more complex and artificial , and his scene more stirring and active , than his antecessor ; and though his language is more temperate , I know not that it is less significant . Yet lEschylus was always held in high esteem for the strength and boldness of his conceptions and expressions. ** pp. 222-224 . " Euripides is considered us inferior to Sophocles in the plan and in the style of his compositions . His plan is judged to be commonly not so well ordered , nor so uniformly directed to the object and the end . His style also is thought to be not so purely dramatic and poetical , but rather rhetorical , philosophical , and even declamatory ; to be overcharged with moral sentiments , and extraneous and even unnecessary matter . Just sentiments and philosophy are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in good tragedy . But they should not be drawn and pressed in to excess , and to satiety ; z6Qog , as the ancients express superabundance . Sophocles appears more successful in producing his sentiments and philosophy in the progress of the action , and in the development of the characters and the incidents . Euripides appears sometimes to arrest the action , in order to make a long display of sentimental speculations . " Yet , with these exceptions and abatements , or comparisons , Euripides still holds a high place in dramatic estimation . He was held in great esteem by his countrymen , not only at home but abroad , in their various settlements ; and not only in the Attic , but also in the Done connection : insomuch , that the Athenian captives in Sicily , who were treated with the severity of vengeance for their unprovoked invasion , could purchase their liberty by repeating from memory a few of the verses of Euripides . Yet he had at home a severe satirist and persecutor in Aristophanes ; who studiously seizes every occasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and travesties his verses ; and in two comedies he makes him the burden of the song , or the football of the play , The Frogs , and The Worshippers of Genes . He indeed has treated Socrates with as little ceremony , in the comedy of The Clouds ; and appears to make no distinction between the captious sophists and the sober philo // sophers . In short , he spares no one , who offers him an occasion of displaying his wit and humor ; and he makes himself as free with the rulers , by name , or with the divinities , as with the humblest citizen , or servant , or parasite . His wit and Atticism are unrivalled ; hut his liberty , or license , and indecency , are equally unbounded . The boldness of the ancient comedy provoked a public prohibition ; and it became necessary to use fictitious names , arid to treat of common life and manners . Of this moral and sentimental strain Euripides is supposed to have afforded the most instructive example ; so that his insulted Muse finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was observed in old times , that Euripides painted mankind as they are , and Sophocles painted them as they ought to be ; which is translated into modern criticism , that Sophocles studied the ideal , and Euripides the real character . This reality fitted him to be an example to the moral comedy ; or the comedy of real and common life , and moral sentiment and character . " pp. 229-231 . His summary of the whole subject of Greek tragedy is an amusing specimen of his homely way of treating a theme too apt to lead to fine writing , and of his odd fashion of blurting out his opinions . " Concerning the Greek tragedies in general , I must confess that the story is often too tragical , too atrocious , and horrible , for my taste ; too opposite to the feelings of human nature , and the principles of human reason . I must refer them to the times in which they were composed , or in which they were supposed to have been transacted . I find some relief in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in so high a degree of violence , actual perpetrations . Of this distinction I have seen many evidences . I find my gratification in the parts , the passages , and the verses , rather than in the whole and in the conclusion ; in the filling , as we may say , rather than in the warp of the web of fate . The idea of a fixed , irrational , irresistible fate , driving men on to inevitable crimes and horrors , against their resolute will and desperate resistance , to me is dreadful , and atheistical ; but perhaps it did not appear so to the authors , who studied only to produce a strong character and a powerful impression . But the particular sentiments , in the progress of the work , are often favorable to virtue . And as works of art and power , the dramatic writings are counted among the chief works of Grecian genius . I would consider them as poems to be read , rather than as scenes to be acted . But there must be something awful or distressful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be terror or pity , rather than horror and disgust . // " I am probably singular , but I never loved to be horribly delighted . I love to see every thing , everybody , and every soul , right , and good , and happy , doing well , and ending well . But in this case , it may be said , we should have no tragedies , and scarcely any history ; no trials of principle , and few exercises of virtue . But in fact , there is no danger of this sterility in the world . And since we are as we are , it is best that we should know the truth ; and that it should be set before us in the most strong and striking colors , to deter us from vice , and excite us to virtue . That is true , if it be true . But the same instrument which may be the minister of virtue may also be the pander of vice . As the conclusion of the whole matter , I must say that I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pp. 233 - 234 . From the sermon on the death of Washington we copy an interesting passage . " Never did more of a nation 's happiness depend upon one man ; never was more effected by one , than by that great and beloved man , of whose death the past week brought us the sorrowful tidings . He was truly our Joshua ; for he answered all the meaning of the name . He was , under the Almighty , the savior of his country . Like him , he gave early indications of prowess , zeal , and prudence in the service of his people . Like him , he led our armies against a nation greater and mightier than we , a nation at whom the powers of the earth trembled ; he led us to victory and peace , and to the quiet possession of a fruitful land in the enjoyment of sovereignty and independence . Under his auspices we became settled under a government and laws . His example and authority have highly recommended to our attention the fear and service of God ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce them upon us , that Joshua had under the immediate government of God ; yet , so far as the powers committed to him extended , he has strictly observed and maintained those principles of righteousness which are essential parts of the law of God , and which are necessary and generally effectual to preserve internal order and external peace . " Our chief has left his abode in the midst of his brethren , called , as we trust , by his guardian God , to a more exalted sphere of action and enjoyment . We follow his rising spirit with mingled grief and consolation . We resign him with tears , but we resign him with hope , to his Almighty Father , who has ever been his friend and shield on earth , and will be his exceeding great reward , and his portion for ever . It is a melancholy pleasure to trace the actions , and to view the tokens , which are left to us , of dear , departed , respected friends . Though the deeds and the virtues of 41 // our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recount his history from their grateful memories , yet love , gratitude , and admiration seek their solace in dwelling upon the affecting and glorious theme . " Behold him in his first essays to serve and defend his country . Here his early prudence and skill saved the remnant of an army , whose haughty commander despised the cautions of his sagacity . Here he gave a presage of that masterly address , by which he was destined to save his country from a superior foe , with a little band of her almost deserted heroes . When he was called by her distressful voice to this arduous and dismaying post of danger , he took it with equal promptitude and modesty . Diffident of his own abilities , he undauntedly hazarded the result of a contest extremely dubious , or rather where cool reason would expect a defeat . He exposed himself as the first victim to despotic vengeance . He devoted his life with patriotic zeal to the righteous cause of his country , relying upon that God who loves and protects the righteous . This reliance he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the darkest of his communications ; we believe it reigned in his heart , and we know that it guided and blessed all his measures . Uniting the almost incompatible qualities of prudence and decision , of sagacity in counsel and energy in action , with a small army , ill appointed , ill fed , and ill clothed , he baffled his numerous , insulting foes , he besieged them in a strong fortress with inferior numbers , and while they dreamt of fierce assaults and the thunders of war , he darts across the continent with the swiftness of an eagle , and seizes a prey sufficiently strong to break from the grasp of any other assailant . INothing but his powers could have sustained the war , under every embarrassment and deficiency . Nothing but the esteem , veneration , and confidence which his character commanded , could have brought together the crumbling fragments of a battered army , or the sinking divisions of a quaking continent . " God had adapted and prepared his talents for this unequal struggle . Talents so great , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , or the records of time . He who had appointed him to this contest gave him glorious success , gave him to triumph in the freedom of his country , not only as the effect of the powers with which he had endued him , but , we may rationally believe , as the reward of his sublime virtues , his pure patriotism , his sincere religion . " lie proved the uprightness of his heart , the purity of his zeal , his disinterested love of his country , by his eagerness to renounce the splendor of command , the ways of ambition , and to seek , in the bosom of his family , in the mansion of peace , a repose for his // mind fatigued with incessant energies , and the tranquil participation of the blessing which he had vindicated by his sword . Again he quits his loved retirement , ngain he obeys his suffcrin* , country 's voice , to secure by laws those blessings which he had purchased by arms . Again he relinquishes his pleasure , and assumes the unsought labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a station which kings may envy , but Washington only endures . " If he was great in conducting war , he was greater in preserving peace . Adequate to every office to which he is called , to every duty which human nature can perform , he rises equally with his station ; every step augments that honor which was already deemed complete . And when he descends from the chair of rule , and returns to the pleasant vale of life which at our desire he had forsaken , he still rises in our admiration . Though we follow him to his retreat with regret , yet we venerate the man who can resign with satisfaction the highest object of ambition . In the storms of nations , he is the lightning ; in peace , he presides as the sun , diffusing everywhere his animating beams ; in private life , his influence descends as the rain , and distils as the dew , to fertilize the rejoicing fields . " pp. 245 - 250 . In the sermon on the memory of the righteous , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eloquent . " Let us remember his unconquerable love of his country , to whose welfare he freely sacrificed all his happiness ; for whose honor he repeatedly hazarded his reputation ; in whose danger he braved the sword of the mighty , and the more fearful poniard of slander ; in whose service he expended all his years of vi*or , years in which events of vast magnitude were his daily occupations . Yet nothing abated nor diverted the ardor of his patriotism ; and he died while his wounded country was kaning on his arm . Reruember his inflexible regard to truth and duty , which subdued all passion , which quelled all fears when the boldest hearts would have quaked ; which fixed him immovably to the principles of right and the dictates of conscience , and forbade the suspicion of an improper motive . Remember his piety , which constantly referred to the Almighty all his success , and reposed on him all his hopes and the hopes of his country , which has placed upon this foundation all the virtue and happiness of a people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which seemed to seize the truth by a native affinity , and to display it with a force of conviction which superseded all argument . Remember his services to his country , than which never were greater performed , nor more worthy of every expression of // gratitude . I can not call all his merits to remembrance ; but your own minds do not , I trust require this office . You will read them often in our history , and in their unparalleled effects . We should often retrace them , not merely to admire , but to follow them , thou h with unequal steps . For we can not confide in a better judgment , nor in purer integrity . We should love our country the better for having such a leader . Our love and reverence for this great man and his associates , who established our independence and our nation , should be a strong bond of union , a powerful spring to the love of their and our common country . " pp. 271-273 . We take leave of Professor Felton , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old pupils of Dr. Popkin will share , for his labors of love in editing this volume . If the resonant sentiment of Dr. Johnson be literally true-that " whatever makes the past , the distant , or the future , predominate over the present , advances us in the dignity of thinking beings , " - we have by his labors been advanced in the dignity of human beings ; for this memorial of Dr. Popkin has made the past predominate over the present , at least for a season . We enter once more that well-remenibered recitation-room , with a Gr*ca Majora in our hands . The tall form and sturdy stride of our old teacher reappear , as we read . We see now his abstracted gaze , his old tricks , and his awkward movements . We hear him call up our classmates , one by one , many of whom have now , like him , passed away from earth ; we recall his curt and broken observations , and the invariable " you may sit , " with which every examination was closed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitary scholar , with its grim portraits of Greek authors over the mantle-piece , its book-cases filled with Greek and Latin books , the row of boots and shoes , which commonly stood in one corner , and its general aspect of comfortless disarray . The years that have passed , since all this was before our cycs , seem like a dream when the morning has dawned.
