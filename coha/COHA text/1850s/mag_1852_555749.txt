txt ART . VI . - The Works of JAMES FENIMORE COOPER . Author 's Revised Edition . New York : G. P. Putnam. 1851. l2mo . No American writer has been so extensively read as James Fenimore Cooper . His novels have been translated into nearly every European tongue . Nay , we are told - but hardly know how to believe it - that they may be had duly rendered jnto Persian at the bazaars of Ispahan . We have seen some of them , well thumbed and worn , at a little village in a remote mountainous district of Sicily ; and in Naples and Milan , the bookstalls bear witness that " L ' Ultimo dei Mohecanni " is still a popular work . In England , these American novels have been eagerly read and transformed into popular dramas ; while cheap and often stupidly mutilated editions of them have been circulated through all her colonies , garrisons , and naval stations , from New Zealand to Canada . - Nor is this widely spread popularity undeserved . Of all American writers , Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His genius drew aliment from the soil where God had planted it , and rose to a vigorous growth , rough and gnarled , but strong as a mountain cedar . His volumes are a faithful mirror of that rude transatlantic nature , which to European eyes appears so strange and new . The sea and the forest have been the scenes of his countrymen 's most conspicuous achievements ; and it is on the sea and in the forest that Cooper is most at home . Their spirit inspired him , their images were graven on his heart ; and the men whom their embrace has nurtured , the sailor , the hunter , the pioneer , move and act upon his pages with all the truth and energy of real life . There is one great writer with whom Cooper has been often compared , and the comparison is not void of justice ; // for though , on the whole , far inferior , there are certain high points of literary excellence in regard to which he may contest the palm with Sir Walter Scott . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor and pathos , the fine perception of beauty and delicacy in character , which adds such charms to the romances of Scott . Nor can he boast that compass and variety of power , which could deal alike with forms of humanity so diverse ; which could portray with equal mastery the Templar Bois Guilbert , and the Jewess Rebecca ; the manly heart of Henry Morton , and the gentle heroism of Jeanie Deans . But notwithstanding this unquestioned infer riority on the part of Cooper , there were marked affinities between him and his great contemporary . Both were practical men , able and willing to grapple with the hard realities of the world . Either might have learned with ease to lead a regiment , or command a line-of-battle ship . Their conceptions of character were no mere abstract ideas , or unsubstantial images , but solid embodiments in living flesh and blood . Bulwer and Hawthorne - the conjunction may excite a smile - are writers of a different stamp . Their conceptions are often exhibited with consummate skill , and , in one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never cheat us into a belief of their reality . We may marvel at the skill of the artist , but we are prone to regard his creations rather as figments of art than as reproductions of nature , - as a series of vivified and animate pictures , rather than as breathing men and women . With Scott and with Cooper it is far otherwise . Domninie Sampson and the Antiquary are as distinct and familiar to our minds as some eccentric acquaintance of our childhood . If we met Long Torn Coffin on the wharf at New Bedford , we should wonder where we had before seen that familiar face and figure . The tall , gaunt form of Leatherstocking , the weather-beaten face , the bony hand , the cap of fox-skin , and the old hunting frock , polished with long service , seem so palpable and real , that , in some moods of mind , one may easily confound them with the memories of his own experiences . Others have been gifted to conceive the elements of far loftier character , and even to combine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have rivalled Cooper in the power of breathing into his creations the breath of life , and turning the phantoms of his // brain into seeming realities . It is to this , in no small measure , that he owes his widely spread popularity . His most successful portraitures are drawn , it is true , from humble walks and rude associations ; yet they are instinct with life , and stain ped with the impress of a masculine and original genius . The descriptions of external nature with which Cooper 's works abound bear a certain analogy to his portraitures of character . There is no glow upon his pictures , no warm and varied coloring , no studied contrast of light and shade . Their virtue consists in their fidelity , in the strength with which they impress themselves upon the mind , and the strange tenacity with which they cling to the memory . For our own part , it was many years since we had turned the pages of Cooper , but still we were haunted by the images which his spell had evoked ; - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest boughs against the red evening sky , and the raven flapping his black wings above the ctrrnage field near the Horican . These descriptions have often , it must he confessed , the grave fault of being overloaded with detail ; but they are utterly mistaken who affirm , as some have done , that they are but a catalogue of commonplaces , - mountains and woods , rivers and torrents , thrown together as a matter of course . A genuine love of nature inspired the artist 's pen ; and they who can not feel the efficacy of its strong picturing have neither heart nor mind for the grandeur of the outer world . Before proceeding , however , we must observe that , in speaking of Cooper 's writings , we have reference only to those happier offspring of his genius which form the basis of his reputation ; for , of that numerous progeny which of late years have swarmed from his pen , we have never read one , and therefore , notwithstanding the an6ient usage of reviewers , do not think ourselves entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as style must always be , in no small measure the exponent of the author 's mind . It is not elastic or varied , and is certainly far from elegant . Its best characteristics are a manly directness , and a freedom from those prettinesses , studied turns of expression , and petty tricks of rhetoric , which are the pride of less masculine writers . Cooper is no favorite with dilettanti critics . In 13* // truth , such criticism does not suit his case . He should be measured on deeper principles , not by his manner , but by his nith and substance . A rough diamond , and he is one of the roughest , is worth more than a jewel of paste , though its facets may not shine so clearly . And yet , try Cooper by what test we may , we shall discover in him grave defects . The field of his success is , after all , a narrow one , and even in his best works he often oversteps its limits . His attempts at sentiment are notoriously unsuccessful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no words can express the remarkable character of the product . With simple country girls he succeeds somewhat better ; but when he essays a higher flight , his failure is calamitous . The most rabid asserter of the rights of woman is scarcely more ignorant of woman 's true power and dignity . This is the more singular , as his novels are very far from being void of feeling . They seldom , however - and who can wonder at it ? - find much favor with women , who for the most part can see little in them but ghastly stories of shipwrecks , ambuscades , and bush fights , mingled with prolix descriptions and stupid dialogues . Their most appreciating readers may perhaps be found , not among persons of sedentary and studious habits , but among those of a more active turn , military officers and the like , whose tastes have not been trained into fastidiousness , and who are often better qualified than literary men to feel the freshness and truth of the author 's descriptions . The merit of a novelist is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his skill in delineating *iharacter . The permanency of Cooper 's reputation must , as it seems to us , rest upon three or four finely conceived and admirably executed portraits . We do not allude to his Indian characters , which it must be granted , are for the most part either superficially or falsely drawn ; while the long conversations which he puts into their mouths , are as truthless as they are tiresome . Such as they are , however , th&amp;y have been eagerly copied by a legion of the smaller poets and novel writers ; so that , jointly with Thomas Campbell , Cooper is responsible for the fathering of those aboriginal heroes , lovers , and sages , who have long formed a petty nuisance in our literature . The portraits of which we have // spoken are all those of white men , from humble ranks of society , yet not of a mean or vulgar stamp . Conspicuous before them all stands the well known figure of Leatherstocking . The life and character of this personage are contained in a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Leatherstocking Tales . Cooper has been censured , and even ridiculed , for this frequent reproduction of his favorite hero , which , it is affirmed , argues poverty of invention ; and yet there is not one of the tales in question with which we would willingly part . To have drawn such a character is in itself sufficient honor ; and had Cooper achieved nothing else , this alone must have insured him a wide and merited renown . There is something admirably felicitous in the conception of this hybrid offspring of civilization and barbarism , in whom uprightness , kindliness , innate philosophy , and the truest moral perceptions are joined with the wandering instincts and hatred of restraint which stamp the Indian or the Bedouin . Nor is the character in the least unnatural . The white denizens of the forest and the prairie are often among the worst , though never among the meanest , of mankind ; but it is equally true , that where the moral instincts are originally strong , they may find nutriment and growth among the rude scenes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous , and kindly as Leatherstocking may still be found among the perilous solitudes of the lATest . The quiet , unostentatious courage of Cooper 's hero had its countei*part in the character of Daniel Boone ; and the latter had the same unaffected love of nature which forms so pleasing a feature in the mind of Leatherstocking . Civilization has a destroying as well as a creating power . It is exterminating the buffalo and the Indian , over whose fate too many lamentations , real or affected , have been sounded for us to renew them here . It must , moreover , eventually sweep from before it a class of men , its own precursors and pioneers , so remarkable both in their virtues and their faults , that few will see their extinction without regret . Of these imnen Leatberstocking is the representative ; and though in him the traits of the individual are quite as prominent as those of the class , yet his character is not on this account less interesting , or less worthy of permanent remembrance . His life conveys in some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its most busy and decisive periods . At first , we find him a lonely young hunter in what was then the wilderness of New York . Ten or twelve years later , he is playing his part manfully in the Old French War . After the close of the Revolution , we meet him again on the same spot where he was first introduced to us ; but now every thing is changed . The solitary margin of the Otsego lake is transformed into the seat of a growing settlement , and the hunter , oppressed by the restraints of society , turns his aged footsteps westward in search of his congenial solitudes . At length , we discover him for the last time , an octogenarian trapper , far out on the prairies of the West . It is clear that the successive stages of his retreat from society could not well he presented in a single story , and that the repetition which has been charged against Cooper as a fault was indispensable to the development of his design . The Deerslayer , the first novel in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most interesting of Cooper 's productions . He has chosen for the scene of his story the Otsego lake , on whose banks he lived and died , and whose scenery he has introduced into three , if not more , of his novels . The Deerslayer , or Leatherstocking , here makes his first appearance as a young man , in fact scarcely emerged from boyhood , yet with all the simplicity , candor , feeling , and penetration , which mark his riper years . The old buccaneer in his aquatic habitation , and the contrasted characters of his two daughters , add a human interest to the scene , for the want of which the highest skill in mere landscape painting can not compensate . The character of Judith seems to us the best drawn , and by far the most interesting , female portrait in any of Cooper 's novels with which we are acquainted . The story , however , is not free from the characteristic faults of its author . Above all , it contains , in one instance at least , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he compels his marvellously graphic pen to depict scenes which would disgrace the shambles or the dissecting table , none can wonder that ladies and young clergymen regard his pages with abhorrence . These , however , are but casual defects in a work which bears the Unmistakable impress of genius . The Pathfinder forms the second volume of the series , and // is remarkable , even among its companions , for the force and distinctness of its pictures . For ourselves - though we diligently perused the despatches - the battle of Palo Alto and the storming of Monterey are not more real and present to our mind than some of the scenes and characters of The Pathfinder , though we have not read it for nine years ; - the little fort on the margin of Lake Ontario , the surrounding woods and waters , the veteran major in command , the treacherous Scotchman , the dogmatic old sailor , and the Pathfinder himself . Several of these scenes are borrowed in part from Mrs. Grant 's Memoirs of an American Lady ; but in borrowing , Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - for as such we are to take them - have an air of fiction ; while Cooper 's fiction wears the aspect of solid fact . His peculiar powers could not be better illustrated than by a comparison of the passages alluded to in the two hooks . One of the most widely known of Cooper 's novels is The Last of the Mohicans , which forms the third volume of the series , and which , with all the elements of a vulgar popularity , combines excellences of a far higher order . It has , nevertheless , its great and obtrusive faults . It takes needless liberties with history ; and though it would be folly to demand that an historical novelist should always conform to received authorities , yet it is certainly desirable that he should not unnecessarily set then at defiance ; since the incidents of the novel are apt to remain longer in the memory than those of the less palatable history . But whatever may be the extent of the novelist 's license , it is , at all events , essential that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run counter to nature and common sense . In The Last of the Mohicans , the machinery of the plot falls little short of absurdity . Why a veteran officer , pent up in a little fort , and hourly expecting to be beleaguered by a vastly superior force , consisting in great part of bloodthirsty savages , should at that particular time desire or permit a visit from his two daughters , is a question not easy to answer . Nor is the difficulty lessened when it is remembered , that the young ladies are to make the journey through a wilderness full of Indian scalping parties . It is equally difficult to see why the lover of Alice should choose , merely for the sake of a // romantic ride , to conduct her and her sister by a circuitous and most perilous by-path through the forests , when they might more easily have gone by a good road under the safe escort of a column of troops who marched for the fort that very morning . The story founded on these gross inventions is sustained by various minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention is absorbed by the powerful interest of the narrative . It seems to us a defect in a novel or a poem , when the heroine is compelled to undergo bodily hardship , to sleep out at night in the woods , drenched by rain , stun0 by mosquitos and scratched by briars ,  --  to forego all appliances of the toilet , and above all , to lodge in an Indian wigwam . Women have sometimes endured such privation , and endured it with fortitude ; but it may be safely affirmed , that for the time , all grace and romance were banished from their presence . We read Longfellow 's Evangeline with much sympathy in the fortunes of the errant heroine , until , as we approached the end of the poem , every other sentiment was lost in admiration at the unparalleled extent of her wanderings , at the dexterity with which she contrived to elude at least a dozen tribes of savages at that time in a state of war , at the strength of her constitution , and at her marvellous proficiency in woodcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two thousand miles on her forest pilgrimage , and reflected on the figure she must have made , so tattered and hepatched , bedrenched and bedraggled , we could not but esteem it a happy circumstance that she failed , as she did , to meet her lover ; since , had- he seen her in such plight , every spark of sentiment must have vanished from his breast , and all the romance of the poem have been ingloriously extinguished . With Cooper 's heroines , Cora and Alice , the case is not so bard . Yet , as it does not appear that , on a journey of several weeks , they were permitted to carry so much as a valise or a carpet bag , and as we are expressly told , that on several occasions , they dropped by the wayside their gloves , veils , and other useful articles of apparel , it is certain , that at the journey 's end , they must have presented an appearance more adapted to call forth a Christian sympathy than any emotion of a more romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Last of the Mohicans is surpassed by several other works of the author . // Its distinguishing merit lies in its descriptions of scenery and action . Of the personages who figure in it , one of the most interesting is the young Mohican , Uncas , who , however , does not at all resemble a genuine Indian . Magua , the villain of the story , is a less untruthful portrait . Cooper has been criticized for having represented him as falling in love with Cora ; and the criticism is based on the alleged ground that passions of this kind are not characteristic of the Indian . This may , in some qualified sense , he true ; but it is well known that Indians , in real life as well as in novels , display a peculiar partiality for white women , on the same principle by which Italians are prone to admire a light complexion , while Swedes regard a brunette with highest esteem . Cora was the very person to fascinate an Indian . The coldest warrior would gladly have received her into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wholly dispensing ,  --  in honor of her charms , with flagellation or any of the severer marks of conjugal displeasure . The character of Hawkeye or Leatherstocking is , in the Mohicans as elsewhere , clearly and admirably drawn . He often displays , however , a weakness which excites the impatience of the reader , - an excessive and ill-timed loquacity . When , for example , in the fi , ht at Glenn 's Falls , he and Major Heywood are crouching in the thicket , watching the motions of four Indians , whose heads are visible above a log at a little distance , and who , in the expression of Hawkeye himself , are gathering for a rush , the scout employs the time *n dilating upon the properties of the " long-barrelled , softmetalled rifle . " The design is , no doubt , to convey an impression of his coolness in moments of extreme danger ; but under such circumstances , the bravest man would judge it the part of good sense to use his eyes rather than his tongue . Men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp-fire , are remarkable for preserving a close silence while engaged in the active labors of their calling . It is easy to find fault with The Last of the Mohicans ; but it is far from easy to rival or even approach its excellences . The book has the genuine game flavor ; it exhales the odors of the pine woods and the freshness of the mountain wii*d . Its dark and rugged scenery rises as distinctly on the eye as the images of the painter 's canvas , or rather as the reflection // of nature herself . But it is not as the mere rendering of material forms , that these wood paintings are most highly to be esteemed . They are instinct with life , with the very spirit of the wilderness ; they breathe the somhre poetry of solitude and danger . In these achievements of his art , Cooper , we think , has no equal , unless it may he the author of that striking romance , Wacousta or the Prophecy , whose fine powers of imagination are , however , even less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American novelist . The most obvious merit of The Last of the Mohicans consists in its descriptions of action , in the power with which the author absorbs the reader 's sympathies , and leads him , as it were , to play a part in the scene . One reads the accounts of a great battle - aside from any cause or principle at issue - with the same kind of interest with which he beholds the grand destructive phenomena of nature , a tempest at sea , or a tornado in the tropics ; yet with a feeling far more intense , since the conflict is not a mere striving of insensate elements , but of living tides of human wrath and valor . With descriptions of petty skirmishes or single combats , the feeling is of a different kind . The reader is enlisted in the fray , a partaker , as it were , in every thought and movement of the combatants , in the alternations of fear and triumph , the prompt expedient , the desperate resort , the palpitations of human weakness , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description , the scene of the conflict at Glenn 's Falls is an admirable example , unsurpassed , we think , even by the comhat of Balfour and Bothwell , or by any other passage of the kind in the novels of Scott . The scenery of the fight , the foamin* , cataract , the little islet with its stout-hearted defenders , the precipices and the dark pine woods , add greatly to the effect . The scene is conjured before the reader 's eye , not as a vision or a picture , but like the tangible presence of rock , river , and forest . His very senses seem conspiring to deceive him . He seems to feel against his cheek the wind and spray of the cataract , and hear its sullen roar , amid the yells of the assailants and the sharp crack of the answering rifle . The scene of the strife is pointed out to travellers as if this fictitious combat were a real event of history . Mills , factories , and bridges have marred the native wildness of the spot , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet // still those foaming waters and black sheets of limestone rock are clothed with all the interest of an historic memory ; and the cicerone of the place can show the caves where the a-frighted sisters took refuge , the point where the Indians landed , and the rock whence the despairing Huron was flung into the ahyss . Nay , if the lapse of a few years has not enlightened his understanding , the guide would as soon doubt the reality of the battle of Saratoga , as that of Hawkeye 's fight with the Mingoes . The Pioneers , the fourth volume of the series , is , in several respects , the best of Cooper 's works . Unlike some of its companions , it bears every mark of having been written from the results of personal experience ; and indeed , Cooper is well known to have drawn largely on the iecollections of his earlier years in the composition of this novel . The characters are full of vitality and truth , though , in one or two instances , the excellence of delineation is impaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appears in The Pioneers , must certainly have had his living original in some gaunt , gray . haired old woodsman , to whose stories of hunts and Indian fights the author may perhaps have listened in his boyhood with rapt ears , unconsciously garnering up in memory the germs which time was to develop into a rich harvest . The scenes of the Christmas turkey-shooting , the fish-spearin* by firelight on Otsego lake , the rescue from the panther , and the burning of the woods , are all inimitable in their way . Of all Cooper 's works , The Pioneers seems to us most likely to hold a permanent place in literature , for it preserves a vivid reflection of scenes and characters which will soon have passed away . The Prairie , the last of the Leatherstocking Tales , is a novel of far inferior merit . The story is very improbable , and not very interesting . The pictures of scenery are less true to nature than in the previous volumes , and seem to indicate that Cooper had little or no personal acquaintance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , has several passages of much interest , one of the best of which is the scene in which the aged trapper discovers , in the person of a young officer , the grandson of Duncan Heywood and Alice Munro , whom , half a century before , he had protected when in such imminent jeopardy on the rocks of Glenn 's // Falls and among the mountains of Lake George . The death of Abiram White is very striking , though reminding the reader too much of a similar scene in the Spy . The grand deformity of the story is the wretched attempt at humor in the person of Dr. Obed Battius . David Gamut , in The Mohicans , is bad enough ; hut Battius outherods Herod , and great must he the merit of the hook which one such incuhus would not sink beyond redemption . The novel , which first brought the name of Cooper into distinguished notice , was The Spy ; and this hook , which gave him his earliest reputation , will contribute largely to preserve it . The story is full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn with singular skill . rphe Pilot is usually considered the best of Cooper 's sea tales . It is in truth a masterpiece of his genius ; and although the reader is apt to pass with impatience over the long conversations among the ladies at St. Ruth 's , and between Alice Dunscombe and the disguised Paul Jones , yet he is amply repaid when he follows the author to his congenial element . The description of the wreck of the Ariel , and the death 9f Long Tom Coffin , can scarcely he spoken of in terms of too much admiration . Long Tom is to Cooper 's sea tales what Leatherstocking is to the novels of the forest , - a conception so original and forcible , that posterity will hardly suffer it to escape from remembrance . The Red Rover , The WaterWitch , and the remainder of the sea tales , are marked with the same excellences and defects with the novels already mentioned , and further comments would therefore be useless . The recent death of the man who had achieved so much in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have done , a general expression of regret ; and the outcries , not unprovoked , which of late have been raised against him , are drowned in the voice of sorrow . The most marked and original of American writers has passed from among us . It was an auspicious moment when his earlier works first saw the light ; for there was promise in their rude vigor , - a good hope that from such rough beginnings the country might develop a literary progeny which , taking lessons in the graces , and refining with the lapse of years , might one day do honor to its parentage ; and when the chastened genius of Bryant arose , it seemed that the fulfilment of such // a hope was not far remote . But this fair promise has failed , and to this hour the purpose , the energy , the passion of America have never found their adequate expression on the printed page . The number of good writers truly American , by which we mean all those who are not imitators of foreign modes , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor are the writers of this small class , not excepting even Bryant himself , in any eminent degren the favorites of those among their countrymen who make pretensions to taste and refinement . As in life and manners the American people seem bent on aping the polished luxury of another hemisphere , so likewise they reserve their enthusiasm and their purses for the honeyed verse and the sugared prose of an emasculate and supposititious literature . Some French writer , - Chateaubriand , we believe , observes that the only portion of the American people who exhibit any distinctive national character are the backwoodsmen of the West . The remark is not strictly true . The whole merchant marine , from captains to cabin-boys , the lumbermen of Maine , the farmers of New England , and indeed all the laboring population of the country , not of foreign origin , are marked with strong and peculiar traits . But when we ascend Into the educated and polished classes , these peculiarities are smoothed away , until , in many cases , they are invisible . An educated Englishman is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French ; but an educated American is apt to have no national character at all . The condition of the literature of the country is , as might be expected , in close accordance with these peculiarities of its society . With but few exceptions , the only books which reflect the national mind are those which emanate from , or are adapted to , the unschooled classes of the people ; such , for example , as Dr. Bird 's Nick of the Woods , The Life of David Crockett , The Big Bear of Arkansas , with its kindred legends , and , we may add , the earlier novels of Cooper . In the politer walks of literature , we find much grace of style , but very little originality of thought , - productions which might as readily be taken for the work of an Englishman as of an American . This lack of originality has been loudly complained of , but it seems to us inevitable under the circumstances . The // healthful growth of the intellect , whether national or individual , like healthful growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of internal energies , and not from foreign aid . Too much assistance , too many stimulants , weaken instead of increasing it . The cravings of the American mind , eager as they are , are amply supplied by the copious stream of English current literature . Thousands , nay , millions of readers and writers drink from this bounteous source , and feed on this foreign aliment , till the whole complexion of their thoughts is tinged with it , and by a sort of necessity they think and write at second hand . If this transatlantic supply were completely cut off , and the nation abandoned to its own resources , it would eventually promote , in a high degree , the development of the national intellect . The vitality and force , which are abundantly displayed in every department of active life , would soon find their way into a higher channel , to meet the new and clamorous necessity for mental food ; and in the space of a generation , the oft-repeated demand for an original literature would be fully satisfied . In respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully emancipated from their ancient colonial subjection . They can plan , invent , and achieve for themselves , and this , too , with a commanding success . But in all the finer functions of thought , in all matters of literature and taste , we are still essentially provincial . England once held us in a state of political dependency . That day is past ; but she still holds us in an intellectual dependency far more complete . Her thoughts become our thoughts , by a process unconscious , but inevitable . She caters for our mind and fancy with a liberal hand . We are spared the labor of self-support ; but by the universal law , applicable to nations no less than individuals , we are weakened by the want of independent exercise . It is a matter of common remark , that the most highly educated classes among us are far from being the most efficient either in thought or action . The vigorous life of the nation springs from the deep rich soil at the bottom of society . Its men of greatest influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who , by hard battling with the world , and boldly following out the bent of their native genius , have hewn their own way to wealth , station , or knowledge , from the ploughshare or the forecastle . The // comparative shortcomings of the best educated among us may be traced to several causes ; but , as we are cOnstrained to think , they are mainly owing to the fact that the highest civilization of America is communicated from without instead of being developed from within , and is therefore nerveless and unproductive .
