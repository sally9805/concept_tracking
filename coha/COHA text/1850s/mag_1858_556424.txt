txt ART . VII . Currency or Money ; its Nature and Uses , and the Effects of the Circulation of Bank-Notes for Currency . By a Merchant of Boston . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 185g. 8vo. pp. 112 . Tins pamphlet , anonymous on its title-page , bears affixed to its Preface the initials " S. H. , " which , it is well known , designate Samuel Hooper , whose experience as a merchant , financier , and legislator might give weight to his opinions , were they not sustained by reasonings in themselves satisfactory . Had the work fallen into our hands when it first appeared , we should have promptly noticed it . We did not know of its existence till the forecast shadow , which it announced as already lowering over the seeming prosperity of our mercantile estate , had become apparent and portentous to every eye . It is a searching analysis of the basis of our currency , the elements of its value , the causes of its fluctuation , and the effects of that fluctuation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wages of industry . It announces , indeed , only such truths as have become axioms in political economy among its French expositors ; but it has been our unenviable distinction on this side of the Atlantic , that our legislators , bankers , and merchants have demeaned themselves as if the science of finance were still wholly empirical , and they the pioneers in its test-experiments . Our last number appearbd during the most disastrous paroxysm of alarm and distress that has as yet marked the monetary history of our nation . The panic has now subsided , leaving us in an entirely altered condition , with crippled industry , diminished prices , and a contracted currency . // The storm struck us with topsails and studding-sails spread fearlessly to the wind ; the ship , thrown on her beam-ends , has righted with the loss of all her top-hamper , and now what canvas remains is close reefed , and she feels her cautious way with lead and line . Before the damage is repaired , and the weather-beaten craft takes the open sea again , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remote , of our late calamitous experience , and to gather from the past admonitions that may be serviceable in the future . Credit , as its name imports , is an intellectual creation . It is belief attended by corresponding action ; and as with regard to everything else , so as to monetary affairs , belief may be well founded , inadequately founded , or baseless . If well founded , it can suffer no shock ; if otherwise , its permanence depends on the creditor 's ignorance or heedlessness . Property is the sole basis of credit ; and the indebtedness which an individual may safely incur is measured by the convertible value of his property . In certain conditions of the public mind , one may exceed this measure , and may obtain credit on an inflated estimate of his property , or on the anticipated profits of his business . When money is abundant , and the average rate of profits high , the lender 's credit or belief readily attaches itself to imaginary values or to gains yet to accrue , and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than he owns , without having his solvency called in question . But when money becomes scarce , its owner , being then able to choose among borrowers , scrufinizes the condition of his debtors , and easily takes alarm , if there be one whose present means are insufficient to meet his obligations . And , in like manner , when business is paralyzed , or its profits impaired , creditors who have depended in part on those profits for their reimbursement , regard their debts as insecure , and urge *m settlement at the earliest moment . A single con spicuous failure has a similar effect upon the whole class of creditors , and may thus be the proximate cause of a series of suspensions and failures extending through a whole country , and continuing till it has involved all whose indebtedness exceeds the convertible value of their property . Within the last few years there has been in our country a // combination of causes tending to expand the credit of individuals and corporations beyond its actual basis . In part the influx of gold from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper currency , by diminishing the value of money , have caused the rapid expansion of estimated values for almost every description of property , and thus have made the anticipation of still larger values a ground of credit . With brief intervals of depression , the average rate of freights has been high , and the mere carrying trade has in some instances been sufficiently lucrative nearly to reimburse the cost of a ship by the profits of a single year . Most departments of commerce have yielded a large percentage of revenue . The seeming , though in almost every instance unreal , prosperity of our older railways , has given a stimulus to enterprise in the construction of new routes of travel ; and railway corporations have been enabled , by the prestige of dividends that were never earned , to obtain loans to an incredible amount , and often on an incredibly slender basis of actual property and potential income . Meanwhile the large returns accruing from almost every species of investment have tempted merchants and business men to become borrowers on a larger scale than was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been possessed of a sufficient working capital has been tempted to invest it in stocks , and to rely on loans or long credits for the means of conducting his own operations . The importer has speculated in Western city lots , and discounted the notes of the jobbers to meet his obligations in the foreign market . The jobber has bought railroad bonds under par with his funds in hand , and , as his notes came to maturity , has paid them with the paper of his customers . And the retail dealer , buying on eight months ' credit , and thus realizing the proceeds of his sales before they became due , has gone with them into the stock market , and ' resorted to loans when his notes reached maturity . Thus the summer of 18*7 found the whole mercantile community , though apparently prosperous , with an amount of indebtedness , mutual , to banks and to capitalists , exceeding to a degree before unprecedented the aggregate convertible value of the property in hand . Much of this property , too , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate in the new cities of the West had fallen in the market . Almost every description of railroad property had become depreciated ; in numerous instances , the original stock of railways had grown worthless ; third and second mortgages could hardly have been exchanged for an equivalent amount of blank paper ; and even first mortgages were below par . Manufactured goods had been produced and imported to such an extent as to exceed the highest possible demand of the season , and thus to threaten a general reduction of prices . There were thus accumulated all the materials for a universal panic . At this juncture occurred the failure of the Ohio Life and Trust Company , an institution which had stood high in the public confidence , and had extensive connections in all our great cities . Its suspension at any other period might have affected only those who held its obligations , or were interested in it as depositors or stockholders . But the credits of the country were an inverted pyramid , and needed but a touch for them to topple and fall . Creditors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loans were called in on maturity ; extensions and new loans were refused . Prices still falling , and threatening still further decline , the assets of the indebted class were dwindling in the prospect , and could no longer sustain credit . The reduction of the amount of credits became therefore inevitable ; and the measure of that reduction was the difference between the expanded and reputed values of property , with its anticipated profits , in a season of general confidence , and the convertible values of that same property on a reduced scale and with no anticipation of profit . To this latter standard , or near it , we may trust that the disasters of the last five months have reduced the mutual indebtedness of our business community ; and if so , we may anticipate the speedy revival of commercial and manufacturing enterprise , on a safer basis , with more prudent counsels , and with a more healthful activity . We have thus given , in the simplest form , what seems to us the genesis and theory of the recent convulsion in our mercantile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not but be followed by a ruinous contraction , there lies // 168 THE FINANCIAL CRISIS . a cause which , unless removed , must produce in our future , at no distant intervals , vicissitudes similar in kind , but of severity enhanced by the increased extent and complexity of our business relations . We are accustomed to call ours a rich nation . We are rich , as regards the annual products of our industry and our ability to command the comforts and elegances of life ; but we are poor as to the movable and convertible capital which alone can preserve the business of a country from disastrous fluctuations . In what we term prosperous times , our people collectively are transacting a business beyond all due proportion to their capital . We are emulating the gigantic and world-wide enterprises of England , with but a mere pittance of that accumulated wealth of centuries which constitutes her safety-fund and movement-fund . Among the indications of our lack of capital is the high rate of interest , ranging by law from six to ten per cent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest of these rates , except on loans to the national , state , or iity governments for a long term of years , and often rising far above the highest for well-secured business notes that have but a short time to run . Add to this the fact , that but six of our States are free from debt , while the aggregate debt of the States , larger than at any previous period , falls but little short of two hundred and fifty millions , a very great portion of it incurred in the aid of enterprises undertaken by private corporations , which had neither the funds nor the credit to complete them . The amount of county , city , and town debts can hardly be less than the aggregate indebtedness of the States ; and where these have not been incurred to aid corporations , they have been incurred because the capital of individual citizens would not bear the full amount of taxation needed for the erection of public buildings and other necessary expenses of government . We have before us an imperfect schedule of the debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a complete schedule could fall very little short of four hundred millions . On all these debts the annual earnings of our national industry are chargeable with not less than sixty millions of dollars , which is about two thirds of the annual value of the cotton exported , // and nearly one fourth of the entire value of our annual exports . At least one third of this indebtedness is for foreign capital , the interest on which must be transmitted without return in goods or money , and is a dead loss to the country . Much of this debt , it may indeed be apprehended , will be cancelled by the insolvency of railroad corporations . Many of our railways do not , and can not for years to come , pay their running expenses and keep themselves in repair ; and a railway that yields no revenue to the stockholders is worth only the iron , minus the cost of taking it up and conveying it to market , and the land , minus the cost of reducing or rai*ing it to the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw off the burden by declared insolvency , will ensue only after a long conflict between the sanguine hopefulness of our people and prolonged and chronic disappointment . The art of so employing figures as to conceal the facts which they purport to make known , - an art which has probably been carried to its highest perfection by the financial employ*s of these corporations , - will still , undoubtedly , juggle wasted millions from capitalists at home and abroad ; and we shall carry this increasing load till it receives that last proverbial ounce which breaks the long-suffering back . But it may be said that these railways are developing the resources of the country so rapidly as to compensate for their heavy drain upoI* our capital . Whether this is the case it may not be difficult to determine . The cost of the railways to whose statistics we have access has been about six hundred millions of dollars , or twice their aggregate debt . We will assume this as their actual cost , though the entire cost can not have been less than eight hundred millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still less do our augmented imports indicate a productiveness keeping more than even pace with our population* The population of the Union is increasing at the rate of about six hundred thousaiid per annum . Considering that the increase consists of infant children , and of immigrants nine tenths of whom are meagrely fed and clothed , and that the average life in the country of the year 's new-born and immigrants is but half of // the year , we should find sixty dollars a large estimate for the subsistence of each . Assuming this , however , we have thirtysix millions as the aggregate cost of sustaining the annual increase of our population . In other words , the products of our national industry , which furnish no increased surplus for exportation , are augmented annually by an amount , which at the outside does not exceed six per cent on the lowest estimate of the capital expended in the construction of our railways , leaving the cost of their management ( fifty millions or more ) , and their wear and depreciation , without any counterbalancing increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any single railway , computing the aggregate amount of interest , running expenses , and depreciation , and then attempting in vain to imagine an equal increase of productiveness on its route , or in the regions which it serves as a medium of communication . Thus , the New York Central Railroad could compensate the country for its cost only by stimulating an increased productiveness to the mount of eight millions of dollars per annum . Our railways , then , so far from being a means of the increase of capital , fall far short of paying for their continued existence , and are consuming every year more wealth than they nurse into being . Let it not be imagined that we would , if we could , reverse the progress in the means of communication , which has formed the prominent economical feature of the last quarter of a century . Where neither fraud , peculation , nor arrant folly has left its record , we rejoice in the enterprise , however precipitate , which has thus belted the continent . These iron bonds have given more strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the hot war of party with party , and section with section , had it not been for such clamps , the dissilient States might even now have been arrayed in rival confederacies . Iron , too , has reasserted in our Western world its old prerogative as the prime material agent in civilization ; for , had not locomotion been thus expedited , barbarism must have settled down on our tracts of inland wilderness and prairie , and our nation would have diffused itself in space only to decline in all the elements of culture // and refinement . Nor do we deem it other than an inestimable privilege to have opened genial homes for the fugitives from need and oppression that have poured in upon us from the Old World . We have spoken of railways only in relation to capital ; and we maintain that , with all that they have done and are doing for union , civilization , and humanity , they have drained and are still draining the national capital to an amount immeasurably beyond any added wealth of which they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the deficit of capital in our country is the increasing disrelish of our free native populatioii for productive industr*y . In the Free States , foreign operatives , with their lower standard of intelligence and the cruel prejudice with which they are regarded , are degrading labor in the general estimation , in very much the same way in which slavery degrades it in the Southern States . Since Irishmen have swarmed through our land as hod-carriers , coal-heavers , diggers , and day-laborers , there has been a growing reluctance to engage in hand-labor on the part of native Americans . Foreigners , as farm servants , are supplanting the children of the soil ; as manufacturers , are superseding the sons and daughters of our yeomanry ; as domestics , coachmen , and gardeners , are repelling from these posts the classes that once sought in them an honest livelihood . Their children are in training in large numbers for the mechanical professions ; and , in that same proportion , mechanics decline educating their sons for their own and similar callings . The consequence is a wasteful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eand corn unerce ; and every supernumerary in these professions defrauds the community of the cost of his own subsistence , and of the revenue that should accrue from his industry to the common stock . It is not too much to say that , with a reduction by one half of the regular practitioners of medicine , and an entire abatement of the multiform nuisance of quacks of every name , our bills of mortality would be essentially lessened . A similar reduction in the legal profession could have no other effect than the decline of needless litigation . In the various departments of commerce , the stages through which goods must pass from the producer to the consumer are inju // riously multiplied ; and there is hardly a commodity which is not thus retarded in its natural progress , till it has paid black mail to half a dozen intermediary holders who contribute in no wke to its legitimate transfer . Then there is the horde of mere speculators , whether in stocks , wild lands , city lots , or merchandise , whose only function is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sellers , and introduce into transactions intrinsically necessary and honest the hazards and chicanery of the gambling-table . Could we turn into the ranks of productive industry all who are not needed elsewhere , this would alone be sufficient to create a large annual surplus of industrial earnings , which would contribute most healthfully toward that xvorking capital , the lack of which is a fruitful source of financial embarrassment . Then , too , we are a wasteful people in our personal habits . We live too fast . Our unproductive consumption , in proportion to our population , exceeds that of any other country upon earth . Of a part of this excess we can think only with complacency and pride . We rejoice that our laborers and mechanics have an unprecedentedly high standard of intelligence , comfort , and refinement . We would not bate one jot from the expenditure which ministers to mental improvement , to the joy of home-life , or to the amenities of social intercourse . But , beyond this , all except the very poorest sacrifice large portions of their earnings to mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to good taste as to prudence . Our amusements are expensive , without being genial , refreshing , or invigorating . Our holidays , too few were they devoted to innocent mirth and simple festivity , are too many for the riotous , wasteful , enervating dissipation to which they are given up . Our people seem to have no hearty love of pleasure , and estimate what they call by that naiue , not by their personal revenue of enjoyment from it , but by the amount of money they squander in it . We are prodigal in our tables . Here , again , our standard is not healthful nourishment , but cost . Let the favorite viands of this year be furnished the next year at a reduced price , they will be spurned from three fourths of our larders . We reject the more wholesome grains ; we look askance at the // ho flour darkened with the sweetest and most nutritious particles of its native kernel , and choose for our domestic use tht t for which the demon of dyspepsia might have woven the boltingcloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree than any other people not hyperborean , on animal food , and make this carnivorous habit quadruply costly and destructive , by suffering the juices of the meat to evaporate in cooking , and contenting ourselves with scorched fibrine ; while a French family might feed luxuriously on the refuse of one of our hugely spread , but coarsely and unhealthfully served American tables . In apparel , neatness , appropriateness , and comfort might be attained for less than half of what is now expended in setting them at defiance . In other countries , only a small fraction of the female population deem it their provvince to sacrifipe economy , health , and grace to the reigning fashion , whatever it be ; here , almost every woman not a pauper regards herself as under this necessity . Our annual importation of from thirty to fifty million dollars ' worth of silk and silk goods is but one index of the extravagance in dress , which is certainly not the least prominent of our national characteristics . Among our other follies , our courteous English visitors have anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steamboats . In our large cities , the sojourner pays at least half of his exorbitant tavern bill for tapestry and gilding that interfere with his comfort , for plate from which food tastes no better than if served on porcelain , and for servants whose duty it is to give as munch annoyance and as little help as the circumstances of each individual case will admit of . With a still more foolish improvidence , on some of our waters , we find double the sum which would build and maintain a stanch and well-appointed ste'mboat expended on cobwork and upholstery ; thin boilers and Wilton carpets , machinery that may have survived half a dozen wrecks and furniture that has not seen its first winter . In these , and in more ways than we can specify , are our people wasting what ought to be a yearly accumulation of capital . We believe that the industrial interests of the nation demand retrenchment and economy in all classes but the ab-15* // jeetly poor . We fear that our children will not " rise up , and call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything except our daily living , and are leaving them no sinking fund for the liquidation of their inherited debts . We can not regard our people as rich enough to be just to coming generations , till we know of at least one costly public building , church , school-house , court-house , jail , or capitol , or one great public work , or one extensive manufactory , that has been paid for by those under whose auspices it was constructed . If the reverses of fortune which have of late befallen so many of the worthiest men and best citizens , and have made all who remain unimpoverished tremble for the permanence of their fair estate , shall have generated more simple and frugal habits among those whose social position gives weight to their example , the disastrous crisis through which we have just passed will have been , not a public calamity , but a public benefit and blessing . But retrenchment must begin with those VhO can not incur even the suspicion of being compelled to it , - with the acknowledged leaders in wealth as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while they can not even creep up , the social scale . It may here be asked , If there is a deficiency in our national capital , - in working capital , which is money or property convertible into money , - why have prices ruled so high , and increased so rapidly for the last ten years ? High prices certainly are a prima facie evidence of the abundance of money . If a bushel of wheat will purchase no more iron , or cotton , or beef , than it would ten years ago , yet can be exchanged for twice as much money , this fact might be assumed as a proof that the moneyed wealth of the country has doubled within ten years . This would be the case , had actual money been our medium of exchange , and our sole or chief currency . But if other commodities , under fluctuating conditions , have filled the place and served the office of money , then high prices are no evidence of pecuniary wealth . Should two thirds of the community take to wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be comparatively scarce , and yet would decline in value . And so , if the fashion is set of using property of all kinds instead of gold // and silver , gold and silver may be diminished in quantity , and yet may be cheaper than ever before , that is , may be required in larger quantities than ever before for any definite purpose for which one may see fit to use them . Now this is precisely what has taken place . Property of every description , and reputed property , pretended property , future property , possible property , have all been converted into money . Credits , based on everything and on nothing , have passed current for the payment of dues . Goods and property have been bought on long credits , which , when they expired , have been replaced by other credits , and they by others still ; and when at last nominal liquidation took place , it has been by the substitution , for the written notes of individuals , of the engraved notes of corporations . These last have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they purport to be the representatives of money , but they are not so . There has not been a solvent bank in the country , - not one which could come near the fulfilment of its pledge to pay at sight its promises to pay in circulation .. 1 On the first of January , 18.56 , there were in Mississippi nearly forty-two dollars of bank-notes in circulation to one dollar of specie in vault , and in the whole country the circulation of bank-notes exceeded that of specie in the vaults of the banks in the proportion of ten to one . Banknotes actually represent debts due to the banks , and those debts are represented by the houses , lands , and merchandise which have been purchased by bank loans . The bank-notes in circulation are nearly equal in amount to all the specie in the country , and considerably exceed in amount the specie in circulation ; for a large amount of specie always lies inactive in bank vaults and in the Sub-Treasuries . We have then a depreciated currency , even when paper money is nominally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that an unredeemable paper currency falls beneath its par value in specie , while redeemable paper depreciates with itself the specie with which it has concurrent circulation . The value of money , like that of everything else , is determined by the relation of the supply to the demand ; and if paper not representing actual money is received as equivalent to money , the supply diminishes the value both of the paper and money , // just as burnt peas , did they suit the general taste as well as coffee , would reduce the market-value of coffee . It is perfectly obvious that an inflated paper currency , together with the habit of lax and long credits , places the industry of a country at a disadvantage as compared with countries which have a sounder and safer system of currency and credit , and turns the balance of trade in their favor . Unlimited paper currency and protective duties - hard money and free trade - are respectively parts of the same system . Our error has been , not in lowering our tariff of duties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need no protection for our manufactures , did we pay for our homegrown raw materials and for our labor in gold and silver . But inasmuch as the currency of France and of England approaches nearer than ours to a specie basis , their homegrown materials and their labor are cheaper than ours . Nay , in manufactures in which labor forms a large ingredient , they can afford to purchase materials from us , and can then undersell us in the finished goods . Hence it is that they of late years have undersold us in our own markets . The rate at which we purchase their goods is determined by our depreciated currency ; but at the same time we pay for those goods in gold and silver or their equivalents , thus draining our country of its specie , and inviting still larger issues of paper to meet the increasing deficit . But the evil does not stop here . A paper currency is not only a depreciated , but a necessarily fluctuating currency , especially when it is furnished by numerous independent corporations , of which none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their resources . The tendency of the system is to alternate seasons of expansion and paroxysms of contraction , the former generating causes which must needs issue in the latter . It is a system , too , by which the banks can lend the most when their aid is the least requisite , and the least in the very stress of need . A bank has for the measure of its loans its capital , its average deposits , and its average outstanding circulation , - the first a constant element , the last two variable . We have seen that it is the tendency of a depreciated currency , by creating high prices , to // encourage importation . When the imports exceed the exports , there is a balance against the country , which must be liquidated in specie . This specie the banks for the most part supply , and the supply is drawn from them by the return of their circulation to their counters . When the draft for specie has been for some time continued , or is at any one time peculiarly urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and their only remedy is to call in at once their loans ( if they have made any ) on demand , and their loans on time as fast as they reach maturity . The payment of each loan virtually cancels its own amount of circulation ; for the payrheut is made either in the bank 's own bills , which it thus redeems , or in the bills of other banks which it can exchange for specie . But in this state of things new loans can not be made ; for they must needs be made in the bank 's own bills , which will at once find their way back to its counter . By this curtailment made simultaneously by the banks of the great commercial cities , ( and if by the New York banks , they necessitate the same movement through the country , ) the currency is diminished in quantity , the relative value of money is raised , and a general decline of prices ensues . This decline renders securities that were deemed ample inadequate , alarms the whole class of creditors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes . They , no longer able to obtain bank accommodations , are obliged either to pay a rate of interest which combines compensation for the use of the money and insurance for the safety of the debt , or to sacrifice property at a rate below its cost and its intrinsic value ; and if the first alternative be resorted to , it often only staves off the latter till the sacrifice is still more ruinous . Thus the individual or the firm that six months previously could honestly reckon a large surplus of assets over debts , may be forced into bankruptcy with a deficit as large . All this while , importation declines ; the demand for specie slackens ; the bank vaults are filled ; and at length it becomes safe for the banks to extend their accommodations and increase their circulation . Then commences the steady process of expansion , till again a crisis ensues which compels a sudden and rapid change of policy . We thus see , that , were all // other causes inactive , our banking system alone would produce a periodical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be fittingly inquired , On what defensible grounds of justice are private corporations permitted to furnish the currency of the country ? The transaction is intrinsically unfair . It affixes the government sanction to a procedure by which the bank gets a double interest on every dollar of its circulation . The bank , by issuing its bills , virtually borrows so much money of the community without interest , for every holder of its bills is its creditor to that amount ; and while it can ward off the payment of these debts , it may hold on interest to their full amount the obligations of its borrowers . In the States where bank capital is taxed , the tax is indeed regarded in the light of compensation for this monopoly ; but it may reasonably be doubted whether it is an adequate compensation , and if it be , it properly belongs , not to the government , but to the holders of bills , who , if compelled ( as they are virtually , if not legally ) to use evidences of debt instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are their creditors . The sudden suppression of a paper currency , however , would occasion a decline of prices ruinous to all holders of property , and would render the cancelling of all existing obligations oppressive to debtors , and unduly advantageous to creditors . Approaches to a specie currency should therefore be gradually made . The first step might be the prohibition of the issue of small bills . On commercial grounds it would he well that our currency should be assimilated to that of France and of England , the countries with which our mercantile intercourse is the most intimate , and which therefore should not have the opportunity of underselling us in our own markets , by means of the depreciation of our currency below theirs . In England no bank-notes are permitted below the value of five pounds ; in France , none below one hundred francs . Our first step should be the suppression of bank issues below the denomination of twenty dollars . The change brought about by such a measure would be very great ; but it would be gradual . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a largely increased issue of bills of the higher denominations , and individual credits would be more frequently employed than now to hold smaller dues in suspense . But the needs of the community would by degrees draw into circulation increased quantities of the precious metals , till in a few years the entire place now occupied by bills of from one to ten dollars , inclusive , would be filled by gold and silver . When this state of things should have been reached , it would be seasonable to agitate the question of a still further reform , with the view of confining the circulation , properly so called , to the precious metals . There would , indeed , still be needed convertible paper of some kind for the transmission of values between distant places . This need might be met by drafts on the United States Treasury , obtainable for a slight percentage , by bills of exchange , or by bank orders made redeemable by arrangements that could be easily effected between city and city . There can be no doubt that the ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest degree beneficial to all departments of industry and enterprise . It is a currency that can not fluctuate . It may expand with the increased quantity of the precious metals , but there is hardly a possibility of its contracting ; and its expansion must take place by the operation of causes which operate equally throughout the civilized world , thus keeping the international relations of currency unchanged . Our country , by ridding itself of its bank circulation , would attain for itself a higher level of general prosperity than could be witnessed elsewhere , and a vantage-ground in every career of honorable competition , for the not far distant period when the same reform shall have taken effect through the whole commercial world . With a metallic currency , the low prices of labor , provisions , and home-grown materials would at once give our manufacturers such protection as a precarious tariff could never afford , and would insure them the command of the domestic market , and a sufficient foreign outlet for their surplus products . The growth of manufacturing industry would stim ul ate agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean to find purchasers , but would be in perpetual demand among the // THE FINANCIAL CRISIS . artisans and operatives . Then , too , the cheapness of our fabrics would enable us to export them with ample profit , and to offer them even in competition with EngliTh or French manufactures on their own soil , thus furnishing a far more lucrative husiness for our ships than when they load with deal on the Canadian rivers , or sail in ballast from New York , with the mere chance of engaging a paying freight in Liverpool . Whenever this state of things is r cached , exchange will be in our favor , and the current of metallic wealth will set in upon us , instead of receding from us . But for years , nay , for centuries to come , till our whole territory from ocean to ocean is reclaimed , settled , and developed in all its capacities , the influx of the precious metals may continue , without raising our prices in comparison with those of other countries ; for our growing population , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bringing successively less and less eligible soils into productiveness , and the enterprise needed to feed and clothe our increasing millions , will absorb into use every accession of the circulating medium as fast as it accrues . Bnt how can a reform in the currency he effected ? It is beyond hope that the individual States should concur in any measure of the kind . But is it beyond the scope of the general government ? A strict constructionist might not indeed find license for it in the Constitution . But recent judicial decisions have taught us that the Constitution , as expounded by its official expositors , means whatever the people or the goveminent would have it mean . And they are right . We yield to none in our regret for the ground assumed by the Supreme Conrt in the IDred Scott case ; but we regard such a construction as inevitable , so long as the national administration was committed to the principles it recognizes ; and we even rejoice in the demonstration it furnishes of the flexibility of our Constitution , and its capacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . A pernIanent written constitution is in the nature of things impossible . A nation 's constitution is at every moment composed of the nation 's existing usages , opinions , and resolves . The only difference between the British and the American Constitution is that the former is modi // fled directly by the will of the nation , as expressed in acts of Parliament ; while the latter demands the word-jugglery of the Supreme Bench to consummate any modification made by Congress , or by the general voice . The Constitution confers on Congress the exclusive right " to coin money , " and to " regulate the value thereof " ; and what is engraving but an alias for coining ? or why may not Congress , as a " regulator of ' value , " declare engraved money to be without value ? Again , the States are forbidden to " emit bills of credit , " and " to make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts . " But qui facit per aliurn facit per se . Bank-bills are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in authorizing their issue . Moreover , their currency makes them , if not a legal , a necessary tender in payment of debts ; for it renders the procuring of specie for the payment of debts at all times difficult , and often impossible without a premium . And especially , when a State legalizes the suspension of specie payments by the banks , ( as Pennsylvania has recently , and as most of the States did in 1837 , ) such legislation can have no other intent than that bank-bills shall take the place of specie in the payment of debts . Yet more , when , by a fluctuating paper currency , specie itself is depreciated , and made of uncertain and varying value , that which the Constitution declares to be the only legal tender is deprived of its function as an equitable measure of value , and the undoubted and manifest intent of that constitutional provision is frustrated . We can not but think , then , that the whole subject of a paper currency falls within the province of the general government ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectional strife for the consideration of an interest which vitally concerns all portions of the Union . A properly regulated currency , by giving free scope to the enterprise and industrial capacities of the whole country , would tend to the peaceful settlement of the controversies which now agitate us , and which are only inflamed by the retaliatory legislation by which the North and the South alternately seek to depress each other 's prosperity . On a field of open competition , if free labor does not demonstrate its superiority , and win the reluctant and in time*the hearty suffrage of its opponents , we // are content to take issue on the side of slavery ; for we do not believe that economical and moral laws can work otherwise than harmoniously ; and did what we conceive to be a moral law fail by economical tests , we should regard our judgment as reversed by the decision without appeal of Him whose providence is the arbiter of national fortunes no less than of individual destiny .. Let it not be supposed that what we have written has been dictated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the detail of our personal relations and sympathies , they would suggest a bias in the opposite direction . Were xve to strike those concerned in the management of these institutions from our list of friends and associates , the catalogue of the residue would be meagre indeed . But it would be for the interest of the banks to be relieved from the responsibility of furnishing a circulating medium . Their chief dangers are those incurred in consequence of this function . The most arduous and harassing duty of their officers is to protect their circulation . And when the contraction of their currency is forced upon them , it is only at the hazard of the most serious losses from the insolvency of their borrowers . Banks could still lend to the amount of their entire circulation , plus the minimum , if not the average , of their deposits ; and the interest on such loans as were based on their deposits would leave a surplus above the expenses of management , thus affording for net profits more than the legal or usual interest upon their capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of their aggregate capital , and in the New England States collectively the proportion exceeds one fourth . Moreover , the repeal of usury laws would be the necessary accompaniment of such measures as should look toward the establishment of a specie currency . These laws , by depriving money of its value in open market , compel its holders to increase its quantity by its paper representatives . It must for the most part be only a depreciated currency that is worth but six per cent in New England . Were sugar or pepper legally restricted to a low average price , its adulteration would be necessary whenever an increased demand or a diminished supply augmented its actual value . Bank issues are an adul // teratioii of the currency , which is rendered necessary and legitimate by a similar error of legislation . But were specie the only article offered in the money market , its value , the profits of its lenders , and of course the profits of the banks , would be regulated by the relation of the supply to the demand . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be left to be influenced by the same laws which determine the current value of all other commodities . The only legislation needed on this subject is a legal determination of the interest to be charged ou accounts and dues , with reference to which there has been no stipulation of the rate of interest . We have now presented such views as have occurred to us in connection with those great financial questions which have been forced upon us by the stress of the times . We are aware that they differ from views that have been ably advocated in this journal in former years . They do not represent the creed of any sect in politics or in political economy , but are simply our own opinions , offered with all proper diffidence , yet as a contribution which we have deemed it our duty to make to the fair discussion of subjects that are pressed upon the immediate and decisive action of our merchants , financiers , and legislators . While on not a few concerns of national interest we dissent lob CWlo from our Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , we are glad to quote authority so eminent for some of the views developed in the foregoing pages . Since we wrote them , we have received from a friend a copy of remarks made by Mr. Buchanan in the United States Senate on the suspension of specie payments in 1837 , from which we make the following extract . " Let me now recur to the proposition with which I commenced ; and I repeat that I do not pretend to mathematical accuracy in the illustration which I shall present . The United States carry on a trade with Germany and France , - the former a hard-money country , and the latter approaching it so nearly as to have no bank-notes in circulation under the denomination of five hundred francs , or nearly one hundred dollars . On the contrary , the United States is emphatically a papermoney country , havin* , eight hundred banks of issue , - all of them // emitting notes of a denomination as low as five dollars , and most of them one , two , and three dollar notes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these banks , they issue three , four , five , and some of them as high as ten , and even fifteen dollars of paper . This produces a vast but ever-changing expansion of the currency , and consequent increase of the prices of all articles , the value of which is not regulated by the foreign demand , above the prices of similar articles in Germany and France . At particular stages of our expansions , we might with justice apply the principle which I have stated to our trade with these countries , and assert that , from the great redundancy of our currency , articles are manufactured in France and Germany for one half of their actual cost in this country . Let me present an example . In Germany , where the currency is purely metallic , and the cost of everything is reduced to a hard-money standard , a piece of broadcloth can be manufactured for fifty dollars , the manufacture of which , in our country , from the expansion of our paper currency , would cost one hundred dollars . What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cloth into our country and sells it for a hundred dollars . Does not every person perceive that the redun. dancy of our currency is equal to a premium of one hundred per cent in favor of the foreign manufacturer ? No tariff of protection , unless it amounted to prohibition , could counteract this advantage in favor of foreign manufactures . I would to Heaven that I could arouKe the attention of every manufacturer of the nation to this important subject . " The foreign manufacturer will not receive our bank-notes in payment . He will take nothing home except gold and silver , or bills of exchange , which are equivalent . He does not expend this money here , where he would be compelled to support his family , and to purchase his labor and materials at the same rate of prices which he receives for his manufactures . On the contrary ; he goes home , purchases his labor , his wool , and all other articles which enter into his manufacture , at half their cost in this country , and again returns to inundate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures . I might cite many other examples , but this , I trust , will be sufficient to draw public attention to the subject . This depreciation of our currency is , therefore , equivalent to a direct protection granted to the foreign over the domestic manufacturer . It is impossible that our manufacturers should be able to sustain such an unequal competition . " Sir , I solemnly believe that , if we could but reduce this inflated paper bubble to anything like reasonable dimensions , New Engh*nd would become the most prosperous manufacturing country that the sun ever shone upon . Why can not we manufacture goods , and especially // 185 cotton goods , which will go into successful competition with British manufactures in foreign markets ? Have we not the necessary capital ? Have we not the industry ? Have we not the machinery ? And , above all , are not our skill , energy , and enterprise proverbial throughout the world ? Land is also cheaper here than in any other country on the face of the earth . We possess every advantage which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they are all counteracted by the folly of man . The raw material costs us less than it does the English , because this is an article the price of which depends upon foreign markets , and is not regulated by our own inflated currency . We therefore save the freight of the cotton across the Atlantic , and that of the manufactured article on its return here . What is the reason that , with all these advantages , and with the protective duties which our laws afford to the domestic manufacturer of cotton , we can not obtain exclusive possession of the home market , and successfully contend for the markets of the world ? It is simply because we manufacture at the nominal prices of our own inflated currency , and are compelled to sell at the real prices of other nations . Reduce our nominal to the real standard of prices throughout the world , and you cover our country with blessings and benefits . I wish to Heaven I could speak in a voice loud enough to be heard throughout New England ; because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subject , their own intelligence and native sagacity would teach them how injuriously they are affected by our bloated banking and credit system , and would enable them to apply the proper corrective . " In what we have now written , we have purposely confined our discussion to the causes of financial disturbance most nearly concerning ourselves . We forget not that , while we write , England is approaching or passing a crisis bearing some resemblance to our own recent experience , though evldently less extensive and severe ; and that the other commercial nations show symptoms of derangement in their monetary relations . The whole civilized world now virtually constitutes one confederate nationality as to matters of finance . Every quickened or slackened pulse-beat in the circulation of one member is felt in all . Especially must England be profoundly affected by the sudden suspension of purchases on the part of her best customer , by the unlooked for insolvency of her largest debtor . At the same time , the Crimean war and Australian emigration had largely reduced her produc-16* // Jan . THE FINANCIAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pecuniary resources of the country at least all the accessions of wealth derived from Australia ; and now the peril of her Eastern empire is renewing the drain of men and money . In France , too , the Credit illiobilier , of which our limited space precludes more than the mere mention , and which presents on a gigantic scale many of the worst features of our banking system , has been expanding credits to a dangerous extent , and thus rendering the financial condition of the country precarious and alarming . But , while we can not now extend our remarks so as to embrace the financial history or condition of France or England , it is worthy of note that from the suspension of specie payments by the Bank of England in 1793 , to the suppression of the small-bill circulation in 1829 , periods of financial distress had occurred at no very distant intervals ; while from the last-named date to the present crisis , the fluctuations in the money-market have never been rapid and violent , nor has there been in the kingdom any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial prosperity . But it is time that we return to the pamphlet named at the head of this article . It commences with a definition of money , an enumeration of the grounds on which gold and silver commend themselves for monetary uses , and the principles on which prices regulate themselves in the ratio of the relative supply of money and of the commodities for which it is exchanged . Then follows a demonstration of the inevitable tendency of paper money , whether irredeemable or nominally convertible , to depreciate the currency of which it forms a part . We have next a detailed " Sketch of the History of the Modern Currency of Great Britain , " which is followed by a masterly treatise , historical and argumentative , on the currency of the United States . This survey of the subject prepares the way and furnishes the grounds for an exhibition of the incomparably superior advantages of a specie oveW a mixed currency . The discussion is then narrowed to " The Practice of Banking , and Effects of the Currency in New England . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Massachusetts . It // is shown that it is perfectly easy for a company , not of capitalists and lenders , but of borrowers , to procure a bank charter , and to comply in form with all the legal conditions of their charter . No money need be furnished by the subscribers to the capital stock . Their subscription may be paid by checks on the new bank , and balanced by discounts made on the same day ; or , still better , by checks on other banks , based on the deposit in those banks of the bills of the new corporation obtained by loans . In the last case these checks , being payable in specie , may furnish the necessary specie for the vault of the new bank , while the bills paid out for the discounts obtained by its stockholders constitute its circulation , and their notes its loans . Thus the new bank enters at once on a thriving business , and can present a fair show of its condition , - just so long as its directors and large stockholders remain solvent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solvency still further in peril . Its shares are hypothecated as collateral security for yet- other loans , so that every dollar of its stock represents a double indebtedness on the part of those who virtually placed themselves before the community as capitalists . Banks thus organized are driven to desperate expedients to prevent their circulation from returning too rapidly upon them . Distant loans are made in small bills , which , from the very nature of the case , may pass through many hands before they find their way whence they came . Railroad and manufacturing companies have peculiar business facilities allowed them , and sometimes a bonus paid them , on condition of their using the small bills of a particular bank in change for the price of tickets or in payment of the wages of operatives . There is one of our principal railroads , at whose Boston terminus the bills given in change are always on the same bank . We have even known an itinerant umbrella-mender supplied with a huge roll of the bills of a bank , whose continued solvency has from its birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ultimate resort to a specie currency , Mr. looper gives the following approximate estimate of the amount of money required in a community for the transaction of its business . // Jan . THE FINANCIAL CRISIS . " The amount of money required to transact the business of a community , for which paper money can be substituted , is much less than is usually supposed by those who have not considered the subject . Financial writers variously calculate the whole amount required in an active business community at sums varying between ten and fifteen dollars a head for the population . With a mixed currency , consisting only in part of paper money , still less would be required . Ten dollars a head would probably be a large estimate for the amount of paper that could be substituted for coined money without greatly depreciating the currency . The amount of paper circulation in England , Scotland , and Ireland is less than forty millions sterling , equal to nearly thirty shillings sterling , or little more than seven dollars a head for the population . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commercial community as can be found in any part of the world , all the bank-notes are supplied by the State , and registered and countersi* , n ed by a State officer . No bank , whether it be incorporated or organized under the general law , is allowed to issue any other notes for circulation . According to the official returns on the 30th of September , 1854 , the whole amount of such notes furnished to incorporated banks was $ 19,300,963 , and to banks organized under the general banking law , $ 24,661,572 , making together $ 43,962,535 ; or about twelve dollars a head for the population of the State , including the amounts held by the banks , and therefore not in circulation . There is probably no community in the world where paper money is so freely used as in the State of Massachusetts . Each one of its hundred and sixty-eight banks can have printed and ready for use as many notes as they please . The law allows them to be circulated to the extent of one quarter more than their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The capital of the banks of Massachusetts exceeds fiftysix millions of dollars , which would allow an aggregate circulation of more than seventy millions of dollars . Some of the banks often exceed their proportion , but no notice has been taken of it , when the published returns have shown any of them to have exceeded the lawful limit of circulation . It appears by the annual official return for 1854 , that there are nearly twenty-five millions of the notes of the banks of Massachusetts in circulation . A large amount , however , of each others ' notes is returned as held by the banks themselves . Moreover , there is always a large amount of notes issued by banks in the country , instead of checks , which do not really become general circulation , being merely transmitted for payments in large sums , instead of a check or draft , to gain the advantage of a few days in interest , and they are immediately sent into the Suffolk or some other bank in Boston , which // acts as the agent of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills at these agency banks in Boston , which have been redeemed , but not yet sent back to the country banks that issued them , and must therefore appear in the returns as circulation . Making these allowances , the whole amount of bills actually circulating among the people in Massachusetts , does not probably exceed twelve or fifteen millions of dollars , or about from twelve to fifteen dollars a head for the whole population of the Commonwealth . This conforms very nearly with the issues of bank paper in the State of New York . If the actual amount of paper circulating in Massachusetts amounts to fifteen millions of dollars , since checks and drafts could be advantageously substituted for many of the purposes for which hank-bills are now used , it would not require more than ten millions of coined money , less than the product of California in three months , to supply a sound , uniform , and substantial currency in its place . " - pp. 72 - 74 . The following paragraph shows the ease and rapidity with which the desired substitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the cost to Massachusetts of ten millions of the precious metals to use for currency , instead of paper money ? If the $ 41,197,300 of gold and silver that were exported from the United States during the single year ending in June , 1854 , had remained in the country , at least one tenth part of the amount would have rightly belonged to Massachusetts with her extensive commerce and manufactures . This would have supplied nearly one half of the amount required in a single year . To the industry of Massachusetts , it would have been worth , at the least , as much more , by the protection it would have given to her manufactures against foreign competition , by lessening , to that extent , the amounts of foreign importations , which it was sent abroad to pay for . " - p. 75 . In illustrating the feasibility of this change , if gradually made , Mr. looper says - " With the large quantities of gold that are constantly brought from California by the enterprise of the citizens of Massachusetts , there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees , the place of the present paper money with the precious metals . To avoid trouble and inconvenience , it ought to be done gradually , by a law to prohibit the circulation of any notes below the denomination of ten dollars , after one year from the passage of the act . This would give the banks time to recall the notes of smaller denominations , and for the specie to be circulated to take the place of them . // " In England and France , the two greatest commercial countries of Europe , paper money can hardly be said to exist , in the sense in which it exists in the United States . For the Bank of England and the Bank of France , both of which are so organized that those governments exercise great influence in their management , are not permitted to issue bills of a denomination so small as to be used in the every-day transactions of retail purchases and sales . In England , the lowest denomination of bills is five pounds , equal to nearly twenty-five dollars of our money ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred francs , nearly one hundred dollars of our money . The Bank of France has , within a few years , issued bills for one hundred and two hundred francs , equal to about twenty and forty dollars . The smallest denomination of bank-notes in England and France are too large for the common use of the people ; their use is confined almost entirely to purposes of trade , or for transactions that require large sums of money . " - pp. 76 , 77 . According to our author , our republic holds at the present time a solitary pre-eminence as regards a paper currency . " When the Bank of England was rechartered , in 1844 , it was not intrusted with the unrestricted power to expand and contract the currency by its issues of paper money . Its issue of paper without a cash foundation is limited to fourteen millions of pounds sterling , equal to about sixty-eight millions of dollars , and it is required to keep that amount specially invested in government stocks . The Bank of England must have specie in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus it has no interest in extending the issue of paper beyond the fourteen millions , as it could not loan or invest it , but would be obliged to keep the amount on hand in bullion or coin . No bank organized since 1844 is allowed to issue any bills for circulation , and a limit is fixed to the circulation of all banks organized before that period . " Paper money has been sometimes used in times of war , for the purpose of giving to government the control and use of the real money of a country . It exists in Austria and some other despotic countries , where the governments can control it , and where they control all property . But it is only in the United States that communities can be found willing to delegate to individuals and to private corporations the despotic and sovereign and irresponsible power of furnishing and controlling the currency , which measures the value of all the property of the country . " - pp. 77 , 78. // 191 The illegitimateness of a paper currency - its existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : - " The use of paper money was long since discontinued by the national government , but it has been permitted , and indirectly protected and sanctioned , by most of the State governments , though it has never been directly recognized or legalized by any of them as real money . Paper money is an excrescence which has grown up illegitimately on the body politic ; but , as it is based on false principles , it can not be expected to endure . Either its evils will continue to augment until an enlightened public will no longer bear them , or an intelligent , judicious , and gradual change to a more substantial and to a more just system will be introduced . " - p. 79 . We regret that we can not give a detailed analysis of the lucid statements and cogent arguments which make this pamphlet well-nigh a complete manual within its range of subjects .
