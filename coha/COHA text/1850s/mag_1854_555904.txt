Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1854 . IT would be difficult to select books presenting greater contrasts than those whose titles we have transcribed . The frivolous , but vivacious and stirring Irishman ; the American preacher , who went out to Europe , one might think , on purpose to see the iniquities of the Romish Church , which he accordingly saw and delights to record ; the thoughtful and philosophic ex-Minister of France ; and the truth-loving German , with his wondrous erudition and faculty for historical divination , - represent the extremes of authorship . We refer to their works , however , not to comment on their value , but because they all treat , more or less , of Italian subjects , and because they show the inexhaustible materials which Italy furnishes for book-making . To a writer of travels , no country offers so many temptations as Italy , and of no country is it so difficult to give a satisfactory account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist fancies he can copy , but which no one 38* // succeeds in copying . A traveller in China , in ilindoostan , in most countries of Europe even , has something new to tell . Statistics are waiting to be collected , institutions to be described , social customs to be portrayed . Then , too , the objects of great and general interest are comparatively so few and so marked , that one is not embarrassed in the selection , while , at the same time , they are sufficiently novel to insure him interested readers . But with Italy , all is reversed . When the traveller has brought together the statistics , and narrated the history , and given an account of the institutions , he has hardly begun his task . Italy , the wonder of the world , still remains . Its infinite variety exceeds the limits of any traveller 's note-book ; and to define its true charm is like describing a picture , or translating a poem , - the sentiment vanishes in the process . That which attracts all men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not express in words . The bloom and fragrance are exhaled , as from the leaves and flowers he presses between his pages . Its characteristics may be carried away in the soul , but not in a book . We derive the best idea of them , not from volumes of travels but from the architecture and the poetry , the paintings and the music , through which the heart and the genius of Italy have found utterance . Italy is the centre of the world , because it contains more than any other country to interest a greater variety of minds . Its natural scenery is the loveliest which the sun looks upon . What an horizon of beauty is that which hangs between heaven and earth , on the far-off verge of the traveller 's memory ! Como and Maggiore , in whose calm waters the hoary Alps bathe their feet ; the mystery that broods in the Venetian sunset ; " the top of Fesol6 , " or the tower where the yQuthful Milton may have stood with " the Tuscan Artist , " now old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dante and Michel Angelo ; Perugia , from whose high summit stretches a vast and varied landscape , with its olive-gardens and its vineyards , its valleys and its hill-sides lying warm in the sun , like a vision of some fairer world of which we have dreamed , - a scene on which Raphael fitly gazed , while learning to portray the different , but not more wondrous , loveliness // with which his soul was haunted ; the opening Bay of Naples , its sunshiny waters , its curving shores from Bake to Sorr*nto crowded with the memorials of by-gone ages , its retreating hills , and , towering above all , the great altar of Nature , the steep volcano ; - as these , and a thousand other scenes , rise before the memory , we confess that there is no kind of natural beauty of which Italy does not contain the fairest specimen , - the type and ideal form of which all else is but a deterioration and a copy . There are elsewhere wider rivers , and mountains more sublime , but here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See Naples and die , " says the proverb , for after that , all else must appear tame and faded ; - at least so thinks the Neapolitan , and so the traveller is apt to think . And more than this : it is not on Nature only that you look , but on Nature glorified by historical memories . It would hardly be too much to say , that the whole world besides has not so many objects interesting from their associations with men and events in the past , as Italy alone . In this respect it outmatches other lands in the very things for which they are most remarkable . The opening of the Etruscan tombs has revealed more of a forgotten civilization than the disinterred ruins of Assyria . Palestine has spots more sacred to the heart , and there are localities of Greece which can never take a place of secondary interest ; but these countries have been ravaged by so many conquests , and their ancient characteristics have been so effaced , that , with the exception of a few points , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams and anticipations . He goes to the East only to be disorientalized . But in Italy , the old remains in the midst of the new , like a time-worn tower garlanded and crowned by the fresh-springing ivy which climbs around its crumbling walls to-day . The successive stages of civilization are presented visibly before you , like the successive strata of a geological section of the earth . In tracing back the history of Italy , you witness , step by step , the progress of mankind . He who enters IRome has around him , as in Liverpool or New York , the people and the works which belong to the present time . But he soon becomes conscious that this is the least of Rome . // St. Peter 's and the Vatican carry him back to the great age of* modern art . The house of Rienzi , and the letters of Petrarch to that sublime or mad enthusiast whose early career reminds one of the greater modern tribune of Hungary , bring up before the thought the wild , blind struggles . of a reviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slowly disinterring the Forum from the accumulated ruins under which it was buried during that darkest age , when Rome , the world 's capital , was almost depopulated and had become a nest of feudal bandits . If one rides around the walls , there are the very portions which Belisarius repaired , and there are the gates through which Goth and Vandal , the ministers of destiny , burst with merciless hearts and bloody hands . You cross the Tiber by the Milvian bridge , over which the visionary cross led Constantine to empire . You traverse the dark galleries of the Catacombs , which once , in the days of persecution , heard the voice of Christian worship . You pass beneath the Arch of Titus , and still trace , amidst the sculptures of the triumphal procession , the captive Jews and the golden candlestick of the sanctuary . You visit the Coliseum and the Pantheon , and seek out the pillars and columns , arches and temples , of imperial Rome . You descend into the dungeon described by Sallust , - " twelve feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone , a dark , noisome , and frightful solitude , " - within whose silence Jugurtha starved , where the associates of Catiline were strangled , and where - so tradition asserts- St. Peter was chained . You go back still farther , to the days of the kings , mount the Tarpeian rock , trace the Cloaca Maxima , and endeavor , though probably in vain , to find the sunken piers of the Sublician bridge which " Horatins kept so well , in the brave days of old . " Or , leaving Rome behind , you may explore those Etruscan cities , whose tombs contain the memorials of a civilization which existed before the first stones of the Eternal City were laid . As one passes from the base to the summit through the changing belts of vegetation which succeed each other on the sides of a tropical mountain , so he ascends through thirty centuries of the monumental history of Italy , surveying at once the present and the past . // The peculiar characteristics of Italy multiply as we look . Let us bring some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy is the only country which , in any proper sense of the words , has both an ancient and a modern history . Greece has the ancient , but not the modern . Modern Greece is a mere cemetery in which ancient Greece lies buried . But Italy contains the full records , not merely of ancient and modern times , but of two civilizations formed on different ideas , - the heathen and the Christian . These civilizations have come down within the walls of the same city , and in connection sometimes with the same names ; for amidst all the changes of twenty-five centuries , Rome has preserved her personal identity . Moreover , Roman history derives a peculiar interest from the circumstance that the Roman people , alone of all the nations of antiquity , and , with few exceptions , of modern times , understood , in any large sense of the words , the art of organizing those self-perpetuating institutions of government , without which history loses its unity , meaning , and value . The Romans had an instinct for organization . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which they had the self-denial and the self.control to maintain and obey . Every state which they conquered was brought within the circle of Rome 's organic life , and became a part of itself . And this conquest , instead of being a mere aggregation of dissimilar fragments , was like a growing free , and every added province was a branch permeated by the vital circulations of the trunk . Thus , while the history of nearly all states is a mere disjointed record of aimless violence , without interest , because without plan or far-seeing purpose on the part of the actors , that of Rome is peculiarly a history of organizing minds . And this characteristic has been singularly connected with the city of Rome ; appearing to-day , in the Papacy , as two thousand years ago , in the Republic . It is this which gives an interest to the wars of Rome above that which we feel in the mutual conquests and defeats of the barbarians on the Roman borders . Of the innumerable battles which have drenched the earth with blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piratical fleets on the coast of Borneo . Nothing comes of them of any moment to mankind , or even // to the parties , unless it be new conflicts as purposeless as the first . But every Roman victory had , trailing after it , a thousand years of history . Had Pyrrhus conquered the Romans , his empire would probably have dissolved and disappeared at his death . But the advance of the Romans was the advance of a permanently organized empire , which depended on no one man for its continuance . Hannibal swept over Italy , like one of his own African simooms . But* the fiery tempest passed , and Rome rose from the ground , strong as ever . With Rome war was a means to an end , and that end was empire ; and every step of her armies is traced with an engrossing interest , not because of the personal fortunes of those who composed them , but because of the vast drama in which they were actors . Italy has also been the great centre of modern , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the ancient world and the fresh races out of the Northern forests , which were to furnish material for modern civilization . During the Dark Ages , the Roman Church was the only power which could resist the otherwise universal sover4*gnty of brute force . It was the informing mind in the muscle and bone of Europe . Rome had surrendered the sword , but she directed the passions and the hands of those who held the sword . Under her impulse , the Crusades deluged the East , and she controlled the policy of the forming kingdoms of the West . Through her ministers and agents , she had a universal presence , and gathered trophies from all lands . To this day , Venice , in the Church of St. Mark itself , through its Oriental forms and memorials , speaks to the traveller of Byzantium and the Saracen . It was in the municipal organizations of the Italian towns , that the people preserved some of the habits of self-government , and it was in them that the idea of an organized freedom - of popular rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . The plains of Italy have been successively the theatre of war for the Frank and the Russian , the Austrian and the Spaniard . Throughout the whole Peninsula , there is scarcely a spot which is not , in some way , historical , while numberless places are connected with the most decisive movements of the world . // You travel amidst great names and amidst scenes whence history has taken a new direction . The Benedictines - that benignant brotherhood to whom Europe owes eternal honor , who through ages of darkness were the conservators of ancient learning and the great teachers of the arts of peace on Monte Casino still glory in the parent institution and the grave of their wise and humane founder . Below Assisi , in the open plain , yolh enter the magnificent church , built over the little way-side chapel , in which the great head of the order of Franciscans made his first vows , and around which he cob lected his earliest followers . In Bologna , beneath a monument adorned by the chisel of Michel Angelo , and gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleeps the dust of him who founded the Inquisition . The Genoese pretend to point out the spot where Columbus was born . The tower of Galileo still overlooks Florence , and Dante 's stone is shown beneath the shadow of her cathedral . The broad streets of Ferrara are grass-grown , but Tasso 's prison and the house of Ariosto remain . Along the Neapolitan coast are the foundations of the palaces where Cicero and Ca*sar , and the great chiefs of Rome , sought retirement . You enter Pompeii by the Street of Tombs , and sit down to meditate where tradition affirms that Cicero once sat and read to a friend a portion of one of his writings . The universities , once frequented by nearly all the youthful scholarship of the world , though shorn of their glory , still survive . The very dust of Italy is mingled with historic names . There is not a town which has not been hallowed by genius . The frescos of Correggio look down on the traveller from the consecrated walls of Parma . The artist studies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venice are the very forms which furnished models for Titian . A single picture of Raphael , nay , a mere incident in a picture , has made Foligno one of the places of pilgrimage . And all this has taken to itself the added consecration of poetry . Shakespeare goes with us into the gates of Verona , and Soracte 's crest and Thrasymene 's lake will never cease to be seen through the verse of Byron . But we are far from saying that Italy is one unmarred scene of glory and beauty . Its decaying cities , its ports with // scarcely an entering or departing sail , its backwardness in all the useful arts , its fortresses garrisoned by foreign troops , its miserable and oppressive governments , its chained press and silenced tongues , its innumerable beggars , and the comparative absence of every sign or prospect of improvement , constitute the background of the picture , in whose front stand St. Peter 's and the Vatican . Among the causes which have had an important influence in determining the peculiar characteristics of Italy , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those who have had no experience of it except during the rains and penetrating chills of winter , should think the terms in which it is often described exaggerated . But not so those who have chosen the true season for visiting the Peninsula . The heat of summer may be in some regions sickly , but is not oppressive . During the larger part of the year , one is scarce conscious that there is either heat or cold . The air folds itself about you in quietness . There is no sense of discomfort to remind one of the weather . The winter garments of the North are not burdensome , and yet the utter raggedness of the Neapolitan lazaroni suggests no idea but that of surprise that they should be at the trouble of wearing any garments at all . Apparel seems so unnecessary to comfort , that one is ready to fancy it a mere concession to a traditionary custom . The climate interprets much that is peculiar in the architecture of Italy . The child at the North reads of roofless temples and theatres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years witness a theatrical entertainment in the open air , while seated on the ascending steps of the Amphitheatre at Verona , or hear in the Coliseum the sermon of a begging friar , or listen to an Austrian band in the Place of St. Mark , which through the long moonlight evening , like an immense ballroom , is filled with the beauty and fashion of Venice , and he begins to fancy that there is no better roof than the sky . In ancient days , the houses of Pompeii were small , and the lodging-chambers narrow . They were not , like ours , places to live in , but rather for sleep and temporary shelter . The open colonnades , the porticos , the public places , gardens , and edifices , // 1854.1 457 so magnificent as compared with private dwellings , were for a people who loved , and lived in , the open air . The climate , we imagine , accounts for many peculiarities in the Italian character . It is essentially the climate for enjoyment . It infuses a healthy life into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pores of the body to the influx of pleasurable sensations . It gives the health which makes labor easy , yet does not stimulate one to exertion . The bracing climate of the North drives us into the field to work . The first thought of the morning is of what is to be done . There is a nervous irritability which can be quieted only by labor . We must work , or become insane . Our very pleasures are violent , and we are satisfied only with excess . But in Italy , the passive state is the natural one . It is enough to breathe . When earth and air and sky are flooding body and soul with pleasurable sensations , why should one be anxious about doing this or that ? All the labor of the world can add little to the means of pleasure already possessed by the meanest and poorest peasant . The very state which fits him for enjoyment- the passive , receptive state - is antagonistic to any persevering exertion . In these remarks , although to some extent they apply to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and even here the stranger no doubt feels the influence of the climate more , or , at any rate , is more conscious of its influence , than the native Italian . But one fancies that he can see its power in all the more prominent features of the popular character . It not only puts the whole being into the condition suited for enjoyment , but it has a corresponding influence over the will . Northern Europe is full of enterprise , it looks forward and plans for the future , and is ever proposing something to be accomplished . Mind and body are the mere instruments of the will . But with the Southern Italian , the will seems to have gone to sleep . Under the pressure of urgent necessity , he may do any thing that requires simply bodily exertion , and he may be roused to violent effort by some sudden burst of passion ; but in the one case the impelling force is in the immediate occasion , and in the other , the passion soon subsides , and the effort with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does . There is no enterprise , no improvement ; for this would require a strenuous , persistent effort of the will , breaking through the customary routine in order to reach some new end . Agriculture and its implements are substantially the same that they have been for hundreds of years . The Italian is not easily persuaded to adopt new methods . It is not for want of natural intelligence , but because the will which governs him is in the traditions of the past . He can endure any amount of physical labor , or any deprivation , rather than start from some new centre of action , and follow out a volition of his own . We can not but think that the form which religion takes , has been in no inconsiderable degree affected by the same general influence . Protestantism is essentially a religion of the will . It always supposes that something is to be done . It says , " You ought , and ought not . " It is forceful and energetic . Romanism , on the contrary , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires its adherents to submit the will to the will of another . No questions must be asked ; no reasoning is allowed on points of faith ; but the true Romanist denies himself , and acts and thinks as the Church wills . Protestantism inculcates the idea of individual and personal responsibility , where Romanism requires passive obedience . Probably , in this matter , Romanism has been both cause and effect , but still it is in harmony with the climate . For a time , to the Northern traveller , there is something in these characteristics of Italian life which has a singular attraction . After years of planning and of toil , he finds himself in Naples among those who seem to have no plans for the future . Of a sudden , he is let down among a people who are satisfied simply to enjoy , and the luxury of the climate brings him into sympathy with them . Why should not the lazaroni sleep under the shadow of those palace-walls , within whose chambers all manly energy slumbers ? Why should the Neapolitan carriage-driver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superfluous trouble of drawing in the reins , when lungs are so abundant , their exercise so delightful , and an outcry will suffice to open a doubtful pathway through the thronged street ? There is a satisfaction in seeing all one 's // 459 old traditionary notions quietly defied ; in seeing a population which does not believe a word about the dignity of labor ; which deems enjoyment the end of life , and labor accidental and exceptional ; and which regards any exercise of the will , except in the way of carrying out the impulse of the hour , as an intrusion and an absurdity . No doubt the feelings of the traveller undergo a rapid change . The sober judgment , when things begin to be seen as they are , is shocked by the innumerable evils which rapidly reveal themselves , and which belong to a state of society formed on the prevailing idea of the rightful supremacy of present and passive enjoyment . But even this only enables him to appreciate more clearly the power of those natural influences , which have perpetuated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ages ; and he learns to thank God more devoutly than ever before , that the land of his birth is blown upon by the inspiring and invigorating winds which come down from the coasts of Labrador . This enervating influence of the climate is seen most conspicuously in the southern portions of Italy . As one goes north , the character of the population and the general aspect of things constantly change . Lombardy has always been famous for its productiveness , and is as much so now as ever . Tuscany is cultivated like a garden . The implements of labor are rude , and there is little appearance of the presence of the enterprising and inventive mind ; but everywhere may be seen the evidences of patient and careful toil , while the people seem to have inherited much of the spirit , which , from the old Etruscan times , has made this region the great birthplace or nursery of Italian genius . But throughout Italy , one is oppressed with the feeling that things are not in a natural state . The people evidently possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among a race of men , seemingly endowed with more than the average proportion of vital energy , every thing is stationary . Italy seems to be thrown into an unnatural sleep , as if by some spell of enchantment , which it may rebel against and resist , but which it can only partially overcome . The attention of the traveller is first attracted to the wonders // of art and the remains of antiquity . But when the novelty is worn off , his human sympathies vindicate their power , and he is less interested in the relics of past ages , than in the condition of living men struggling with the difficulties of the present time . And turning from the past to the present , no contrast could be more sad than that between the traditions and monuments of former glory , and the melancholy fortunes of Italy to-day . Time , violence , storm , siege , and barbarian conquest have dealt mercifully with the works of ancient genius and power . The real ruin is that of the living Italians . Statues and walls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form a just idea of what existed in former ages . It is the manhood of Italy which is decayed . The decline of the Roman Empire was sad enough , the decline of the Italian people is still more melancholy . The secondary causes of their present condition are numerous and complicated , extending back into remote times , and connected with successive revolutions and conquests , and the blending of different races . But the two principal depressing forces have undoubtedly been government and religion ; and it is to these , in their bearing on the condition and prospects of Italy , that we shall confine our remarks . In order to understand the influence of government on the Italian people , we must go back to an earlier period . Italy was originally divided into numerous independent states ; and the larger cities possessed each of them a government of its own , and more or less of political freedom . As the power of Rome increased , they were absorbed , one by one , within her growing dominion . But they never entirely lost their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of selfgovernment . Republican Rome modified , but in most cases did not subvert , the municipal organizations which she found . She united them , indeed , under her central authority ; she deprived them of the rights which were inconsistent with this union ; she often imparted to them - thus binding them to her . self in closer bonds - some of her own forms and privileges ; but she did not destroy their individuality . The Empire ab lowed them still to exist . And when nearly every thing else // was swept away by the inundation of barbarian conquest , these ancient cities , unless literally blotted from the earth , retained something of their former characteristics , and preserved to the scanty population which remained at least the memory of their ancient privileges . The dawn of modern civilization found them shorn of their power indeed , and almost depopulated , but possessing still , though broken and fragmentary , their independent organizations . Milan , Padua , and Verona were places of note in the times of the Republic , and Arezzo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumerating them , large numbers of the modern cities of Italy have had a separate individual life of their own , during not less than twenty or twenty.five centuries . The moment that better days came , the importance of these municipal organizations began to appear . The free cities of Modern Italy started not up , of a sudden , out of the ground , but had foundations in the his*tory , traditions , and customs of ages . It was in the midst of them that modern civilization first broke forth , and from them was kindled and carried the light , which has been slowly spreading over Western Europe . All this , however , is secondary to the influence which , from the commencement of her growing power , Rome has exerted over the destinies of the Italian Peninsula . The organic laws and institutions of the city of Romulus cherished a spirit among the people which fitted them far more for success in war than for prosperity in peace . The wealth of Rome was not the product of Roman agriculture , manufactures and commerce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She invested her treasures in her armies , and when they ceased to conquer , it was as if she had ceased to work the mines of precious metals whence alone her riches were drawn . The moment that her legions , instead of ravaging new countries , were reduced to the necessity of protecting her own borders against invasion , a disastrous change began . Not only did the bar .. barians crowd in from east and north , but a growing poverty blighted the centre . The evils wrought into the organization of Roman society began to be felt . Labor was a disgrace , and confined in great part to slaves . A gulf opened , and 39 * // constantly widened itself , between the classes of Roman society . A few rich men owned provinces , but the multitude of the poor became paupers . That all-important class of independent men , such as Virgil describes , who labored on their own farms , like the people of New England , and who must ever constitute the strength of a state , altogether died out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - in the cities living on the largesses of the government , and in the provinces composed of slaves , ignorant , brutal , without thought for the morrow -- had no country worth defending . And when Goths and Huns , Vandals and Lombards , broke through the passes of the Alps , and burst in long waves over the Italian plains , the people had no interest in resisting them . A new slavery could hardly be worse than the old . Then , too , luxury and vice had demoralized the rich , and want without hope had demoralized the poor . The Empire , from the centre to the extremities , had sunk into a degraded condition , in which its rulers were without patriotism and its soldiers without courage ; and the fresh , triumphant races of the North planted themselves easily and permanently in those regions of ancient fame , which the Romans no longer had the manhood to defend . No words can describe the miseries which fell , like an untimely blast , on the length and breadth of the land . From the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given over to ravage and plunder , her cities were sacked and burned , all the arts and interests of life fell into decay , and one race after another of barbarians - sometimes remaining permanently , and at other times , like the Mahrattas of the East , withdrawing with their spoil to their native fastnesses - swept over the devastated provinces . Society crumbled into disconnected fragments ; the country was depopulated ; large regions were turned into a desert ; Campania itsdf , once a garden filled with inhabitants , at length became so solitary , that wild beasts , which had almost disappeared from the peninsula , returned and took possession of their ancient haunts . The city of Rome , whose population at the beginning of the fifth century is estimated by Gibbon to have been not less than 1,200,000 , was reduced , during the time // when the Popes were at Avignon , as low as 30,000 or 40,000 . Its degenerate and ferocious aristocracy , revering neither the dead nor the living , and too ignorant to appreciate the glories of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting them into strongholds for the protection of themselves and the savage banditti rallied under their standards , carried on between one another a perpetual war . A large part of the city , within the walls even , became an open field . The Forum itself was a pasture for cattle . Its temples were prostrated , and the space between the Capitoline Hill and the Palatine , within which was crowded the most glorious architecture of the Roman world , was filled up fathoms deep with rubbish . And Rome , thus crushed and in ruins , was but a symbol of Italy . Yet , light coming out of darkness , in the order of Providence , it was the very misery of these ages which was to give birth to a better state of things . There had been a general mingling , and often blending , of races . The Northern barbarians brought into Italy a passionate , though undefined and purposeless , love of personal independence . The Italians had , what is very different , an idea of personal freedom , in and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians had died out , but the fragments of their old social organizations remained , and into them the barbarians were gradually drawn . Thus the union of races possessing such opposite characteristics resulted in the improvement of both , the one supplying in a degree what the other lacked . This tendency was favored by the universal disorder . The unprotected parts of Italy were exposed to constant marauding irruptions of Lombards , Saracens , and Normans , and to the robber bands of unemployed soldiers . The people were forced to unite for mutual protection . They left the open country , and herded together in towns . Even after Otho the Great , in the tenth century , had made himself master of so large a part of Italy , he was unable to protect the very people whom he had conquered , and was thus obliged to give permission to the citizens of the towns to possess arms and to build walls . In these towns , under various modifications , the old popular organizations were revived . The people // chose their own leaders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the birthplace of Modern Italy . The cities were small , at first , and built up amidst ruins ; but the defenceless flocked to them for safety , and in a brief time they had regained more than the splendor of former days . Their governments necessarily took more or less of a popular form ; for among those who , like the ancient Hebrews , while they built with one hand , held the sword in the other , none could be long a leader , except from popular choice or acquiescence . The necessities of self-defence every day put the courage and resolution of the newly gathered population to the test , and united it in closer bonds , while freedom and prosperity inflamed its ambition and called out its resources . Even war , for a time , by awakening the energies of the people , seemed only to promote the general prosperity . Patriotism was condensed within the walls of a city , and became a passion . The population of the several states was so small , that each citizen identified himself with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a rude and troubled time . Human life was held at a small price ; but there was freedom , and the manhood which is developed amidst the trials and opportunities of freedom , and confidence in individual resources , and growing wealth and power , and triumphant hope ; and the elastic , vivid Italian mind broke out like the morning sunlight over the retreating night . Then came - extending through several centuries till the independence of these free cities was crushed again under foreign ii*vasion - the great epoch of modern Italian history . Within that period nearly all the eminent names of modern Italy are included . They belong to the era of freedom , and their existence is an eternal witness to the world , that foreign war , and intestine dissension and violence , and all the worst evils which liberty ever brings or allows , are lighter than the dust of the balance compared with the loss of liberty itself . But the prosperity to which freedom gave birth , and the energies which it developed , became in turn the causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal cities were enlarged in ever-widening circles until they touched one another 's borders . Their fortresses frowned on one another // from neighboring hill-tops , their merchants were rivals for the traffic of the East and the West , and their fleets met in every port of the Mediterranean . Eager , grasping , patriotic , jealous , and trained to arms as they were , it was impossible that rivalry should not often result in war . Their conflicting interests , in accordance with the spirit of the age , were settled in the bloody arbitrament of battle . The true remedy for the evils belonging to this state of things would have been a union of these independent cities under equalJaws and one general head . But centuries were to elapse , and a new world to be discovered by one of their own people , before the minds of men should be prepared for a step like this in the science of government . The only idea of union was that of the conquered under the conqueror . And thus each city strove for the mastery over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pisa , - each with those states with which its relations were the closest . As in the republics of Greece , perpetual war crippled and consumed their resources . Their military leaders became the heads of the state , and transmitted their power to their descendants . Division and strife and weakness offered the temptation , and opened the way , for the invasion of the great powers beyond the Alps . Nor was this all . The several cities in seasons of disaster themselves sought this foreign aid to support them against their nearer enemies . The Germans and the Franks were invited by Genoa and Milan , by Rome and by Pisa , to furnish temporary assistance . But their armies , once in Italy , did not retire when the occasion which called them was past . The Italian cities had raised a spirit which they could not put down . The foreigner came as an ally of one state against another ; but he remained to becQme the master of both . France , Germany , and Spain made the plains of Italy their battle-ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers constantly took more or less part in the affairs of Italy , until , in 1530 , Charles V. received in Bologna the crowns of Lombardy and the Empire . The Italian states had now a master stronger than either of them separately , and perhaps stronger than all of them united . From this period they were brought more or less under the influence , // and sacrificed to the conflicting interests , of courts beyond the Alps ; and from this period commenced , relatively , at least , to the other nations of Europe , their steady decline . With the loss of free institutions , the Italian mind seemed to be struck with paralysis . Intelligence decayed , and manhood decayed , and a constantly darkening twilight drew its shadows over what had been the sunshine and hope of the world . Without tracing the history of the sad centuries that followed , we may find in these general circumstances the causes of what we behold in Italy to-day . The peninsula is divided into different states . The retribution of Roman violence has come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign powers . Lombardy is a province of Austria . In the place of the Doge of Venice rules an Austrian military governor . An Austrian duke reigns over Tuscany . The king and queen of Naples partake of the blood of Austria and Spain . Austrian armies garrison a large part of the cities of the North , and the influence of Austria is powerfully felt in those states which she refrains from claiming as a part of her dominions . French troops maintain the peace of Roni* , and protect the Pope and the priesthood against the people . The king of Naples garrisons the castle of St. Elmo with regiments of Swiss . The sovereignty of the Papacy does little to modify this state of things for the better ; for though it be an Italian Pope who is at the head of the Papal States , he has interests quite independent of the people whom he governs . His civil jurisdiction over the States of the Church is subordinate to the spiritual dominion which he claims over the Christianworld . A large part of Italy is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard the Italian states in no other light than that of provinces already conquered , or in due time to be brought into subjection . Italy is to Austria and France what India is to England , - a conquest ruled for the benefit of the conqueror . Power thus gaiiied and held in defiance of the interests and wishes of the people can be maintained only by means as iniquitous as itself . Here we come to the immediate causes of the present condition of Italy . A foreign despotism can sustain itself by two methods // only ; either by overwhelming force , or by treading down the manhood of the subject people , and thus crippling its ability to maintain its rights against aggression . Italy is kept under by both methods . From a hundred to a hundred and fifty thousand foreign troops are stationed at the great military centres , ready to crush the first sign of national life . But means , in the course of time more potent even than armies , are made use of to destroy the power of resistance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness rather than light . Political questions are discussed at the peril of life . Religion is placed under the same despotic restrictions . Heresy is made a crime against the state , not less than against the Church ; and about subjects concerning which it is dan .. gerous to express a doubt , the only security for men is not to think . When the faculties of the mind are thus chained and exchtded from their proper and highest spheres of exertion , their activity in all directions is deranged and hindered . But the horrors of this foreign rule are not appreciated till we descend to particulars . Worse than the standing armies of foreigners is the police , civil and ecclesiastical , known or secret , which dogs every Italian 's steps , watches all his doings , and catches up and reports all his words . Its purpose is so alien to the duties which we are accustomed to regard as belonging to such a class of officials , that it takes time for an American or an Englishman to understand its nature . Its primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would violate the law , but to defend the usurpations of a government , which respects no law but its own will , from popular indignation . The rulers of Italy for the most part are themselves despots , or they represent a foreign sovereignty which is detested , and they are obliged to defend themselves against the very people whom they govern . The police , in one form or another , is their most potent instrument . The passing stranger is not annoyed by it ; he oftener finds a certain convenience in it , provided always that he abstains from forbidden subjects . But he can not be long in the country without becoming aware how it presses with a deadly weight on the freedom of the Italian mind . Its natural impulsiveness is tamed down , and its free utterance stifled . Before an Ital // ian ventures to speak of the government or the Church , he looks over his shoulder to see who may hear . And the pentup bitterness which breaks out when you are with him alone is silenced if you pass a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaches to ask alms . You are warned not to speak on such subjects with the guide you employ , lest he should be himself one of the police , or if not , lest your casual words , listened to by him and overheard by another , should bring him into dangerous suspicion . In one place , the shops are closed at a certain hour by the police ; in another , the traveller is hardly set down at his hotel before he is aware that the amiable and civil-mannered man who somehow , without be ing called for , is always present when an Italian approaches , is an agent of the police . At every stage the traveller 's passport is demanded , and a careful account , for which the keepers of the hotels are responsible , is kept of his name , and of the places whence he comes and whither he goes . You can not remain stationary in a city without permission from the police , nor can you go from one state to another without a fresh vis6 upon your passport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in general , the ordinary traveller finds little embarrassment . But if his passport is out of rule , or if there be the least cause of suspicion , he becomes conscious of that ever-present vigilance of despotism , which , though he may have slept , never slumbers nor sleeps . So long as a foreigner concerns himself only with churches and operas and galleries of art , he is not disturbed , because no suspicion attaches to him . But every Italian is a suspected person . If he departs from the ordinary routine , if a few men meet together in the street , or even in a private house , it is assumed that there is something wrong on foot . No one knows in whom to put confidence . This atmosphere of universal and mutual distrust in which the Italians live , creates a state which can be compared to nothing except the system of solitary imprisonment . Mutual suspicion divides men more effectually and more sadly than walls of stone . Every friend is treated as if he might be an enemy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , lest she should unawares disclose them at the confessional . // One of the most shocking features of the system is , that in this way religion is converted into an engine of despotism .. In any movement , though it be to remedy an intolerable wrong , before the decisive moment of action comes , some one more timid than the rest , and , anxious , if the political enterprise fail , at least to save his own soul , confesses to a priest ; . and though the priest 's lips are understood to be sealed , . somehow , within a few days , those engaged in the movement have disappeared . The prisons are filled with political offenders , many of whom are among the best and wisest and purest men of Italy ; and on any threatened disturbance , the prison gates are opened to lead forth the noblest of their number to exile or execution . A military tribunal , a short shriv .. - ing , and the shot of a platoon of mercenaries , restore and maintain order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere of a suspected city . The concentra. * tion around it of foreign troops , the silence with which the government acts , the ignorance of the people where the next blow may fall , the knowledge that there is lightning in the gathering cloud , the certainty that every generous heart that has ventured to speak a word for Italy is in peril , create a feeling of apprehension , by which even a stranger is oppressed . The public places are comparatively deserted , and a profound melancholy , in look and tone , is mingled with the Italian vidvacity . The newspapers give the usual accounts of operas and theatres ; but the subject which occupies all thoughts is the one about which the press and the people are alike silent . The brutal and bigoted king of Naples relies in part on his Swiss regiments ; but his more effective method in the maintenance of his power has been to weed out of his dominions , by means of death , dungeon , or exile , every generous , intelligent , and patriotic man who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . The best hope of such a land is that the government will at length sink amidst the ruin which itself has made . In all Northern Italy , wherever the Austrians bear sway , the same general system , though not so merciless in its form , is pursued . And Rome is more fortunate only in having French soldiers , whose feelings rebel against a system which they are placed there to sustain . von . Lxxviii. - No. 163. 40 // But it is constantly replied to all this , that the Italians are unfit for any other government ; that to remove the despotism of the priesthood and of foreign troops , would be to deliver Italy over to anarchy . It must be confessed that one can hardly see the lazaroni of Naples , or the populace of Rome , without feeling that there is too much truth in such an assertion . But no warrant is found for it in Tuscany and the Northern Italian states . In them education is more general , pauperism and mendicancy are less common , industry has more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in preserving order and good government . The people have none of the appearance of a worn-out race , but , on the contrary , possess in a full proportion that physical vigor which must always be the foundation of self-supporting energy and mental intelligence . The whole region was filled with self-governing republics when the rest of the world was lying in barbarism ; its cities abounded with men whose names have entered into the history of mankind ; and that there is no hopeless debasement is clear from the fact , that the traditions of liberty are preserved among them , as the persecuted remnants of some excommunicated faith preserve and cherish in secret the Bible or the cross . But if this were not the case , how long will it be before the soldiers of Austria and the police of Rome shall have educated the Italians for liberty ? What is the prospect of their ever being prepared for a better government ? The whole influence of Austria is to crush every manly and independent thought ; and no system was ever devised better adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhoping submission , than that which prevails throughout nearly the whole of the Peninsula . No ; the true training of men for freedom is to give them all the freedom of which they can in any way appreciate the value . Men learn to meet responsibility , by having responsibility put upon them . Independence , suddenly gained , would no doubt be followed by many disturbances , but disorder and violence are not always the worst things in the world . The quiet which has its origin in enslaved hearts is worse . But the very disorders of an intelligent people have in them a correcting element . We see this daily on our own // Western frontier , where men advance , through violence and Lynch Law , to communities where law is held all the more sacred because there has been such terrible experience of its necessity . Jt is seen in the history of Italy itself , which produced nearly all of its great men at a time when its free cities were racked and torn by internal convulsions and foreign war . But we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of a better government than that to which they are now subject . Looking forward a century , we do not believe that the social progress of Italy is to come from these bands of conscripts , who , without speaking the language of the land which they consume , fill the barracks , and sentinel the walls , and are trained in the public places of Verona , Ferrara , and Milan . We should have faith in the capacity of the Italians for a better system of things , were it only that there still subsists among them a passion for the liberties they have lost , a passion which centuries of foreign rule have not trampled out . But why do not the Italians rise and assert their liberty ? Or when for a moment they seem to have gained it , why not show a calmer wisdom in uniting under judicious laws ? It is a question which an American naturally asks , but which is easily answered . If we remember that the Italians have lived under a rule which has forbidden among them any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and opportunity to manage their own affairs , and which studiously represses every organization for political ends , we shall not be surprised that their wisest men and truest patriots should , in their first attempts at self-government , have fallen into mistakes . But why not cast off a foreign yoke ? The overwhelming reason confronts you the moment you pass within the gates of an Italian town . Let us enter Verona , a city of sixty thousand inhabitants . " Shall not such a place , " asks the indignant American , who never saw a standing army , " vindicate its own freedom ? " He presently observes immense buildings , which he learns are barracks , and he ascertains that they are not built for show , but that in them is permanently quartered an Austrian army of not less than ten or fifteen thousand men . Austrian sentinels appear at every angle // of the fortifications , and with loaded muskets warn him not to ascend the ramparts . He meets Austrian regiments of artillery , cavalry , and infantry , perpetually defiling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands on the plain outside the gates , a solitary spectator , while they go through their daily drill . Every thing is terribly in earnest . In a single day their cannon could level every square of Verona . On the other hand , the people are disarmed , and , were they allowed to possess arms , they have not the custom of using them . Still more , by one of the most subtle and effective contrivances of despotism , they are excluded from all those habits of organization which give men power and enable them to rely on one another . Through a discipline transmitted from father to son , from the time of the Mayflower , we have a facility for organizing men into bodies in which every one readily falls into his place , understands his part , expects to concede much in order to attain the general end , and knows that he may rely on those who are acting in concert with him . Here lies the power of a free people . With arms in their hands and the habit of organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any foreign force , unless it be of overwhelming magnitude . Austria is endeavoring to incapacitate Italy for any such concerted action . It is no trifling regulation of the police , but the instinct of despotism , which forbids men 's acting together , which disperses the slight gathering at the street-corner , and hardly allows a company of friends to meet at the festive board , unwatched . But if this were not so , to expel from a city a body of troops which bears a startling proportion to all its male inhabitants of mature age , and which , besides its munitions of war , is protected within almost impregnable fortifications , is not in modern times to be accomplished with the rude weapons which a disarmed people may clutch in frantic haste , but which are powerless against ramparts and batteries . Such , substantially , is the condition of Italy . But the fact that year after year , in spite of efforts constantly renewed and constantly defeated , and in spite of the confiscation of property , and the banishment , imprisonment , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word or strike // 1854. 473 a blow for his country , the Italians still preserve the hope of freedom , and are willing to risk life to gain it , shows plainly enough that they are not so debased as is sometimes thought . At this distance , it is easy to talk of the value of order , and to say that there is no reason why the Italians should not be happy under foreign rule . But while there is any manhood in a people , this can not be . Nor do we believe it possible that there is a man in this country whose sympathies are not with the subjugated and oppressed against a power like Ausfria , which rules simply and solely by brute force , and which is always arrayed in antagonism to Italy . Doubtless , the Italian patriots have often wanted discretion , they have struck madly , blindly , and in the dark ; but instead of crying out against their mistakes and extravagances , we do not see how an honorable Italian can have more than one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sweeping this brood of brutal soldiery into the sea . The second great cause of the present condition of Italy is to be found in the nature and administration of its religion . On entering Italy , the first thing that attracts the attention of the traveller , and the last thing about which he forms satisfactory and settled conclusions , is the IRomish Church . One might easily fancy himself in the most religious country in the world . There is scarcely a village which has not a cathedral towering over the dilapidated roofs below , while there is not a spot on which fishermen make a landing , or a few mountaineers abide , where the open doors of a chapel do not invite men to worship . The wealth and labor and genius of Italy have been expended , more than on any thing else , upon its churches . And though our tastes , formed on simpler rituals , enter slowly into sympathy with this different and more magnificent expression of the religious sentiment , one at length comes to doubt whether the theory of Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements of human genius be dedicated to God ? What though we are insignificant , and the noblest fabrics which our hands can build be nothing to Him whom the heaven of heavens can not contain , - why shall not our best works have inscribed on them , " Holiness unto the Lord " ? Why shall not the 40 // praises of God be.uttered in stately forms , and majestic architecture , and the sweetest strains of music ? He does not need it ; - but is it not in accordance with the prompting of our own souls ? There is nothing on earth , of man 's workmanship , so impressive , so fitted to lift the mind into the region of elevated thought , as the interior of a great cathedral . As one sits apart in the dim twilight of its arches ,  --  the soft strains of the distant organ and the scarcely heard chanting of the priest in the remote chapel floating through the shadows and mingling with his musings ,  --  the vast church seems to dilate above and around , solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecrated from the fretted and fevered human life without its walls . Beneath such a pile , all men are reduced to an humble and an equal level ; and while one witnesses the worshippers of every class scattered over the great space , and kneeling at the different altars , each apart and by himself uttering his devotions , it is impossible not to sympathize with them and with the spirit of the place . You want no words . A sermon , in which man addresses man , would be an offence . It is a temple , not for man 's teaching , but for God 's worship . One cares not even to hear any distinct utterance of prayer , and is glad that the human expression of the sentiment of devotion is in a foreign tongue . The true language is found in the architecture , and in the solemn cadences of the music ; and devotion falls back so much upon its simplest , sublimest , and universal emotions , that no other language is needed . As among great mountains , which alternately oppress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire you with their grandeur , but admit no interruediate feelings , so the natural utterance of the cathedral seems to be either that of weakness and humble trust , or , while one forgets himself and thinks of God , that of loud thanksgivings , of majestic anthems , and exultant adoration . The kneeling worshipper , conscious of his sins , cries , " Help , Lord , or I perish " ; or , rising above the thought of self , joins in the chorus of men and angels : " For thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever and ever . " There is another scene not less impressive . In the smaller // towns there is less of the pomp of worship . But when the sinking sun sends its twilight through the church , there may be seen gliding in , one by one , and kneeling apart at different altars , here a mother with a little child , there a woman bent with age , some clad in mourning , and some in the garments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitent , the infirm , who frequent the place because here they find the best , and it may be the only Friend they have . Here they find refuge from trouble , and comfort amid sorrow , in the thought of God . And the place grows more sacred to you . These walls have stood a thousand years , and in all that time perhaps no day has passed in which desponding hearts have not here sought strength , and sinful hearts implored God for pardon . The atmosphere is throbbing with the profoundest emotions of human souls . You would trifle with yourself , it would be trifling with humanity no less than with God , not to regard such a place as holy . In the Romish Church , above all others , art has been dedicated to religion . A vast proportion of the great Italian pictures are religious pictures . There may , at first , be something repulsive in the perpetual exhibitions of suffering and martyrdom on the canvas ; but their aspect changes when it is remembered that the highest heroism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are here portrayed . The instinct of genius led the great artists to subjects through which they could express the noblest fidelity to truth , the purest affections , and the sublimest self-devotion to God . In their great works , that which they did was done unto God ; and the judgment of the world , in crowning them with immortality , has vindicated this consecration of art to religion . It must , however , be confessed , that much of the magnificence of the Italian churches is to be attributed to a less exalted cause , - to the peculiar ecclesiastical organization of the priesthood . The church is the home of the priest . He is practically severed from family , and kindred , and country . To take an example which expresses what we mean better than any general words - Rome is the metropolis df the Catholic priesthood . Every Catholic priest , be he stationed in America , in India , or in Europe , and whatever his rank , // high or low , has a direct personal interest in IRome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveller to Rome brings back an account of what is there witnessed , and some rays of its splendor are reflected on the head of the humblest missionary in the farthest land . He belongs to a great and powerful aristocracy , and though in the lowest rank , the class is the same with that of which the Pope is the head . His country is Rome , the sovereign whom he has sworn to obey is the Pope , and he is a member of that vast fraternity whose glory is the enlarging power of the Papacy . It is a permanent body , united from generation to generation by the same interests , and of this vast body St. Peter 's is the Metropolitan Church . Whatever may be thought of Romanism , it must be acknowledged that the feeling which led to the erection of St. Peter 's was a natural one . Every priest has a personal interest in it , and every monument built beneath its arches is something in which he , in a manner , may indulge the pride of ownership . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has the right of entrance . Thus the whole body of the Catholic priesthood throughout the world is concerned in adding to its riches and magnificence . What we witness in the churches of Rome and in the Vatican to-day , is the slow accumulation of centuries , and could not have existed except through the mutual sympathy and coöperation of a permanent body like the Catholic priesthood . Every priest that visits Rome is strengthened by witnessing this splendor . He may be clad in rags , but the body to which he belongs holds in its possession those wonders of genius which are the admiration of mankind . And thus the interests of his order , and no doubt the presumed interests of religion , have filled Italy with churches compared with which , if one excepts a few cathedrals scattered over Northern Europe , all others seem but the cheap fragments of architecture . In looking at the favorable aspects of Catholicism , we think it can not be doubted that it does much to promote that form of charity which consists in almsgiving ; and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy , the immense provision made to supply the wants of the poor indicates a wide and general spirit of beneficence . And defective as the // 1854.1 477 methods of charity in Italy doubtless are , there is one respect in which they appear to advantage , as compared with our own . They imply more of pity for the individual . Our charity is calculating . It deals with classes . It proceeds on general principles . Sometimes we refuse aid in order to prevent the growth of the mendicant character . We give aid through institutions , and the object is not merely to relieve want , but to develop qualities and resources which shall raise the mendicant above want . No doubt all this is wise and well . It is the result of experience , and conscientious thought and purpose . But it removes and separates him who receives from him who gives , and though it implies a more enlarged and enlightened charity of principle , and though the form is infinitely more serviceable to the poor , it tends to exclude the element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of pity . This characteristic difference is everywhere seen . For example , in Milan there is a hospital for the aged poor , in which six hundred persons of seventy years of age and upwards are maintained . They are simply but well clad ; they have no occupations except such as they themselves choose for amusement ; they have wholesome food , and a daily allowance of good wine , and spend their age in the midst of comforts which most of them in middle life never knew . With its great hospital - one of the largest and most magnificent in the world - is connected a foundling asylum . The foundling , as in other institutions of the kind in several parts of Europe , is received through an opening in the wall , in such a way that he who leaves it may remain unknown ; while , on the same principle , in the lying-in department of the same institution , the woman if she chooses may continue veiled , and thus her features remain unseen even by the attendant physician . The objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it remains to be proved that this compassion towards human frailty produces worse effects , than the merciless temper with which we crush those , who have been led astray through their affections , into despair . The records of our courts and coroners , and the advertisements of some of our newspapers , do not encourage us to think that we have reached a perfect sys // tern of charity . We certainly would not have the foundling hospitals of Paris and Italy transplanted to our shores ; but it would do us no harm to temper our more rigid treatment of evil-doing with something more of personal tenderness to the guilty , but always most miserable , wrong-doer . There is still another characteristic of Italy , which , though it must , no doubt , be mainly attributed to the general spirit of the civilization which grew up during centuries of Italian freedom , has certainly been to no inconsiderable extent modified by the Christian sentiment , preserved by and within the Catholic Church . We refer to the kind of men who , during past ages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . We properly judge of a people , somewhat from the character which it holds in most admiration . In comparing the saints and great men , to whom statues are built and churches consecrated in Italy and in Northern Europe , the contrast is too striking not to be observed . The great gallery of Versailles is covered with pictures which commemorate the wars and glories of France . Battle-piece succeeds battle-piece for furlongs , and almost for miles , till the perpetual repetition of these scenes of conflict makes you almost fancy that your weary feet are draggling through fields drenched and heavy with blood . Paris may be the centre of science , and is one of the cenfres of literature and art , but neither men of science nor artists nor philanthropists take the first place . The great conqueror who looks silently down on Paris from the column of the Place Vendome , and in the gathering shadows seems to listen to the sunset anthems of the military bands at its base , is the ideal man of France . In St. Paul 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every monument is dedicated to some naval or military hero . Those of Johnson , and Howard , and a few others , eminent in peace , may be found , but they are unnoticed and undistinguished in the crowd of martial names . Were England , like the Oriental monarchies , to decay and be lost out of history , and should some Layard , a hundred centuries hence , disinter the buried remains of London , as those of Nineveh have been disinterred , it could scarcely be doubted that the great temple of England had been ded // 479 icated to the god of war . In Germany there is a wider range of sympathy and admiration , and a more just idea of the purposes and dignity of art ; but of the magnificent frescoed epics of Munich even , a large part , as compared with those of Italy , are devoted to the illustration of the glory achieved in war . The Northern saints , such as St. Patrick , St. Siebald , St. Boniface , are invested by tradition and the popular imagination with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South , as the Scandinavian forests are unlike the Italian plains . Or , descending to more modern times , Calvin , the saint and the republican , Knox , whose statue towering over the Necropolis of Glasgow looks like the grave and stern genius of Scotland , and Luther , the religious hero of Protestantism , belonged to the North by character , not less than by birth . We are not comparing the merits of different men , but the hero-worship of Italy chooses for its homage objects of quite a different stamp . The Virgin Mary is the type of womanly purity and love . If Italy gave birth to the founder of the Inquisition , his tomb is no place of pilgrimage . Among the most popular saints of Northern Italy is St. Charles Bor .. romeo , and he is a saint of charity . In all the public places of Milan , and throughout the diocese of which he was Archbishop , are the memorials of his humility and self-devotion to the good of his flock . On Lake Maggiore , not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , amidst trees and grounds where art has done no more than to remove whatever could deform the natural beauty of the scene , on a lofty pedestal , a colossal statue - from the base to the summit not less than ninety feet in height-of the meek minister of Christ 's love is erected . Here he still looks over the lake and the charming region round about , and seems to be raising his hand in gentle and loving benediction . As the sunset throws its shadows across the ravines and the valleys and the water , and the quiet of nature settles like dew on the soul , and the history of the peaceful , self-denying priest , held for his virtues in such honor , is recalled , it is one of the most impressive scenes in Italy . The same distinctly marked characteristics appear gen // erally in the great men whom the Italian memory and heart preserve most faithfully in reverential regard . Italy , from the Roman times down , has had its distinguished soldiers ; but if Venice be excepted , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war . In Genoa , the statue of Columbus the discoverer is the ornament of the central public place . In Rome , the tomb of Raphael adds a new attraction to the Pantheon . In Florence , the Tribune of Galileo , Michel Angelo 's chapel , and the statues which line the sides of the court along the Uffizi palace , show the reverence paid to the names of the great Florentines , whose immortal renown was won in other fields than those of war . The monuments of Santa Croce are not those of soldiers , but of Galileo , of Machiavelli , of IDa Vinci , of Alfieri , and of Michel Angelo , - of men who in art or poetry or science have opened new realms to the imagination , the curiosity , and the reason of mankind . In part , this characteristic peculiarity of Italy must be referred to the influence which the Church has had , in directing attention to the arts of peace and to the triumphs of mind rather than of force . But there is another side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done or is capable of doing , still Catholicism , viewed as a form of church government , is not , except in a limited degree , favorable to the improvement of mankind . In rude and barbarous ages it arrested violence , and gave protection and encouragement to the milder and more peaceful virtues . But beyond a point early attained , it does not favor the development of those qualities , either of mind or of heart , which produce the feeling of self-reliance . Any progress in this respect is at war with its fundamental character . The Church is a great ecclesiastical organization ; and for a permanent and unchanging organization , there must not be too many competent to be leaders . On one side must be absolute authority , and on the other unquestioning obedience . A religious organization is the strongest , when the great body of its members are ignorant . Awakened and free thought leads to different and clashing views , and the union which depends on authority , unless the Church knows how to convince as well as to command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an ecclesiastical organization , to promote general intelligence , and to encourage freedom of thought in religion , would be suicidal . Then , too , a great organization , which has numerous interests depending upon it , is always timidly sensitive and fearful of change . It is artificial and un-elastic , and disorder in a single part renders the whole machinery liable to derangement . The Church governs too much not to have its influence powerfully felt , and its ecclesiastical laws and methods are so stationary , that while it raises those below it , its tendency is to draw down those above it , to its own level . The only safety for a system , which is itself to remain permanently without change , is to keep the men who come under its control unchanged . The introduction of a few ideas respecting the rights and duties of the mind , such as prevail with us , into a Catholic country , would shatter the mere organization of the Church from corner to key-stone . We shall not here trespass on the territory which belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church are well or ill founded , and whether it has or has not sufficient warrant for its peculiar dogmas , for its ecclesiastical organization , and for its claim to control the religious faith and practice of mankind , are questions of infinite moment , but the discussion of them belongs to another place . In what we have to say , we decline to bring against the character of the Catholic priesthood those charges , so easily made , and , even when false , with such difficulty refuted . On the contrary , we do not believe that such charges are true . If the priests are as corrupt as they are sometimes said to be , if their celibacy is fatal to the purity of domestic manners , and if there is among them that wide-spread infidelity which is often affirmed to exist , the Catholic Church must perish from internal decay . It is idle to say that men are insincere , because they are not convinced by the evidence which convinces us . Doubtless the Catholic clergy have the infirmities of our common human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know how they could be expected to give more satisfactory proof of sincerity than they have done . The patient , selfdenying labors of its humbler members , the enthusiasm of its // missionaries , the infrequency of any public abjuration of their belief the earnest perseverance with which they fulfil the duties prescribed to them , and the simple impossibility that large numbers of men should ever for any length of time profess to believe what they do not believe , should silence these accusations of bad faith and hypocrisy . If we were to blot from the world 's history all the heroism , the self-denial , and the devotion to human good , which the ministers of the Catholic Church have exhibited , we should leave a melancholy blank behind . But the ministers of religion may be sincere , while the system which they adopt may be defective in all its parts . The objection which we here make to the Catholic Church is , that , for some reason or other , it fails in promoting , beyond a certain point , the improvement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a religious system , we should have other objections to offer . But we confine ourselves to the single point , that as a system it is not favorable to the development of those qualities of mind and character on which human improvement and progress depend . We are well aware that the prosperity of agriculture and manufactures , and the amount of exports and imports , are no certain criterion by which to judge of the general well-being of a people . But the absence of this prosperity and the want of improvement in the institutions and customs of a country to which Nature has been lavish of her bounty , is a certain proof that there is a great defect in the general training and culture . The present condition of the Peninsula furnishes a melancholy commentary on those influences to which its inhabitants have been subjected . As one approaches Italy by water , - that Italy which was once the commercial centre of the world , - he expects to see the Mediterranean white with glancing sails ; but along the whole coast , hardly a vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sight . The ports of Leghorn , Genoa , Civita Vecehia , and Naples are guarded on the water side by vast fortifications ; but on entering their precincts , the half-empty space within gives melancholy indications as to the condition of the states of which these cities are the commercial capitals . But what bearing have facts of this description on the Catholic Church ? // We answer , that this decay has been going on in a country endowed with all the elements of prosperity , over the character of whose people the Catholic Church has for centuries exerted a commanding influence . It is right to expect that an institution possessing such power , if it be a beneficent one , should reveal itself in the gradual improvement and general prosperity of those whose minds and energies to so great an extent it educates and guides . But a far more striking fact in this connection is , that the want of prosperity and of improvement is the greatest where the power of the Church is greatest . For example , the population of Northern Italy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of Naples , as compared with those of Tuscany and Lombardy , appear but half civilized . The prosperity of Italy is confined to the North . Thus the value of the silk exported from the Lombardo-Venetian provinces amounts to about twenty-five million dollars annually , while all the exports of the continental portions of the kingdom of Naples , containing six millions of people , with a soil in many parts of inexhaustible fertility , amount only to ten million dollars a year , and the average imports are less than twentyfive millions . The total amount of its shipping , including every kind of vessel of five tons and upwards , is one hundred and thirty-two thousand tons , - hardly more than is owned in the single city of New Bedford . Without enumerating more particulars , it is , to say the least , a melancholy coincidence , that where the Catholic Church has most to do with forming the mind and character of the people , - as in the Papal and Neapolitan States , - there the prosperity which , under ordinary circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social condition , is at the lowest point , and there the prospect of any great change for the better is the least encouraging . It may be answered , that the Church devotes itself exclusively to the spiritual interests of men . We shall not discuss the merits of its religions influence , though it might be replied , that even in this work there is no proof of any signal success . Certainly , the common impression is that neither Rome nor Naples ( though these are the great seats of Church power ) is // particularly distinguished for the Christian spirit or practice of its inhabitants . But , apart from this , the statement that the Church devotes itself to the spiritual interests of the people , does not meet the objection . Religion ought to awaken and foster all the higher qualities of manhood ; and if these qualities are developed , they will exhibit themselves in action . They will appear in the energy , wisdom , grace , and uprightness carried into the common pursuits of life . As mind and heart prosper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they are concerned will prosper . Our objection is , that the lethargic , unprosperous , unimproving condition of Italy indicates an unenlightened and unimproving character in the people ; and that a Church which has such control over religion , morals , government , and education , must be in its principles or methods seriously defective , so long as it fails of doing for the Italian mind and character what we have a right to expect from a true religion . The actual influence of the Romish Church must be seen to the best advantage where there is the least hinderance to the thorough working out of its principles , that is to say , in the Papal States . We certainly shall not be guilty of the extravagance or injustice of imputing all the evils which exist in these States to Catholicism . But if we consider the length of time during which , with brief interruptions , the Pope has been the head of the State as well as of the Church , - if we reflect that the laws are enacted and the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools for the education of the young are under ecclesiastical superintendence , that the institutions for the relief of pauperism , for the prevention or punishment of crime , and , in short , all the great interests of society , are under the controlling influence of the Papacy , - we have a right to attribute to Catholicism what is peculiar in the moral and social condition and tendencies of the Papal States , to the extent at least of judging from them of the true nature and value of its influence . Tried by what it has done and has not done , where its power over institutions , customs , and ideas is nearly absolute , we think that the judgment formed of Catholicism , as a system of religion suited to promote the improvement of societ&amp; or of // individuals , can hardly be a favorable one . The climate of the Papal States unites in itself many of the advantages both of the North and the South , and , in the ancient Roman days , was not inconsistent with the highest physical and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in the variety of its agricultural products and its mineral resources . The dreaded Campagna itself is scarcely more sickly than large portions of the West and Southwest of the United States , which the industry and enterprise of a single generation have fransformed into a populous country . The people , though ignorant , have the vivacity and quick intelligence which have always characterized the Italians , and in physical health and vigor there is certainly no evidence of degeneration . There is a country to be improved , a people competent to be trained , and an opportunity for the highest form of civilization . Under all these circumstances , it is a fair question to ask , What has the Papacy made of its opportunities and advantages in these States ? It has built the sublimest temple ever reared by mortal hands . It has erected large numbers of rich and splendid churches . It has brought together , in the Vatican , the most magnificent collections of ancient and modern art . It has furnished extensive means for the education of priests . It trains some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to a limited extent has provided schools in which the children of the people may receive the first rudiments of instruction . It has established hospitals , and , in proportion to the number of inhabitants , more money is expended in Rome in charity and on charitable institutions , we suppose , than in any other city of the world . But , on the other hand , the great body of the people are poor , ignorant , and superstitious . The agricultural resources of the country are imperfectly developed , its manufactures are not sufficient to supply the wants of the inhabitants , its commerce has hardly an existence , its methods of administering justice are without those guards which furnish the best protection for the innocent , and its popular schools do little more than educate the young to be submissive and unquestioning subjects of Church and State . The charities of Rome are so wretchedly administered , that , large as they are , they apparently cre-41 // ate as much pauperism as they relieve . There are five thousand priests in Rome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are as many beggars . The worst prison in the civilized world is , probably , the great prison of Civita Veechia . One may there see to-day , among its thirteen hundred convicts , the state of things which existed before Howard lived . The Roman prisons , the mendicancy of the streets , the rude implements of agricultural labor , the absence of enterprise and improvement among the people , scarcely less than the ruins of ancient buildings , carry you back centuries . It is the civilization of the Dark Ages , maintaining itself strangely amidst the growing light and progress of modern times . The improvements of the age in the useful arts , in intercommunication , in the treatment of pauperism and crime , in the education of the young , penetrate slowly into the Papal States . They are not welcomed , but find their way in , if at all , in spite of the prevailing character and tendencies of Papal rule . It is a melancholy and suggestive fact , that the centre of the Catholic Church , where it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christendom . The Papal government is so little successful even in winning the affection of its subject*s , that they are kept in peaceful subjection only by means of a standing army . There is no freedom of the press or of speech in regard either to religion or government . The people are treated as children , whose thoughts and wills are to be kept under the entire direction of ecclesiastical authority . When it is remembered that Rome is the centre of the Catholic priesthood , that large numbers are carefully educated within its schools , and that many of the most eminent among them have been established in its different offices , and when it is also remembered that to the priesthood , beyond any other class , belongs the duty of promoting the moral and social welfare of mankind , the little that the modern world owes to the capital city of the Church may well excite surprise . How many literary or scientific works of a commanding and high order of merit has Rome produced during the last century ? what theological work even , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , within the same pe* nod , have emanated from Rome ? what suggestions of better // 487 18*54 . J methods of government ? Of . the multiplied philanthropic movements which during the same period have done so much to improve the condition of the ignorant and wretched , how many date from Rome ? What more enlightened ideas in regard to the true method of meeting and remedying the enormous evils of pauperism do we owe to Rome ? What has Rome done within a century to elevate the condition or improve the prospects of the laboring classes ? Nay , if we look only at the fine arts , - while the galleries of Rome attract the genius of all lands , how much of original genius has she herself produced ? How many painters of Roman birth are there of any mark or note ? One is surprised at the small number of the great masters who , not only recently , but in past ages , have had their birth or their early training in Rome . Michel Angelo and Raphael were among the first names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Da Vinci was from the neighborhood of Florence . Titian was from Venice , Guido from Bologna , Claude Lorraine from France , Rubens , Vandyke , and Rembrandt from a region regarded by the Romans as semi-barbarous . The great musical composers even , Handel and Haydn , iViozart and Beethoven , were reared in other lands . Neither Tasso , nor Ariosto , nor Dante , nor Petrarch , nor Alfieri , is a Roman name . We would not imply by this that there is any reason for expecting that all the genius of the world should have its birth in Rome . But it might be legitimately expected of a true Church , that , in the place where it has had for ages a confrolling influence over the moral and intellectual culture of the people , it should awaken a general thirst for improvement which would manifest itself in the excellence attained in those departments to which particular attention is directed . It might be expected that Rome should be distinguished , not only by the number of great men attracted to it from abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand years , but that it should itself give birth to its full proportion of men eminent for their genius . We dwell a little on this point because of the idea so commonly entertained , that there is some peculiar connection , which Protestantism does not share , between the fine arts // and the Romish faith . How much art in general may owe to the Romish Church , it may be difficult to say . It is much less , however , we suspect , than is sometimes imagined . The condition of the line arts depends on those general causes , whatever they may be , which , at any period , awaken and rouse to activity the powers of the human mind , and which tend to direct that activity towards art . Thus the unsurpassed wonders of Grecian genius were produced before Christianity existed on earth in any form . If art has flourished in Catholic countries , one reason probably is , that these countries have been commonly subject to despotic governments , under which freedom of thought and action in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted and hindered . Thus , men of genius , prohibited from the free discussion of religious , political , and social questions , have sought some compensation in the culture of poetry and music , of sculpture and painting . The mind of the time has turned aside from more important , but dangerous pursuits , to these safer employments . The noblest work of the Papacy , having for its specific object the elevation of men to a higher form of civilization , is its steadily continued effort to convert the heathen world to Christianity . In this , at least in purpose , it has been faithful to one great duty of the Christian Church . All honor should be paid to the missionaries of religion whom Rome has sent to so many barbarous nations , all honor to their self-denying labors and their lifelong martyrdom . But even in this work it is obvious that there has been some great deficiency . Tribes and provin*cs have been nominally converted , only to relapse again into heathenism . In the Middle Ages of violence , ravage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society , the Romish Church was the great promoter of peace , intelligence , and social order . The Church was then in advance of the civilization of the age . Yet the fact that the world now looks so little to Rome for aid in its efforts at improvement , would seem to indicate that it has fallen behind the civilization which it once fostered . The great task of Catholicism now is to maintain its own existence in the advancing light of modern society . // But without dwelling on the results of Catholicism , there are in the Papal government radical defects , which constitute essential parts of the system , and which must always go far to paralyze its power for good . In the first place , the dominant class in the Papal States is composed of men whose interests have no vital and necessary connection with the welfare of the people whom they rule . The people have no country but that in which they live and die ; but the country of the priesthood is coextensive with Catholicism . The Papacy is encamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province . But its great interests extend far beyond the limits within which it exercises its temporal sovereignty , and the condition of the Roman people must always be secondary and subordinate to its prosperity as an ecclesiastical power , claiming a religions supremacy over Christendom . Its temporal sway over the Roman States is but a means of strengthening its position as the head of the Church . It is impossible that a government with such divided interests should ever , except incidentally , be a good one in that department which it regards as subsidiary to its great objects and interests . But this is not the only , nor perhaps the most hurtful , way in which the ruling power separates itself from the people . The worst feature of all is , that in the Papal States the administration of government , religion , and education is in the hands of men divorced from those domestic ties which constitute the great bonds of society . A state is made up of families . It is an organization , not of isolated individuals , but of individuals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted by men who , as far as possible , abjure family ties . A religious life finds the most important part of its sorrows and joys , its trials , duties , and discipline , within the circle of family relations ; and yet the ministers of religion are on system separated from such relations , and thus from the experiences which interpret them , and the close personal interests which grow out of them . In the same way , the education of the young , and particularly that of females , is conducted almost exclusively by those who not only are themselves forbidden to enter into these // domestic bonds of husband and wife , and thus of parents and children , but who are taught to regard the abnegation of the tenderest human ties as one of the highest virtues of the Christian life . The system is in defiance of the practical sense of mankind . The mere statement of it is its condemnation . What parent can wish a daughter to be trained for her natural condition in the frimily , by those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls of a monastery or nunnery ? Or how is it possible that men who exclude themselves from domestic relations and experiences should have other than maimed and fragmentary views of the real religious wants and trials of this mortal condition ? It is like giving the command of an army to a member of the Peace Society . Thus the defective administration of the affairs of the Roman State is the result , not of accident , but of fundamental principles wrought into the very substance of the Romish Church . But leaving this part of the subject , we are led from a survey of the present condition of Italy to speculate on its prospects in the future . Here , again , in endeavoring to form any definite ideas on this point , the first inquiry is , What is likely to be , in Italy , the fate of the ecclesiastical power of Rome ? For the present , at least , the destinies of Italy are bound up with those of the Romish Church . Were the Church the true friend of the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and call into action the mind and the energies of Italy , to arouse a national spirit and to unite Italian hearts , no foreign power would be able to keep the Peninsula permanently in subjection . But so long as the Church allies itself with , and derives support from , the despotisms which have sway in Italy , there is little ground for anticipating any political change for the better . The civil governments and the Chnrch together are too strong for the people . That Catholicism , though with many modifications and limitations of its power , for a length of time beyond the reach of human foresight , will be the nominal religion of Italy , there can be no doubt . For generations to come , ingenious commentators on the Apocalypse will be able to predict the speedy downfall of the Papacy . But for ourselves , we see no indica // 491 tions of any such event . Were the Pope even to lose his temporal power as the head of the Papal States , it is by no means certain that it would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church . He would still remain the centre and sovereign of the great army of the Catholic priesthood , a body of men scattered over all lands , divorced from the ordinary ties of country and family , and connected with the Papacy equally by religious faith and earthly ambifion . The Papacy would still retain its wealth , and it would be all the more safe and effective for its purposes , from its being divided and diffused through so many countries and in the charge of so many agents , united in a common dedication to the service of the Church . The loss of temporal power would at least save it from those political positions and entanglements , which , however it may have been in ages when nearly all diplomatists were Churchmen , can now only by accident result in its advantage . We have no confidence at all in any of the direct efforts made to convert Italy to Protestantism . We should quite as soon expect Italian priests to convert England , as English missionaries to convert Italy . Any religious reformation which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up within itself , and not come from abroad . We do not , however , on this account , by any means regard the omens as favorable to the fortunes of the Catholic faith in Italy . Romanism is at war with the spirit of the age . It forbids inquiry and freedom of thought in religion , and yet the spirit of inquiry and freedom is stimulated by all the circumstances of the times . The contagion spreads into Italy . No quarantine can entirely fence it out . Throngs of travellers are making the Italians familiar with those of a different faith . The railroads which are sure in the end to traverse the Peninsula , the eleefric telegraph , the commerce with Protestant and republican countries , the various improvements of civilization which must at length find their way into the most guarded and secluded provinces , not only accustom the Italians to a wider circle of thought , but excite the mind to greater activity and curiosity . In former ages every thing might be kept in the dark . The Grand Duke of Tuscany or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot whomsoever he pleased , and the event was hardly known beyond the immediate friends of the victim . But Italy has constantly multiplying relations with countries which allow nothing to remain concealed . It has to deal now , not only with the Spaniard , the Frank , and the German , but with that Anglo-Saxon race , which , whether reasonably or unreasonably , somehow feels it necessary to investigate the affairs of its neighbors as if they were its own . The sacred immunity from criticism which the Italian sovereigns possessed , no longer exists . They have not the privilege of putting even their own people into a dungeon , without being exposed to inquiries about the cause . If it be a man who has been prominent in religion or in politics , and especially if his only crime be some religions or political act which in another country would be esteemed a merit , it becomes the talk of Europe . " Our own correspondents , " the public press , the platform , the pulpit , the political assembly , feel a sudden call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpus applied to sovereign powers . " Let us have the subject up and talk it over . " The matter is by no means entirely settled when the King of Naples , following the good old custom of despotism , has quietly shut up a suspected patriot in an oubliette ; and all England and America can have no rest till it is known why the Madiai are imprisoned in Tuscany . These questions have meaning in them , because they are , or may be , backed with batteries of cannon . And what is more , instead of being silenced by any remonstrances against interference , they are likely to become more and more urgent every year . This disposition to search into the acts of government is contagious . But all such questioning brings up the general question of individual rights ; and when men begin to discuss their civil rights , they are not likely to stop short of any which belong to them as men . With this spirit of inquiry , and this increasing regard for the rights of the individual , which characterize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its existence may not be put in jeopardy , its character can hardly fail to be greatly modified , and its power limited , by their influence . To retain its authority , it must adapt both its pretensions and its modes of administration to the changed condition of the world . // But there is another , and at the present a far more powerful , tendency of feeling with which the Church , as an ecclesiastical organization , has to contend . Whatever may be thought of the capacity of the Italians for the enjoyment of free institutions , there can be no doubt that large numbers earnestly desire to recover political liberty , and that they hate with bitter sincerity that foreign influence which prevents their attaining it . The citizens of Venice and Bologna , to whom the presence of Austrian regiments is a daily and galling insult , do not willingly submit to the brute force of those whom they consider semi-barbarians ; but with this hated foreign rule the Church is associated . The priests are believed to be allied , both in interest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common conviction that the most sacred rites of religion are made use of as a means of strengthening this foreign domination . We have already alluded to the prevailing belief , that the plans of Italian patriots are perpetually revealed through the confessional . Any union of the Church with*the foreign conqueror is offensive enough , but this treachery to man and to God , in behalf of despotism , this converting of religion into the instrument of a state policy which they abhor , has intensified that feeling of bitterness towards the Church , which other causes had before excited . It insults the people , by offering them a stone when they ask for bread . It comes under the guise of a friend , but is distrusted as the most insidious of all spies , and as the most dangerous foe of those who would do any thing for the restoration of Italian liberty . One result of this has been , to make many of the more thoughtful and patriotic - though they nominally remain Catholics - willing to favor the dissemination of the Scriptures . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those among us who are desirous of propagating Protestantism in Italy . At any rate , to a considerable extent the disposition shown by many of the Italians to aid in the circulation of the Bible is to be ascribed to political , rather than religious causes . By substituting the Bible in the place of the Pope , as the supreme authority in religion , and by closing the confessional , through which the priesthood is put into possession of the secrets of Italy , they hope to protect them // selves against what is now their most formidable enemy . Except in the Papal States , such a change would practically separate the Church from the civil government . The Pope might still be the first bishop of the Catholic world , and the priests would retain their moral influence as ministers of religion , while they could no longer be made use of as efficient and reliable agents of the political power . But whatever the cause , it does not diminish the hostility to the course of the Papal government . Not only the spirit of inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal danger , the hope of reinstating the liberties of Italy , and the hopelessness of accomplishing this end so long as the Church retains its present authority over the mass of the people and uses it as a means for suppressing all efforts to recover the freedom which has been lost , have brought large numbers of the most active , intelligent , and enterprising spirits into opposition to the Papacy . The very means which in an ignorant and uninquiring age have added to the strength of the Church , this disposition to question its authority is likely to convert into a source of weakness . For example , what will be the result when the minds of men , stimulated and sharpened by political enmity , begin to inquire into the value of the innumerable relics with whose sanctity the Church has to such an extent identified itself ? It would amount to little , that in some secluded village of the Apennines a superstitious homage was paid to the doubtful bones of some mythical martyr , or to the image of an ecclesiastical saint . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense , takes them under its immediate protection , and vouches for their trustworthiness . In a balcony over the high altar of St. Peter 's is preserved the handkerchief which St. Veronica gave to the Saviour on his way to the cross , and which , being used by him to wipe the sweat of his great suffering from his face , took and retained the impression of his features . With it is deposited the lance of the soldier who pierced the Saviour 's side . In another balcony is preserved the head of St. Andrew ; and in another , a portion of the true cross . In St. John Lateran , you may see the table of the Last Supper , a column splin // tered when the veil of the temple was rent , a portrait of the Saviour painted by St. Luke , and other objects of similar character , presented for the veneration of the Catholic world ; while every moment of the day pilgrims may be found ascending on their knees the Scala Santa , - the staircase of Pilate 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment-seat . One 's religious faith is somewhat startled , when in Cologne he has shown him the bones of the eleven thousand virgins built into the walls , or exhibited in glass cases about the choir of the church of St. Ursula . He can hardly fail to have some misgivings , when , among other relics , he is pointed to one of the stone vessels which held the water that was turned into wine at the marriage of Cana . And above all , when the skulls of the three wise men of the East who brought their offerings to the infant Saviour - incased with jewels , and deposited in a shrine whose treasures , after being plundered during the French Revolution , are still estimated at more than a million of dollars - are uncovered for his veneration , not in some road-side chapel , but in the very sanctuary of the great cathedral , and when he learns that the fees paid for the exhibition of these ghastly relics are devoted to the completion of the unfinished temple , his respect for a Church which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudely shaken . But the honor paid to these relics might be regarded as merely an accident of superstition , one for which the Cath .. lie Church is not properly responsible , and which may remain or disappear without serious damage to its authority . The numberless relics , however , which are exhibited at Rome can not be regarded in this light . They do not occupy a secondary place , but are the attraction , the glory , and the sanctity of the churches to which they belong . They are not offered to the homage of the people as venerable , though uncertain relics of the past , but are taken under the patronage of the Pope himself , and through the most solemn offices of religion are commended to the faith and adoration of the Christian world . It is the circumstance that the Pope makes himself responsible for their genuineness , which gives them their great importance . They thus are not an excrescence on the Church , but wrought into its very fabric . It would seem as if in time // they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it understood that the Pope and the Cardinals receive these relics and legends as authentic ? If they do not , a startling question comes up as to the moral honesty of adopting , honoring , and using them , and thus commending them to Catholic belief . On the other hand , if they are received in good faith , and if the Church makes itself responsible for their being what they purport to be , the next question is as to the infallibility of the Pope who indorses them . The authenticity of many of these relics must be rejected by the common sense of men , when they are brought fairly to consider the facts in the case . And to doubt here is to doubt the infallibility of the Church . Thus the Church must , to a greater or less extent , come into conflict with the intelligence of the age . But while , in this and in other ways , the Church is alienating from itself both the intelligence and the patriotism of Italy , we by no means regard this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , the more probable immediate result is the decay of all religious faith . We fear that the darkest days for religion in Italy are yet to come , and that the going out of an unreasoning superstition may be only a signal for the entrance of an unreasoning infidelity . The Italian nature has little affinity with the austere , simple , and almost nak*d forms of Protestant worship ; and a Catholic training creates intellectual habits , which , more than any positive dogmas , indispose and unfit one for the duties and responsibilities which Protestantism makes fundamental . A Protestant faith not only admits , but requires , the use of reason in religion . It is founded on evidence which addresses itself to each individual understanding . It enjoins the exercise of the private judgment in the interpretation of Scripture , and makes each man personally responsible to God for the faithful use of his faculties in the formation of religious opinions . On the contrary , the Italian is taught to regard religion as a matter of authority , and the use of reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as treason against God . The Church determines for the individual what is to be believed . That spirit of inquiry which Protestantism in- // 1854. culcates as a duty , Catholicism denounces as a crime . Minds trained to this habit of acquiescence and submission in religion may undoubtedly become alienated from , and perhaps be led to reject , an old form of worship ; but they are wholly unprepared to adopt religious views which address themselves to the active intelligence of man , and which in their very reception require its exercise . If Christianity is accepted on no ground except the declaration of the Church that it is true , if belief in the religion is identified with a belief in the infallibility of its ministers , the moment that the authority of the Church is rejected , the authority of Christianity is rejected with it . It was in this way that unbelief spread so rapidly in France . Christianity had no hold on those mental convictions which are produced by a personal examination of its nature and evidence ; the people were taught to regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very doubts which undermined the latter swept away the former . Before Protestantism can prevail in Italy , the fundamental habits of the Italian mind in regard to religion must uiidergo a revolution . For these reasons , we greatly fear that the decay of Catholicism will , at first , result only in the prevalence of irreligion and unbelief . The immediate prospects of Italy seem to us , whichever way we turn , to be covered with gloom . The long continued and firmly established power which foreign states have gained within her borders can scarcely be cast out , except in connection with some general war which will involve the whole continent of Europe . Ana even when relieved from foreign rule and interference , the discipline of the people for a liberty to whose forms even they have been so long unaccustomed , the union of cities and states which for ages have been rivals into one confederacy , and the consolidation of liberal institutions which shall embrace the Peninsula and be in harmony with the Catholic Church , or with any church , can , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violence , disorder , and conflict . The only hope of regeneration seems to be through the terrible baptism of blood . And yet we can not believe that the fairest land on earth , with a soil like a garden , and a people which , though now 42* 497 // politically demoralized , is gifted with natural intelligence , and preserves in its history the records of past freedom and glory , can be doomed for ever to its present lethargy . There is one remarkable fact in Italian history which finds elsewhere no parallel . It is the reviving of a new and fresh civilization on the ruins of a preceding one . Nineveh and Palenque have known no awakening . Not so with Italy . Its earlier civilization reached its highest mark , and then sank amidst the vices , the effeminacy and selfishness , of the later ages of the Western Empire . There never was a race on earth whose manhood seemed more entirely to have gone to decay , and never a people among whom society seemed to be more entirely disintegrated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was accompanied by the weakness , profligacy , and ignorance , without any of the common virtues , of barbarism . But still there was something in the Italian nature , - a vitality not desfroyed by the misery and degradation of centuries , - which enabled it to rise from the ground and to vindicate its descent from a race that had ruled the world . The same people which had been overborne and crushed under foreign invasion , in turn subjected the conqueror to itself , rebuilt its cities , reorganized the institutions of liberty , and gave birth to those men of genius who made the age of the Italian republics as remarkable as that of Pericles . We found our hopes for the future not a little on this fact . The same Italian nature still remains . It is incomparably and in every respect less degraded than it was ten centuries ago . Whatever may be the case in the larger towns , those who are best informed declare that the inhabitants of the country , though ignorant and superstitious , have very generally the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vices which are commonly thought most to degrade the higher and lower classes of the cities , it is affirmed , do not , in any similar degree , taint the rural population . There is still to be found an unexhausted race . The great mass of the people thus possess those essential elements which must be at the foundation of a higher civilization , - physical vigor , quickness of apprehension , faith , simplicity . Under such circumstances , it is not unreasonable to think that Italy may reinstate // herself among the great powers of the earth . We know not why one may not expect her , as she has twice done before , again to take the lead in some higher development of civilization . There is , at any rate , hope for Italy so long as any considerable number of her leading minds preserve that passionate , though it may be vague , craving for freedom , which now so widely exists . We gather encouragement for the future out of the very disasters of the present . It does not disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempts to establish Italian freedom are wild , misdirected , and abortive . It is only through a thousand unsuccessful efforts that the northwest passage into that open sea is yet to be found . We certainly should rejoice to see wars and fightings give place to a social order founded on the principles of justice . But we have no desire to see the order which despotic courts would establish remain undisturbed . Italy owes but a small debt of gratitude for the popular quiet which they maintain within her borders . In the present state of things , our sympathies are with those , whatever be the name by which they go , who can not rest , who can not have peaceful sleep , so long as a foreign flag hangs out its ill-omened folds under the fair heaven of Italy . Our hope lies in the fact that a hundred thousand Austrians scarcely suffice to keep the peace in its northern provinces . The Italian patriots may or may not be Red Republicans , and Mazzini may be , for aught we know , a wilder dreamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ineffectual ; but with all their errors they are on the right side . The only fatal mistake is to be on the side of the foreigner , and the hopeless degradation of Italy will not have come till the people willingly and submissively bow their necks to the yoke . But this , let us rejoice to think , they are not likely soon to do . The spirit of resistance is not only kept alive , but seems to spread . The Italians have so much manliness still left , that perpetual defeat can not teach them to keep quiet under despotism . Out of the ashes of one conflagration , they gather the sparks wherewith to kindle another . The Italian patriots are gaining wisdom from their experience at home , and , driven into exile , they prepare themselves to return to their // native land with the additional light which they have derived from their acquaintance with the institutions of those free countries in which they have lived while abroad . The constant failure of partial and local insurrections , and the evident necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length lead to that the want of which has been the source of such immeasurable evil , - the organization of the several parts of Italy into one national unity . The day of Italian redemption is nearer , perhaps , than we sometimes think . If the world had settled down into a permanent peace , we confess that there would be little hope for its disarmed , undisciplined , unorganized masses in any conflict with the armies of Austria and France . But powerful causes are at work , which must soon lead to new political combinations . While we write , Europe seems to be pliinging into a general war . What the result may be , no human foresight enables one to predict . If Russia should be occupied with France and England , Hungary is not likely to remain passive and quiet . If Austria should be forced to take sides with Russia , the first cannon-shot will resound over Italy as the signal for a general awakening . Let a French or English fleet approach Venice or enter Leghorn , and supply the Italians with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops be withdrawn to defend the hereditary states of the house of llapsburg , and the continuance of Austrian rule in Italy would seem to be near its end . No doubt , if the Italians should obtain freedom from foreign interference , they would only have begun the real work before them . Under the most favorable circui*stances , long and weary , and it may be disastrous years , must elapse before the Peninsula can attain to a wise and permanent political organization . But that it shall finally do so , we will not allow ourselves to doubt . We have faith in man , and faith in freedom , and faith in that Providence under whose sovereignty evil at length consumes itself , and whose fundamental laws are on the side of human progress .
