ART . V.-TIIE RIG LIT OF SEARCII. llistor*q of the Law of Nations in Europe and America , from the Earkest Times to the Treaty of Washington , 1842 . By HENRY WHEATON , LL . D. WITHIN a few weeks the country has had a new dispute with a foreign power thrown upon its hands , and demonstrations of war , too fierce to be sincere , have resounded through the halls of Congress . Statesmen , forgetting their statesmanship , sought to gain favor with the people , or to frighten Great Britain , by hostile menaces . Men from the remote West , safe in their distance from fleets and bombardments , " breathed threatenings and slaughter " the loudest ; while leaders of parties bid against one another , on the assumption that a slumbering jealousy of England could be turned to some account . Meanwhile the people felt no particular interest in the dispute , nor any serious apprehension of war . Everybody knew that neither Great Britain nor the United States could afford to go to war , that they could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war , whenever it should end , would be likely to end , as the last war did , without a syllable being uttered respecting the original ground of controversy . The people to all appearance have judged right ; the cloud has passed by without any real thunder , and things are as they were before . The cause of this alarm is the active search of British cruisers around the coasts of Cuba for slavers . It is well known that a somewhat brisk trade between the slave coasts of Africa and that island is carried on by means of American vessels and agents . By treaty between Great Britain and Spain , a mutual right of search of vessels suspected of being engaged in that traffic is conceded . But the United States , partly because they formerly smarted under arrogant , ill-founded claims of searching their vessels for British seamen , partly because the government has long been indifferent to its treaty obligation to suppress the slave trade , have been unwilling to allow // to England the first step towards a right of search , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruisers any power whatsoever over our vessels , although caught in the very act of a traffic which is piracy by the laws of both nations . The result has been , that as far as the slave trade is concerned , we take the same place which neutrals do in a state of war ,  --  we get the carrying trade in slaves into our hands . The English stand for one belligerent , Spanish and English slavers for the other . This latter belligerent being driven out of the seas by the activity of its foe , the neutral takes his place , but since there is not here , as in war , a clear and full right of search , the neutral is safe from molestation . Under the temptation held out by the profits and practical impunity of this traffic , we are becoming the principal slave trading , as we are the principal fillibustering people of the world . And these evils are greatly aggravated by the feebleness of the force employed on the coast of Africa , by the inefficiency in the execution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the readiness of our government to complain against England of every fancied want of respect to our flag , united with an apparent indifference towards the suppression of the slave trade , and the fulfillment of our treaty obligations . It would appear , then , that upon a question which most persons would regard as very trivial , our national honor and some of the most important interests of mankind depend . If the English are wrong in their doctrine of international law , or their practice under it , the evil they can inflict is not of very great amount , it is hardly more than an over-careful police might inflict upon an innocent person sallying out late at night to go to the doctor 's ; but if we , from jealousy or indifference , refuse to make reasonable arrang6mnents in regard to the slave trade , we are sustaining thereby the worst crimes that men calling themselves Christians can commit ,  --  crimes which our own laws justly punish with death . We propose in the following pages to give a brief view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American doctrines on the point of examining vessels suspected of being slavers , for the purpose of ascertaining their national character ; and then to inquire whether anything effectual can be done by the // United States to execute their own laws against slave trading , and to perform their obligations , assumed by solemn treaty more than once , that they would do this to the extent of their power . The right of search has sometimes been represented as being exclusively of a belligerent character , as incidental to the exercise of certain belligerent rights , and therefore never justifiable in a state of peace . This is in a great measure true , and yet , in one instance , according to our laws , and those of Great Britain , vessels beyond the proper national sea-line , are liable to detention and visitation . We refer to operations under the hovering act of Great Britain and to a kindred regulation in our revenue laws , which prohibit foreign goods to be transhipped within four leagues of the coast without payment of duties . In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adjoining shores is extended ; its police rules are carried into effect beyond the reach of cannon shot or the marine league , which in ordinary cases limits its sway over the high seas . Let now a vessel be suspected of evading the revenue laws , at this distance from the shore ; there is no way of executing the hovering act , or our similar provision , except by a search on the high seas , of which the suspected ship , so far as we can see , has no reason to complain . Again , a merchant vessel , which has been suspected of committing a crime within the territory of a nation , may be pursued into the high seas , and searched , or it may be captured there ; but this case is only a seeming exception to the rule that search on the high sea is a belligerent act , for the conduct which provoked the search began within the dominion of the searching power , which has an undoubted right to redress itself for such injuries upon the common territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must be admitted that the right of search belongs to a state of war . As long as the distinction is received between articles contraband of war and innocent in their character , as long as the doctrine that enemy 's goods are not safe on board of a neutral vessel is not blotted out from the code of international law , neutral ships must be liable to search , and can not resist it with impunity. // And even if all restrictions on neutral trade whatever were abolished , the right of war could not be exercised without visiting and detaining vessels on the high seas , in order to ascertain whether they belonged to a friend or to an enemy . The annoyances , therefore , growing out of this right , the arrogance of lieutenants clothed with a little brief authority , the detention on a *oyage , the feeling of something like oppression which neutrals will always entertain when a vessel of war gives its peremptory notice to make a visit ,  --  these can never cease unless some arrangement can be agreed upon by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way give security for its merchant vessels , that they are not engaged in an unlawful traffic . Such an arrano'ement has been attempted by sending a pub-b lic vessel as a convoy to a fleet of merchant ships , having the proper certificates of the lawful nature of their trade on board . The frigate or the privateer of a belligerent , in this case would have to do only with the convoy . This is a desirable arrangement , and has been introduced into treaties between particular powers , but hitherto the law of nations does not require the abandonment of the right of search on account of the presence of a convoy . It is quite conceivable , also , that a storm at sea having separated a fleet sailing under such protection , a visiting vessel falling in with one of the merchantmen , might not find sufficient proof of its character without a search . It is equally conceivable that the certificates of a government might not amount to much ; that a vessel might stealthily take articles contraband of war on board , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search might be regarded as the safest and best way of securing belligerents against infractions of their rights . The right of search as thus laid down , brings us to the case of the search of a ve*sel suspected of being a pirate . Between organized states and pirates there is perpetual war , and so the belligerent right always exists against the latter . Moreover , flag no more covers a vessel suspected of piracy , than it covers a neutral suspected of having contraband on board . A pirate will have an assortment of flags on board , and will hoist any one which is most likely to serve his turn : how ridiculous it // would be in this case to make the plea that the flag covers the vessel . So far as we are aware , this plea is never made , aithongli it may be claimed that an innocent vessel arrested and detained on unreasonable suspicion of piracy , has a right to damages , on the same principle as an innocent man arrested through mistake by a sheriff . We pass on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a right by one nation only and admitted by no other , which in its attempted exercise became a cause of war , and has contributed , as much as anything else , to attach to the legitimate right of search an odious character . We refer to the claim of England to visit neutral vessels in time of war , for the purpose of ascertaining whether any of the sailors on board of them are British subjects , and of impressing such persons into the military service of their country . This claim is defended on two grounds ; first , by the prerogative of the English crown to force its subjects to do duty on board men of war , or the right of impressment , and secondly , by the principle of indefeasible allegiance , according to which no Englishman by settling abroad can shake off his national character and obligations . But a moment 's thought will show that the claim of impressing native-born Englishmen out of neutral vessels in war is not justified by these principles of English law . Though the crown of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can this attribute be exercised within another sovereignty , on foreign soil-as on board of neutral vessels which are neutral territory ? This principle runs connter to some of the plainest and best established rules of international law . It would justify the pursuit of one belligerent by another within neutral waters , and the invasion of foreign territory to secure fugitives from justice . An Englishman on the same principle might be arrested on a neutral vessel for the purpose of collecting his poll-tax or enforcing any other obligation towards his sovereign . It would , in short , destroy all sovereignties in order to extend the operation of the laws of each , and in its application would become as unendurable to the English nation as to any other . Again , the denial of a right in an Englishman to expatriate // himself seems to have nothing to do with the question of impressment , at least as far as those Englishmen are concerned who have never changed their nationality : were the right to be abandoned , the right of impressment would have j ust as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English citizens as it has now . Thus we may say that the reasons , in the light of international law , for such visitation of neutral vessels are less cogent than for almost any violation of neutral territory . The British sailor may have entered into the service of the neutral in the strictest conformity with the laws of both countries , He is engaged in a lawful employment . He is while so employed wholly amenable to the laws of the neutral state , and is , when on the high seas in the ship , upon neutral territory . There is no special hardship in carrying out the rule of the neutral 's jurisdiction , no case of necessity to justify any departure from the rule . No other nation has persisted in any similar claim. * The enforcement of this pretended right , peculiarly oppressive when it fell on English emigrants who had their families and their homesteads in the United States , and peculiarly difficult of application to the sailors of a nation having the same names and speaking the same language , was , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1812 , and the principal cause of the acrimony with which the war was attended . Peace followed with no distinct mention of this ground of quarrel , but it is certain that the offense will never be repeated , unless for the purpose of provoking war again . The right of search for the purpose of impressing British seamen on board of our vessels is a dead , obsolete thing , which no interests or pride or necessity of England can ever revive . Meanwhile , a jealousy of England upon the sea was aroused by this idle claim , which has never been laid asleep ,  --  a jealousy which became us in our weakness , but now in our strength seems inconsistent with national bravery and selt*reliance . This jealousy has influenced negotiation on another and the only * Comp . Mr. webster 's letter to Lord Ashburton , of Aug. 5,1542 , reprinted in his works . VoL VI , page 318. // remaining right of search of which we have not spoken ,  --  we refer to the right of search for vessels engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly what are the differences of opinion between Great Britain and the United States , which have led to so much negotiation , and have threatened serious collision , we may be permitted to give a summary of what has taken place between the two countries in regard to the prevention of the slave trade since the year 1815 . For a fuller view we refer our readers to Dr. Wheaton 's work at the head of this Article . By the treaty of Ghent in December , 1814 , we bound our selves solemnly as a nation to " use our best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object , " as the suppression of the traffic in slaves . For some years after this however we contented ourselves with the cheap work of imposing penalties on the traffic . An act which passed Congress in 1818 , increased the penalties of the slave trade and extended their application ; the act of 1819 authorized the sending of armed vessels to the coast of Africa , and the confiscation of ships engaged in such trade , whether belonging to native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1820 , the slave-trade , wherever carried on , was declared to be piracy , both for all persons on American craft so employed , and for American citizens serving on any vessel . This legislation was honestly meant . There was then no show , as now , of preventing crime coupled with connivance at it in private ; there was no voice lifted up to defend the slave-trade ; and almost everybody , everywhere in our land , expected that slavery itself would eventually cease . Those who are old enough to remember that time , feel not a little solemnized by the unwelcome conviction that since then political honor , national character , and the principles of politicians have been regularly descending , until nations abroad have ceased to feel respect for the honesty of the United States , and a political man has begun to be regarded as a rogue , or a dupe of rogues . Notwithstanding this increased severity of our laws against slave trading , the trade was carried on from this country , Cuba and Brazil furnishing the demand . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government of the United States the adoption of more effectual measures , in order to comply with the stipulations of the treaty , and in particular , proposed that each nation should concede to the other the right ofsearch with the simple object in view of ascertaining whether suspected vessels were really concerned in this traffic . But our government uniformly objected to any such concession , both on account of the odiousness of the right , even in war , and the difficulties which mixed courts , having jurisdiction in cases of capture , might involve . Things were in this state in 1823 , when the House of Representatives by a most honorable vote of 131 to 9 resolved " that the President of the United States be requested to enter upon , and to prosecute from time to time , such negotiation with the several maritime powers of Europe and America , as he may deem expedient for the effectual abolition of the African slave trade , and its ultimate denunciation as piracy under the law of nations by the consent of the civilized world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negotiations which followed it that brought the Parliament of England to declare the slave trade piracy for the first time in March , 1824 . We pass over abortive attempts to establish a qualified right of search for slavers , which began soon after this , and come down to the convention of March 13 , 1824 . By this convention the officers of certain government vessels belonging to both powers , and duly qualified to cruise on the coast of Africa , America , and the West Indies , were authorized to detain and examine vessels suspected of being engaged in the slave trade . If the search justified the suspicion , the vessel was to be delivered up to the officers of a vessel having the same national character with the slaver , and cruizing on the station ; or if there were no such cruisers , such vessel was to be taken to its own country or to one of the dependencies of the same , and placed within reach of the tribunals there . Remedies were provided against the exercise of search in a vexatious or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the captains of visited vessels identifying themselves , and declaring their object to be that of ascertaining whether // the inerchantman was engaged in the slave trade . Such , were some of the provisions of this convention . The tenth article we give in its own words . " The high contracting parties declare that the right , which in the foregoing articles , they have each reciprocally conceded , of detaining , visiting , capturing and delivering over for trial the merchant vessels of the other , engaged in the African slave trade , is wholly and exclusively grounded on the consideration of their having made that traffic piracy , by their respective laws ; and further that the reciprocal concession of the said right , as guarded , limited , and regulated by this convention , shall not be so construed as to authorize the detention , or search of the merchant vessels of either nation by the officers of the Navy of the other , except vessels engaged , or suspected of being engaged in the African slave trade , or for any other purpose whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels concerned in that traffic for trial and adjudication by the tribunals and laws of their own country ; nor be taken to affect in any other way the existing rights of either of the high contracting parties . And they do also hereby agree and engage to use their influence respectively with other maritime and civil . ized powers , to the end that the African slave trade may be declared to be piracy under the law of nations . " When this convention came before the Senate of the United States they amended it in several particulars . They introduced a limit of place by striking out the right of cruising on the coast of America , and they gave power to either party to renounce the convention after six months ' notice . They struck out also an article , which speaks of trying for piracy citizens or subjects of either country , found on board a vessel " not carrying the hag of the other party , nor belonging to the citizens or subjects of either , but engaged in the illicit traffic of slaves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such cases would be principally those of citizens of the United States , on board of Portuguese , or other slavers , subject by treaty to l3ritish search , who were committing piracy according to our law , but not according to the law of the country to which the vessel belonged . Thus mutilated , the convention went back to England to be rejected , and so the matter ended . The thread of negotiation was again taken up after some years and the treaty of Washington , signed August 9 , 1842 , contained provisions which still continue to be binding . By this treaty the parties to it engaged to maintain in service on the coast of Africa a snfflcient force of vessels to carry in all not less than // eighty guns , in order to enforce , separately , and respectively , the laws , rights and obligations of each of the two countries for the suppression of the slave trade , which squadrons , while separate , were to act in concert under instructions from their governments . The ninth article of the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within whose jurisdiction markets for slaves are allowed to exist , to induce them to close such markets for ever . By another article , the 11th , the article requiring a naval force on the coast of Africa is to continue in force five years after the ratification of the treaty , and afterwards until either of the parties shall signify a wish to terminate it . The efficiency and vigor of our African cruisers in carrying out our obligations assumed in this treaty are shown by commander Foote , in his " Africa and the American Flag , " to be most commendable . The officers of our navy go there with the fullest intent to discharge their duties like honorable men . No one can say of them that munera navium , S*vos illaqueant duces , but it is still true in the language of the same ode that Aurum per medios ire satellites , Et perrumpere amat saxa potentius ictu fulmineo . Great profits keep up the trade in spite of the penalty of death , and the watchfulness of cruisers , just as they keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , to an American mind , adds a certain sort of keen relish as well as of respectability to the employment . But the great difficulty in putting an end to the slave trade under this arrangement , is owing to the stand which we have taken in regard to the right of search . If a British cruiser boards a vessel belonging to this country , and the papers are right , no search can be made , notwithstanding the most flagrant suspicion . As has lately been said in Parliament , an American slaver may pass through a British fleet with its slaves in open sight with perfect impunity . And should the boarded vessel , on the other hand , be engaged in a lawful trade , the cruiser is responsible for the damage of the detention . Nay , we may say , it is re // sponsible in a certain sense for more , since the irritated commander of the detained vessel , desirous of distinction , sends home a flaming account of wrongs which were never inflicted , and puts what was done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , we believe , that the stories of insults to the American flag , which of late awakened the unseemly wrath of the Senate , were nearly all of them falsehoods or exaggerations . If we go to war for Jenkins ' ears , we ought to be sure that our enemy cut them off . A question of considerable importance arose a good while since , between our country and Great Britain , as to the true notion of the right of search . Is there any difference between a right of visitation so called , and a right of search , between a right to ascertain by an inspection of a ship 's papers that she has the nationality which she claims , and a right , after that , to inspect the vessel and cargo for the purpose of ascertaining whether the papers are not fraudulent The English doctrine as to this point , was expressed by Lord Aberdeen in a note to our minister in London , in 1841 , of which the following words are a part : " The right of search , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and can have no existence on the high seas during peace . The undersigned apprehends , however , that the right of search is not confined to the verification of the nationality of the vessel , but also extends to the object of the voyage and the nature of the cargo . The sole purpose of the British cruisers is to ascertain whether the vessels they meet with are really American or not . The right asserted has , in truth , no resemblance to the right of search either in principle or in practice . It is simply a right to satisfy the party who has a legitimate interest in knowing the truth , that the vessel actually is what her colors announce . This right we concede as freely as we exercise . The British cruisers are not instructed to detain American vessels under any circumstances whatever ; on the contrary , they are ordered to abstain from all interference with them , be they slavers or otherwise . But where reasonable suspicion exists that the American flag has been abused for the purpose of covering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // that the government of the United States , which has stigmatized and abolished the trade itself , should object to the adoption of such means as are necessary for ascertaining the truth . " A little later we find the English Envoy at Washington in a corn munication read to the Secretary of State , giving notice that the British Government still maintained and would exercise when necessary , its own right to ascertain the genuineness of any flag which a suspected vessel might bear ; that if , in the exercise of this right , either from involuntary error , or in spite of every precaution , loss or injury should be sustained , a prompt reparation would be afforded ; but that it should entertain for a single instant the notion of abandoning the right itself , would be quite impossible . The Government of the United States , on the other hand , have maintained that there is no right of visiting a vessel for the purpose of ascertaining its national character , and distinct from the right of search , known to the law of nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effectual , must in the end include search ; that the right differs in no respect from the belligerent rightof search ; and that every case of detention of an American vessel for this purpose , is a wrong , calling for a reparation . These views are set forth by IMr . Webster , then Secretary of State , in a letter to the American Ambassador at London . " No such recognition , " he there says , ( i. e. of the right claimed by England , ) " has presented itself to the United States ; but on the contrary , it understands that public writers , courts of law and solemn treaties , have for centuries used the words visit ' and search'in the same sense . What Great Britain and the UnL ted States mean by the right of se*rch'in its broadest sense , is called by the continental writers and jurists by no other name than the right of visit . ' Nor can the Government of the United States agree that the term right ' is justly applied to such exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain cases . " Again , " there is no right to visit in time of peace , except in the execution of revenue laws , or other municipal regulations , in which cases the right is usually exercised near the coast or within a marine league , or where the vessel is justly suspected of violating the law of nations by piratical aggression , but wherever exercised , it is the right of search . " // To Lord Aberdeen 's declaration that reparation would be made for injury sustained through the exercise of this right of visit , it is replied , that if injury be produced by the exercise of a right , it would seem strange that it should be repaired as if it had been the effect of a wrongful act . The general rule of law certainly is , that in the proper and prudent exercise of his own rights , no one one is answerable for undesigned injury . It may be said that the right is a qualified right , that is , a right to do certain acts of force at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of being made answerable for all damages . But such an argument would prove every trespass to be matter of right , subject only to just responsibility . It is as if a civil officer on land have process against one individual , and through mistake arrest another ; this arrest is wholly tortions . No one would think of saying it was done under any lawful exercise of authority , subject only to responsibility , or that it was anything but a mere trespass , though an unintentional trespass . The municipal law does not undertake to lay down beforehand any rule for the government of such cases ; and as little does the public law of the world lay down beforehand any rule for the government of cases of involuntary trespasses , detentions , and injuries at sea , except that in both cases law and reason make a distinction between injuries committed through mistake , and injuries committed by design , the former being entitled to fair and just compensation , the latter demanding exemplary damages and sometimes personal punishment . " In another passage the inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nationality of a vessel to be effected ? Must it lie to ? Or if it pursue its voyage , may force be used ? Or if it resist force and is captured , must it not be condemned as resisting a right , which can not exist without a corresponding obligation imposed on the other party ? Thus it appears that the right exercised in peace differs nothing as to the means of enforcing it which must be adopted , from the right of search exer*lsed in war , which the English Government disclaims the use of . The Government of the United States admits that its flag can give no immunity to pirates , nor to any other than regularly documented vessels , and it was upon this view of the // whole case that it cheerfully assumed the duties of the treaty of Washington. *** The position assumed in these words of one of our ablest statesmen , is still maintained by the United States . At the close of their late session , the Senate took this ground in a resolution , which , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag , may be called quite moderate : " Resolved , as the judgment of the Senate , that American vessels on the high seas in time of peace , bearing the American flag , remain under the jurisdiction of the country to which they belong , and therefore any visitation , molestation , or detention of such vessels , by force , or by the exhibition-of force , on the part of a foreign power , is in derogation of the sovereignty of the United States . " To this of course the British Government will agree , and has always , since 1812 at least , professed to have nothing to do with slavers from the United States , carrying on their piratical work in all boldness upon the African coast ; knowing or believing them to be American , they admit that they can not detain , and finding them on examination to be American , they admit that they can not search them without a violation of international law . They will fully concede that " American " vessels remain under the jurisdiction of their country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference on this point between the two countries ? Is it that the flag shall always protect the vessel which carries it ? We do not understand our Government to take this almost absurd position , which would prevent in fact the execution of the treaties between England on the one hand , and Spain and Portugal on the other , establishing a mutual right of restricted search , and would make all attempts to put down the slave trade impossible . Is it that on flagrant suspicion , a vessel on the coast of Africa may not be boarded to ascertain whether it be English , Portuguese , or Spanish , and not American ? We do not understand that this is claimed , which would amount in effect to the flag covering the vessel . Is it that if an American vessel is detained by mistake , no reparation is due ? Lord Aberdeen distinctly admits the contrary . Of // what use then , except to set the English right on a point of international law , Mr. Webster 's very able argument is , from which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granted that the act of a cruiser in visiting the wrong vessel , like that of the sheriff in arresting the wrong person , is a tort , must there be no cruisers to break up the slave trade , and no sheriffs to arrest persons by due process ? We must confess that although the law of nations does make no distinction between search and visit , such a distinction appears to us perfectly reasonable , and one which ought to be introduced into that science . The act of ascertaining nationality is separated by a marked line from the act of ascertaining what trade the vessel detained is carrying on . And for aught we see , a state of relations between two countries might exist which would make the distinction necessary . Suppose that by special convention , two States were to give up reciprocally the right of search in war ; and one of them were to be at war with some other country . Is it not evident either that such belligerent mast abandon the right of search altogether , or ascertain for itself by inspection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its agreement to abstain from search existed ? Chancellor Kent , with his impartial and judicial mind , finds no difficulty even in accepting the English distinction between search arid visit as being well grounded in international law . We fear , however , that his position* is untenable . The Supreme Court of the United States , to whose authority he refers , simply speaks of a right of approach between vessels on the high sea , and of ships of war acting under the authority of Government to , arrest pirates and other public offenders , having the right to " approach any vessels descried at sea for the purpose of ascertaining their real character . " t But the Court does not undertake to say that ves*els thus approached may be detained or searched , except on suspicion of piracy , which was the case before it . Still , admitting that the law of nations , what we believe to be true , is as Webster , and * Comment , Vol . I , p. 153 , note a , 5th edition . // not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to a certain limit in getting evidence of a vessel 's nationality , which makes the right to get that evidence perfectly just . Nor is it any more dangerous than the parallel one of examining vessels suspected of piracy , to which even public vessels before now have been obliged to submit . But let it be conceded that there ought to be a right of visit distinct from that of search , what will such a right amount to ? To very little , if the United States employ on the coast of Africa the petty force mentioned in the treaty of Washington , and to almost nothing , if our cruisers are to be withdrawn from there , as the newest partisans of slavery desire . It is evident that if Africa is ever to be redeemed from the horrible curse of internal wars , waged for the purpose of supplying the slave markets of Christendom , something else besides the means hitherto used by the United States , in accordance with the obligations of the treaties of Ghent and of Washington , must effect that result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong majority for free labor shall control the destiny of this country , and that for all time , no law , no naval forqe , no watchfulness of executive officials , will weigh much against , avarice ; nor can such officials be expected to be vigilant in parts of the country where the slave trade finds respectable defenders , and where a white man is hanged for scarcely any crime but that of being an abolitionist . There may be selfish interests which shall keep the foreign slave away from our shores ; the northern slave states may claim the monopoly in this staple , but there is no such moving force that can be brought to bear upon Cuba , as long as its ports are practically open to African slaves , and the traffic yields an immense profit . What then can cure this great pest to two continents ? African colonization along the coasts , and a profitable trade in the products of Africa , may hereafter mitigate it , but this is the slow work of long years , and the existing slave trade must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need measures which can have an immediate result . Two such measures ,  --  supposing the right of search to remain as it // is ,  --  occur to us , although we have small faith that either of them will be applied . The first is , that the slave trade should be constituted piracy by the law of nations , as our House of Representatives , by an almost unanimous vote , in 1824 , desired . This is not likely *o be effected , however , unless it comes in as one of a number of measures , which must be received in their " solidarity , " or not at all . England , at the late treaty of Paris , showed a commendable willingness to recede from its old position of standing out for belligerent rights against neutral . Let now an offer be made in the same spirit , to enlarge and define neutral rights . Let privateering cease and the slave trade become piracy , and as a compensation to nations which can rise to such illustrious acts of virtue , let not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Franklin desired , let the navigator have the same treatment of his property as the farmer or the citizen on the land . Let even the rule of contraband be given up , and only that of blockade retained , for surely in these days of railroads it must be easy enough in a large country to supply contraband articles from remote and unguarded ports . Let as much as this be conceded , and it is not unlikely that the consent of the United States could be obtained to a rule making the slave trade piracy , and probably the consent of all other powers . And when this is once brought about , England can take the slave trade police into her own hand . The other measure is not so revolutionary ; and recommends itself to an empty treasury by its cheapness. * Put a lieutenant of our navy on board of each English cruiser for slaves ; let it be necessary whenever a vessel carrying American colors is to be visited , that the visit be made by him ; let him have the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the vessel shall be seized and sent home for trial ; let , in short , the whole responsibility rest on an American officer or officers , sailing upon British ships ; and if the United States wish to perform their bounden part , let a similar British officer // be put on board each of our vessels : in this case , if ever , the work would be well done ; the gentlemanly feelings of the service in both navies would protect individual officers so situated from everything unpleasant , and all cause of collision would be avQided . Our flag would no longer be our shame . It is true , if France did not come into the arrangement , all the villainy of this traffic would sail under her colors , but France can have no long or great interest to encourage the slave trade , or reason to refuse consent to such a measure , if it should be found in our case to be effectual.                    @
