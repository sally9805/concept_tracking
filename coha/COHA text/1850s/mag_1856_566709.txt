txt ART . IV. - AMERJCAN DEMOCRACY . Thirty Years ' View ; or a History of the Working of the American Government for Thirty Years , from 1820 to 1850 , chiefly taken from the t2ongress Debates , the private papers of General Jackson and the speeches of Ex-Senator Benton , with his actual view of men and affairs ; with historical notes and illustrations and some notices of eminent deceased contemporaries . By a Senator of thirty years . In 2 vols . Vol . IT . Appletons. 1856 . HAD the veteran statesman finished his great work by publishing his second volume of 788 pages in royal octavo , in two years after the appearance of volume I , with only the ordinary hindrances to overcome , it would have been deemed a creditable monument of his untiring industry and intellectual energy , prolonge ( l in spite of the weight of years , which at the age of three score and ten he can not but yield to in a degree . But this volume has been finished amid the sorrows of widowhood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when called to bury from his bosom the // faithful wife of his youth , and more especially when premature infirir*it-y has made that companion the object of pec**Iiar care and tenderness . And more than all this , it is to be mentioned as an evidence of Colonel I3enton 's indornitability of purpose , that when he had all the materials for his work collected togetli er and nearly one half of it written out for the press , he was suddenly summoned from his seat in the house of iRepresentatives at mid-day , to see all these treasures and fruits of labor consumed in a moment in the ashes of his dwelling-house at Washington city . It was never his way to surrender , aud while the rains were yet smoking , the public were informed that he would set to work immediately to replace the lost chapters , with the belief that lie should be able in a great degree to recover all the most essential parts and authorities for the completion of the work according to its originni design . The result is in the volume now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held in honor by the country which has had the benefit of his long life of public service , and by posterity which is to derive so many lessons of political wisdom from these massive volumes . Impartial criticism will pronounce yolume second well worthy to stand by the side of its predecessor , for the weight of political information which it contains ; while we can not but own reluctantly , that it is not characterized by so great a fullness of thought and arb umnent , nor so much breadth of view , nor compactness amid cogency of argument , as the first volume . It is thinner in its texture for the loss of those irrecoverable notes and diaries and original letters , which tIme ruthless flames devoured . It is less vigorous and connn'manding in its tread , doubtless , for the added years and the weight of grief under which it was composed . rihe publishers will probably realize this in time difficulty of selling fifty thousand copies in two years from the date of publication . The intelligent reader will not find lmimself carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time mighty river on whose banks its author so long had his Imome . And yet it is a very valuable contribution to our political literature , which sheds much valuable light upon time eventfbl tinnes to which it belongs ; and it is replete with those sounid democratic principles , by the observance of which our republican imistitutious may be rendered as enduring as time , or fronu which the future historian may learn the poiimts of departure of the great political apostasy , which ( if heaven do not prevent ) will lay our beloved country among time wrecks of all previous republics . We wish that more of the great political leaders of the last forty years had left us memoirs equally elaborate of their own labors , // and of ' the views and constructions they had formed of the passing events of their times . In our review of the first volume of this work , ( see New Englander for February , 1856 , pp. 52-74 , ) we sketched the great prin ci 11 ) 105 which constitute the distin ye characteristics of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those principles , and elucidating their practical application , so as to show the stability of a government . thus constituted , and the security of all just interests nuder such a control . We showed that the government of the United States is in fact democratic , or a government by the will of the people , and that such a government is the safest and best that can l ) e created by man . Also , that it protects and facilitates the best development of the individual and of ' society , and is therefore a true blessing to the country that possesses it , and to be cherished with the utmost warmth of the most intelligent patriotism . It is not to be honored arid obeyed merely because it is the actnal government of our country , but is to be loved and gloried in , as the nearest approximation to a perfect system the world has ever seen . And hence , whatever defects may be seen in its framework , and whatever failures may occur in the working of its administration , the fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are to be taken as instances of the iinperfection of all things human , and the remedy is to be sought by assiduous and patient labor under the forms of the Constitution , and not by harsh and unpatriotic denunciations of the Constitution itself We shall rejoice to see the day when all Amencans , at home arid abroad , shall be found so thoroughly impressed with the excellencies of their own system of government , as to cherish it in their hearts and exhibit it before all the world as a most valued gift of ' Divine Providence , for which we never can he sufficiently grateful . Sure we are that no other people under heaven have so good reason for cultivating the spirit of loyalty to their own government ; and it moves our indignation , as well as our grief , whenever we find an American so ungrateful and base as by speech or writing to disparage our republican system to foreigners , on account of the democratic features which lie at its foundation . Ilavipg thus considered the general principles of American democracy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us , which is to be regarded as the most practical and authentic exposition of American democracy to be found in print , we are prepared for a cursory examination of the manner in which democratic principles have been applied and carried out in the actual administration of our national // government . Having heretofore commended the work , and frankly honored the author as " the most far-seeing , the most laborious , the most uncompromising , and the most uniformly consistent snpporter of democratic principles , " we shall not be suspected of a lack of respect for the veteran statesman , if we make our examination thoroughly rigorous and impartial , and endeavor to gather honor for democracy , and wisdom for its Xuture application , as well from his errors and failures , as from his firm maintenance of the right in its genera applications . This second volume will be further instructive by the light it sheds upon the gradual dilapidation and decay , the " decline and fall " of the great political party whose administration formed the theme of exultant rehearsal in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most philosophical impartiality , to elucidate , if possible , the cause or causes of that remarkable overthrow , and to show , for the instruction of posterity , how easy it is for a political party to admit unconsciously and unintentionally into its policy , principles and compliances so inconsistent with the fundamental idea of its organization , that they can not but demoralize its ranks , weaken the mutual confidence and cohesion of its parts , disintegrate its organization , and finally make it a mere machine by which usurping leaders first pervert its power to their own selfish purposes , and then leave the rifled carcass to unhonored decay . In making this analysis , we shall not feel bound to take Colonel Benton 's philosophy for our guide . He is much better for a leader to win battles when he is right , than either to retrieve or explain disasters arising from blunders which were partly his own . We shall rather consult the still older fathers of the republic , and then endeavor from an analysis of the facts to show that the Democratic party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself to thank for its ignoble overthrow . The great idea of the second President Adams , which governed his administration so far as he was niaster of it , was to make the federal government a grand instrument of beneficence at home , as well as a powerful protector towards foreign nations . No one who knew Mr. Adams as a man could doubt the disinterestedness of his patriotism . He served his country all his days , with clean hands and a faithful and loving heart . lit was his fortune to come into power in the year 18*5 , just after a great foreign war and a thirty years ' political struggle had terminated in settling at once our legitimate position among the nations , and the capacity of our govermnent to maintain all its foreign relations without encroaching upon the sovereignty of the States , or violating the great safeguards of // personal freedom . The successful completion of the Erie Canal by the State of New York , the preceding year , had inflamed a passion for internal improvements , especially in the way of turnpikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As few of the other States had the resources or the courage to command them for the construction of great works , people began to look to the federal government as the Hercules that should lift them along . Mr. Adams had been familiar with the sight of such works constructed by the governments of Europe , with their beneficent effects upon the prosperity of nations , and with the renown gained by their constructors , whose names were perpetuated in history as great benefactors . He thought , too , that the monoply of the right to levy taxes upon imports , which the Constitution had vested in the federal government , had given it such resources , and so curtailed the resources of the States , as to make it imperative on the former to aid or undertake all the great enterprises of the kind which the advancement of the country required . A conversation he had , just as he returned home from Europe in 1817 , with the great patron of the New York Canals , had impressed this indelibly upon his mind ; and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , his laudable ambition of distinguishing his administration by great deeds of public beneficence , naturally directed his attention to a system of internal improvements , as a leading object of his care . It was his misfortune , however , to be plunged at once into a troubled sea of political strife , and to encounte* ' a fierce fight of partisan Ol ) pOsitiOn , which lie was totally unprepared for , and which left him no longer the master even of his own acts . The struggle gradually and necessarily assumed a party form , and brought the powers of the federal government over internal affairs , and its constitutional relations to the financial concerns of the people , into the forefront of the controversy , and led eventually to a final settlement of constitutional boundaries on these subjects , in a manner which had hardly been thought of by the wisest of our political philosophers , when the discussion first began . Not only were Mr. Adams 's views overruled , and his hopes of a brilliant administration crushed , but he himself was borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most mortifying political defeat . The whole policy of internal improvements by the general government , was rejected by the body of the people , as too vast and complicated to be wisely or safely carried on by a central administration . And although this policy has been a convenient stalking-horse for a certain class of politicians , it is remarkable that none of // them have ever obtained political advancement by making it their leading issue . And the coolness with which President Pierce has vetoed bills of this sort , one after another , as fast as his opponents would crowd them upon him , is a proof of the confidence with which the administration rely upon the votes of the masses to stand by them in rejecting everything which looks like the introduction of a system of improvements under direction of federal authorities . The true rule is thisthat Congress may make improvemnents in cases of plain necessity , arid where great public or national interests are seen to be immediately and directly involved ; but this is never to be extended beyond the requirements of public necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a certain thing which has favored a particular interest or locality , is not to be drawn into a precedent , or to warrant a claim or expectation that the same favor shall be extended to other similar interests or localities , unless they can show also the same warrant of plain public necessity . The question was decided , not so mucliby the unconstitutionality of the system , as by its unsuitableness - not by what was in the paper constitution , as by an appeal to what was in the minds of the people , to wit , that the preservation of oum. nationality depends upon keeping the federal government within as narrow limits as the absolute necessities of the country will allow . Had the will of the people definitely resolved upon such a system , there would have been no difficulty in finding sufficient grants of power to the frderal government to carry it into effect . The right to " establish post-offices and post-roads , " would as well carry the right to make and improve the roads as to erect buildings for the offices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on war , with the rio'ht of absorbing all the capital of the country in taxes , and of appropriating all the real amid personal property to public uses , would easily carry the ribht to make canals and roads of intercommunication , as well as ships and carriages to traverse them . The control of commerce among the States might be supposed to give as much power to facilitate as to regulate it Amid so on . It was the vastness of the application which the existence of such powers would involve , the immensity of revenue and patronage , the overshadowing and virtual extinction of the State goverumneuts which would be sure to follow , and perhaps more than all , the jealousy of the different sections , and the impossibility of making a satisfactory distribution of benefits , that led to the rejection of the system ; and not any logical deduction of a prohibitory principle from the language of the constitution itself . And in this aspect , we see it still more // clearly proved , that the principle of democracy , or governmerit by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution , and establishes the true construction of its phraseology . The policy of favoring domestic manufactures was coeval with the existence of the government . The trials and privations ot the revolution impressed it strongly upon the minds of the people , that to be truly independent they must be able to produce at home all time most essential articles of suI ) sistence and defense . On the division of the country into parties , the patronage of domestic mnanutactures was assumed as a distinctive feature in the policy of the Jeffersonian republicans , and was always regarded with jealousy by the federalists of that day . The war of 1812 cmeated a fresh entbnsiasm in favor of manufactures . The necessities of the country , the difficulties of foreign commerce , and the influence of double duties imposed to raise the revenue necessary for the war , had given such an impulse to manufactures , that they had grown np in a few years to be a great interest , standing third with agriculture and commerce . The necessity and advantage of home supplies commanded general assent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object and not as an incident , and was adopted by the influence of nearly all the leading statesmen of the South and West , including Mr. Cal homi himself ; afterwards the special enemy of protection . The tariff of 1824 carried tins policy still further , undertaking not only to hasten the extinction of the public debt , and to create a home supply of articles necessary in timne of war , but to relieve the pecuniary distress of the country at the time by cansing such a home employment of capital and demand for labor and agricultural products , as would make money plenty and restore general prosperity . The chief opposition , at this time , came from New England , under the lead of Mr. Webster , whose speeches on that occasion xxiii long remain as the best memorials of his statesmanship . The Southern States then followed the lead of Massachusetts , and were overruled with her . From this time the question of protectiQa gradually assumed a party aspect , until , in the tariff of 1828 , it took the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader . Nexv England in the meantime had changed its voice in favor of manufactures , and thus brought Mr. Webster into the position of a second to Mr. Clay-  --  a place fromn which he never was able to extricate himself , and which was the primary cause that frustrated his ambitious hopes . General Jackson voted for the tariff of 1824 , expressly on the // ground of providing for the payment of the public debt , and to increase the resources of the country in case of war . Many of his supporters voted for the more stringent tariff of 1828 ; and so many local interests were combined in favor of this , that the Jackson party , on their accession to power could not make its repeal a mere party question . In consequence of this division , with the political complications arising out of Mr. Calhoun 's devious course , and the nullification movement of South Carolina , the adjustment fell into the hands of Clay and Calhoun , the most ultra of the leaders , who bargained away the principles of both for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated in this compromise than we now care to enumerate . For our present purpose it is sufficient to mention the irregular ratio of reduction of duties-which were to diminish slowly for the first eight years , and rapidly in the remaining two years**the effect of which was to throw upon the manufacturing interest almost the whole weight of the injury to be inflided by the reduction , almost at the critical moment of the final diminution . Mr. Calhoun asserted that this particular feature was contrived and insisted on by Mr. Clay , and assented to by himself with reluctance . If its object was honest , the result was not creditable to the sagacity of its author ; if it was political , intended to produce a state of distress that should compel a restoration of the protective policy , it was an unjustifiable method of sacrificing public interests and the prosperity of whole classes of individuals for the benefit of political aspirants and theorists . But it is difficult to make the actual conduct of parties square exactly with their professed principles . The ups and downs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be accounted for by individual peculiarities , some by personal interests , some by a permanent regard for the wishes of constituencies , and a few by considerations of pure patriotism . The compromise prolonged the artificial protection to the manufacturers nine years . At the extra session called by General Harrison before his death , and held under the administration of President Tyler , the fact was brought forward that * Of the excess of customs duty above 25 per cent . ad valorern , one-tenth of the rate was to be taken off at the beginning of the several years , 1834 , 1536* 15*5 , and 1840 , taking eight years to effect a reduction of four tenths of the duty ; and then threetenths the first of January , 1842 , and the remaining threetenths on the first of July of the same year . In fact , six-tenths of the entire reduction of the duties were to come off in the first half of the year 1842 , and a uniform rate of tweuty per cent . was then to go into effect . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but little more than half the amount required for the expenses of the government . By the time of the regular session , 1841-2 , the treasury was bankrupt , unable to borrow , treasury notes below par , and with a million and a half of demands under protest for non-payment . The Whig Congress , with Mr. Fillmore for chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means , tried every art to frame a bill that would preserve the distribution of the revenue to the states , and at least nominally sanction the compromise act of 1833 ; but the stern vetoes of Mr. Tyler baffled them . Two successive bills were returned to Congress with the President 's objections ; the session was drawing to a close ; revenue must be had , or the wheels of government would stop ; it was now near the end of August , and Congress had been nine months in session ; adjournment could not be deferred ; at length Mr. Fillmore brought in his bill , sacrificing both the land distribution and the compromise , which was pushed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which the country made haste to abolish as soon as possible by substituting the tariff of 1846 , and which is now become so completely " an obsolete idea " in politics , that even its author , now a candidate for the Presidency , neither incorporates its restoration among the planks of his platform , nor even alludes to it in the enumeration of his public services . Mr. Polk , in his first annual message , December , 1845 , recommended a revision of the tariff ; with a view to revenue as the object , with protection to home industry as the incident . The result was the tariff of 1846 , still in force , and yielding a revenue of above seventy millions yearly . It was so ingeniously contrived to hit the wish6s of both parties , that it taxes the country exorbitantly in the revenue it yields , far beyond the proper wants of the government , while its protection to certain branches of home production is yet more oppressive to the mass of the people . This last remark is specially applicable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the price of which is enhanced nearly one-half for the benefit of about six hundred sugar planters , who yet are unable to raise a tenthpart of the quantity required for consumption . The price of all is kept up in consequence , with only partial benefit to any , amid no prospect that the home production will ever supply the demand . The present administration was elected under a distinct pledge of a thorough overhauling of this tariff which has many other objectionable features ; but the temptation of handling seventy or eighty millions a year is too great for the virtue of our Democratic leaders , and so the tariff is un // touched , and its much-needed amendment is reserved for the reform administration of 1857 . The whole history affords an illustration of the proverb - With how small wisdom this world is governed . It shows the foolishness of making the complicated arrangements of finance the topics of party strife . It shows , also , that progress has been made towards juster ideas on the subject , and we trust the time is drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be taken up , unconnected with party strife , and regulated in such a way as to yield barely the needed revenue , with the smallest possible pressure upon the people . The history of the tariff down to the present time , does not reflect the greatest credit upon the intelligence or the fidelity of the Democratic party leaders . They have never once carried out their own theory to anything like a consistent conclusion . Even the most elaborate tariff of 46 is marked with most extraordinary violations of the democratic rule of action , which contemplates " the greatest good of the greatest number. *** The tax imposed upon the four great articles of universal consumption and necessity , sugar , salt , coal , and iron can be defended by no plea but that of a stern and absolute necesssity , which always compels governments to tax wherever they can get revenue by taxing . The sugar tax benefits five or six hundred rich planters of Louisiana , by a tax upon consumption , almost as equal upon rich and poor as a capitation tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of its removal or mitigation . The salt tax is equally oppressive to the mass of the people , chiefly for the benefit of the rich owners of salt springs , and in addition has a highly injurious operation upon many of the greatest and most productive interests of the country . Its effects upon the agricultural interest reach to the curtailment of the proper supply of salt for all kinds of stock , to the injury of all provisions which require sunmade salt for their best preservation , and to the entire suppression of its use as a manure . Yet , none of our statesmen , except Colonel Benton , has ever moved for the abolition of the duty on salt . The coal tax enables the rich owners of the coal mountains of Pennsylvania to draw incomes of almost fabulous amount from lands which they have purchased for a song , and upon which they have expended neither labor nor capital . And for this , every family , rich and poor , in our large towns , is assessed in proportion not to their ability but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all taxes on consumption . The same is true of the tax upon iron , the greatest benefit of which accrues to the Owners of mines , who levy a seignorage of twenty-five cents per ton ou the ore lying in the bowels of the earth , they not lifting a finger to bring it within the reach of use . The country sees its great and essential railroad interests burthened , and often crippled , by the tax upon iron . Multitudes understand its injurious effects here , who are yet slow to see that the same injury must take place , though its operation is more concealed , upon every interest that depends upon the manufacture or the use of iron . The aggregate of duties collected by the government on all of these articles of universal necessity and consumption , is at least ten millions of dollars , all of which goes into a treasury already so full as to be itself the most dangerous source of corruption in our government , while the additional expense to the people in consequence of the tax , through the complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times the amount paid to the government . There is no so siniplc method now , of reducing the revenue towards the proper wants of the government as by making these four articles free . If any statesman of ability in Congress would make the move , and persist in urging it from year to year , regardless of party combinations and of all other resistance , he would in a few years enlist the whole country , and compel Congress to follow his lead . The public attention has been called of late to the importance of promoting the manufacturing interest by removing all duties from the raw materials . This is universally considered now among political writers to be sound and statesman-like policy ; and it would be adopted , nem . con. , in a month , but for one objection . The difficulty is , that if you once begin to remove the duty from the raw material , no man can tell where to stop . The first article proposed to be released is wool , because the woolen manufacture is just now depressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , to be consistent , take it off from every other ingredient used in making every kind of cloth and fabric of wool . And then a large part of the cost of the cloth is in the cost of making ; and so you must take off the duty from all machinery and all the materials used in making machinery . Another large part of the cost is the labor employed ; and so you must reduce the cost of labor by removing all hindrances to its importation , and every tax that increases the expense of subsistence , because the price of labor can never fall below the cost of the subsistence of the laborer . And , in like manner , every tax that enhances the cost of // tom-house business ; so that a new profession has grown up , of custom-house brokers , whose support and enrichment is in reality a tax upon commerce , far more grievous than the Danish tolls at the mouth of the Baltic sea . And we exhaust skill and lavish expense to save a few hours of time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one to five days at the wharf or the public store , by the complex process of getting the goods through the custom-house . Our whole fleet of clipper ships might be covered with barnacles without causing so great a loss of time in the actual delivery of goods , as is caused by the tedious details and absurd and ineffectual forms which ancient superstition and modern red-tapery impose upon commerce in the custom-house . A real man of sense , acquainted with business , and having the courage to sweep all that system of machinery into the fire , could easily prescribe methods of proceeding which would afford more security against fraudulent entries on the one hand , and against official corruption and peculation on the other , at less than a quarter part of the expense of time and trouble to the merchant , and of fees and salaries to careless officers for the government . The adoption of a truly democratic tariff is therefore reserved to be one of the fruits of an administration such as we hope to inaugurate on the 4th of March next , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sectional and class interest  --  a dictation as antagonistic to all the other financial interests of the country , as it is to all the higher interests of republican government . The discussions of our own country , the writings.of our scholars who were not political partisans , the experiments of other countries , who have found their prosperity advanced in proportion as they have allowed freedom of trade to keep pace with the advances of intelligence and civilization among the people , have diffused true ideas concerning the tariff much more generally than the old politicians are aware . The first lull in the intensity of the slavery storm will call for tariff revision with a voice that can not be disregarded . But it is the bank controversy that concentrates the principal interest of the political contests which Colonel Benton has elucidated . It was here that the struggle was most severe , and longest continued , the points in issue most direct and simple . and least mixed up with other questions ; and it is here that the result has been most complete and final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great political controversy . The history of the bank war , if truly developed by an impartial and truly philosophical mind , would be one of the most instructive studies that republican governtom-house // business ; so that a new profession has grown np , of custom-house brokers , whose support and enrichment is in reality a tax upon commerce , far more grievous than the Danish tolls at the month of the Baltic sea . And we exhaust skill and lavish expense to save a few hours of time in the transportation of goods , only to have them detained from one to five days at the wharf or the public store , by the complex process of getting the goods through the custom-house . Our whole fleet of clipper ships might be covered with barnacles without causing so great a loss of time in the actual delivery of goods , as is caused by the tedions details and absurd and ineffectual forms which ancient superstition and modern red-tapery impose upon commerce in the custom-house .

The adoption of a truly democratic tariff is therefore reserved to be one of the fruits of an administration such as we hope to inaugurate on the 4th of March next , which shall be democratic without being subservient to the dictation of a sectional and class interest  --  a dictation as antagonistic to all the other financial interests of the country , as it is to all the higher interests of republican government .

The first lull in the intensity of the slavery storm will call for tariff revision with a voice that can not be disregarded . But it is the bank controversy that concentrates the principal interest of the political contests which Colonel Benton has elucidated . It was here that the struggle was most severe , and longest continued , the points in issue most direct and simple , and least mixed up with other questions ; and it is here that the result has been most complete and final , commanding universal acceptance as an absolute settlement of a great political controversy . The history of the bank war , if truly developed by an impartial and truly philosophical mind , would be one of the most instructive studies that republican government // has ever furnished . Extending over ten years ; involving the financial interests of the whole country , which were constantly periled , and repeatedly and wantonly sacrificed , for the advancement of party ends ; involving also the political fortunes of all the leading minds in the country , who continually risked everything upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the greatest-lost every thing in the support of their favorite theories ; it kept the finances of the country in a state of most injurious instability , repeatedly causing widespread ruin among the commercial and inanufacturing classes , wasting the available capital of the country , alternately maddeniuig and paralyzing enterprise by artificial infiations and inevitable collapses , in a struggle of unparalleled obstinacy between the theories of political dreamers and the plain sense and indomitable will of the people . No intelligent and unprejudiced man can look back over the events , of that struggle , without being filled with amazement at every aspect of the history ; - arnazement at the fatuity of great and learned and experienced statesmen , in committing themselves to so many untenable , and even absurd positions , as well as in setting themselves to resist by political management the settled will of the people ; - arnazement that the productive industry of the country was able to sustain itself so long , before the crash of 1837 ; - amazement that a country whose whole industrial economy was so completely collapsed , could so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the incubus that had crushed it , rush forward in a career of such marvelous prosperity as has distinguished the last ten years of our history ; - amazement that the leaders in this infatuation were so largely sustained by the suifrages of the people , and have their names emblazoned in the roll of statesmen whose memory their country will ever cherish among her choicest treasnres . Such a history is still a desideratum in our political literature . We mean , such a history as shall command attention and secure confidence , by its clearness , consistency , impartiality , attractiveness of style , and soundness of argument . There are several valuable repositories of materials , but they have never been subjected to that process of analysis and classification which should exhibit the causes and workings of events , and bring out from the story its profound lessons of political wisdom , in their application to the proper theory of republican government . The plan of Colonel Benton 's book , chopping every subject into *s many chapters as it has occupied years in history , has precluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the evident haste and carelessness // with which he has huddled up his materials for the second volume , has greatly lessened the value of the delineation in which he has rejuvenated the closing part of the history of the Bank War . There are parts of the picture , indeed , which are finished with the hand of a master . There are chapters which command at once assent and admiration for their sagacious analysis and comprehensive classification . The relations of causes and effects are made apparent , and the political lessons they afford are easily learned . But we lack a proper summing up of the case , which should give us a view of the whole ground , as well as of its several parts . We thank him for what he has done so well . We join our regrets for the catastrophe of fire which consumed at once his materials , and the means he had accumulated for making the best use of those materials . We freely assent to all apologies which circumstances offer in favor of the veteran author . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have it at all , or even to have run any considerable risk of failing to receive it . But yet we can not help wishing that Colonel Benton could give us , even yet , a general and connected history of the Bank War of 1833-43 , as a distinct lesson in politics , well worthy of being preserved and handed down to posterity . It would be absurd , were we to attempt any such survey , within the compass of an article which must embrace also many other topics of interest ; but yet we wish to indicate a few of those more striking points in the history , which are specially worthy to be remembered , and which may be found more or less applicable as practical lessons for the p resent or the approaching exigencies of our government . We assume the final result as not only the settled policy of the country , but the universal will of the people . All parties are now satisfied that the policy which was overruled was unwise , and would have been pernicious , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , but has justified its wisdom and soundness by its results . And yet , we believe that , at the beginning of the struggle , there were but few , even of the advocates of that policy , who comprehended the point to which they were drifting , or anticipated the desperateness of the struggle upon which they were entering , or saw from afar the positions upon which the country would settle down in the end . General Jackson 's first annual message to Congress , delivered on the 8th of December , 1829 , called attention to the fact that the charter of the Bank of the United States would expire in // ciency " are well questioned by a large portion of our fellowcitizens , " and that " it has failed in the great end of establishing a unifbrm and sound currency . " The only notice taken by Congress of this intimation was the production of elaborate reports in favor of the Bank , by the regular committees of both Houses . These were widely circulated , and extensively discussed among the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , ( excepting Colonel Benton 's masterly and violent assault upon the Bank as an institution , in the month of February , 1831 , and his equally vehement exposure of its currency , ) until the beginning of 1832 , when the Bank made a formal application to Congress for the renewal of its charter . This application was made in such a way as to show a purpose of making the renewal the leading issue in the presidential election then shortly to come off . The case in favor of the Bank was managed in the Senate by Mr. Dallas , and in the House by Mr. McDuffle , both men of commanding ability , and both well known in their subsequent history as zealous adherents and leaders of the Democratic party The first votes that were taken showed that the Bank had then a clear majority in both houses . This policy was carried out , with inexorable obstinacy , sustained by profound ability , but with no practical effect , so far as the present action of Congress was concerned ; for the bill for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote of 28 to 20 , after a debate which , with intermissions , continued from January to June , and in the House by a vote of 106 to 84 , after little or no contest at all . It was met , as was expected , by General Jackson 's famous veto ; and thus the question of the new charter was fairly launched upon the stormy sea of politics , as the leading issue in the presidential campaign of 1832 . The veto was followed in the Senate by speeches of the utmost ability from all the leading advocates of the Bank-Webster , Clay , J. M. Clayton , and Ewing of Ohio  --  and these speeches were spread by thousands all over the country , with a prodigality till then unexampled in our political management , the Bank contributing largely to the expense , and thus in effect *making itself a partisan machine in a popular struggle . These speeches were answered by Benton , Hugh L. White , and others , whose then admirers can now contemplate the result with some satisfaction . Mr. White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he exalted the merits of the veto message above all the acts of General Jackson 's life , and claimed for it a more enduring fame and deeper gratitude than for the greatest of his victories . He concluded his speech thus : // " When the excitement of the time in which we act shall have passed away , and the historian and biographer shall be employed in giving his account of the acts of our distinguished men , and comes to the name of Andrew Jackson ; when he shall have recorded all the great and good deeds done by this man in the course of a long and eventful life , and the cireumstances under which this message was communicated shall have been stated , the conclusion will be , that , in doing this , he has shown a willingness to risk more to promote the happiness of his fellowmen , than by the doing of any other act whatever . " The result of the election was a grave commentary upon the sagacity of political calculators . The newspapers of the country had been mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pamphlets to show the evil of his policy ; the ablest orators traversed the country haranguing the multitudes against the veto , and in favor of the benign influences of the Bank , and its indispensable necessity as the mainspring of commercial activity and general industry ; while the Bank itself resolutely pursued a policy of rigorous contraction , as if to impress the conviction of its power to do good by demonstrating its power to do harm , producing manifestations of alarm and distress , real or fictitious , in all parts of the nation . Mr. Clay , the great champion of the Bank , was the candidate in opposition to General Jackson , and was fortified in his canvass by the greatest personal popularity ever enjoyed by an American statesman , and further strengthened by the whole manufacturing interest , on account of his zeal in favor of a high protective tariff . And yet the people dashed all the sanguine hopes which these advantages had created , and actually re-elected General Jackson by a greater vote , a greater popular majority , and a greater electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of 288 electoral votes , Mr Clay received but 49 , only 17 per cent . of the whole . Such a result , after so complete a canvass , ought to have been taken as conclusive and final . It was as unwise as anti-republican to continue a political controversy which the people had so decisively settled , and in circumstances which made their decision so manifestly their deliberate and definitive determination . How much the country would have saved and gained , had such counsels prevailed , and had all parties set themselves , with good faith and concert of purpose , to shape plans in the . wisest way for the new state of things which the discontinuance of the National Bank would produce ! There was then ample time for this ; the charter had yet four years to run , and the Bank had two years allowed after that to close up its concerns . But other counsels prevailed In his annual message , Dec. 1 , 1832 , General Jackson plainly declared his distrust of the solvency of the Bank , and his doubts // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he urged Congress to make a thorough inquiry into the condition of the Bank . The insinuation of insolvency was received with general incredulity , and was regarded by multitudes even of the President 's friends , rather as a piece of sharp political practice against an adversary , than as a mark of faithful concern of the public interests entrusted to his care . The result has shown the sagacity with which an experienced man forms reliable opinions from slight indications-  --  a sagacity illustrated every day by shrewd brokers in our cities , who judge of the solvency of a house by signs that are wholly unobserved by the public . Congress took no decisive measures , and after the close of the session the President took such measures as were in his power to ascertain the character of the Bank administration , and , at length , in the month of September , 1833 , he suddenly issued an order on all the collectors of the revenue henceforth to cease their deposits in the Bank of the United States , and to deposit all moneys of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . This measure , Colonel Benton assures us , " was the President 's own measure , conceived by him , carried out by him , defended by him , and its fate dependent upon him . " We will now let Colonel Benton tell a little of his own story , certain that he will take no undue pains to keep his own agency out of sight . " The fact of this removal was communicated to Congress in the annual message of the President . The reasons for it , and the mode of doing it , were reserved for a separate communication ; and especially a report from the Secretary of the Treasury , to whom belonged the absolute right of the removal , without assignment of any reasons , except to Congress , after the act was done . The order for the removal , as it was called -- for it was only an order to the collectors of revenue , to cease making their deposits in that bank , leaving the amount actually in it to be drawn out at intervals , and in different sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 22d of September , and signed by Roger B. Taney , Esq. , the new Secretary of the Treasury , appointed in place of Mr. William J. Duane , who refusing to make the removal , upon the request of the President , was himself removed . " This measure , the ceasing to deposit the public moneys with the Bank of the United States , was the President 's own measure , conceived by him , carried out by him , defended by him , and its fate dependant upon him , He had coadjutors in every part of the business , but the measure was his own . For this heroic civil measure , like a heroic military resolve , had to be the offspring of one great mind-self-acting and poised -- seeing its way through all difficulties and dangers , discerning ultimate triumph over all obstacles , in the determina. tion to conquer them or to perish . Councils are good for safety , not for heroism-good for escapes from perils , and for retreats ; but for action , and especially high and daring action , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one act of that kind-high in daring , and requiring as much nerve as any enterprise of arms , in which the President had ever been engaged . His military exploits had been of his own conception ; his great civi.l acts were to be the same ; more impeded than promoted by councils . And thus it was in // this case . The majority of his Cabinet were against him , his Secretary of the Treasury refused to execute his will , a few only , a fraction of the Cabinet and some friends , concurred heartily in the act ,  --  Mr. Taney , Attorney-General , Mr. Kendall , Mr. Francis P. Blair , editor of the Globe , and some few others . He took his measures carefully and deliberately , and with close regard to keeping himself demonstrably as well as actually right . Observation had only confirmed his opinion , communicated to the previous Congress , of the misconduct of the institution , and the insecurity of the public moneys in it ; and the almost unanimous vote of the House of Representatives to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denied a legislative examination into its affairs , he determined upon an executive one , through inquiries put to the government directors , and the researches into the state of the books , which the Secretary of the Treasury had a right to make . Four of these directors , namely , Messrs . Henry P. Gilpin , John T. Sullivan , Peter Wager and Hugh N. Elderry , made two reports to the President , according to the duties assigned them , in which they showed great misconduct in its management , and a great perversion of its funds to undue and political purposes . ' Vol . I , pp. 373 , 374 . This bold stroke of policy by the old hero , brought the struggle to a Crisis at once . It was a daring movement , a la Napoleon , but it was effected by the use of powers strictly constitutional , the supreme prerogatives which the Constitution has lodged in the hands of the President , the care of the execution of the laws , and the power of removal and appointment of all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the government itself would become , like that of the city of New York , an unwieldy and disjointed congeries of coordinate departments , each chiefly effective in ernbarrassing the others . It was also fully justified at last by the result , for it was manifestly in accordance with the will of the people , who had pronounced against the Bank in the election , and did not wish to be baffled of their purpose by any political chicanery ; and , besides , the final fate of the Bank has clearly proved that the suspicions of its insecurity a a place of deposit were well founded . In short , the removal of the deposits was an act of as true heroism as ever was seen in war . A great public necessity was clearly seen , and it was well met ; and the development which it made of the power of the government should forever remove the fears which the old Federalists used to cherish , that our form of government would soon break down by its own weakness . History has shown that the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle that ensued is as full of incidents and expedients , of bold strokes and masterly defenses , of deep plans and sharp conflicts , as any of the most wonderful of the world 's great battles . All the arts and resources of the government on one side , and of a vast combination of wealth and talents on the other , were put in full requisition . There was no maneuver of political strategy left untried , in a struggle on which // vast interests were depending , and where neither party entertained the thought of surrender . And it was continued , the opponents of the Bank exulting in victory after victory , until the Bank was utterly exploded and annihilated , and its supporters sought refuge in consigning their darling project to oblivion as " an obselete idea . " The great struggle in which democracy overthrew and demolished the National Bank , possesses much more than a historic interest . As a development of the powers of the government , and of the resources by which the majority of the people can make itself dominant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , talents , position and prestige , or other political advantage in the minority , its lessons are of untold value . Its success is a guaranty of the practicability of all reforms ; for it proved that what the people will , must be ; so that you have only to enlighten and reform the people , and the reform of the government must follow . We might pursue this thought through a variety of details to almost any assignable extent . But we have even now reserved less space than we desired to occupy with a few thoughts illustrative of the bearings of this history on another and greater struggle , in which democracy is called to a life-and-death conflict against slavery . The only great political question now pressing upon the American people for their decision , respects the constitutional relations of slavery . The moral character of the system , its bearings upon religion and morals , upon education and civilization , upon the financial interests of the States where it exists or of the whole country , and the just and wise method of dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions concerning its political relations , but they are distinct from these , and may be determined either for or against the system , without necessarily determining the exact place which slavery occupies as an existing practice under the Federal Constitution . It is this latter question which is up now , and which the people of the United States alone can settle . It is of minor importance to know how any party leader , or any class or combination of politicians may propose to settle the question ; their settlements are like a dam of twigs and turf across the mountain torrent , which only increases the fury of the stream by its temporary obstruction . The people must settle it ; and in order to this , they must have it before them , and have it so fully presented and discussed that they can understand it , and be left so far free from blind prejudice and heated passion that tbey can decide upon it deliberately , according to the difficulty and importance of the question . Then they will decide it in accordance // with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Stat*s , and with the great safeguards of individual rights and personal freedom . No other decision than this can be final , no patch-work settlement ignoring these great principles can be permanent . When it is settled right , it will be settled finally and forever , and that settlement alone will effect a real pacification . lines deleted // American Democracy . Aug. , opposer of agitation on the subject of slavery . Let us look at the consistency of this policy , and its productiveness , lie shows abundantly that the people of the North and their representatives in Congress , always paid a just and kind regard to the rights and the interests of the South . This is seen in their support of measutes for the removal of the Indians from the southern States , in the diplomacy of the government for the benefit of the South , in the debate on Foot 's resolutions in 1830 , and on every occasion where there was an opportunity for magnanimity and justice to display themselves . On the plan for the removal of the Indians from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says " It was a plan of inestimable importance to the southern and western States , but impossible without the hearty concurrence of the northern and nonslaveholding States . It might awaken the slavery question , hardly got to sleep after the alarming agitations of the Missouri controversy . The States and territories to be relieved were slave-holding . To remove the Indians would be to make room for the spread of slaves . No removal could be effected without the double process of a treaty and an appropriation act  --  the treaty to be ratified by two.thirds of the Senate , where the slave and free States were equal , and the appropriation to be obtained from Congress , where free States held a majority of members . It was evident that the execution of the whole plan was in the hands of the free States . And nobly did they do their duty by the South . * * * And I , who was an actor in that transaction , who reported the bills and advocated the treaties which brought this great benefit to the South and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the free States , without whose concurrence they could not have been passsd -- -I , who wish for harmony and concord among all the States and sections of this Union , owe it to the cause of truth and justice , and to the cultivation of fraternal feelings , to bear this faithful testimony to the just and faithful conduct of the non-slaveholding States in relieving the southern and western States from so large an incumbrance , and aiding the extension of their settlement and cultivation . " VoL I , pp. 28 , 29 . And after the conclusion of the Creek treaty of removal , in 1826 , for the sole benefit of Georgia , he says " It was an incalculable advantage to her , and sought in vain under southern Presidents -- Jefferson , Madison and Monroe- ( who could only obtain part concessions from the Indians )  --  and now accomplished under a northern President , with the full concurrence and support of the northern delegations in Congress ; for the northern representatives in the House voted the appropriations to carry the treaty into effect , as readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Candid men , friends to the harmony and stability of this Union , should remember these things when they hear the northern States , on account of the conduct of some societies and individuals , charged with unjust and criminal designs towards the South . " p. 59 . This testimony to the justice and generosity always exhibited by the North to the South , is in strict accordance with historic truth , and it comes with no small force from the author of the eternal-slavery clause in the Missouri constitution , inserted as a gratuitous flout , at the very moment when the public mind of the // North was yet sore under its sad defeat in 1820 . And it suggests the inquiry whether the North has ever in a single in4ance received a corresponding treatment-.the South sacrificing its honor and violating its most cherished principles in voluntary concession to a naked and insolent demand of the North . And we can not but admire the frankness of our author , who seems to conceal nothing , when he tells us of another demand which he himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what he rather daintily calls the " ExtensioiT of the Missouri Boundary . " Vol. iii , Chap . 137 . It was the ingenious scheme by which he succeeded in conveying to the State of Missouri the triangular tract of territory lying between what was originally its eastern boundary and the Missouri river-sometimes called the Platte Purchase-now divided into the counties of Platte , Buchanan , Andrew , Holt , Atchison and Nodaway , the chief seat of the border ruffians . It was a gratuitous and wanton breach of the compact of the Missouri Compromise , by converting free soil into slave soil , for the enlargement of a State already the largest in the Union , and at the very height of one of the sharpest excitements produced in Congress in 1836 , by the indignitfwith which anti-slavery petitions were treated . Our author says " In the face of all these discouraging attacks , the two Missouri senators , Messrs . Benton and Linn , commenced their operations . The first step was to procure a bill for the alteration of the compromise line , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Judiciary Committee , reported by Mr. John M. Clayton , of Delaware , and passed the Senate without opposition . It went to the House of Representatives , and found there no serious opposition to its passage . A treaty was negotiated with the Sac and Fox Indians to whom the country was assigned , and was ratified by the requisite two thirds . And this , besides doing an act of generous justice to the State of Missouri was the noble answer which northern members gave to the imputed design of abol. ishing slayery in the States ! actually extending it ! and by an addition equal in extent to such states as Delaware and Rhode Island ; and by its fertility equal to one of the third class of states . " One can not but surmise that in writing this voluntary tribute to the noble magnanimity of the North , the venerable senator must have felt his ribs dilate with the slightest kind of inward chuckle at the success of the " operations " by which Congress had been so adroitly circumvented , and th' national and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coolly sacrificed . What a guaranty for peace and what a source of prosperity would have remained to the Territory of Kansas , had the original boundary been preserved , giving to Kansas the control of both banks of the Missouri , from the mouth of Kansas river , upward ! But there is a further lesson to be learned . It was for the aggrandizement of his State that Mr. Benton de // scended to this notable trick of political legerdemain . It went to strengthen the slave-interest in the western section-that interest which has finally trampled upon the " Thirty Years in the Senate , " and driven the old and ever-devoted servant of the State out of the national councils , and covered his old age with public reproach . Here is the home of Atchison and the seat of his power . But for this act of sordid and reckless selfishness , the thought of blotting out the compromise line would never have been entertained . By this act the ascendancy of the slave interest in the councils of Missouri , was secured for a generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from carrying out her system of railroads , and thus thwarted that other darling project of the Senator , which he had calculated on as his fruit in his old age , and the crowning of his political career-the Pacific IRailroad-now paralyzed and at a stand-still for an indefinite period . This one act of wrong has spread border-ruffianism over the fertile prairies of Kansas , carrying fire and sword and every conceivable outrage among the peaceful settlers . This has furnished the point d'appui of that piratical blockade along the Missouri river , which is now directing the course of travel across the State of Iowa , hastening on the completion of the Iowa lines of railroad , diverting the course of travel of the far West and the upper Missouri forever away from St. Louis to Davenport and Burlington and Chicago , and destroying the hope and even the probability of making Missouri the thoroughfare and St. Louis the entrepot of the great national railroad to the shores of the Pacific . To the North , to Missouri , to Mr. Benton , the results of that annexation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whoPe history of the providence of God . The present state of the country is the most striking comment upon the favorite policy of our senator , opposition alike to slavery agitation and slavery extension . We could wish he might be permited to add ten or fifteen years more to his life , with the faculty to note and to describe the results of that policy which those years shall disclose . The truth is , Mr. Benton and those who have acted with him have pursued towards the evil of slavery-ascendancy a policy directly the reverse of that which they carried out so successfully towards the kindred but lesser evil of bank-ascendancy in the government . In the latter their policy was that of ceaseless agitation , and utter disregard of clamor and of threats , from whatever quarter or however sustained , a bold and almost desperate practice , startling by its novelty , and carrying prerogative up to the utmost verge of constitutional limits , trampling down opposition , provoking and then taunting , and then curbing the // angry passions of opponents , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hunting the " monster " through all his subterfuges until he was harried to death , assailing and as far as possible overbearing State laws and institutions without scruple , cutting off the government from the ordinary mercantile conveniences in the transaction of its business , leaving no stone unturned , and no act of denunciation or of intolerance untried , in order to effect " the divorce of bank and state . " All these lessons of tactics , of stoic firmness , of heroic daring , of indomitable persistence , are on record and available , as precedents and encouragements in the greater struggle now fairly commenced and never to end but iu the similar " divorce of slavery and state . " May a merciful providence open the eyes of the people , unite and guide their councils , with equal wisdom and firmness , and send above all other gifts , " the man for the hour , " to stand in the breach , and be the chosen and trusted leader of the host to the last and . greatest triumph of American democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
