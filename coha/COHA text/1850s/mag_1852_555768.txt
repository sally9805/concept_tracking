ART . IX . -1 . A Municipal History of the Town and City of Boston during two Centuries , from September 17 , 1630 , to September 17 , 1830 . By JOSIAH QUINCY . Boston : Little &amp; Brown . 1852. 8vo. pp. 444. 2 . Sketches of Boston Past and Present , and of some few Places in its Vicinity . With 120 Engravings , and three Maps . Boston : Phillips , Sampson , &amp; Co. 1851. l6mo . Pp. 246 &amp; 112 . MR . QUINCY publishes this history at the close of his eightieth year . The generation of his contemporaries , therefore , has almost entirely passed away ; and his public character and career can be discussed with something of the freedom which belongs to the history of a past age . We hope the day is still distant when an equal license can be given to those who would contemplate him in the more private relations of life , and in the circumstances by which he was acted upon , as well as in those which he shaped or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and distinguished career in many departments of the public service . Mr. Quincy has been emphatically a public servant , in the most democratic meaning of that phrase ; he has filled many offices , quite dissimilar in character , with as much reputation and success as others have secured by confining themselves to a single sphere of action . He has been an active politician , a most efficient chief of municipal administration , and a highly esteemed president for many years of the oldest and most renowned literary institution in the country . And his pen has not been idle . He has published an excellent life of his father , whose name was so prominent in the opening scenes of the American Revolution , an elaborate history of Harvard College , a minute record of the origin and progress of the Boston Athenmeum , and he now appears as the historian of that city whose fortunes he has done more than any living man to shape and influence . We need not pause to enumerate the minor publications or lesser offices that have filled up the intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity has known no pause , and asked no relaxation but change of labor . His hand has always found something to do , and he has invariably done it with all his might . It // was perfectly characteristic in him , after he had retired from the presidency of the college at an age which most m*n consider as a natural and necessary resting-place from all labors which have reference only to our present existence , to devote himself with characteristic energy to the compilation of two historical works , which no one , indeed , was so competent to write as himself , but which no one but himself would have thought of writing , except in the spring-time or summer of life , before the hand begins to shake , or the eye to grow dim , or former employments and interests to seem dull and insignificant in the retrospect . Mr. Quincy has retained the freshness of his feelings quite as well as the vigor of his intellect . He has now chronicled the active scenes of his mayoralty , - and no one who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how terribly active they were - with as much keenness and animation as if he had left the office but yesterday , instead of nearly a quarter of a century ago . It is little to say that Mr. Quincy was eminently successful in all the public trusts that he held . He imprinted his own character upon them , and the history of his administration became a chapter in his personal biography . He exerted that influence which always belongs to a mind of commanding powers and great resoluteness of purpose , to remarkable administrative energy and a singular capacity of labor . To adopt a common phrase , he threw his whole soul into the business . When once placed in command , he was not content to be the figure-head , but insisted on becoming the rudder , of the ship ; he shaped its course , and guided it in every storm . Still , he was not a martinet or a busybody ; he did not mar every thing by officious interference , or a petty scrutiny of details ; and he was not tenacious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . On the contrary , much of his success was attributable to his entire freedom from any petty personal feeling , and to his disregard of all collateral aims . His manliness and independence of character were so conspicuous in his demeanor and his acts , even in his commanding figure and noble presence , that they enforced universal respect and esteem , and gave him the personal influence , without which , in this country at least , nothing great can be accomplished . Keen and almost imperious in his pursuit of a great public purpose , he bore down // all opposition , but forgot the strife as soon as the end was accomplished , and welcomed his former opponents to be his coadjutors in the next enterprise . Such a character is not often formed under our very democratic institutions ; and the people are apt to be so terribly jealous of one when it does appear , that it can with difficulty secure a sufficiently wide field of action . The sovereign Demos is not content to have the thing done which is most to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with proper deference to its supreme authority . The really faithful public servant must often spend as much effort merely to maintain his own popularity , though this popularity be desired only because it is a means of public usefulness , as in the promotion of schemes that directly tend to the public good . The people persist in regarding office only as a reward , or a favor conferred upon the recipient ; and still exact from the functionary , when installed in the post , as exclusive devotion to their interest and pleasure as if they had chosen him for their own advantage , without reference to his personal gratification . He is expected to perform much , hut authority is granted him as sparingly as if the office were meant to be a sinecure . This policy effectually protects the community against any harm from an incompetent or ill disposed person , who might unfortunately be placed in a public station ; but it is a great obstacle to the accomplishment of any permanent or comprehensive good . While it is continued , we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to behold so active and efficient an administration as was that of Mr. Quincy during the six years that he was Mayor of Boston . The principles upon which it was conducted are well explained by himself in the following extract . " The Mayor , from his first induction in 1823 , had taken the place of chairman of every Committee of the Board of Ald*er. men , appointed on any important interest of the city . As this practice had been openly censured as selfish and assuming , the Mayor afterwards vindicated publicly his course , as essential to a knowledge of the objects of his official duties , which included inspection , superintendence , and recommendation of measures on his responsibility . To an intelligent performance of these duties , the actual investigation of every question , as it occurs , in the course of daily business , is important , as scarcely one can arise among the complicated and often discordant interests of a // great city , which is absolutely local and individual . It touches some other , perhaps some rival interest , affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alone detected or rightly understood by being examined in the vicinity , or among the individuals it directly affects . The knowledge thus acquired , must often be all-important to the chief magistrate , who means to place himself in the condition to understand and maintain all the real interests of the city . One of the greatest securities for public virtue and for the exact performance of official duty is a sense of responsibility . Whoever means to be faithful to himself or his trusts will enlarge and multiply occasions for keeping alive this sense in himself and in those whose interests he is called upon to protect . " From the recent organization of the city government , and the consequent new arrangement of its powers , and from many new and extensive projects of improvement , there was an uncommon influx of questions of great interest and importance ; yet the business of the office was efficiently and promptly executed . The practice of this rule of conduct , during nearly six years , did not involve the Mayor in any unreasonable or impracticable accumulation of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a rule , and a practice in conformity with it , exceeds the ability of any individual qualified for such a station , who brings into it , as every one ought , a heart exclusively devoted to duty , and a spirit resolved on its faithful performance . " The practice of devolving all , or a principal part , of the duties of the office of Mayor upon committees of the Board of Aldermen ought , therefore , to be received by the citizens with great jealousy . " As the city increases in population and extent , some relaxation of this principle may be required , in relation to merely personal or local questions ; but none ought ever to be permitted in respect of those which affect the health , the character , or the general interests of the city . A disposition to evade labor and responsibility is the best criterion of a want of qualification for any office . It is important that this point should be distinctly stated and realized , for a contrary practice is very likely to find advocates in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who take office only as a stepping-stone to some higher station , will be apt to regard some of its duties as menial ; and , consequently , to strive to throw the personal superintendence and examination of the resulting questions upon others , and cast on them the burden and responsibility of inspection and decision . They will thus be relieved from attention to subjects , often irksome , never , in themselves , interesting , at times disgusting , and , // in cases of malignant contagion , dangerous . Above all , an executive officer is thus enabled to escape the odium and unpopularity consequent upon discovering his opinions on questions often intensely interesting to individuals or sections of the city ; especially when it happens , as it often must , that the Mayor or his friends are interested in the advancement or prevention of projects or improvements of the city . The practice of devolving responsibility on committees , enables men to do that by influence , which they might be unwilling to do directly . It is so much easier to effect private and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendence , that there is a constant temptation to evade the principle of that official responsibility of the Mayor which tends to place his conduct in frequent and full relief before the citizens . " This principle of executive responsibility , which the Mayor , at his entrance into the office , thus inculcated on the citizens , and which , during the nearly six years of his official tenure , he never ceased both to assume and avow , was unquestionably among the chief causes of whatever success attended that administration . It is , however , unfortunately a fact , that there is in republics a reciprocal tendency , both in executives and among citizens , to keep this principle out of sight . Men are naturally jealous of any disposition to exert powers , even when they exist and are used for their benefit . But if a people require talents in official station , they must exact responsibility in their exercise ; for the best , if not the only evidence of talents and qualification for public usefulness is to be found in what is recommended and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , the title of this volume is a misnomer . It purports to he a history of the town and city of Boston for two centuries ; hut more than three fourths of it are devoted to a review of the six years during which Mr. Quincy was its Mayor , and of the measures that were adopted during this period , the remainder being properly nothing more than an introduction and an appendix to these annals of a single K administration . The more comprehensive title was probably adopted front considerations of delicacy , that the writer might not seem to be exclusively occupied with matters in which he had a strong personal concern . To many readers , however , the hook owes most of its interest to the fact that it is thus limited , in a great degree , to the history of Boston for the brief hut critical period of the author 's mayoralty . It thus acquires something of the charm of a biography ; for it // illustrates the writer 's own character and history quite as much as the subject to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always manifested a strong attachment to that organization into townships , which has been rightly declared to be the characteristic feature of their political system . The number of independent boards or committees , who managed the affairs of each little republic , opened so many public offices to gratify the ambition and the pride of the inhabitants , that every head of a family might , if he saw fit , acquire a share in the administration . There was this further advantage , also , at least in a small township , that , the majority of the people being actually in office , the administration was necessarily popular ; the dissentients were certain to be in a minority . Each office , however humble , being conferred by popular choice , was a mark of public respect , and had the dignity of a public trust . In every town , however small , there must be Selectmen , Overseers of the Poor , Surveyors of Highways , Assessors of Taxes , School Committees , Firewards , and many other incumbents of petty offices , the functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are performed by delegates from the central power . Those who have a local interest and most local knowledge are more apt than strangers to fill these offices to advantage . The system , moreover , is an economical one ; there is much work to be done , but being shared among so many , it is all done gratuitously , the dignity conferred by public office being the only compensation for its burdens . But when the population of the township has increased beyond a certain limit , the advantages of this system begin to diminish , and its inconveniences become manifest . Numerous as the offices are , if there be two or three thousand heads of families in the place , but . a small fraction of them can have a share in the administration . There is more work to he done , and the office which has no salary attached to it is found to be burdensome . The incumbent of it is brought into contact , not with a ' small circle of neighbors and friends , who understand his character and appreciate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he is known only in his official relations , and each one of whom requires some attention to be paid to his personal concerns . // The perplexed town-officer can not explain the difficulties of his position , or justify his conduct , to all of them . He soon finds that he is either becoming unpopular himself , or is sharing the unpopularity of his colleagues . The offices begin to go a begging ; that is , competent persons can not be found who are willing to occupy them , and they necessarily fall into the hands of the careless , the inefficient , and the presumptu-. ous , under whose administration the interests of the community suffer serious damage . The increase of the population has created new wants , heightened old defects , and shown the necessity of many improvements . But while the authority is divided among so many boards and committees , unity of action can with difficulty be secured , and little is accomplished . The responsibility is divided among so many , that no one is held accountable for delay and neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sufficient excuse for not undertaking any enterprise of weight and magnitude . Only the business of ordinary routine is accomplished , and that usually in a languid and inefficient manner . This is but a faint picture of the inconveniences to which the people of Boston were subjected by their " inherited and inveterate antipathy to a city organization . " The population had increased , from about eighteen thousand in 1790 , to over forty thousand in 1820 ; and six vain attempts had been made at long intervals to form them into a civic corporation . These had been defeated by a vote of the inhabitants in " town meeting , " - that primitive form of a popular legislative assembly , which was so strongly recommended to them by their old associations and democratic instincts . To organize a municipal administration would be to give up the cherished privilege of immediate legislation upon their own concerns , and to delegate this power to a Council , whose actions could be controlled only by their liability to be turned out of office at the expiration of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length became manifest ; when there were over seven thousand qualified voters , it was obvious that a town meeting would be an unwieldy and tumultuous assemblage , in which no deliberative action could be had , as the greater number of those present could have neither voice nor hearing . Reluctantly , then , and by a slender majority , // the people accepted , in 1822 , an act that had been passed by the Legislature " for establishing the city of Boston . " This act , following the most prevalent example , gave the control of most of the affairs of the city to a Mayor , a Board of Aldermen , and a Common Council , whose collective appellation was " The City Council . " The organization was imperfect at first , many defects being allowed to remain in it , probably for the purpose of reconciling the people to the change in their form of government by not rendering it too sweeping and too sudden . Thus , several independent boards , the members of which were chosen directly by the people , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the City Council , instead of being subject to it , and the unity of the administration being , to this extent , destroye ( l . The limits of their respective functions being imperfectly defined , collisions between them were frequent , and the vigorous prosecution of any one set of measures , which were closely related to each other , was met by almost insuperable obstacles . The facts related in this volume form an instructive coinmentary on this defect in municipal organization , which still exists , in a greater or less degree , in all the cities in the State . The multiplication of offices , filled directly by popular election , is a fundamental error in the organization of a large community . Neither the National nor the State government is thus constituted . In both these cases , the people choose the members of the legislature , and the leading officers of the executive department , - frequently , only the chief of that department ; and on the few persons thus chosen rests the whole responsibility for the proper conduct of affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote would be to throw the machine of state into inextricable confusion , all the independent portions being more likely to clash than to cooperate , and any defect or failure in the general result being likely to be irremediable , because it could not be traced with certainty to its proper cause . The management of private corporations affords an instructive lesson in this respect to the community at large . The affairs of a bank , a railroad , or a manufacturing corporation are generally managed with far more prudence and economy than those of a city . Many of these corporations have the control of larger funds , employ a // greater number of servants , and give larger salaries , than any municipal corporation in the State . Yet the stockholders in them content themselves with making choice , at their annual meeting , of a board of directors , to whom they give full powers . These directors often select one of their own number to be the president , and put the reins entirely into his hands , keeping a watchful oversight of his proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave necessity . And with what energy , economy , and despatch their affairs are generally conducted ! Cases of defalcation , incompetency , or criminal neglect , among their subordinate officers , are even fewer than among those of a public corporation , where the whole community are on the watch to detect them . The administration has , in many respects , the vigor and unity of a despotism , with this capital improvement , - that the despot is sure to be dethroned in less than a year , if he mismanages the affairs of his people . One great objection to the system of filling numerous subordinate offices by popular vote is , that an incompetent or dishonest person , having once wormed his way into the post by his political manoeuvres , is sure to remain there till the end of his year , though his unfitness may be glaringly manifest before the first month has expired . The advantage in point of economy is so clearly in favor of the system which makes the administration a unit , that it hardly needs to be pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite plan without serious risk of bankruptcy in the first year of its operations . The local administration is now far the most expensive portion of our whole scheme of government , the burden being more sensibly felt because it is supported by direct taxation . Plans of retrenchment , or of more effectual protection to the local treasury , are of little avail ; for the evil does not arise from positive mismanagement or any gross abuse of office , so much as from negligence , timidity , and the want of that far-sighted economy which makes seasonable provision for future exigencies . To multiply jealous precautions would only be to increase the evil ; the system is too complex already . But we are not so sanguine as to believe that the public will ever learn to manage their affairs upon the same principles which , as individuals , they apply to their pecuniary concerns . // It would be too quixotic to expect that fhe business of a city should be as well conducted as that of a manufacturing company at Lowell or Waltham , or even of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waste of the public funds , by remembering that we have our money 's worth in the glorious privilege of grumbling at our rulers , and turning them all out of office at the end of every year or two . The bank or the railroad , when it has found a faithful and efficient manager or servant , is usually foolish enough to retain his services as long as possible ; which is contrary to the democratic principle of rotation in office . The people of Boston left Mr. Quincy out of office at the expiration of the sixth year of his mayoralty ; and the corporation of Harvard College eagerly improved the opportunity by making him President of that institution for sixteen years . The first year after the organization of the new city government , it was designedly administered upon cautious and moderate principles , few innovations being attempted ; the object being to alleviate the fears and jealousies that had been excited by the change , and to allow the new system to become rooted in the habits and the affections of the people , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms which the increase of the population and the altered circumstances of the times had rendered necessary . At the close of this year , the first Mayor , Mr. Phillips , declined being a candidate for reiAection ; and the convention which nominated Mr. Quincy for the office expressed to him their wishes and expectations , " that the measures of the ensuing administration should he characterized by great activity and energy , and that a full development should be given , as far as possible , to all the executive powers granted by the charter . " He expressed his willingness to accept the office upon this understanding of the nature of its duties , and pledged himself , if elected , that he would endeavor to carry out the desires and principles of the convention . Never was a pledge more fully and satisfactorily redeemed . We wish candidates for civic offices were oftener selected on similar principles , and required to give similar pledges . Our municipal administrations throughout the country , but especially here in New England , seem to have been injuri // ously affec*ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by an anxious shrinking from responsibility . This remark applies to all municipalities in which the number of the inhabitants exceeds ten or twelve thousand ; but it is particularly applicable to our great marts of commerce , some of which already vie in magnitude with the leading capitals of Europe . The system which was first devised for the small townships of New England , and is still working admirably in them , is wholly insufficient for the wants of a great metropolis , and even for the masses of population that are drawn around the centres of manufacturing and commercial industry . In these , a large measure of municipal reform is greatly needed , in respect both to the economy and efficiency of the administration . The expenditures of these communities are large , as , under our decentralized polity , the law throws upon each of them the support of their own poor , the maintenance of the system of public education within their limits , the construction and support of highways , the establishment of the police , and the regulation of the inferior tribunals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poverty , and crime gravitate towards these centres of population , and exist there in rapidly increasing masses , which sometimes menace the general security . The preservation of the public health often requires a whole system of reformatory measures to be executed at one time , at great expen*e , the rapid growth of the population having far exceeded the expectations of the founders of the city . The first step for accomplishing these objects in the cheapest and most efficient manner should be to give greater unity to the administration , and to throw the whole responsibility upon a few persons . The necessary preparation for this step must be to get rid of the idea , that municipal office is a reward , to be bestowed upon the most deserving or the most needy , - to compensate those who have merited well of the public in other relations , or have rendered important services to the political party to which they belong . Who would think of giving away the presidency of a bank , or the agency of a manufacturing corporation , upon such principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a great deal of work to be done , and the only proper question is , who can be found to do it most efficiently . Whoever is // really fitted for the office should be asked to accept it , and sufficient inducements should be added to obtain his consent . The idea of favor or reward on either side is inappropriate , the only object being to obtain the services of the most competent person for the post , and to give him a reasonable compensation for the entire devotion of his time and talents to its duties . Still more short-sighted and unwise is the system of holding up this class of offices as prizes in the political arena , to be won by the most active and astute , perhaps the most unscrupulous , partisan . What has the orthodoxy of a man 's political or religious opinions to do with the proper management of such municipal affairs as the conduct of the finances , the direction of the police , the superintendence of the streets , and the construction*of school-houses ? Who cares whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political intolerance has been a chief cause of wastefulness , neglect , and mismanagement in municipal concerns ; for the principle has been , not only to exclude those who belonged to the party in the minority , but to elect the most prominent and active members of the dominant faction , as it ' their political services were a sufficient test of their abilities and their uprightness . Mr. Quincy 's term of service was eminently fortunate in this respect ; as during most of the time there was a lull in the storm of party politics , and at the elections he was generally supported or opposed with reference . only to his merits as a Mayor of Boston . We have not room to give a detailed account of the measures which characterized his administration , and it is not necessary . The history of them in this volume is able , clear , and impartial ; and the account of the ohstacles with which he had to contend , as well as of the results of his policy , both as they were developed at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction . Generally speaking , he had no cause to complain of a want of support by the bulk of his constituents . His manly and independent course , the sagacity with which his measures were conceived , and the energy and perseverance with which they were executed , commanded the respect and confidence of the citizens , even when they shocked the prejudices or obstructed the interests of a few . After six years of service , it is true , the people // failed , at two successive trials , to re*ilect him to office . But the failure was owing to a partial disaffection proceeding from causes that soon ceased to operate ; and but for the appointment that almost immediately removed him to another sphere of duty , he might have been reinstated in his post at the end of a year with greater unanimity than had ever yet been manifested . Nearly all the objects for which he was first appointed , however , had been accomplished ; and he could well afford to retire , leaving many conspicuous monuments of the great public improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his name and praise to future generations . Among the most successful measures of Mr. Quincy 's administration were those adopted for the suppression of idleness , vice , and crime , and the purification of the city from many of the causes of infection and disease . The success of these measures was the more remarkable , as they were attended with little or no expense , and did not render necessary any additional legislation , or any enlargement of the very scanty police establishment , which had hitherto hardly merited its name . The remedy was found in the vigorous enforcement of the laws already in being , and in the active use of the little force already appointed for the work . On retiring from office , Mr. Quincy was able to say , " the venerable old charter number of tweaty-four constables still continue the entire array of city police ; and eighty watchmen , of whom never more than eighteen are out at a time , constitute the whole nocturnal host of police milhant , to maintain the peace and vindicate the wrongs of upwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his duty to cause the laws to be executed and put in force , had no specific authority granted to him for this end , and in the attempt to suppress riots and unlawful assemblies , could act only as " justice of the peace throughout the commonwealth , " or under a character which was not derived from his connection with the , city . Yet with these slender means , he succeeded in entirely breaking up the great haunt of vice and crime , which had long been the opprobrium and the terror of the citizens . When a riot was anticipated , instead of sending a few constables to the spot , who would only have been derided by the mob , or of calling out the military , which might have // occasioned a considerable loss of life , he organized a volunteer force of athletic truckmen and other well-disposed citizens , and , placing himself at their head , quickly overawed and dispersed the rioters merely by a show of stouter arms and heavier fists than their own . Having caused a suitable House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicious could he not only imprisoned , but provided with hard labor , the " venerable constables " were set to work to make arrests with astounding rapidity in the district which had been for many years a sort of Alsatia , or head-quarters of effrontery and crime . Awed by this bold attack , its inmates attempted no defence , and the region where vice and villany had been represented as " too strong for the police " was soon rendered as peaceable and orderly as any part of the city . Street-begging was almost entirely repressed , and the measures for a systematic cleansing of the city were so effectual , that they produced a striking alteration in the hills of mortality . During the ten years preceding 1823 , when Mr. Quincy came into office , the proportion of deaths to the whole population was one in forty-two ; during the next four years it was less than one in fifty ; and in the last three years of his administration , it was but one in fifty-seven . The effect upon the personal comfort of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a proverb , that Boston never bad clean streets before Mr. Quincy 's administration , and has never had clean streets since . Another important service rendered to the city was an entire reform of the old system of protection against fire , and the creation of a new and very efficient fire department . The opposition to this reform was formidable enough , arising from the affection of the citizens for their old institutions , and especially for an ancient and honorable board of " firewards , " thirty-six in number , annually chosen by the citizens in their respective wards , and who , in point of vigor and efficiency , almost equalled " the venerable constables * themselves . Their chief duty at a fire was to " impress " unhappy persons out of the gaping crowd who had been drawn together to see the show , and compel them " to form lanes ' * for the purpose of passing buckets of water from the pumps to the engines . But as resistance to arbitrary impressment was a constitutional principle with the good people of Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the fireward 's back was turned . These officers also had general authority to direct operations at a fire ; but as they were so numerous , and as any three of them had just as much authority as any other three , it may be supposed that there was not much unity or system in command . Practically , each engine company acted as they saw fit , and the impressed volunteers did the same . No means had been devised for furnishing a supply of water ; and as each engine had hut a few feet of hose , even when it was drawn as near to the flames as was possible without scorching the firemen , the stream had to be propelled from a considerable distance , and most of the little water which had been obtained was wasted . The system in all its parts was at least a hundred and fifty years old , and had answered tolerably well for the wants of a small population . But it was ludicrously insufficient for the protection of a great city against the most formidable peril @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be menaced . The account of the projected reform , of the furious opposition that it encountered , and of its ultimate entire success forms an amusing and instructive narrative . The wrath of the old firemen , " the infringement of the ancient liberties of the people , " who could no longer choose firewards , as the appointment of the chief engineer and his assistants was to be vested in the City Council , and the indignation of the mob , who were to be kept at a distance from the fires , instead of crowding around them under the pretence of rendering aid , would have crushed the project altogether , if the occurrence of three extensive conflagrations , in rapid succession , had not thrown new light upon the subject . " Do you think , sir , ' said one of the captains of the engines , that the citizens of Boston will ever submit to he prohibited from assisting a fellow townsman in distress . Such sort of laws may be obeyed in despotic countries , or in cities where the mba . bitants do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , nor ever will be in Boston . No such system can ever be introduced into this city . ' When the advantages of the hose system were suggested , it was answered , that it was practicable in Philadelphia , from the abundance and easy command of water ; but Boston possessed no such facilities . When it was stated in reply , that , in New York , the want of a sufficient head of water was supplied by stationing engines at intervals between the water and // the fire , which , by playing into each other successively , enabled the nearest to throw a continuous stream upon the fire . The answer of one of the captains was characteristic of the state of the existing prejudices on the subject . Set enginemen at a distance from the fire ! It will never be submitted to . Their desire is always to be in the hottest of the battle . The nearer the fire , the higher the post of honor . Their struggle is , who shall get to it the first , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep a Boston engine back , in order to play into its neighbor , than it would be to put out the fire . ' Many thoughtful and intelligent citizens had also doubts concerning the efficiency of the hose system ; and the City Council concluded , after much deliberation , that it was most prudent to postpone for a time attempts to introduce improvements obnoxious to so many prejudices . ' " pp. 156 , 157 . As the recent Presidential elections had been rather tame affairs , the good people of Boston exhausted all the public spirit they had to spare , - and no community ever had more , - on the question about a new fire department . The voice of the Mayor was continually heard abov , the din , arguing , expostulating , and replying to vague and stereotyped asser* tions by concise and nervous statements of facts . He triumphed at last ; he convinced , in succession , the Legislature , the City Council , the respectable 01 ( 1 flrewards themselves , and at length the citizens . On the final appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a majority of less than two hundred decided in favor of the new system . The Mayor organized a numerous and very efficient fire department , animated with so much esprit de corps that when , a few years afterwards , presuming on the paternal relation which he sustamed towards it , he ventured to disobey its behest in the appointment of its chief , the members marched to the polls in solid column , and turned him out of office . Never was there a more signal exhibition of republican ingratitude . The most conspicuous and enduring monument to the praise of Mr. Quincy 's administration is the great public improvement , the chief feature of which is the noble markethouse , that is everywhere styled , except in this volume , " The Quincy Market . " Before his time , the ground-floor of Faneuil Hall , the old " Cradle of Liberty , " was defiled by the presence of butchers ' stalls , ( we wish it were more worthily occupied even at the present day , ) while a mean and ugly 43* // wooden shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the only place for the sale of vegetables . A labyrinth of crooked and narrow alleys , frequently choked with trucks and farmers ' wagons , formed the purlieus of this place of general resort , while the " Town Dock , " extending up nearly to one end of it , mingled the offensive odor of the salt ooze with that of the garbage and filth peculiar to such a locality , and which no exertions in such a neighborhood could wholly remove . Mr. Quincy conceived the hold scheme of buying the neighboring estates , filling up the dock nearly to the limits of the channel , and after making a clean sweep of the vegetable market , of old buildings , and blind alleys , to build a grand market-house of granite , extending in a long line to the eastward , and opening on either face to straight and broad avenues , bordered on the opposite sides by rows of handsome warehouses , built on a uniform plan , to correspond with the architecture of the central edifice . The space about Faneuil Hall would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the citizens regarded with so much pride and affection would no longer be the centre of an unsightly and noisome district . The plan was a gigantic one , involving the expenditure of millions , alarming to many capitalists who owned the buildings in the neighborhood , and needing the approval of the mass of the citizens , who had a singular affection for their ancient pathways and ancient landmarks , and were nervously apprehensive even of the commencement of a city debt . They were not yet inured to the heavy speculations in real estate , which have since become familiar , and which would cause many at the present day to regard such a project with complacency . But formidable as the difficulties were which surrounded the scheme , Mr. Quincy entered upon the execution of it with his characteristic ardor and energy ; and within a few years , the work was completed with results so favorable that the projector himself was probably astonished by them . " A granite market.house , two stories high , five hundred and thirty-five feet long , fifty feet wide , covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was erected , at the cost of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . Six new streets were opened , and a seventh greatly enlarged , ineluding one hundred and sixty-seven thousand square feet of // land ; and flats , docks , and wharf rights obtained , of the extent of one hundred and forty-two thousand square feet . All this was accomplished in the centre of a populous city , not only with . out any tax , debt , or burden upon its pecuniary resources ,  -- notwithstanding , in the course of the operations , funds to the amount of upwards of eleven hundred thousand dollars had been employed , - but with large permanent additions to its real and productive property . The proprietors of land in the north section of the city were also enabled by this improvement to open Fulton and Commercial Streets , thus greatly enlarging mercantile accommodations , facilitating intercourse with the great southern wharves , and creating opportunities for the foundation of those noble blocks of granite stores , which have since been erected to the eastward of those streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon this volume than its local interest and importance may seem to justify . But we trust the reader is now prepared to believe that the history contained in it affords some curious illustrations of the working of our democratic institutions and the peculiarities of our national character . Those especially who have any interest in the conduct of municipal affairs may derive from it much profitable instruction ; and we are sure they will lay it down with a hearty feeling of admiration and respect for the eminent public services and manly character of its author .
