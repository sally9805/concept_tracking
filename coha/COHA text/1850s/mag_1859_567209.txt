EDWARD DLIFFIELD KEILL , Secretary of the Minnesota Historical Society . 1868 . THE progress of our civilization across the continent is opening new studies in geography and ethnology . Areas , larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are becoming the abodes of enlightened and prosperous peoples , who are organized under constitutional governments of their own . Together with what is new in this march of empire , some old things are brought to light connected with the preoccupiers of the soil which awaken peculiar interest in the development of our history . Particular attention has of late been directed to the newest * orthwest , in which we include the last-admitted of our // States this side of the IRocky Mountains and the areas to the north and northwest of it , both in the territory of the United States and of British America . Several causes have led to this . Gold , that magnet of men , has been largely discovered on Frazer River and its tributaries , giving promise of a region opulent in treasure , in consequence of which there has been a great rush of the loose residents of the Pacific coast to the spot , and a strong desire this side of the mountains to open up a highway to it . The government of Great Britain , improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case , has created the new colony of British Columbia for this auriferous region , so as to maintain order and security for the settlers , thus both attracting population and establishing it under the forms of society and law when gained . The Hudson 's Bay Company , that ancient chartered corporation , which for nearly two centuries has held as a private demesne the vast realm known as IRupert 's Land , extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude to . the Arctic Ocean , a re ahn larger than the entire territory of the United States , has just finished its existence by the expiration of its last license . Nearly all parties on this side of the water and on the other were opposed to the continuance any longer of this gigantic monopoly which , with its significant motto , " Pro pelle cutem , " had held as wild hunting grounds an immense domain which might be opened for the abodes and works of civilization . The statesmen of England , ever eager in enlarging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of American settlements , have conceived the idea of planting a series of colonies along our northern frontier from ocean to ocean . The country has been examined , the most reliable information has been sought , and the queen 's speech has announced " The Act to which her Majesty has assented , for the establishment , of the colony of British Columbia was urgently required in consequence of the recent discovery of gold in that district ; but her Majesty hopes that this new colony on the Pacific may be but one step in the career of steady progress , by which her Majesty 's dominions in North // America may ultimately be peopled , in an unbroken chain from the Atlantic to the Pacific , by a loyal and industrious population of subjects of the British crown . " Our own outlooking , restless and advancing pioneers already begin to feel crowded by the settlements which are thickening on the sun-down side of the northern Mississippi , and they are entering these new northwestern regions with their characteristic traits . " There is no geographical obstacle whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , and the time must come , before many years have expired , when they will reach the imaginary line which divides the level prairie between Great Britain and the American Union . " A nd he fears that that line will be no barrier to them . The healthfulness of Minnesota , together with its productiveness , has also contributed to turn attention thither . That State is already an asylum for invalids from all parts of the land . Medical theory as to a change of climate for the arrest or cure of diseases seems to have undergone a change , both in this country and in Europe . The victims of pulmonary disease , which , in its various types , is the prevalent disease of the age , are sent , not , as formerly , to the warm latitudes , but to cold ones . The dry , bracing air of Minnesota has proved peculiarly remedial , as the high , cool districts of Switzerland have done . Many have found there the boon of health ; from the Yankee who left the damp seaboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indyanny " who came to till the land and " get shet of the ager . " A speaker at a railroad meeting , who was exalting the air of Minnesota , in the " high falutin " style , declared , among other things , that it was " a triumphant vindication of all pulmonary diseases ! " West of this State the conditions of salubrity are increased . But perhaps the most prominent cause of all is the rising demand for interoceanic communication . The Pacific Railway is a necessity of the age , and it is felt to be so not only by the people of this country , but also by the statesmen of Great Britain . It is a favorite scheme among some of the latter to connect halifax and Vancouver by a grand continental railroad through the entire length of British America . From explorations and estimates // that have been made , it is demonstrated that the shortest and most feasible route within our own territory is the northern one from the head of navigation on the Mississippi to Puget Sound . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Great Britain are not yet all settled . It is significant that the sole unsettled line is the extreme boundary on the Pacific coast . The island of San Juan , i'n Puget Sound , a portion of the disputed territory , has , according to the last accounts , been seized by Gen. ilarney of our army , and its fortifications now bristle defiantly with American arms . Should diplomacy unfortunately be too late to decide the dispute which has already been appealed by this rash soldier to the arbitrament of battle , war would give to all this region a fresh glow . A glance at the geography and population of the territory now before us will show what interest and importance attach to it . On our northern frontier we have the Mediterranean Lakes , thrust half way across the continent , already the seat and highway of a commerce which extends to th' other hemisphere , and pointing out the route westward to the Pacific . Reaching to a point within a hundred and fifty miles of the western end of Lake Superior , is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the right angle where these two natural lines of continental commerce meet , is our starting place in the survey . Two hundred miles northwest of St. Paul , one hundred and twenty-five miles west of Fort Ripley , at the junction of the Sioux Wood and Otter Tail Rivers , is the new town of Breckenridge , near the new fort Abererombie , at the head of navigation on the Red River of the North . The head waters of this river interlock with the head waters of the Mississippi and of various streams that flow into the Mississippi , so that small boats when the streams are fullest caxi pass from one to the other . The intermediate region is one of great beauty and fertility . Here are the " Big Woods , " a belt of dense forest twenty or thirty miles in breadth , consisting of the best varieties of timber , the oak , maple , ash , elm , // walnut , butternut , basswood , and aspen . Here are luxuriant rolling prairies , covered with tall grasses and many varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . Here are innumerable lakes , with which the whole landscape is gemmed , generally skirted with fine forest growths , and so clear that a late traveler in his enthusiasm says , that in looking into them one can see through to the other side of the globe and view the Chinese picking tea ! It has been commonly supposed that this district is too far north for the prosecution of successful agriculture . Experience has exploded the idea , and we shall see , as we progress , that agriculture is far from being a fhilure many degrees farther northward . Wheat , barley , corn , oats , and potatoes , yield large products . The potatoes rival any that Ireland itself can produce , and are already quite an article of export . The writer brought to New Haven last fall ripe field corn , of the dent variety , which he gathered in a field north of St. Paul on the 16th of September . The soil is largely a rich , sandy loam , on which vegetation matures with almost tropical rapidity . Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner have the frosts disappeared than a bright greenness is spread over the whole landscape . Leaves and flowers start forth as by magic ; the crops spring to maturity and the harvest follows rapidly after sowing . Every mouth in Minnesota is a month of flowers , from the departure of the frost till it comes again . New blooms are constantly charming the eye as they garnish the prairies . Here is a bright yellow blossom , bending before the wind , that looks like the plume of a warrior . There is a tall spike covered with purple flowerings , by which the Indian knows when the corn is ready for roasting . Yonder is a plat all covered and spangled with bright blooms of many colors , like the gayest parterre of a garden . An editor says in a late issue of his paper , " On Sunday last we counted , in a space of less than thirty acres , krty-seven varieties of wild flowers , all indigenous to Minnesota . " Many of the high prairie lands are very moist and the luxuriant grasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose upon these unfenced fields and the flocks and herds remind one of Holland . The // winters are long and cold ; but the air is so dry that the cold is not as severe as in lower latitudes . Indeed the coldest days are among the pleasantest ! The air is then clear and still , the sky cloudless , everything on the earth white and sparkling with frost , every step creaks and cracks on the glistening pavement . The lakes and rivers are turned into smooth , hard roads . The evenings are gorgeous . The stars shine with a clear brilliancy . When the moon is full the nights are almost as bright as day. * Wrapped in furs from head to feet everybody goes out to enjoy the bracing tonic of the bright , cold atmosphere . Merry parties , joyous families , glide to the music of jingling bells , over the smooth streets of the town out on to the broad highways of the prairies . The snow-fall is slight ; it is too steadily cold for much of it . Wood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a striking sight on one of these cold , still days . A thousand white columns rise from the roofs to the heavens as straight as pillars of marble . Let the day be a little breez*y and they are turned into a thousand streaming banners . On these cold days the " frosts of age " hardly distinguish those to whom they belong . All beards turn white , and the youngest who can wear them assume a very venerable appearance out doors . Black horses become white , as do those of all colors . Winter is the silver season . Autumn is the golden season , dry , beaming , glorious . The meteorological phenomena are magnificent . Rainbows come in pairs . Mist-bows are not uncommon . Splendid meteors flash through the air . Storms are grand . They are like storms at sea . Such thunder is rarely heard elsewhere . The reverberations are awful . It is " live thunder . " The crash is like that which one hears among the high Alps . The ecliptic runs low on the southern sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the porch of his residence at St. Paul , last winter , on a Sabbath night , read three articles in different type in the independent , by the light of the moon , and in his room a chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians in an agate , 32mo . New Testament , by the same light . // 1001 unnsnal brilliancy . The skies are lustrous and of a peculiar tint ; and the stars flash like diarnonds. * Minnesota means " sky-tinted water . " It is the IMlinne-land , the land of many waters . Rivers , from the " Father of Waters , " to the little stream that gladdens the most secluded glen , flow profusely through its territory . A number of picturesque waterfalls add their beauty to the landscape . The most noted of these is Minnehaha , the Indian term for Laughing Water , near the fair city of Minneapolis , and not far from Lake Minnetonka . " Stars in the silent night Might be enchained , Birds in their passing flight Be long detained , And by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home , Hearing in waters dancing , Mid spray and foam , Minnehaha ! " Between green and flowery banks , almost on a level with itself , the stream comes gliding along to the very brink of the precipice . Then flowers nodding over it as it goes , it leaps with a laugh into the chasm sixty feet below . From the boiling basin into which it plunges loud shouts ascend , which are echoed and re-echoed in merry peals up the whole face of the fall . Then again cheerily laughing it sweeps in graceful triotion down the ravine . It is indeed Minne-ha-ha. * " At the small hours of the night , at dewy eve and early morn , I have looked out with wonder , love and admiration upon the steel-blue sky of Minnesota , set with diamonds , and sparkling with brilliants of purest ray . The stillness of your small hours is sublime . I feel constrained as I gaze and admire , to hold my breath , lest the eloquent silence of the night should be broken by the reverberations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . Herschell has said , that in Europe the astronomer might consider himself highly favored , if by patiently watching the skies for one year he shall , during that period , find , all told , one hundred hours suitable for satisfactory observations . A telescope mounted here , in this atmosphere , under the skies of Minnesota , would have its powers increased many times over what they would be under canopies of a heaven less brilliant and lovely . " - Lieut . Maury , Sup . U. S. Nat . Observatory , Washington . // All is changed when the falls go into winter quarters . Pendent icicles , like brilliant stalactites , hang down the face of the precipice on either side , leaving a large gallery back of them . The stream takes the leap into a deep vortex closely shut in by augmenting ice . The spray , freezing as it falls , lies in woolly-looking swells , twenty and thirty feet in thickness , in the deep chasm . There is a wild beauty to Minnehaha now , in striking contrast with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . The water laughs grimly as it takes the cold plunge ; a hoarse shout rises from the ice cavern ; and just below the piled masses of frozen foam the gay brook opens a full merry eye and gives a cheerful smile before hiding again under its bridge of ice . Lakes , linked together like the jewels in the necklace of a bride , adorn its surface , and their bottoms are bright with agates , carnelians , and other stones . Here are the haunts of the naiads ! The Bluffs of the upper Mississippi are famed . They tower along the stream sometimes close to the water , sometimes retreating from it , now fifty or sixty feet high , then rising to the hight of four hundred or five hundred feet . Sometimes a bold line of rock , like a mighty wall , the work of Titans , shoots down from inland to the river with deep ravines bordering it . Sometimes the massive masonry extends for miles on the banks of the river like an impregnable fortification , which it often greatly resembles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks into fortresses like that of Ehrenbreitstein , and castles like those whose ruins enchant the traveler on the crag of IDrachenfels and far along " the wide and winding Rhine . " Sometimes these bluffs are bare rock , shooting up in forms of pinnacles and towers , and one almost expects to see the flash of the sentinel 's musket upon them . Sometimes they are crowned with old trees , without any undergrowth , looking as though they had been planted and carefully cultivated for centuries , while smooth green lawns spread far away , and one looks for the walls of the old baronial castle which should certainly stand somewhere near . Sometimes a single turret rises from the masses of foliage , as // if it were the outlook of a bold robber chieftain , commanding the navigation of the river. * An intelligent population is entering into this region whose settlements are crowding the solitudes beyond the Red River . Liberal provision has been made by the state for education . Two entire townships are appropriated to the university . Two sections of land out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every six miles square , are given for common schools . The swamp lands , some of which must eventually be valuable , are also set apart for the schools . In 1820 , a party of sixteen men left Prairie du Chien , then a fortified out-post , in three Mackinaw boats , with supplies of seeds for settlements in the British possessions . They voyaged up the Minnesota river to Big Stone Lake , from which they brought their boats by a portage of only a mile and a half , to Lake Traverse , whose waters through the Sioux Wood river flow into the Red river . So long ago was indicated the natural channel of trade which is now attracting new attention . It seems almost like a new creation or a magical addition to the resources of the country that so far inland has been revealed a region with a navigable water system of its own and with vast agricultural capabilities , fitted even to compete with the valley of the Mississippi or the borders of the great Lakes . From Breckenridge the Red river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continually swollen by smaller streams , for five hundred and seventy-five miles , navigable for steamers through its whole length , four hundred miles of which are within our own territory , within the state of Minnesota . The Shayenne , a tributary from the west in Minnesota , is navigable for a hundred miles in like manner , and the Assiniboin , also from the west , within British territory , for two hundred miles . The whole navigable length of the Red * " Sugar Loaf Bluff " at Winona , is described by its name . " Eagle Rock " has a romantic Indian tradition connected with it . " Maiden 's Rock , " the grandest bluff of the Mississippi , rising five hundred feet above the stream , takes its name from the fair Indian maiden , the gentle Winona , who leaped from its summit to certain death ,  --  alI for love . // River and its tributaries is more than nine hundred miles . The valley of this river , which emigrants are only beginning to possess , is described by Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States to negotiate a treaty with the Chippewa Indians of Pembina , IRed Lake , and Turtle Mountain , and who , with a party of twelve men , descended the stream in two birch canoes one hundred miles beyond our boundary line , as " inviting the farn*er to luxuriate upon its fertile bosom ; a laud now flowing with milk and buffalo ; a valley watered by a river the most admirably calculated , from the depth of its channel , its freedom from rapids and the sluggishness of its current , for navigation by steamboats for over five hundred miles ; a valley , or rather a slightly oval basin with islands of timber dotting it over , the bluff slope of the Coteau dii Prairie bounding its horizon on the west , and heavy woods east of the river circumscribing it in that direction . " He speaks of a portion of it as " a garden like region , " and of another portion as " a paradise of beautiful lakes and groves and waving meadows , rank with fine grasses , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he further says , " so great is the luxuriance of the grasses in this valley , that the buffalo winter there and find food by pawing away the snow to get at the sward beneath . " Pembina , on the international boundary , formerly a trading post of the Northwest Company , is now an American settlement . Eighty miles northward is the famous Selkirk settlement , so named from the Earl of Selkirk , a nobleman of Scotland , who , as a member of the hudson 's Bay Company , had explored the region , and was so charmed with its climate and its resources , that he patriotically proposed to do , a half century ago , what the British government at this late day has entered upon , to plant colonies of British emigrants there . He urged the project in various ways , he obtained , after some years , a grant of land from the Hudson 's Bay Company for the purpose , and he sent out a company of colonists from the highlands of Scotland to found a settlement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlers . In 1816 , Lord Selkirk , who had learned of their distresses , with a small // military force and a reinforcement of colonists , visited them , and for a year devoted himself to the firmer establishment of the colony . With varied fortune it has existed in the solitudes for nearly half a century , until now the march of civilization has opened it to the world , and it becomes an important post in the majestic enterprises which are hastening to their fulfillment in this region . The settlement now occupies a territory fifty or sixty miles in length , on the Red and Assiniboin rivers . Productive farms tYonting on the river and extending back for miles into the country ; the neat white dwellings , embowered with trees and shrubbery and trailing vines , and surrounded with opulent gardens ; the capacious barns and out-buildings ; occasional school-houses ; steepled churches and a massive cathedral stone fortresses ; the showy seats of retired officers of the old Fur Company amidst smooth lawns ; herds of horses and cattle and the ripening grains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impression of wonder upon the voyageur whose canoe glides down the Red river towards the Arctic circle . Governor Alexander Ramsey speaks of " seeing two ladies driving by themselves a tine horse hitched to a buggy of modern fashion , just as much at home apparently as if they were driving through the streets of St. Paul ; " and , he adds , " but this was not a whit more novel than to hear the pianoforte , and played , too , with both taste and skill . While another lion ' of those parts that met our view was a top-sail schooner , lying in the river at the lower fort , which made occasional trips into Great Lake Winnipeg of the north , a hundred miles below . " here wheat and barley , the cereals and esculent roots are easily produced . The want of a market for the crops has latterly turned the attention of the farmers to the raising of stock , which can be driven to the new American towns on the Mississippi . Originating in Scotland , the agricultural population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affinities . Beside these , tlmere is a Catholic population of the Imunters , descendants of Canadian adventurers , who were originally attracted to the region by the pursuits and profits of the fur // traffic and the free life of the wilderness , and who still rely on game for their livelihood . These are a bold , free-and-easy people , for the greater part of the year indulging in indolence and pleasure in the settlements , and for the lesser part dashing over hills and plains in the wild deeds and dangers of the chase . In camp they are under self-imposed rules of military strictness . Prowling enemies demand careful preparation and watchful sentries . No hunting is allowed on the Sabbath-day . Theft is a crime . The hunt requires the nerve of the battlefield . The IRed river flows into Lake Winnipeg , which is two hundred and fifty miles in length and from five to fifty in breadth , with an area equal to that of Lake Erie , and is navigable throughout its whole extent . Into this Lake , on the northwest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than seven hundred miles in a direct line , though the windings of the stream nearly double the distance , into the very shadows of the iRocky Mountains . This is a swift , strong stream , with formidable rapids at its mouth , which , however , are not considered as unpracticable for steamers . Says one of the reports before us , " It is feasible and probable that steamboats now moored in the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers will yet seek the northwesteru limit of their voyages within view of the Rocky Mountains . " The Saskatchewan has two branches , the north and south ; and a late British expedition has discovered that the south branch at the angle where it tuins northward to join the north Saskatchewan , is within a short distance of the Calling river , a tributary of the Assiniboin , and that the two streams can be easily connected , as they were formerly , thus both shortening the distance and improving the navigation . An old channel is apparent , averaging nearly a mile in breadth , and with bold banks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet deep , extending along in its course for fifty miles . Directly west of Lake Winnipeg , and parallel with it and connected with it by a tributary , and of nearly the same length with it , are Lakes Winnipigoos and Manitoba , fed by rivers from the west , which are said to drain a country of rare // beauty and fertility . Indeed the whole valley of the Saskatchewan is represented as possessing attractions for settlement such as we have been accustomed to attribute to those regions alone which lie in a far more southern latitude . Were it not for the high character of the witnesses and their qfficial statements , we might be tempted to impute to their representations somewhat of romance . The itinerary of Sir George Simpson speaks of " a beautiful country with lofty hills and long valleys , full of silvan lakes , while the bright green of the surface , as far as the eye could reach , assumed a foreign tinge , under an uninterrupted profusion of roses and blue bells ; " of a country of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a picturesque panorama ; " " of bands of buffaloes in all directions , to the number of about five thousand , abundant game , bold scenery , delicious wild fruits and a seam of coal ten feet in thickness . " Father IDe Smet , a Jesuit Missionary , describes a portion of the region as " extremely fertile , abounding in forests , plains , prairies , lakes , streams , and mineral springs . " " The country , " he adds , would be capable of supporting a large population , and the soil is favorable for the production of barley , corn , potatoes , and beans . The day will come , " he predicts , " when a strong , active , and enterprising people are destined to fill this spacious void . " Governor Ramsey remarks , " From what I have seen of the land in that direction , and from what I learned respecting its capacity , and making every allowance for its climate , and for its extraordinary fertility also , I hesitate not to ascribe to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saskatchewan river , an agricultural value superior naturally to the fields of our New England in their primitive condition ; and though lack of timber might be an objection to some portions of the Saskatchewan territory , yet it has mineral coal in abundance , which may be easily mined to supply fuel for a population of the densest character ; " and he , too , predicts that " the advancing tide of farmers seeking homes will swell resistless over the border upon these northern plains , " within this generation . The old British Lion should therefore keep wide awake along the line ! // This magnificient area , drained by the waters which flow into Lake Winnipeg and which flow from it , through the Nelson river , into hudson 's Bay , forms a grand division of the continent of five hundred thousand square miles , sufficient for ten of our first class states . The head of steam navigation of the Saskatchewan river is within two hundred miles of Thompson river , a branch of Frazer river , in the new gold regions . Should the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the course of travel would lead directly to the Kootonais Pass , in latitude 500 , which is described as the most favorable pass in the Rocky Mountains . Thus is there opened to the enterprise of the present , this opulent inland territory , with navigable waters of more than two thousand and five hundred miles in length . Over the mountains are the mines , the richest of which are nearest to the mountains . Between these and the Pacific is a region of three hundred thousand square miles , whose climate is likened to that of France , whose agricultural resources are superior , and whose gold fields are supposed to be capable of as large products as any on the globe . Along the northern Pacific coast are noble harbors , inviting the development of commerce and suggesting a future unlimited trade with the old lands of Eastern Asia. * Following up the Frazer river to its sources , we are but fiftyfive rods from those of Peace river , which flows to the northeast through the Rocky Mountains into Athabasca Lake . Here is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river system of its own , and with capabilities wondrously like those we have already considered . Athabasca Lake , Great Slave Lake , and Great Bear Lake , are all connected * " It is most surprising that so little is known of the great Islands and the long line of coast from Puget Sound to Sitka , ample as its resources must be even for recruiting the transient commerce of the Pacific , independent of its immense intrinsic value . To the region bordering the Northern Pacific , the finest maritime positions belong throughout its entire extent , and no part of the west of Europe exceeds it in the advantages of equable climate , fertile soil and commercial accessibility of the coast . " Blodgett 's climatology of the United States . // by large rivers , while from the middle one flows the great Mackenzie river into the Arctic Ocean . We do not propose to examine this region in detail , but only to allude to it as a field for interesting exploration . Governor Ramsey , of St. Paul , in an address befere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country in these words : " Away np on Peace river , on the extreme northern slope of the Rocky Mountains , they raise around the Hudson 's Bay posts , as Governor Colville told me , as fine barley as anywhere in the world , and yet that is in latitude sixty degrees north , or a thousand miles nearer the North Pole than we are ! " " Under date of May 10th , Sir Alexander Mackenzie mentions the exuberant verdure of the whole country , trees about to blossom and buffalo attended by their young . " The climatology of these northwestern areas is a matter of interest . We have been accustomed to project the climatic lines of the eastern seaboard directly west to the Pacific ; and because the winds , the snow-fall , the temperature of St. John , Halifax , and Montreal , are so severe , we have thought life in St. Paul , Pembina , and Victoria must be almost unendurable . The friends of the writer shivered in mid summer in the anticipation of his winter residence in Minnesota . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Paul , from a professional gentleman , inquiring in regard to the new state , in which it was assumed that it would be utterly impossible to force a passage from the east to that city , through the mountainous snow-banks which must intervene , much before the summer solstice ! At the time , Burbank 's stages were thundering regularly every day into St. Paul , with passengers only five days from New York , and all winter long there was hardly a delay of a single mail . The snow-fall of this region is far less than would be supposed , being much smaller than in the other northwestern states , and very much smaller than in the eastern states . The average depth of the entire winter precipitation , supposing the whole fall to be of snow , is , at St. Paul , two feet ; at Montreal , seven feet ; at New York , ten feet ; at Utica , nine feet ; at Worcester , twelve feet . The actual average // depth of snow on the ground in St. Paul is exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last twenty years show , amounting to but a few inches . From Central illinois to the north and northwest , the decrease in winter precipitation is so rapid as to be remarkable . At Athens , Illinois , the mean fall is , in water , 7.1 inches ; at Beloit , 6.43 inches ; at Milwaukee , 4.2 inches ; at Green Bay , 3.36 inches ; at Portage City , 2.82 inches ; and at St. Paul , only 1.92 inches. * But as it is the force of the wind which converts the snows into formidable barriers and gives edge to the cold , it is notable that , by observations made for a series of years at eleven different United States fortresses in northern states , the mean force of the wind at Fort Snelling , Minn. , for the whole term of years , is less than at any other station , and twenty-five per cent . less than the average of all stations for the whole term , and that the mean force in any year is below the average at all stations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Isothermal lines , drawn across the Continent , deflect , beyond the great lakes , rapidly toward the north , so that the shores of the Pacific have a very different temperature through the year from the shores of the Atlantic in corresponding latitudes . St. Paul has a temperature in spring equal to that of Chicago ; in summer , equal to that of Philadelphia ; in autumn , equal to that of Northern New York ; and through the whole year equal to that of Central New York . The areas , extending hundreds of miles northwest of that city , possess nearly the same temperature . Spring is ushered in at the same time from Minnesota to the Mackenzie , and the glowing summer heat gushes alike over these immense domains , teeming with prolific vegetable and animal life . Starting from Lake Superior , Mr. Blodgett remarks , that " the increase of temperature westward is quite as rapid as it is southward to New Mexico , and the Pacific borders at the fiftieth parallel are milder in winter than Santa Fe . In every condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continental mass lying westward and northwestward from Lake Superior , is far more valuable than the interior in lower latitudes , of which Salt Lake and Upper New Mexico are the prominent known districts . " On the Peace and Upper Athabasca rivers , in latitude fifty-eight , the buffalo are accustomed to winter . The surface susceptible of profitable cultivation is almost universal , in striking contrast with more southern areas , which are largely desert . These conditions of commercial and agricultural capability must attract to all this region the enterprise and labor which have heretofore been despotically excluded by that overbearing monopoly which has held it all subsidiary to its selfish interests . The barbarism of IRupert 's Land will retreat before the energetic civilization which is now crowding hard upon it . To grasp at once the full future of this New Northwest we have only to consider its analogy to the continent of Europe . It lies in the same parallels of latitude . It has a corresponding temperature . It has similar industrial and commercial capacities . It has equally superior seaports . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its nearest occident , with the placid Pacific inviting to maritime triumphs . On the east it is in close communication with the advancing enterprises of the United States and Canada . St. Paul is on the forty-fifth parallel , which runs through southern France , northern Italy , and the Crimea . The entire Russian empire is north of it and so is the whole of Germany . The commerce and power of the old world are north of the southern line of Minnesota . The Red River of the north runs across the same lines of latitude with the Rhine . Lake Winnipeg is bounded by the same lines as St. George 's channel and Holland . Athabasca Lake is lower than the Gulf of Finland . Victoria and llavre are near the same parallel . The productive plains of central Europe , which seem like vast gardens , are bounded by the same degrees of latitude with the rich plains of the Saskatchewan and the gold fields of Frazer River . The thermal lines which run through Belgium , France , and England rise to still higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Rocky Mountains . The isotheral line of our international boundary touches the Danube at Vienna and skirts the northern waters of the Black Sea . The isothermal of Vancouver is also that of the Crimea . IKiachta , Novgorod , and Leipsic , those marts for fairs and trade , may be reproduced on this western area . San Juan may become the Liverpool of the Pacific . Where the great lines of telegraph and railroad run on the eastern hemisphere they may also on the western . The policy of Russia , which is to crowd her civilization eastward , through Siberia to the Pacific , and there to build up a maratime power which shall cope with any on the world , points to grand results for these northwestern regions . Through a more rigid climate the Czar maintains a regular postal service , which unites Moscow with Irkoutsk , a distance of three thousand four hundred miles , and which is thence continued to the mouth of the Amoor . Along this continental line we learn that the telegraph is to be established ; and next a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way b maritime station of the Pacific . It is only in the natural order of things , only in the unarrested progress of settlement and enterprise , that similar endeavors should be projected here , and that similar results should be reached . The advantages of the route which we have designated in this Article for a mail service to the Pacific , are obvious . It is the shortest , the most feasible , the cheapest . It has but one objection : it is the most Northern . The distance from St. Paul to Puget Sound is eighteen hundred miles ; from St. Louis to San Francisco is twenty-eight hundred miles ; from Benicia to Rock Island by the South Pass is twenty-three hundred miles . The time for the transport of the mails by the present southern route is twenty-five days ; by this northern route eighteen days would be sufficient . More than one million two hundred thousand dollars are expended annually for mail service south of latitude forty . Not a dollar north of it . The despotism which controls our national affairs " knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of an augmenting population in the high latitudes , find no favor with a government which lusts after // Cuba and the annexation of slices of ' Mexico . The " irrepressible conflict " between freedom and slavery secures defeat for appropriations which would so decidedly benefit the free states . But our next election , seating in the chair of Washington a man of broad patriotism and securing legislative bodies which will hold to the nationality of freedom , will date a new era for our Northwest . The United States service will be naturalized on the northern boundary . The keels of mail steamers will plow through these inland waters from St. Paul to San Juan ; and good post-roads will connect them from river to river . And then population will swarm along these natural routes of trade and emigration . Here too is designated the most feasible and important route for the railroad to the Pacific . Somewhere on these northern plains , independently of ; or in connection with Great Britain , a grand continental road should be projected . Here is the shortest route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparatively little labor in grading . The slight snow-fall of winter would present small obstruction to the regular passage of trains ; and the further they moved westward the warmer would be the climate . The commerce of the world demands this route . Opposite the western terminus of our international boundary are the now opened ports of those old opulent eastern peoples who have so long been excluded from the outside barbarians , and who include nearly one-half of the population of the globe . There too is the eastern capital of IRussian art and commerce , inviting our friendly alliance . Puget Sound , a roadstead capacious enough for the ships and steamers of the merchant service and the navies of all the nations , with its six hundred miles of shore line receding around magnificent land-locked harbors , seems appointed for the commercial center and metropolis of the world . On its shores are illimitable forests of all timber for ship-building . Stretching north and south from it are the British and American territories , ri cli in gold and richer still in agricultural products and with utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are // alluring capital and enterprise to complete the connection between the oriental and occidental civilizations . The completion will be for the aggrandizement of our country . " The truth is , " says the Edinburgh reviewer , " that though the accidents of political organization have decided otherwise , the district of the Red River is , according to all geographical considerations , a part of the state of Minnesota . It is beyond all question , that the natural approach to and outlet from the best part of the Hudson 's Bay territory is through the state of Minnesota . Such commerce as the country has is destined to go to the south , and as far as its intercourse with the rest of the world is concerned , the Red River settlement is a part of the states which are watered by the Mississippi . " What trade there is has already taken this route . Every summer there can be seen in the streets of St. Paul the Red River Trains . Half-breeds , strange in garb and physiognomy , with manners and traits of barbaric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing at points the characteristics of each and of all ; horses or oxen harnessed with strips of raw-hide and looking the worse for wear ; rough carts of primitive formation , into the structure of which no iron enters , with wheels upon which there are no tires and which creak along the road with harsh discord , loaded with valuable furs , with utensils for cooking and all the materials for camping out , constitute the train . It is all under the direction of the trader or traders who thus come to the market from their successful expeditions into the hunting grounds of the rich Northwest . The half-breeds , with their teams , pass out of the city to a camping-place upon the prairie , and the trader with his traps takes his quarters at the " Fuller House . " In the winter , from the northern wilderness emerge dog-trains . A sledge consisting of a thin , slim slice of wood ten feet long and a foot and a half broad , bent up at one end like the runner of a sleigh , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tandem by raw-hide harnesses . It is loaded with furs and with supplies of pemmican , coffee , and dried meats for the hardy , semi-civilized Pembinese or Bois-brul* , // who with so scanty an outfit traverses the long distances between his home and the market . The bronzed visages of these strangers do not linger long in the city . The return journey is quickly undertaken . Citizens , attracted by curiosity , gather around the train ; the wild dogs spring to their task as though glad to turn their noses northward again ; and the bold hunter glides into the mysteries beyond the outposts of civilization . The Hudson 's Bay Company , abandoning the dangerous route into the Hudson 's Bay , through which it has been accustomed to hold communication with the outer world , and seeing nothing attractive in the old route of its ancient rival , the Northwest Company , by Lake Superior , has within the past year begun to t'orward its supplies by New York and St. Paul , up the valley of the Red River to its interior posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific , have been attended , in the towns of the upper Mississippi , with enthusiasm . Expeditions , well-equipped , have , during the past summer , gone through this whole region , to open up more thoroughly its capabilities and to test by experiment its feasibility . Two steamers , the " Freighter " and the " Jeannette Roberts , " moved up the Minnesota river during the high stage of water in the spring , for the sake of passing across from Big Stone Lake to Lake Traverse , and so of entering upon the navigation of the northern inland waters . Another steamer , the " Anson Northrup , " was taken apart in the winter and drawn on sleds from Crow Wing on the Mississippi to Brecken ridge on the Red River , where it was rebuilt ; and this summer it has actually begun the navigation by *teamn of the Red River of the North . So private enterprise , unaided by govern mental patronage , is gathering the laurels , and , we trust , profits also , on this realm of promise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
