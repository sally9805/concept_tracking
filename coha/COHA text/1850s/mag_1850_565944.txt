txt ART . VII. - BARTOL 'S DISCOURSES . Discourses on the Christian *S1pirit and Life . By C. A. BARTOL , Junior Minister of the West Church , Boston . Second edition , revised , with an Introduction . Boston : Win . Crosby , and H. P. Nichols , 111 Washington street . 1850 . THE author of these discourses is-as most of our readers know-generally called a preacher of Unitarian Christianity . So far as any doctrinal opinions are advanced in this book , they are not however those which distinguish the old or the new school of Unitarian Theology . Mr. Bartol , it is true , in common with // most liberal divines , now and then explicitly rejects a doctrine which we hold to be essential to the integrity and life of Christianity . The ways in which he disposes of it are also very common with liberal theologians , and these are , nakedly to assert , either that it can not be taught in the Scriptures , or that it is a part of Calvinism , or that it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending it . On the other hand , it would be easy to shoxv , that more than one of the truths which in its dogmatic form the author most dogmatically rejects , is in fact implied , expanded , and illustrated in some of the most thrilling and powerful passages of this interesting volume . It would be easy to demonstrate , that the author is indebted to the " Calvinism " which he so easily puts aside , for the best parts of his book . We do not propose to discuss the theology of these discourses . Indeed they were not designed to defend or inculcate any scheme of doctrinal truth . They are what they purport to be , literally " dis6ourses of the Christian spirit and life . " When a second edition was called for , and the author found that the volume had attracted some attention beyond the circle of his friends , he prefixed a somewhat elaborate introduction-as " a larger expression of his faith . " In this introduction , he does not state or defend his views of Christian theology so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believers . Rather does he vindicate Christianity itself from that subtle but pervading skepticism in respect to its necessity , its permanence , its historic verity , and its spiritual power , which he encounters in the circles for which he writes . This skepticism we believe , is not wanting in many other circles , which are less bold and honest in their avowals of the distrust which they actually feel . This introduction , as an argument designed for these ends , and addressed to the men for whom it was written , is an argument of great interest and power . We pity the man who is not touched by its earnestness , charmed by its beauty , and moved by its eloquence . We do not sympathize with the theologian , who can not appreciate the value of such an argument , proceeding from such a source , and adapted to such a circle of readers ,  --  because it does not assert the whole truth , or because it may imply or even positively affirm some serious error . We quote the following passages " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander off on the adventure of skepticism and self-sufficiency , they will be likely , nay , how often , by their own spiritual necessities , have time strongest of ' themim been constrained to return . Christianity , many-si ( led , many-handed , stretching out far her guards au ( l co-workers , has encompassed , caught and rescued theum chanwi , mo their infidelity at one human presentation of her into faith , as she beams upon them in another . She has , indeed , other apologists than those who have written and spoken eloquently in her behalf . Sickness , death , sorrow , sin , and remorse , if other witnesses can be resisted , are her sad , yet majestic advocates // and defenders . Our weakness , our pain , our anguish , press upon us the indispensableness to our comfort and peace of knowing if we may , as in Jesus we may ,  --  where , in this mysterious , surrounding immensity of existence , we are . " - pp. 6 , 7 . " But I speak to the consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of my own , in saying that this very revelation , so clear , deep , and vast of duty , only puts us the more sensibly into the condition of sinners . The breadth of the commandment is our conviction . The law comes , sin revives , and we die . A dull savage may he a much lower character , than a believino* Christian . But he has nothing like the sense of sin that the Christian has . The pure perfection , that is the Christian 's aim , glares dreadfully at transgressions and short-comings , which the savage , composedly and without remorse , outdoes in the evil purposes and delinquencies of every day . Conscience is very much a creation of Christianity ; and sin , too , or the knowledge of sin is its creation . How live and tender this faith makes the soul ! A stain is a wound ,  --  forgetfulness is fault , and the fear to have offended , remorse . The hands that seemed to be clean , are , in its light , spotted with iniquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the invisible ink of life 's secret unfairness and silent meanness , starts out , black and legible in its fire , and actions that passed by as venial or customary , exciting no compunction in ourselves , and the subject , perhaps , of no accusation from others , rise up from the dust into mountains to fall upon us and rocks to cover us ! " - p. 11. * * " He Jesus is not , in the phrase of the day , a representative man , ' but representative of deity . The world recedes not from , but approaches him . He seems in the future , not in the past . He transcends all our transcendentalism . What vast changes in 1800 years have come over the scene , but he is fresh as the morning ! The book published yesterday has nothing of beauty or originality to match the newness arid force of his old instructions . There is no fault to scale off from his divine form , no glory of wisdom to supply to his person . Sap and weather-stain have crumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged olive beneath which he prayed or wept is in its grave , but his religion is yet in the youth of its triumphs . " - p. 20 . " Human invention has done wonders since the angels ' song over the manger in Bethlehem . It has travelled over and into the earth , dived through the sky , weighed and measured planets and their central orb , explored nature and transformed it . The magnet , the leaden type , the bubble of steam , the electric spark and chemical force , wielded in man 's fingers , have almost turned the world into another sphere . Rocks and sunbeams are taxed for our benefit and enjoyment . Ancient kings lacked the advantages of the modern poor . We have travelled far , but not from the cradle and the cross of Christ . We have distanced Judea , but not Jesus . With the marvelous fulfillment of the primal decree , to subdue the earth and have dominion over it , ' the need of his influence has but increased . England and America , as yell as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inward hunger and thirst , for which all human labor , riches , refinement and advancement can not provide . The original prediction , then , that of Christ 's kingdom there should be no end , has not yet failed . He is a king , though Roman Cmsars and proconsuls of Galilee are dead . " - pp. 21 , 22 . " Christ answers its cry . Here lies his power and the foundation of his kingdom . He has distinctly followed the way from God to man , and back from earth to heaven , crossing and recrossing , to show that we , timid and weak , can move after . He has lain down in a tomb , measured it with his own body , and returned in the figure of a definite existence to prove its dimensions unequal to our life . He has given ideas of God , heaven , and man 's relation to God and immortality ,  --  before which the host of heathen deities flee from their Olympus , and the fables of Elysium and Tartarns become trifling stories . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every word he says bursts with meaning . Wonderful how a few sentences about the Father , his Holy // Spirit , Comforter , the many mansions of his house , the angels of little children beholding his face , and the succeeding of more spiritual relations to these bonds of flesh and blood , the ties of kindred and marriage , - sentences spoken incidentally , for a purpose of correction or consolation ,  --  should furnish symbols and pictures of the heavenly world , which no other delineations can obscure or rival , which , so far from growing dim , make our hearts at every perusal stand still in an awe of delight , and all additions to which , though made by the genius of a Swedenborg , of a spiritual mystic . or metaphysical philosopher , are like modern daubs on an ancient master-piece. " - pp. 23 , 24 . We have given these extracts as good examples of the author 's style of thinking and writing . We have made them foranother reason . In reading this volume , the questions have again and again been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpretending discourses ? What is the secret of their power to interest and impress ? We propose very briefly to answer our own inquiries  --  and believe that in so doing , we shall perform a more useful service , than if we take occasion to expose or confute the anthor 's theological errors . The questions proposed are of the highest practical importance and hold a most intimate relation to the religions teaching of the times . The amount of preaching and writing on religious topics is enormous in ( juantity . Any course of thought which may tend to improve its quality , ought not to be deemed out of place . We make the remarks which follow , in connection with this volume , because they have been suggested by its peculiar excellencies . We do not intend that the writer is above criticism nor that his excellencies are accompanied by no defects in thought and expression . On these , however , our limits forbid us to dwell  --  and the consideration of them , is not necessary to our present purpose . One of the striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is everywhere visible . What artists call " ease of handling " seems to characterize these productions , and it lends to them a peculiar charm . It would seem that this grace is preeminently suited to every kind of religious discourse . When a man speaks to his fellow man on themes of such thrilling interest as well as of such transcendent importance , then if ever ought he to assume the air , if he has not really the feelings , of one so interested in the theme and so intent upon interesting others , that he thinks his own thoughts , and communicates them in his own way . And yet we believe that no class of writings are more liable to the charge of stiffness , mannerism and artificialnessthan are the sermons , devotional treatises , tracts and exhortations of which such immense masses are daily spoken , written and printed . One reason for this , may be the timidity with which the novice in speaking or writing , defers to the style of expression which he finds adopted by his elders in the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we notice in different // parts of our own country and even in different churches and regions of New England , that a different religious dialect , is used in prayer , in exhortation , in sermons and in newspapers . This dialect is transmitted from one generation to another , and to each succeeding generation is likely to be less significant and less natural , than to the one which has gone before it . This dialect does much to give the impression of dullness and monotony to all sorts of religious performances , especially when the freshness of religious feeling declines . Even when there is greater life and sincerity , the preacher or writer is apt to forget that the old phrases and expressions , which are luminous and vivid to him because they reflect the light that shines from his own " clear breast , " may yet to other minds be dead and unmeaning from having been so often sounded in their ears , and invested with the lifeless if not repulsive associations , gathered from a careless childhood or a worldly and undevout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phraseology , is the importance which is justly attached to fixed terms in theology and to a precise definition of these terms . No man can reason without definitions , no man can define without recognizing precise and sharply-cut distinctions between terms , and no man can recognize such distinctions without petrifying many words , into the statue-like stiffness of an artificial technology . For a similar reason , it is desirable to have a fixed terminology to stand for the varied feelings which are natural to the devout Christian . Those who have sought to banish such terms for the doctrines , duties and emotions of the Christian life , through fear of cant expressions , have generally ended , by adopting a cant of their own , which sometimes more resembles the cant of the infidel and the scorner than that of the believer . It should ever be remembered however by the religious teacherand we use the term in its widest sense , including every one who gives expression to religions thought and feeling for the purpose of affecting others ,  --  that the words and phrases which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are utterly meaningless to those for whose benefit they are used . He may easily forget that he has grown into their use , and while a long course of reflection and practice has made them the expression of himself , to others they may be as dead and thorny as are the technical terms of an art most remote from common use . When he speaks for such , let him arouse himself to the effort of using the dialect of men and not of religionists , let him use the terms common , and descend to the natural language and familiar level of our common humanity . Another reason for the fault which we notice , is the strong preference on the part of many religious men and even of reli // gious teachers , for one stiff phraseology as the expression of doctrine and feeling . They say and sometimes they feet that their " prayers are hindered " because they miss the old phrases and forms of expression . Some very good people , and some who are only goodish , are at once thrown into active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preacher , who does not salute their ears with the same succession of articulate sounds to which their ears have been mechanically trained for scores of years . Some very honest ministers , and more whose zeal for orthodoxy is exhausted in suspecting the orthodoxy of others , will shake their heads at the young preacher who will not sell his soul to a slavish repetition of the technical terms which they adopt , but who chooses to express his doctrines in language that common men can understand and feel . It *ot unfrequently requires some independence , if not some conscience , to enable a man to follow his own better judgment and to secure to himself a high power of influencing others , as well as the comfort of using a natural and easy phraseology . That it is the serious duty of every man to strive after such naturalness , no one can doubt , who has listened to the superior pathos and religious power which have floxved from the unstudied expressions of some earnest prayer , when it breaks in upon the well sounding monotony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always secured to that preacher who speaks with appropriate gravity indeed , but yet as a man speaks to his fellow-man . The quality of freshness of thought and illustration , is also very apparent in these discourses , and imparts to them their highest charm and peculiar power . This quality may seem very nearly allied to the one which we have named . The two are indeed very closely akin . They differ only in this , that while one may be natural without freshness-it is impossible to have freshness without being natural . To be natural a man need only have a just taste and an honest and earnest mind . To be fresh in the highest sense of the word , a man must attain some of the qualities which we call genius . And yet in one sense of the word it *s the duty of every man to be a genius , when he writes or speaks on the subject of religion . Not only is he bound to be natural in his manner and his modes of expression , but he is bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings with that degree of freshness , be it greater or less , which every man 's thoughts and feelings attain so far as they are his own . It is no paradox to say , that every man is bound to have freshness of thought and feeling on religion , because it is certainly true that every man is bound to make religion a matter practical to himself , that is , to apply its truth to his own sins , his own sorrows and his own fears . Just in proportion as he does this , just in that proportion has he the material which he may communicate with greater or // less force and facility according as he has attained the power to impart what he himself has known and felt . We observe in these discourses both these constituents of true excellence . Mr. Bartol seems to ns not only to say what he believes , but also what he has learned to believe by using the truth for his own practical necessities . There are in these discourses tokens not a few , that the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of which he has come to declare what has given him peace and hope . He speaks what he thinks , and speaking what he thinks in the way in which he has learned to believe it , he speaks his own heart to the hearts of others . Without doubt it is the case , that the peculiar condition of the liberal preachers and of their hearers in Boston , has forced upon him this high advantage . The preacher rejecting every form of traditional orthodoxy aed knowing that his hearers own no authority except argument , and perhaps call in question the historic truth of the gospel itself , knowing too that they scrutinize with cold and critical judgment every utterance that he makes ,  --  is impelled by the strongest of necessities , to say only what he believes and to say it in a form which best expresses and defends that belief . Too often has it happened , we believe too generally ; that both preachers and hearers have contented themselves with far too limited a view of their own wants and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so by the exclusion of not believing this or that truth lest they should be imposed upon , they have disbelieved the very vital and essential parts of Christianity . But when , as seems now to be the case , such a community is animated with the spirit of earnest inquiry , when casting aside the traditions of its elders , it believes in a good sense , " that God has yet more truth which may break forth from his holy word , " then is it in the highest degree favorable to the higher and best kinds of religious teaching . The preacher , supposing him to be in earnest to seek the truth for the double purpose of satisfying himself and his hearers , will come up to that best standard of what good preaching is , which is expressed in the words " we believe and therefore speak ; " and the hearers will , by their interested attention and strong emotion , furnish to him the noblest stimulus . The true simplicity of genius , that highest attainment to utter great thoughts from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the genteel claptrap , the gaudy rhetoric , and the mouthing declamation , which so often rule in pulpits of loftier claims , to the disgust of men of sense , to the grief of the earnest Christian , and often to the degradation of the gospel that is defiled and depressed by the auctioneering tricks of the popular preacher . We repeat the remark which we have already made , that the charm of these discourses results from the natural expression which the author gives to that religious truth which he has learned to apply to himself . Add to this the fact , that a mind of delicate struc // hire has been formed by generous culture , and enriched by reading and society , and above all , has learned the true force and preeminent power of simplicity , and we have the secrets of his power . We could desire that these excellencies should be seen more frequently in the many books and the much preaching , which exert so powerful an influence in training the tastes and in forming the characters of the present generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aid and add their charm to the defense and enforcement of what we hold to be a more perfect Christianity , than that of these discourses . We have no right to expect , that the same natural gifts and the same refinement of culture will be brought by every one to this high service . But we do contend , that the standard of true excellence in religious teaching should be most rigidly applied , and that every deviation should be visited with severe censure . If this can not be done by the popular taste , which is liable to be dazzled by the tawdry and to despise the simple , there ought to be but one judgment expressed by the entire profession of religious teachers and writers . We believe that there is no kind of production in which the proportion of the inferior to the excellent , is so great as in that of religious teachings . One cause is the natural shrinking from finding fault with any man of good intentions . There are the tendencies which we have specified against fresh thoughts in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses and publishing societies , who seem often to estimate their power and usefulness by the quantity rather than by the quality of the matter which they circulate ; and there are other causes which we need not specify . The demand , too , is pressing if it is not loud , for a preaching and writing which shall excite greater interest and give better satisfaction . Hence the frequent call for preachers and writers of greater originality , attractiveness , &amp;c . Alas , we fear that those who make this demand , have too generally a depraved judgment of what good preaching and writing are , and that many who attempt to satisfy the demand , do it in ways which render this taste still more depraved . Our limits will allow us to glance at a few only of the various methods which are adopted to meet this demand , and to give variety and interest to the religious teaching of the times . The ingenious philosopher , hopes to give life to the common places of religious truth , by recasting them in a new logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metaphysical ingenuity is his study , and he hopes by the play of the various lights that sparkle from the corners of his many-angled system , to secure life and interest in his instructions . Order and development , we acknowledge to he prime essentials . They are even indispensable to the ease and simplicity of communicating // and receiving truth of any kind . But order and deduction alone , never can attract or sustain a fresh and new interest in any relig* ions teacher or writer . There must be principles from which to begin , on which the mind supports itself as on an unshaken rock , and from which it borrows strength , while it rests upon them . There must be arguments to be arranged , that arrest the attention and hold the thoughts , or the mere development however ingenious , becomes no better than a striking combination of algebraic symbols . Lights that are beautiful and attractive do indeed play from the brilliant surfaces and the sparkling angles of the many-faced diamond , but let the dead and earthy clay , be moulded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracts . The metaphysician who depends for the life and power of his teaching upon the form only and not the matter of his thoughts , becomes the poorest retailer of common-places , and sinks below the windy though earnest declaimer , and the cold but polished essayist . He does not comply with the indispensable condition of originality on which we have insisted . He has not baptized the truth with that fresh and original interest with which it is then invested when it becomes his truth as distinguished from that of every other man - that is , when it is clothed with those varied associations , with which each man believes and loves the truth for himself . Not having received this human interest from the action of the mind that utters it , it can have little freshness and novelty for those who hear . As to that added interest which comes from earnest feeling , he does not even propose to secure it , he fails of it altogether . Greatly as we esteem a just philosophy as the basis of all successful teaching , and important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method to be to natural communication , we insist as strongly , that a philosophy that lends freshness to preaching must be a philosophical handling of subjects about which human beings are supposed to care , and that a method of nothing and for nothing , except of and for itself , is likely to attract the attention of few except its author . The elegant and mellifluous utterer of common-places , next presents himself . He makes no pretensions to originality , the thought of it startles him as profane . rp he truths of religion are in his view so familiar , that any attempt to give to them novelty must be a failure , if the attempt is not to be counted an affront to heaven . All that he hopes to accomplish is to clothe them in a clear style and to express them in well balanced phraseology . For a while the style attracts by its clearness . The well turned sentences tinkle pleasantly on the ear . But by-and-by , the reader and hearer tire of the pleasant monotony , and the tinkle lulls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of his own , whether there can be in his soul the earnestness that becomes a living man . // The rhetorician next appears . He believes in variety , in interest , tin beauty and power , and strives most faithfully to give a peculiar interest and life to the truth as coming from himself . But his ideal is false , especially false , strikingly inappropriate , as an ideal for religious teaching . No beauty of illustration , no felicity of expression , no prettiness of conceits , no splendor of diction , piled upon the exterior of the theme , can produce any effect that is worthy of a religious teacher , nay , the effect is one which as a man he should despise , and which as a Christian teacher , he should abhor . An audience listening in rapt attention , and so engrossed with the theme skillfully and earnestly enforced by a teacher , as to go away thinking of the truth rather than of the eloquence of the man who has said it , is the highest glory of the preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim and his delight . But an audience admiring the flights of an exaggerated and hollow rhetoric , or pleased by the conceits of a fopling litterateur , or entranced by the soaring of a labored declamation , and going away loud in their praises of the eloquence of the preacher , ought to be judged each one of them as uttering the severest condemnation on the teaching and the man who gives it . Empty is the head and the heart of the man who will sell himself in the name of Christ for such praises , or who proposes to himself such an ideal . Empty are the hearts and heads of the people who think such kind of exhibitions constitute preaching the gospel , or who with such an interpretation of the word popular , seek for such a popular preacher to fill their pews . Of all the various classes of rhetoricians , as distinguished from the truly eloquent , whether in the pulpit or by the press , the windy and wordy variety is the most offensive . It moves our pity and disgust . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary inflation which must precede the giving forth of what he esteems to be eloquence . We have sincere compassion for the galvanic excitements , by which the reluctant spirit forces itself to produce its pompous nothings . We are offended even to disgust , at the taste which in full view of the severe examples of a manly eloquence with which the records of the pulpits abound , can be so ignorant as to suppose such empty in- anities to be eloquence at all , or having the least knowledge of any thing better , can deliberately commit intellectual and moral suicide , to please the ear of the multitude or to gain the fame of a popular writer or preacher . And yet the triumph of windiness seems to be in the ascendant . Sermons , platform speeches , reviews , anniversary orations , books devotional and even theological , on both sides the water , seem to be constructed on the principle that windiness and wordiness constitute eloquence , or if eloquence of a certain kind can be attained from the old fashioned materials of fresh thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest order , fit for this glorious nineteenth century of religious wonders , can only be attained by a hail storm of words with much wind . Notwithstanding all this we remain stedfast in the assurance that " the Lord is not in the wind . " We are ashamed that a taste so corrupt should so far prevail in our religious communities , and that it should be fostered by so many influences from the pulpit and the religious press . We are well aware , that there are many causes of the prevalence of this sun-flower style of eloquence , and that these causes operate with special energy in the religious world . There are many from whose better judgment we should expect the sternest rebuke to these ridiculous exhibitions , who not only excuse them in others , but enact them themselves . They reason thus ,  --  whatever attracts attention and excites interest on a subject to which men are so indifferent or so disinclined , as that of religion , must of necessity be praiseworthy ,  --  and so the hearer forces himself to endure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the writer or teacher stoops to the self-degradation , at first from the sense of duty , and in it at last he learns to delight , from the golden rewards which it ensures . But let no man be thus imposed on , especially let no young man think that to be a popular and useful religions writer or speaker , nay , one who is eloquent and powerful , he must do violence to his good sense or his good feelings . It will end in the destruction of that which is the best part of any man , that delicacy of moral taste , which has a near alliance to delicacy of conscience ; arid a surrendering of self-respect and of natural truthflilness which itself speaks a sterner and louder reproach against the Christian profession , than the most stirring sermons that he can write or speak , can speak in its favor . It is indeed necessary , that the man who writes for the people should cherish a strong sympathy with men as they are . He should be something else than a scholastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste . He must himself be familiar with living men , and know how they think and reason and feel , and to the thoughts and feelings which rise and fafl in their minds , must adapt the expression of his own . But the true secret , nay , the only secret of power over others is , as we have contended , to give variety and freshness to the truths which you declare , by living upon them yourself . Especially is this the case with religious truth . Of itself and as the con*imon stock of a Christian community , it is more hackneyed and common-place , than any other theme . And yet if applied by a man to hirnselg it is invested with an interest to him , that transcends the interest of all other themes united . If bathed in his own feelings and associated with his own best and strongest emotions , it is clothed with freshness brighter and more cheering than that of the morning dew . // The man who finds here the secret of his power and interest , can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made his own , in the highest sense in which it can be , so will the way of communicating it be his , and that of no one else , and all the miserable tricks of a factitious and imitative rhetoric , and the gaudy ornaments of " fine writing " will be seen to be but poor and stale in the comparison . If such were the maxims with which every young preacher should set off in his course , if he should esteem this honesty in his own thoughts , to be no less sacred and binding , than the vulgar honesty of commercial intercourse , the clerical profession would be redeemed somewhat from the degradation to which it is tending . A higher order of minds would be attracted by its duties who are now repelled from it by the offense which it involves to their good sense and good judgment , and the religious public would esteem the office of a religious teacher to be higher and better than that of one " who can play well on an instrument .
