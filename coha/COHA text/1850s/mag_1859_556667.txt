ART . IX . - Jilemoir of Rev. David Tappan Stoddard , Missionary to the Nestorians . By JOSEPH P. THOMPSON , D. ID. , Pastor of the Broadway Tabernacle Church . New York : Sheldon , Blakeman , &amp; Co. 1858. l2mo. pp. 422 . WE doubt whether there are anywhere else so patent grounds for an honest ancestral pride as in New England , and among the scions of the Puritan stock . Where power , rank , or entailed and inalienable wealth is transmitted with the name , a cause of malign agency intervenes to impair the heritage of a father 's virtues ; and the novus homo , th efirstof his race , the founder of his family , is likely to have few equals among those who succeed to his honors . The expectation from early childhood of office , title , or estate to accrue independently of meritorious efforts to win or to keep it , while it may sometimes stimulate a generous ambition , much oftener relaxes the energy of mind , and lowers the tone of character . Thus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find some whose genius and virtue have reflected lustre upon the family name , they are interspersed at rare intervals among those to whom the name alone gave lustre . On the other hand , of the fathers of New England there were not a few whose posterity , in each of the seven or more generations that have intervened , have done ample honor to their progenitors . There are among the earliest names on our records those which have never failed to be borne by men of high eminence in church or state , of commanding influence , of impregnable uprightness , of venerable sanctity . Thus continuous threads of holy light mark in our annals the lines of descent from those men of whom the world was not worthy . We therefore admire the sound philosophy which has led Dr. Thompson to devote a distinct chapter of his Life of Stoddard to " A Godly Ancestry . " We are prepared to believe all that is good of one in whom the Stoddard and the Tappan lineage unite ; and , after reading that chapter , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corollaries from a demonstrated proposition in mathematics . The richness of these parent stocks has been reinforced at every stage of their // history , by intermarriage with families of similar claims to respect and reverence . Thus Anthony Stoddard , the first of the name in New England , a man of no small mark in his day , and for more than twenty years a representative of Boston in the General Court , married a niece of Governor Winthrop , of Massachusetts . Their son , Rev. Solomon Stoddard , of Northampton , whose personal presence was so majestic as to lead the Indians to suppose him the " Englishman 's God , " and whose influence was so great that a sect of some vitality took its name from him , married a daughter of Rev. John Warham , an eminent divin&amp; from Exeter , England , who became the first pastor of the church in Windsor , Connecticut . The wife of their son , Colonel John Stoddard , who had no superior , perhaps no equal , in the Province , as to weight of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was descended from a sister of Thomas Hooker , the first minister of Cambridge , and chief founder of Connecticut . We might follow with similar results the alliances of David Tappan Stoddard 's maternal ancestry , and might trace the confluence in him of a singularly large proportion of the best blood of the most genuine aristocracy the world has yet seen . David was born in Northampton , December 2 , 1818 . His boyhood was distinguished equally for amiable and for energetic traits of character . He was prepared for college at the Round Hill School , then under the supervision of Professor Cogswell , now of the Astor Library , George Bancroft , and his own brother , Solomon Stoddard , afterward Professor of Latin in Middlebury College , and well known as one of the authors of the Latin Grammar which has superseded almost all others in our seminaries of learning . In the autumn of 1834 he entered the Sophomore Class of Williams College , and after remaining there one year entered as Sophomore at Yale College . Piously educated , and surrounded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best examples , he had been no stranger to profoundly serious impressions ; but they were transient , and alternated with seasons of indifference , until the spring of 1836 , when , during a period of unusual religious interest in the College , and ( as we gather from the modest narrative ) through the agency of the classvoL . Lxxxviii. - NO. 182. 20 // mate who has become his biographer , he was led into the fold of the Redeemer , and yielded himself up in penitence and faith to the love and service of God . The gospel ministry , to which a mother 's prayers had destined him from infancy , was now his choice and goal , and he thus early yearned to devote himself to some department of the field of foreign missions , yet without settled purpose or definite aim . Among the cob lege stndies , he made unusual proficiency in mathematics , astronomy , and the natural sciences , in which , before the close of his Junior year , he had acquired so solid a reputation , that he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exploring Expedition then about to sail for the South Pacific . A letter to one of his brothers expresses his decision on this offer , and his reasons for it , in terms so strongly indicative of Christian manliness , and so vividly characteristic as viewed in connection with his subsequent life , that we can not forbear quoting the following paragraph . " A subject has recently been brought before my mind , for consideration , in regard to which I regretted that I could not have your advice . Application was made to me by government on the recommendation of one of our Professors , to go out to the Southern Sea , on the Exploring Expedition now fitting out . The office proffered was that of Secretary , on board one of the vessels , and the duties of that office something of the following nature : to keep the course and distance of the ship , including occasional astronomical observations , - to write a sub-journal of the expedition , which would be of considerable importance , as this vessel is to do most of the exploring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty dollars per annum , with an outfit of three or four hundred . It was considered here a very advantageous situation for a young man , and my friends , many of them , advised my acceptance . I even went so far as to write home in favor of the plan , thinking that it might make me more robust , and better fitted , pkysically , to perform the duties of life on my return . I was assured that I could procure without difficulty a degree on my return , and receive an education as good as by a regular course . But serious reflection , and , I trust , guidance from on high , dissipated the illusion which deceived me , and set before me arguments too great to be surmounted for declining the enterprise . I could not go as a Christian ; for little opportunity would be afforded me of doing good , and such a voyage migkt have a very unhappy effect on my Christian character . I could not go as a man of // the world ; for I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever bound to serve . Were I to look only at time , and ask myself what course would be likely to advance me in worldly science , I might accept the offer . I could not , however , forget the interests of eternity and the life which I had chosen , or rather I hope I may say , the life to which I have been chosen , that of an ambassador of Jesus Christ . Parents and the family at home disapprove of the idea no less than myself ; and I presume you will coincide with us all in opinion . " - p. 63 . This noble act of self-denial proved no check upon Mr. Stoddard 's pursuit of science . Possessed of an unusual degree of mechanical skill , he constructed a telescope of considerable magnifying power , and made for himself an independent series of astronomical observations . Though this course of study was followed with some earnest self-questioning as to its bearing on the profession of his choice , he after ward had reason to believe that he pursued it under Providential guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were turned to uses of essential importance in his missionary career . He was graduated with honor , and almost immediately entered on the office of Tutor in Marshall College , Pennsylvania , declining a permanent and honorable academic appointment in a Western college from the same motives which had decided him against the South Sea Expedition . In the autumn of 1839 he entered the Andover Theological Seminary , where he remained for one year , during which his class enjoyed the special instruction of Professor Stuart . In the autumn of 1840 , he accepted a tutorship in his Alma Mater , as affording him the means of self-support , and enabling him at the same time to continue his theological studies under favorable auspices . In this charge , as in his earlier tutorship , he was not only the diligent and painstaking teacher , but the religious instructor , guide , and friend of the youth committed to his oversight , and his letters betray all the tender solicitude of a Christian pastor , and emotions of the purest gladness in the Divine blessing on his labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher . In September of that year he became acquainted with Rev. Justin Perkins , D. D. , of the Nestorian mission , who had recently // returned to the United States , bringing with him the Nestonan bishop , Mar Yohannan , with the view of exciting in the churches a xvarmer interest in behalf of that ancient people and that most inviting field of evangelic labor . Dr. Perkins at once marked Mr. Stoddard as the coadjutor he desired in his great enterprise , and the young divine , after brief deliberation , deemed it his duty to accept the call , and offer himself for the work . He was ordained at New Haven in January , 1843 , and on the first day of March following he embarked at Boston for Smyrna , with his young wife , the daughter of Dr. Calvin Briggs of Marblehead , and in company with Dr. and Mrs. Perkins , and four other missionaries . The Nestorians may claim to be the oldest body of Christians now in existence . It has been contended , but with no conclusive evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hebrews . However this may be , their traditions refer the Christian discipleship of their ancestors to the Apostle Thomas , and their standard edition of the Scriptures is the Peschito , confessedly the oldest translation of the New Testament , and the earliest of the Old under Christian auspices . They derived their name as a sect from Nestorius , Bishop of Constantinople , who was excommunicated as a heretic by the Council of Ephesus , A. D. 431 . A prominent charge urged against him was his refusal to apply to the Virgin Mary the title of &amp;EOTgKO9 , Mother of God . Probably this was the ground of the other principal charge , which he perseveringly denied , of investing Christ with two persons as well as with two natures . " It is worthy of inquiry , " writes Dr. Perkins , " whether Nestorius may not haVe been far more Evangelical than his opponents , and whether his comparative purity , in the general corruption of the Church which prevailed at that period , may not have been the principal cause of the rigor with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American mission , the Nestorians had long been destitute of the doctrines and the attributes of spiritual Christianity ; but at the same time their creed contained a smaller admixture of obnoxious elements than that of any other non-Protestant church . They abhorred image-worship , auricular confession , and the doctrine of Purgatory , and maintained the supreme // and infallible authority of the Scriptures . They were simple in their manners and habits , comparatively pure in their morals , kindly disposed toward other sects , and desirous of instruction and improvement . It was believed that such a people offered a peculiarly propitious soil for a higher Christian culture , especially as the existing ecclesiastical organization opposed no obstacles to that endeavor , and the more intelligent of the clergy were ready at once to participate in its benefits , and to aid in its extension . The generous purpose was conceived of leaving the ancient Church unchanged in its external arrangements and order by foreign interference , while there should be breathed into it anew the long-lost religious life , which in its primitive days had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might thus be established a centre for the most extended missionary operations in the East , and not only so , but that this very people might furnish at once faithful and efficient agents in the diffusion of the Gospel , and patent proof of its divinity and power in their example as a Christian community . The larger portion of the Nestorians inhabit the wildest regions of the Koordish mountains . These are nomadic in their mode of living , poor , subject to the depredations of their Koordish neighbors , and debarred alike from the functions and the privileges of civilized humanity . About one fourth of this people dwell in the city and on the plain of Oroomiah , where the necessaries of life are easily procured , and their condition is , on the whole , favored and happy , though not without occasional instances of extortion and oppression by their Mohammedan masters . The entire Nestoria n population does not exceed one hundred and forty thousand . Their vernacular language is the ancient Syriac , modified by time and the attrition of other tongues , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - is believed to be the same with that currently spoken in Ju&amp;ea at the Christian era , and hallowed by the lips of the Divine Teacher . We can easily conceive of the intense enthusiasm with which a man of Mr. Stoddard 's finely-toned sympathies and generous culture entered on the service of a people so rich in memories of early time , and in hopeful tokens of restoration 20* // to primitive simplicity and piety . On the outward passage , the new missionaries were engaged in the daily study of the language of the Nestorians , under the tuition of Dr. Perkins . Their passage was rough , but short . From Smyrna they made the circuit of various missionary stations in Turkey , before commencing their long overland journey from Trebizond , " across the mountains of Armenia and the plains of Persia , " to Oroomiab . This city had been the first permanent site of the mission ; but the intensity of its summer heat compelled the members of the mission to establish a second station on higher ground . Accordingly , some two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared upon Mount Seir , and the necessary buildings constructed . The following account of the mountain and the plain is from a letter of Mr. Stoddard to Professor Olmsted . " The village of Seir is in the province of Oroomiab , in Northern Persia , in latitude 370 28 ' 18 " north , and in approximate longitude 450 east from Greenwich . We are about forty miles from the boundary of Turkey , and one hundred and fifty from that of Russia . The village is on the grassy slope of the mountain , which rises 2,834 feet above the neighboring city of Oroomiab , and 7,334 above the ocean . The side of the mountain on which we live faces the northeast , and is consequently somewhat bleak in winter . The snow also lies upon it in the spring long after it has disappeared from the southwestern side . " From the village of Seir we look down on the very beautiful and extensive plain of Oroomiab , forty miles in length , and from twelve to twenty miles in breadth , which possesses a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred villages . The city of Oroomiab , the ancient Thebarma , situated near the centre of the plain , as well as many of the villages , is surrounded by innumerable gardens and orchards , and rows of poplars , willows , and sycamores , which make large portions of the plain resemble a continued forest . The mountains of Koordistan encircle the plain on three sides , while to the east lies the lake of Oroomiab , studded with islands , and reflecting the pure azure of an Italian sky . " This plain is watcred by three rivers of moderate size , which come down from the Koordish mountains , and are distributed by a network of small canals and water-courses over its whole surface . Without artificial irrigation , but few crops can be brought to maturity , although here and there wheat-fields are cultivated on the slopes of the neighbor. // ing mountains , which are wholly dependent on the rains of the spring and early summer , and sometimes yield a tolerable harvest . " The principal productions of the plain of Oroomiab , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably above that of Seir , are wheat , barley , corn , millet , flax , tobacco , rice , cotton , castoroil , apples , pears , plums , grapes ( which are cultivated in immense vineyards ) , cherries , apricots , nectarines , peaches , melons , pomegranates , almonds , and the jujube . The fig , with care , may be also cultivated , but is often destroyed by the cold of winter . " The lake of Oroomiab , the ancient Spautes , is about ninety miles long by thirty broad . Its elevation above the ocean is 4,100 feet . Its water has been analyzed by President Hitchcock ; its specific gravity is 1.1*i5 . The lake exerts , of course , a marked influence on the climate of this region , and produces a regular land and sea breeze in the summer months . During the day a light wind blows from the lake , and during the night a fresher wind from the lofty mountains of Koordistan , which rise , , some forty miles west of the lake , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand feet above the ocean , and generally retain on their summits , even in summer , deep masses of snow . The amount of watery vapor is thus probably much greater in Oroomiah than in many parts of Persia , which present almost the barrenness of the Arabian deserts . " It should be mentioned in this connection , that all the mountains of Northern Persia are destitute of trees , and many of them rise to a great height , in naked , rocky summits . Indeed , in the valleys and on the plains it is rare to find any trees except those planted by the hand of man , and a stranger , as he looks down on the luxuriant plain of Oroomiah , can hardly be made to believe that the millions of trees before him are entirely an artificial growth . " - pp. 129 , 130 . Mr. Stoddard carried his telescope to Mount Seir , and soon found that the knowledge which he was thus enabled to lay open and make visible to the intelligent and educated Persi*ns with whom he came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity , of winning their personal respect and confidence , of impairing their faith in astrology , which in the Koran is constantly recognized as a valid science , and in various ways of insinuating the great spiritual truths of the Gospel . At the same time , for the youth under his tuition it is hardly possible to overrate the religious importance of just notions as to the physical universe , in a state of society in which every scientific error is a burrowingplace // for some inveterate superstition , and falsities about God , the soul and eternity are buttressed by falsities about material objects . The following extract from one of his letters contains one instance , among many , of the good account to which he turned the observation of the heavens . " I am more impressed - much more - with the general influence exerted by the missionaries than before I came . In all this part of Persia they are softening prejudice , inspiring respect for European manners and civilization , and thus doing much for the planting of the Gospel among these Mussulmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would feel this deeply , as I do . For example : the other day one of their great moolahs , the menajim bashee , the chief astrologer , or , if you please , the astronomer royal , ' came to see my telescope . He is a remarkably intelligent man , though he holds to the Ptolemaic system of the world . He is , however , well acquainted with our views . He went away , as many others have done , who have seen the electrical apparatus and other European inventions , saying , with a stroke of the beard , God is gre at , ' or , Truly you are the wise ones of the earth . ' I showed this man the belts and moons of Jupiter , the rings of Saturn , and one or more of his satellites , the gibbous appearance of Mars , and some of the wonders of the Milky Way . Now this is not saving a soul , and I deeply feel it ; but you will at once see that influe*ice thus gained over the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny of Persia . And if moolahs will permit us to take them by the hand and lead them in paths of science , tell me , is it unreasonable to think the time not distant when we can lead them to the Lamb of God ? 0 , I long to have my tongue untied to speak to this people in their own language the wonderful works of God . " - pp. 136 , 137 . Mr. Stoddard rapidly acquired the vernacular Syriac , and xxTithin five months from his arrival at Oroorniah was able to take a prominent part in the instruction dispensed in the missionary schools , and soon afterward to preach intelligibly to native congregations . He acquired also by degrees an avail . able knowledge of the Turkish ; while at the same time he studied the ancient Syriac , with the view of assisting Dr. Perkins in the translation of the Peschito into the vernacular dialect . His chief work was that of instruction in the schools ; but his labors as a preacher were frequent and arduous , and he often made preaching tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to his toil on the elementary // branches of education , he had the chief charge of what was virtually a theological seminary , and carried those designed to exercise the clerical office among their countrymen through an extended and thorough course of Biblical criticism and dogmatic theology . But , in whatever labors he was engaged , he never lost sight of the great end of Christian conversion and discipleship . And in this he was richly blessed . Often his days were passed , and sleepless nights employed , in personal conference with one after another of his pupils , as they were aroused to a vivid sense of their need of salvation , oppressed by the burden of conscious sin , and earnestly seeking the hope that is full of immortality . There occurred under his ministry and that of his colleagues several seasons analogous in all their most hopeful features and their most gratifying results to the revivals of religion in Protestant Christendom . The awakening voice was first heard in the schools , and thence propagated through the surrounding villages , till those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts of a remote and slowly maturing harvest , could hardly ply the sickle fast enough for the ripening sheaves . If ever man had joy which angels might envy , such is the gladness poured forth in touching eloquence by Mr. Stoddard , as he reports these seasons and numbers up these trophies of his toil in letters to his friends and the Missionary Board at home . Who can read the following narrative of what took place in the village of Geog Tapa , and doubt that the missionary enterprise is equally the sacred duty and the priceless privilege of those who know for their own hearts and lives the blessedness of Christian faith and piety ? " I have delayed thus far to speak of Geog Tapa , because the work there has been so marked and glorious as to deserve a separate consideration . The precious seed which had been sown year after year in that village , - the fact that special interest had been manifested there the previous summer , - the connection of so many ecelesiastics with us as native helpers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nearly all of whom were awakened and hopefully converted , - the frequent mention of this village in the letters of the Committee and of our private friends , showing that it was remembered at the throne of grace , - all these things naturally led us , at an early // period of the revival , to turn our eyes to Geog Tapa , and to expect there a powerful display of the grace of God . Nor were we disappointed . The visitors from that place to our seminaries were , from the first , so numerous , especially on the Sabbath ; so many of our pupils visited there in their turn ; and we have be able , by personal labors and by the aid of our most experienced native helpers , to keep the truth so constantly before the minds of the people , that the revival in Geog Tapa has been closely identified , both in its character and results , with that which we have enjoyed on our own premises . Early in February some interest was manifested in one of the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deeply moved . About a month later , when the seminaries had a vacation of ten days , I had the pleasure , with Miss Fisk , of spending some portion of it in that village . While there had been but few conversions , there was a great deal of inquiry , and our pupils expounded the Scriptures every evening in ten or twelve different places , to attentive audiences . Everything was marked by a deep stillness , which indicated to us the presence of God 's Spirit . And from that time forward converts were multiplied , and the blessed work went on with increasing power . " It would be interesting , were there time , to dwell on the particular features of the revival there , and to describe the individual cases which have , during its progress , affected us so deeply . Suffice it to say , that there are many mouths which before were full of cursing and bitterness , that are now filled with the praises of God . An entire change has taken place in the habits and manners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extent never before known . The name of reviler , or quarreller , or profane swearer , has become one of great reproach . Prayer-meetings are frequent , and attended by many who love to pray . The Sabbath is regarded as the Lord 's day , and not unblushingly profaned , as before , by secular employments . And while there are , of course , many in the village hardened to the truth , and a few who feel the present order of things to be an uncomfortable restraint , the sentiment of the village is strongly in favor of peace , sobriety , and vital religion . At a recent communion season , a time at which disorders were formerly allowed , scarcely less gross than those which disgraced the Corinthian Church , about two hundred remained after the unintelligible service in the ancient language , to celebrate the ordinance in a solemn and reverential manner . The service was conducted with prayer , singing , and other exercises , very much in imitation of our own method ; and the pious natives connected with us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most delightful occasions they had ever witnessed . IDo not such great changes , in one of the most intelligent and // prominent Nestorian villages , promise for us a brighter day than any which has yet dawned upon us ? Who , even of the most sanguine of our number , would have believed , a year ago , that in Geog Tapa two hundred persons would this summer have sat with solemnity around the table of their dying Lord , realizing , in some measure , the meaning of the ordinance ? * And whose heart does not overflow with thanksgiving and praise , when he remembers that scores of these are giving consistent and increasing evidence of piety ? I am informed within a few days , that there is not a single vineyard in the village in which there is not at least one praying laborer ; and it is well known that the men and women , most of whom can not read , go to their daily toil , singing along the way the hymns which they have learned from the children in the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among the stacks of wheat . To these places those who love to pray retire , and , closing the entrance after them with a sheaf of wheat , hold communion with God . " As it is a considerable time since I have visited Geog Tapa , I am obliged , in reporting the present state of the village , to rely mainly on others . But it seems to be a fact , that hundreds there are in the daily habit of secret prayer ; and that fifty of them , exclusive of the members of our seminaries , and our native helpers , are born into the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ . Quite a number of the hopeful converts are young men , who are very active in labors among the people , and who every Sabbath go out to all the villages around to proclaim the Gospel . " - pp. 226-229 . We are compelled to be brief , and can not pursue , as we gladly would , the detailed narrative of Mr. Stoddard 's labors . His health early became impaired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part from a diligence too seldom intermitted for relaxation and repose . After several journeys , unattended by permanent relief , the alternative seemed to be speedy dissolution or a visit to his native country . He chose the latter , as his duty to his family and the mission . With his wife , nurse , and two children , he arrived at Trebizond in the summer of 1848 . There his wife died of cholera , after an illness of a few hours , in perfect peace . The nurse soon followed her , and the invalid - not heart-broken , for his letters " All , among the Nestorians , old and young , pious and depraved , have hitherto been accustomed to partake of the sacrament , thinking it had some inherent efficacy in it , as a saving ordinance . Many now in Geog Tapa absent themselves through fear of the curse of God . " // breathe only serene submission - embarked with the sole charge of his motherless children . He remained in this country two years and a half . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endurance . While here , he was not idle . He addressed churches , public meetings , great assemblies , in behalf of the missionary cause and his beloved Nestorians . He conducted an extensive correspondence , in the same interest , with his colleagues in Persia , and in aid of his and their plans . In February , 1851 , he was married to Miss Sophia D. Hazen , and on the 4th of March following embarked with his wife and daughter , and three other missionaries , for Smyrna . On his return to the mission , Mr. Stoddard entered with new zeal on the self-denying service to which he had nearly fallen a victim . His schools , his frequent preaching , his visits from house to house among the villages , might have seemed sufficient for a constitution once so seriously impaired . But , with all his other onerous duties , he found time to prepare a Grammar of the Modern Syriac , for the use of future missionaries , which was published in the Journal of the American Oriental Society for 1855 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living authority . He was now in the full maturity of his powers , and was regarded by his associates as an eminently judicious counsellor in the many difficult practical questions constantly occurring , as to modes of usefulness , methods of propitiating or overcoming opposition , rind the increasingly complicated and perplexing relations between them and the native priesthood . He again manifested symptoms of incipient disease ; yet was permitted to enjoy several years , the least interrupted and the most prosperous of his missionary life . But a higher Wisdom ordained that his sun should go down at midday . In the autumn of 1856 the attitude of the Persian government toward the mission rendered it desirable that a deputation should visit the civic functionaries at Tabreez . Mr. Stoddard was selected for this service . The journey was performed on horseback , and he preached frequently by the way . His negotiations gave him much anxiety , and on his homeward route he was seized with premonitory symptoms of typhus fever . However , for thirteen // days after his return , he pursued his usual routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confine himself to his bed . At the end of the first fortnight , the disease seemed to be arrested ; but it soon returned , and for eighteen days he lingered on the confines of the grave . During a portion of this time , his mind was clear , and his soul sustained and gladdened by the felt presence of the Saviour , , his words were those of trust and prayer . On Thursday night , January 22 , 1857 , he was translated to the heavenly society . " Eleven years before , on that very evening , he was rejoicing over the first converts of the first revival , and pointing awakened souls to the cross of Christ ; and perhaps some of those souls were among the blood-washed throng , who waited to convey his ransomed spirit to glory . " The funeral service was in Syriac . Mar Yohannan , his devoted friend and fellow-laborer , in offering the closing prayer , was subdued by his emotion , and tears choked his utterance . The body was laid in its last restingplace , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had led to Christ . His oldest daughter , who had been united with him but a little before in the missionary church , sleeps by his side . And around his grave how precious the tribute recorded by one of his missionary brethren ! " Scarcely a day passes but some of Mr. Stoddard 's grateful pupils seek the hallowed spot where they may recall his blessed example , and dwell upon the words of holy cheer which he left to stimulate them in efforts for the salvation of their benighted people . About two weeks since , as I was walking , one Sabbath evening , upon the terraced roof of our dwelling , my attention was arrested by the sound of mingled voices singing , in Syriac , the hymns our departed brother so much loved . Turning to find from whence the music proceeded , I was touched to see some of the pupils of the seminary standing by the grave of their beloved teacher , and surrounding it with sweet songs of praise . I stood for a moment lost in deep emotion . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory 's page than these songs of Zion , sung in a strange land and in a foreign tongue , around the grave of the faithful missionary . Blessed rest , after a life of self-denying toil , to be thus enshrined in the henrts of a grateful people . Who would wish a better monument than those songs von . Lxxxviii. - NO. 182. 21 // of victory which arose above that lowly grave , in the still evening air of a Persian sky ? When rncked with fever , Mr. Stoddard often asked for the sweet hymns which he had been accustomed , while a child , to repeat at his mother 's knee . And it was a strong tribute to the soothing power of those hymns , that they not only sustained him throughout the sorrows and cares of missionary life , but that , even in the last trying hours , the strains of Watts , Cowper , and Doddridge were commissioned , by a hand Divine , to illuminate the dark valley . And shall we deny that , to our own stricken hearts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saviour , have come even from his grave like leaves of healing ? " - pp. 413 , 414 . Were it the sole result of the missionary enterprise to nurture such Christian heroism , to develop in strength and beauty such truly great souls , to bequeath to a grovelling and Mammon-worshipping generation such glorious examples of a higher life , of disinterested love and generous self-sacrifice , it xvould be worth all the cost expended upon it , and the precious lives which have been yielded up to its protracted martyrdom . It has demonstrated , as no other portions of modern history have , the joy-giving power of religious faith , - the independence of the soul of man on its surroundings , its sufficiency with the grace of God for its own happiness . But this is not all . The results of this evangelic labor are beyond estimate , except by the Omniscient Mind . Numerically , they may fail to satisfy the commercial spirit of our times . The expenditure divided by the number of converts would , no doubt , show that a convert costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it costs to kill a man in battle ; all the missionary establishments the world might be sustained for several years by the money wasted in a single campaign . But it must be remembered that , in a heathen or semi-heathen population , a sunken foundation must be laid before the superstructure can arrest the indifferent eye . There are languages - often a debased patois , a mongrel tongue - to be learned without grammar or lexicon , and then to be made available for the uses of instruction . Sometimes an alphabet must be created . Elementary treatises on the language , and vocabularies , must often be written out . Then comes the work of translation , slow , tentative , perplexing . Then there is a hold to be gained upon the // respect and confidence of an unimpressible people . And , after all , the chief reliance must be placed on the training of children and youth , who must be separated from native associations , kept strictly under Christian influence , and formed , by the labor of years , for future usefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many stations the foundation is broadly and durably laid , and the superstructure already appears .
