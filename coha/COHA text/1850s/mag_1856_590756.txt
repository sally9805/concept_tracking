806 2lfet* and Tim*es of the Revolution . April , Men and Times of the Revolution ; or , Kemoirs of Ellcanah Watson , including Journals of Travels in Europe and America , from 1777 to 1842 , with his correspondence with public men , and reminiscences and incidents of the Revolution . Edited by his son , Winslow C. Watson . New-York Dana &amp; Co. , Publishers . IT is a subject of constant regi*et with Americans , that the records of the great struggle for national independence are of so general a nature . The literature of other civilized countries is full of home-sketches ; chronicles of particular places ; lives of individuals ; memoirs and journals of great and little actors in the drama of life . French literature particularly abounds in them . Prime ministers , princes of the blood , secretaries , pages , soldiers , and pretty women , all leave " Miemoir*s pour servir a 1 ' histoire . " Whether prompted by individual or national vanity , or a proper and philosophical desire to add something to the general store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these contributors add something valuable to history . A people rather of action than reflection , among Americans writing is " caviare to the general . " We have scarce time enough to spare from business to attend properly to eating and sleeping . Americans commonly travel from the cradle to the grave by an " express-train , " making no stop at small places on the road . Pen , ink , and paper , therefore , are , for the most part , appropriated to ledgers and commercial correspondence ; hence reliable knowledge of home life in America is unattainable by foreigners . They can get no deeper than the newspapers , and of them we are unhappily forced to say what Lord Bolingbroke said of History : " As for that , we know it to be a lie . " The history of the Revolutionary time in America is particularly bald ; bald , we mean , in respect of records of private history . The lives of the chief actors in it have , indeed , been written and rewritten after a sort ; but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . Every-day matters are left out . The judge is always on the bench ; the soldier always sword in hand ; the statesman wears always the colors of his trade . Our history , in short , is always in full dress to receive company , and too fine by half . We want a little more of the daily food , more plain roast-beef and less // confectionery ' It is a great mistake . Nothi*ig would look better in print than a plain story of all the ins and outs , up-risings and down-sittings of American in-door life , It is the most wholesome and honorable that ever was lived by any people . Outwardly , new manners and fine fashions have blurred the native grace and plainness of our life ; inwardly , at home , the virtuous simplicity of the early days of the iRepublic remains untarnished . Home is every thing to us . The Bible sheds its hallowed influence upon almost every family circle . It is the family book of America . The genuine force ' and hearted goodness of American nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The world is our battlefield . There we rush , and brag , and strive , and dash ahead ; always busy , always in a whirl ; yet cool-headed , and not a bit too unselfish-in fact , rather hard and grasping than otherwise . At home we are different people . We isolate ourselves there , it is true , and have no idea of what the French call " society . " We abhor strangers , in fact , almost as much as Horace did the " profanurn vulgus . " The family-our own family , wife and little ones , dear old father and mother-are all we want there . Any other interrupts , brings discomfort , puts a pound of starch into papa 's collar and mamma 's lips , and makes every body exquisitely unnatural and disagreeable . Thus we are not known abroad . The world has a false idea of us : that , however , is aot the world 's fault . How could it know ? If we wrote " home life " in auto-biographies and memoirs , and journals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all . The chief recommendation of Mr. Watson 's Memoirs is , that they let us a little into the private life of the time he writes of . We have Lee 's , and Graydon 's , and Greene 's Memoirs ; Trumbull 's and Thatcher 's contributions to history ; and Mrs. Mercy Warren 's history , in some respects an invaluable book , in others scarcely to be relied on . The lady was , like most ladies , a little headstrong , and *ufflciently partisan . Later we have had the lives of many great men of Revolutionary fame ; but , as we have said , these deal very little with home life ; the men they treat of are rather used as the necessary appendages to great historical events , than as human beings with a daily life of their own . " My father , " says Mr. Watson , " from the age of nineteen to near the close of his life , which was protracted to more than four-score years , was in the habit of recording his observations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that time had cultivated the same valuable habit . // The work abounds in excellent material , and the style is sim ple and pleasing . " I was born , " says Mr. Watson , " on the 22d day of January , 1758 , in Plymouth , Mass. , within rifle-shot of that consecrated rock , where , in New-England , the first European foot was pressed . Among the pious and devoted  |p11.  gruns of the Mayflower , Edward Winslow , the third governor of the infant colony , was an energetic and conspicuous leader . From him I am descended in the sixth generation on my mother 's side . Born and nurtured among the descendants of the Puritans , I was early imbued with their high sentiments of re*gious and political liberty . My father and all my relatives , with a few exceptions , were zealous and active Whigs , aiding with their hands and purses the glorious struggle for Independence . I remained at the ordinary common-school until the age of fourteen . This scheol*was kept by Alexander Scammel and Peleg Wadsworth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common with the other patriotic spirits of the age , they evidently saw the approach of the coming tempest . I remember thepa as early as 1771 , intently studying military tactics , and have often seen them *engaged in a garden adjoining my father 's , drilling each other . They formed the boys into a military company , and our school soon had the air of a miniature arsenal , with our wooden guns and tin bayonets suspended around the walls . At twelve o'clock , the word was given , to arms , ' and each boy seized his gun ; then , led by either Scammel or Wadsworth , we were taught military evolutions , and marched over hills , through swamps , often in the rain , in the performance of these embryo military duties . A sad and impressive commentary upon the effect of these early influences , is afforded by the fact that half this company perished in the conflicts of the Revolution . Scammel was tall in person , exceeding six feet , slender and active . He was kind and benevolent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was eminently distinguished during the Revolution for his conduct and bravery . In 1777 , he was very conspicuous at the battle of Saratoga , leading his regiment of the New-Hampshire troops , in a desperate charge upon Burgoyne 's lines . At the siege of Yorktown , he held the important station of Adjutant-General to Was in n 's army , and there fell in a reconnoisance upon the British works . " In the month of September , 1778 , at the age of fifteen , I left my native place , and proceeded to Providence , Rhode-Island , to engage in my apprenticeship with John Brown , the founder of Brown University , and then one of the most extensive and energetic merchants of America . " In the December of that year , the tea was destroyed at Boston , and our disputes with the mother country began to assume a serious aspect . The public mind was gradually ripening to the fearful appeal to arms . During the summer of this year the youth of Providence formed themselves into military associations . We often met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses . I enrolled myself in the cadet company commanded by Cob Nightingale , consisting of seventy-five youths , the flower of Providence . The uniform of this regiment was scarlet coats , faced with yellow . These companies , five in number , were reviewed by the distinguished Gen. Lee , in the autumn of 1774 , and received from him the highest encomiums . In a let ( er to the Duke of- , October 29th , 1774 , after speaking of the preparations in progress in the different colonies to resist oppression , he // adds : I was present at a review of some of their companies in Providence , B. I. I really never saw any thing more perfect . ' " The storm now thickened in our political horizon-some acts of hosti. lity had already been committed near Salem . The whole country was agitated as if passing over a threatened volcano . Liberty companies in every community were organizing . The intelligence of the march upon Lexington reached Providence in the afternoon of the 19th of April , 1775 . Our five companies flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vehement excitement . We were unprovided with cartridges , and were compelled to defer our march till morning . I spent the most of that night with many of our company , in running bullets and preparing ammunition . We mustered early the next morning , and marched for the scene of action . The royal governor , Wanton , issued a proclamation , which was little regarded , interdicting our passing the colony line , under the penalty of open rebellion . Capt . Green , afterwards the celebrated Gen. Green , with his company of Warwick Greens , and Capt . Yarnam , afterwards a revolutionary general , with his Greenwich Volunteers , marched with us at the same time towards Lexington . " That was the way they made soldiers then . It may not be uninteresting to our friends across the water to remark that we do so now also . Other nations have gala days , holidays , and festivals . Americans have but one national holiday , the Fourth of July ; and but one national play , namely , playing soldier . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries with it , that you may take any twenty men or boys , at random , in the street , clap muskets in their hands , order them to " fall in " in two ranks , " form company , " and they will fall into line like veterans . Scammel and Wardsworth are not solitary instances . We have a good many schoolmasters left , who would teach the young idea how to shoot " ra'al ball " better than they teach Adams or Lindley Murray . Mr. Watson 's military service was brief . After a turn or two on land and sea , he made a business tour through the southern provinces . He then visited France , and established there a commercial house . Writing in 1778 , he says : " The partial hand of nature has laid out America on a much larger scale than any other country . What are called mountains in Europe are hills in America ; rivers , brooks , trees , bushes , and lakes are reduced to ponds . In short , the map of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages , so pleasantly diversified , and which offers to agriculture , manufactures , and commerce , so many resources ; all of which can not fail to conduct America to the first rank among nations . This I pro . phesy . It must be so . In contemplating future America , the mind is lost in the din of cities , in harbors , and rivers , crowded with sails , and in the immensity of its population . " Taking three millions , the number at this time , as a basis , and admit : ting our population to double each twenty-three years , the result in a hundred years will be sixty-two millions of republican freemen , approaching // one hundred millions , in the year A. D. 1900 , which will be nearly equal to that of all Europe at the present day . " The sagacious statesmen of Europe realize these truths , and already dread the influence that the greatness and prosperity of America is destined to exercise upon the world . The European possessions in the West-India Islands will pass away like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Republic , or will be emancipated , and independent governments themselves . " Though European politicians may consider these events too remote to affect any portion of the present generation of men , still they will obstruct our progress by every means in their power . Their efforts will be as vain as presumptuous , and they will prove as powerless as an attempt to check the flQwing of the ti*le . Their schemes will , in fact , be an effort to arrest the decrees of the Almighty , who has evidently raised up this nation to become a lamp to guide degraded and oppressed humanity , and to direct other nations , even the nation of our oppressors , to liberty and happiness . " " This I prophesy ! " Truly the " second sight " was upon him . Had he written yesterday instead of 1778 ; had he written with the correspondence between Marcy , Buchanan , and Clarendon open before him , he could not have spoken more wisely or to the point . " European politicians will obstruct our progress by every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The whole crowd of timorous and flocking birds , with such as love the night " of prescriptive privilege and monarchical abuse , hate and fear the expansive nature of Republican Institutions . It is natural ; it is necessar Light has no communion with darkness , nor sin with holiness ; but truth is omnipotent . They may " obstruct , " but they can never prevent . English envy and diplomacy may cut down trees , and break up roads on our path of Empire , but when fate passes the word along the Yankee line , " Prepare to pass obstacle , " over go horse , foot , and artillery , at a hand-gallop , and away go the obstructions for ever . It is all moonshine on the water to talk of impeding the march of American enterprise or empire : It ca n't be done . Let no one fret themselves on that subject . It ca n't be done . Whereof hear good old Watson , for he verily talks plain English and sound sense in this matter , and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much importance to our Revolution , in considering it the cause of man , and that it was preparing an asylum for the oppressed and persecuted of all nations ; but the more I reflect , and the more I regard the opinions of older heads , the stronger my conviction becomes of the truth of this solemn and animating thought . " For two centuries , an ineffectual struggle has been maintained , to fasten upon some corner of Europe the principles of liberty , but the bayonets of a million of mercenaries have secured the thrones of European despots. // Freedom , established and maintained in America , in a more liberal age , may diffuse her influence over Europe . " England has fairly rocked us out of our cradle , a sleeping infant ; she may soon find us an armed giant . Should I live to the age prescribed to man , I have no doubt but I shall witness America standing in the first rank among the nations of the earth . " It was his happiness to live to see it all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have swelled within him as he witnessed the fulfillment of his youthful hopes , in the ripe manhood and growing power of his country . Here is a pleasant anecdote of the " stars and stripes ; " the date is 1782 . " Soon after my arrival in England , having won at the insurance office one hundred guineas , on the event of Lord Howe 's relieving Gibraltar , and dining the same day with Copley , the distinguished painter , who was a Bostonian by birth , I determined to devote the sum to a splendid portrait of myself . The painting was finished in most admirable style , except the back-ground , which 4Jopley and myself designed to represent a ship , bearing to America the intelligence of the acknowledgment of Independence , with a sun just rising upon the stripes of the Union , streaming from her gaff . All was complete save the flag , which Copley did not esteem prudent to hoist under present circumstances , as his gallery is a constant resort of the royal family and the nobility . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1782 , after listening with him to the speech of the Kin g , formally receiving and reco*nizing the United States of America into the rank of nations . Previous to dining , and immediately after bur return from the House of Lords , he invited me into his studio , and there with a bold hand , a master 's touch , and I believe an American heart , attached to the ship the 8tars and str4*es . This was , I imagine , the flint American flag hoi8ted in old England . " * The following anecdote might seem exaggerated , but we happen to know that precisely a similar thing occurred , but a year or two since , to a friend of ours . Indeed , in two or three parts of Europe , particularly in England and Austria , they laughed at him when he said he was an American , and replied : " Oh ! no , sir ; that is impossible , for your skin is as fair as ours . " " I was highly entertained by a conversation between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class in society , in a coach , near London , and record it as illustraLive of the prevailing ignorance in England , of the people and condition of America . One remarked to the " 4 ' I brought this splendid painting with ftie to America , and it is stil.l in any possession . It is pronounced by artists , second to no painting in America , and has , at their earnest request , been deposited in academies and schools of painting , as a study for young artists . Copley assured me that it would not , in his own language - ripen in forty years '  --  and now , after an interval of more than half a century , ( 1821 , ) its colors appear clearer and more brilliant than on the day they left the painter 's pallet . " 22 // other : I have seen a wonderful sight  --  a little girl born in a place called Boston , in North-America ; and what is very astonishing , but I pledge you my word it is true , she speaks English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , she is perfectly white ! , Is it possible 1 ' exclaimed the other , in no counterfeit astonishment at the recital . Many of the people of England suppose us to be a nation of Indians , Negroes , or mixed blood . " This was in 1784 . Really , our English cousins are a slow race ; they have not apparently learned much more about us up to this year of grace , 1856 . The little anecdote Mr. Watson tells of the manner of hold . ihg English elections , ought to make John Bull chary of hi* wise reflections upon the dangers of American mobs , voting7 etc . " I attended , for three successive days , in Covent Garden Square , the violently-contested election for Parliament , between Fox , Lord Hood , and Wray . It was a spectacle of the deepest excitement and interest ; but disgraceful in the outrages and violence constantly attending it . I occupied a position near the hustings , upon a temporary stage , which afforded me a view of every occurrence . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of a small church , the hustings being inclosed within a railway . From my elevated station , looking upon the sea of faces , I judged there were assembled within the square , at the windows commanding a view of it , and in the adjacent streets , twenty thousand spectators , to witness freemen giving in their suffrages . " . The contest had akeady continued several weeks . Instead of the silent dignity that usually characterizes an American election , here all was confusion and conflict ; bloody noses and broken heads-intimidation and corruption . In the midst of the canvass , two self-created armies were seen entering the square , at different points ; the one headed by a son of Lord Hood , ( a captain in the navy , ) consisting of sailors , and armed with bludgeons ; the other led by a champion of Fox , composed principally of hardy Irish chairmen . They bore banners inscribed with the names of their respective candidates . " The purpose of each party was to secure to its friends access to the polls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , met with a rude shock exactly In front of the hustings . A violent conflict ensued ; each party made great efforts to prostrate the stand*ard of its opponents . They fought with proverbial English ferocity . The excitement instantly spread in every direction , and clubs , fists , and canes were in brisk motion throughout the crowd . Such a scene I had never witnessed . Victory soon declared for the sailors ; the chairmen were scouting through every avenue , with the sailors in brisk pursuit . " The poll was in consequence open exclusively to the friends of Hood and Wray . Within two hours , the chairmen , strongly reinforced , returned , and a new conflict ensued . I saw Fox , in front of the hustings , clapping his hands and shouting with the utmost engagedness . The sailors , in turn , were compelled to fly , leaving many of both parties mangled and bloody , who were borne into the adjacent houses . A French gentleman at my // 313 elbow , justly exclaimed : If this be liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant glimpse of greatness under a cloud is afforded in the following sketch of the illustrious French refugees , who fled from the horrors of their own bloody Revolution to en o the peaceable fruits of ours . lit appears their gratitude was of a piece with that of kings , and other fine people by the " grace of God . " his*The residence for a short period of Talleyrand in this country , during exile , in a condition of indigence and destitution , is a historic fact . His circumstances and position are somewhat illustrated by trivial incidents , which have been noticed in the manuscripts of Mr. Watson : " In the years 1794 and 95 , I resided in the northern suburbs of Albany , then known as the Colonie . Mons. Le Contaulx , formerly of Paris , a very amiable man , was my opposite neighbor . His residence was the resort of the French emigrants . During that period , Count Le Tour du Pin , a distinguished French noble , made a hair-breadth escape from Bordeaux , with his elegant and accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed in that city for six terrible weeks , during the sanguinary atrocities of Tallien , and arrived at Boston with two trunks of fine towels , containing several hundred in each ; the only property they had been able to save from the wreck of an immense estate . They came to Albany , and brought me a letter of introduction from Thomas Russell , an eminent merchant of Boston . Soon after , they purchased a little farm , upon an eminence nearly opposite Troy . " Here they were joined by Talleyrand , who had arrived about the same time in Albany ; also , an exile , and in want . I became intimate with them , from these circumstances , from my familiarity with their country and knowledge of the French language . They avowed their poverty , and resided together on the little farm , suffei-ing severe privations , bringing to Albany the surplus produce of their land , and habitually stopping with their butter and eggs at my door . They yielded with a good grace to their humiliating condition . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of distinguished Frenchmen : the Count , Talleyrand , Volney , the philosophical writer and traveller , Mons. Pharoux , a very learned man , and Des Jardin , a former qhamberlsin of Louis XVI . They considered me a Frenchman at heart , and appeared to forget that I was an American , jealous of therights , ' liberties , and honor of my country . Their remarks were often revolting to my sentiments and national pride . Sympathy and compassion for their fallen estate constrained me to endure this language , although they did not hesitate to avow their detestation of American institutions , and their disgust at our manners and habits . " On the occasion referred to , after having indulged in this train of remark , and speculating upon the posture of European affairs , . Des Jardin at lexxgth turning to me , exclaimed : Yes , my friend , before this war ' ( the war waged by despotism against republican principles ) shall end , your frontier will be lined with French bayonets . ' To this sentiment they all seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond forbearance , and I replied : God grant , if so , that the invaders may be repelled at // the threshold , or exterminated to a man . ' Here we were at issue , and our social intercourse terminated . " Soon after this , Talleyrand was swaying a potent influence in the councils of France . Whether these hostile sentiments were infused into the Directory , I have no knowledge ; but it is certain , when our three EnVO*5 were literally supplicating for peace , at the foot-stool of this power , they were received with an arrogance and intolerance that insulted the dignity , and trampled contemptuously upon the independence of a free nation . This , however , was the extreme point of our degradation . Adams was found a lion in the path of these aggressions . An open war ensued , in which our infant Navy , the child of his own creation , gloriously sustained the honor of our flag , and our national rights . Truxton , in the Constellation , captured a French frigate of equal size , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the language of the day ; for he performed alone in his gallant ship , all the fighting . The French government retracted , and an honorable peace was consummated. " * Probably if Truxton had lived in 1856 , he would have been put upon the retired list , fighting , at present , affording apparently very serious ground of complaint against naval gentlemen . We would advise them , under the rule adopted in the celebrated case of iRolando vs. the Chinese piratical junks , whenever they find themselves in such quarrelsome company , to clap their swords on the cabin-table , and , with Ancient Pistol , pray , that " Heaven may send them no need " of such unchristian and bloody-minded instruments . Apropos to naval affairs , we must be indulged in one more extract from this pleasing volume ; it is about the battles on the Lakes . " After taking our leave of the Niagara , we proceeded to the shore to visit the arsenal , and were much gratified by the inspection of the shattered spars and cannon of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fraught with the luxury of national pride , in which purest and loftiest patriotism could so widely expatiate , as when I contemplated in the scene the rising glory of the Republic , and indulged the grateful and proud conviction , that the ships , or decaying hulks under my eyes , had done more to humble the arrogance of Britain than all the navies of Franee and Spain , through the long annals of naval warfare . We had often beaten her before , ship to ship , but the battle of Erie was our first trial in naval tactics , fleet against fleet . " I boldly challenge the history of England to unfold a nobler display of skill , decision , and bravery , than was evinced by Perry , a comparative boy of Rhode.Island , and his officers and tars , in every stage of this well-fought battle . The father of Perry I knew well in the Revolutionary war . He commanded a packet between Newport and Providence , and was called , I think , Kit Perry . " What incident in history is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Perry left his almost conquered and disabled ship , the Lawrence , in an open boat , exposed to the fire of the // British fleet , and passed to the Niagara , a ship fresh and uninjured , thus deciding the fortunes of the day , and capturing every vessel of a superior enemy ? " We were rowed back to town across the harbor , and inspected the public store-house , the spot where Perry built his ships , and the identical boat in which he passed to the Niagara , which was lying on the beach in good preservation . " The officer who conducted us in the yawl , a true son of Neptune , not only declared , but swore to the fact , that the Lawrence had been sunk three times alongside the Queen Charlotte , that she could not be kept there , having each time fell off in the raking position in which we saw her , in spite of them . He appeared perfectly serious in the belief ; that this was a preternatural affair . " In the year 1814 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar , and unreserved conversations with a British officer high in rank and character , upon the subject of our successfQl naval encounters with British ships . He freely conceded the fact , and in elucidation , remarked , that he met his friend Gen. Hyslop in London after the capture of the frigate Java , who , with many officers and soldiers , was a passenger in her , em route to the East-Indies ; that he inquired of Gen. Hyslop , how it happened , that the Java was captured by the Constitution , when it was admitted , that she was of about equal force , of superior equipment , and almost doubly manned . That Gen. Hyslop replied to him , They expected , on falling in with the Constitution , to make a short job of her capture . ' He remained , he said , on the quarter-deck of the Java , through the engagement , and was astonished to see the superior gunnery of the Constitution , she discharging during the battle three broadsides to two of her antagonist , which added in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this circumstance he imputed the victory of Bainbridge . My friend added , that Gen. Hyslop said to him , from his subsequent observation and inquiry he was convinced the American sailors were far more active and elastic in their habits and motions than the British . The same result which signalized the combat between the Constitution and Java , characterized the numerous battles in the Revolution , between American and British privateers , and still more marked and decisively those of the late * We take leave of this volume with regret . It is a valuable contribution to American literature and history , and will , we hope , serve to bring to light many important facts connected with the past , which now lie hidden in MSS. , letters , and memorandums , in private hands . it us have in print all that remains of that glorious period . The influence exerted by every scrap and pen-mark of the patriot men of Revolutionary times , is happy and healthful .
