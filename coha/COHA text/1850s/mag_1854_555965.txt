ART . II . - The Lffe of HARMAN BLENNERHA55ETT . Comprising an Authentic Narrative of the Burr Expedition ; and containing many additional Facts , not heretofore published . By WILLIAM H. SAFFORD . Cincinnati . 1853. l2mo. pp. 239 . AARON BURR was born at Newark , New Jersey , on the 6th of February , 1756 . His father , a divine of eminence , was the first President of Princeton College ; his maternal grandfather , Jonathan Edwards , the metaphysician , was the second President . Burr gave early indications of talent , and was graduated with distinction at the age of sixteen . The Revolution , just opening , aroused the enthusiasm of all the ardent youth of the country . It reached its crisis when the battle of Lexington was fought , on the 19th of April , 1775 ; and Burr , in company with many others , in the following July , joined the American army at Cambridge . Quebec , the most important fortress on the Canadian frontier , was at that time the stronghold of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected by Arnold . It was generally conceived to be a desperate project : the winter would set in before the troops could reach the St. Lawrence ; Maine at that time was a perfect wilderness , and its dark pine-forests were supposed to be almost impenetrable ; but Arnold was firm , and Burr , eager for excitement and martial glory , proposed to join the expedition . They marched from Cambridge on the 14th of September . After sixty or seventy days of incredible toil , they effected a junction with Montgomery , then commanding that portion of our army stationed on the St. Lawrence . The combined forces made an attack , under cover of a snow-storm , on the morning of the 31st of December . The result was disastrous to the Americans . They were repulsed ; and Montgomery fell , mortally wounded , into the arms of Burr , who conducted himself throughout the march and attack as a skilful tactician and a courageous man . Recommended to the esteem of Washington by his gallant bearing on this occasion , he received an appointment near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to arouse distrust on one 26 // side and aversion on the other . The circumstances of this affair are yet involved in mystery ; but until a satisfactory explanation is produced , his sudden departure must reflect upon the character of Burr . Washington was never hasty , and seldom incorrect in his judgment ; and from that period he declared that his confidence in Burr was for ever destroyed . He afterwards refused to sanction his nomination as Ambassador to France . Burr was about to quit the service ; but , at the solicitation of Hancock , he joined the staff of General Putnam , and exhibited his usual intrepidity at the battle of Long Island Heights , and the subsequent night 's retreat to New York . He served in the army , with the rank of colonel , until March , 1777 , and was considered a faithful , brave , and efficient officer . Under the plea of ill health , he handed in his commission , stating the reasons which induced him to resign it . The reply of Washington was courteous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sustainTj the absence of Burr , and also the cause which rendered his absence necessary , and closed by notifying him that , when he found it convenient to transmit a settlement of his public accounts , the resignation would receive a final acceptance . Although Burr 's promotion had been commensurate with his services , we have good reason to believe that his resignation was partially induced by a feeling that he had been slighted . Burr had sided with Gates and Lee against Washington , when the rupture took place during the winter of 1777-8 , at Valley Forge ; and he felt that his conduct during this affair would do nothing toward ameliorating the early impressions that Washington had formed against him . Not powerful enough to supplant him , and too proud to endeavor to conciliate his esteem , he determined to escape the overshadowing influence of Washington 's command and popularity . Shortly after his retirement , he married the widow of Colonel Prevost , of the British army , studied law , and was admitted to the bar at Albany . The Revolutionary war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace were signed ; and in the autumn of 1783 , New York having been evacuated by the British soldiery , Burr removed to that city , where his legal // skill and sagacity soon gained for him an extensive practic&amp;* Upon removing to New York , he had joined the ranks of the Federalists , whom his chances of promotion afterward induced him to desert . He was not the man to scruple at a political somerset , and , finally gave in his adhesion to the Democratic , then called the Republican party . He was appointed Attorney-General , then Judge of the Supreme Court of New York , then chosen United States Senator . He took his seat in the Senate in the autumn of 1791 . He opposed the measures of his former coadjutors with an energetic spirit , and was considered the member of the opposition most capable of counteracting the ascendency of Hamilton , the illustrious leader of the Federalists . He took an active part in supporting the contested seat of Albert Gallatin . He opposed the appointment of Chief Justice Jay as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , negotiated by Mr. Jay after his appointment ; but his party was in the minority , and he was unsuccessful in all the measures which he advocated . The style of his oratory was precisely opposite to that of Hamilton , his great competitor . Burr reasoned ; Hamilton speculated . Burr 's manner was cool , compact , and destitute of all rhetorical embellishment ; Hamilton 's was impetuous , and his diction of Ciceronian splendor . At the expiration of Burr 's term in the Senate , he was elected a member of the State Assembly for the City of New York . In the mean time , the administration of Mr. Adams was drawing to a close ; and , having performed the duties of his responsible office to the satisfaction of his own party , he was nominated for re-election . Mr. Pinckney , of South Carolina , was substituted upon the new ticket for Thomas Jeffer. son , the then Vice-President , who now headed the ranks of a distinct and powerful party . Jefferson dissented from the financial system of Hamilton , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtailment of the privileges of the judiciary , rotation in office , and State sovereignty . Jefferson and Burr were the nominees of the Republicans . The result of a Presidential election , at that time , promised to be such as would necessarily carry out the wishes of the great mass of the people ; but the contest of 1800 subjected the // election laws to a practical test which clearly demonstrated the confrary . It was perfectly understood that Jefferson was the choice of the Republicans for the Presidency . Ordinary care would have secured his choice by the vote of the Electors . The Constitution declared that each State should appoint , in such manner as the Legislature thereof might direct , a number of Electors equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the State might be entitled in Congress . These constituted the Electoral College , each member of which voted by ballot for two persons . The person receiving the greatest number of votes was declared President , provided such number was a majority of the Electors appointed . If there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of votes , the election devolved upon the House of Representatives , voting by States . A quorum for this purpose consisted of the Representatives from two thirds of the States , and a majority of all the States was requisite for a choice . Adams was the Presidential candidate of his party , and one Federal Elector withheld his vote from Mr. Pinckney , in order to secure the majority of Adams . From some misunderstanding or blunder , such a precaution was neglected by the Republicans ; and when the electoral votes were unsealed by Jefferson , as presiding officer of the Senate , in the presence of both houses of Congress , Burr unexpectedly found himself elevated to a competitorship for the first office in the gift of the nation . It was a dizzy eminence , and might have subjected the principles of a more virtuous man to a severe test . Burr had no small claim upon the gratitude of his party . They had appointed him to offices calling for the display of integrity and talent ; he had certainly filled them with marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perfect uprightness . Whatever might be the result of the approaching contest , the Democratic President would owe his election to the insfrumentality of Burr . In the election for President in 1796 , New York had cast a Federal vote ; since then , Burr 's influence had won ascendency for his own party , reversed the vote of the Electors , and ( as in the memorable contest of 1844 , the national result depending upon the vote of New York ) secured victory to the Republicans . His position was now unpre // cedented , yet there was but one course for a high-minded man to pursue . Purely entitled to accident for the place he occupied , he should have instantly disclaimed all competitorship for the office intended for another . Burr was at Albany whilst the election was pending . The votes were unsealed on the 11th of February , 1801 . On the 16th of December previous , Burr had written to Senator Smith , of Maryland , thus : " It is highly improbable that I shall have an equal number of votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , every man who knows me ought to know that I would utterly disclaim all competition . Be assured , that the Republicans can entertain no wish for such an exchange . As to my friends , they would dishonor my views and insult my feelings by a suspicion that I would submit to be instrumental in counteracting the wishes and expectations of the people of the United States ; and I now constitute you my proxy to declare these sentiments , if the occasion shall require . " The Federal party in the House of Representatives had a numerical , though not a State majority . Burr had lately defeated and long since deserted them . But they had less to fear from his election than from that of Mr. Jefferson . The Federalists , in this dilemma , embraced the lesser evil , and when the contest came on , Burr was placed at the head of a formidable and dangerous opposition . The representatives determined to vote day and night without adjournment , until an election was effected ; and for thirty-five ballotings Burr was supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were equally inexorable . At that time there were sixteen States in the confederacy , the vote of nine , therefore , being requisite for a choice . From the first to the thirtyfifth ballot , Jefferson received the vote of eight , Burr of six , while two were divided , either of whose respective votes could have terminated the contest , and they were controlled by General Morris , of Vermont , and Mr. Bayard , of Delaware . The period of Adams 's administration was near its close , and had these gentlemen persisted in their opposition , and dared to assume such a responsibility , they might have prevented the election of a new President ; for the adherents of Burr were firm , and those of Jefferson would never have yielded . Deeply // Oct. impressed with the necessity and justice of giving way to the wishes of the nation , the Federalists were yet determined to negotiate for terms of capitulation ; and upon their being assured , from a reliable source , that important principles of the Federal policy would be recognized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , upon the thirtysixth ballot , by Mr. Bayard , who , by withdrawing his opposition , changed the vote of Delaware , and terminated the protracted contest , Burr , according to the then existing provisions of the Constitution , being declared Vice-President . It was supposed that Burr might have secured his election by a mortgage of executive patronage ; and it was inconceivable to the public that such an opening had escaped the practised eye of that consummate political gamester , who had been trained in the labyrinthine mazes of New York politics , which , more than half a century since , acquired the complicate nature they have always retained . Burr 's principles were not so rigid as to have recoiled from corruption ; but there is no evidence whatever that it was employed . - He was known to have resorted to dishonorable artifice when little was to be gained , and now that so splendid a prize was at stake , it was highly probable that his customary chicanery would be employed . The darkest rumors were circulated , and , unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify suspicion and give a speciousness to the charge . Jefferson never forgave him ; and his subsequent treatment of his defeated rival was utterly unworthy of the statesman and philosopher . Burr entered upon the duties of his new office with the reputation of a baffled intriguer . The culpable silence he always preserved under just or unjust imputation has been his most formidable accuser . Before a legal tribunal , the want of conclusive testimony of guilt justifies an assumption of innocence ; but at the bar of public opinion , a man who fails to repel suspicion and reproach virtually indorses the correctness of the popular verdict . Burr 's reputation was injured , but not irretrievably ; we confidently believe that upon this occasion he suffered unmerited obloquy . Yet future rectitude would have reinstated him , for justice will gain the ascendant as inevitably as the tide that ebbs will flow // 303 in its appointed course ; and lapse of time might have varnished over this imputed blot upon his escutcheon , had not an unhappy event which was shortly to follow led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no possibility of his re-election to the Vice-Presidency ; but his local influence in New York was great , he could depend for State appointments upon the support of a powerful party , and while still presiding over the Senate , in 1804 , he was nominated for the Governorship of New York . The influence of Alexander Hamilton was , at that period perhaps greater than any single man has ever exercised in the State . Though not the opposing candidate , he threw the whole weight of his power into the Federal scale , and supported that cause with all the fiery impetuosity of his nature . Washington had long since declared Burr a dangerous and unprincipled man . Hamilton 's conviction of his baseness was equally firm and immutable . He denounced him in philippics of scathing bitterness , as a profligate libertine and an infamous traitor to every principle of honor , integrity , and patriotism . The canvassing was conducted with a fierceness which threatened to end in violence and bloodshed . It lost its political character , and assumed a tone of personal animosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its results . Other politicians had denounced Burr with equal bitterness ; but Hamilton was no ordinary antagonist , - he had been the evil genius of Burr 's life , the friend of Washington whom he hated , the leader of a party which he had betrayed . Hamilton had been the chief obstacle to his promotion at every step of his career , his early competitor at the bar and in the Senate . When Burr made his fierce onslaught upon Jay 's treaty , Hamilton had stood forth as the ablest defender of the executive policy , and finally had been instrumental in Burr 's defeat for the Presidency . These offences were not to be overlooked . Burr had a keen sense of personal dignity . Eclipsed by his superior talents , and stung by his indignant rebukes , he challenged his accuser . Hamilton reluctantly yielded an assent , and at sunrise on the 10th of July , 1804 , in the forest of Weehawken , opposite New York , overlooking the beautiful Hudson , by the hand of // an assassin , perished a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even those politicians who dissented from the theories of the limited monarchist acknowledged that his faults were those of a noble nature , and that the errors he committed were owing to the fiery vehemence of a lofty and an ardent mind . Terrible as was the result , more terrible still was the ensuing retribution . When it first became known through out the country that Hamilton had been sacrificed by such an antagonist , the nation broke forth in execrations of indignant rebuke . Burr was denounced from the pulpit , shunned in public places , and completely ostracized in the private circles of which he had lately been the model and the ornament . The inconsistency is a strange one , that the very tribunal from the fear of whose condemnatory verdict many a duelist has gone forth to the field , instead of greeting the victor on his return from the conflict , refused the bloody hand , and proscribed for ever the unhappy man that had yielded to its exactions . Other men have engaged in similar affairs with no comparative injury to their fame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suffer the penalty of a crime of which ten are guilty . Better men than Burr have been the objects of popular caprice ; and more than one abject creature has been tired of hearing Aristides called " The Just . " But nothing of the kind can be urged in extenuation of the present instance , and we must look elsewhere for a solution of the obloquy which Burr now found himself condemned to endure . Any one who will read the correspondence preliminary to the duel , will be satisfied that the death of Hamilton was the culmination of a purpose deliberately contrived and systematically carried out on the part of his antagonist . He felt that the limits of this country were too circumscribed for the presence of Hamilton and himself . The affair was conducted on the part of Burr with coolness and premeditation ; he made unreasonable exactions , to which no honorable man could accede ; and his memory was burdened with the foul deed for thirty-two years , without his uttering one sentiment of compunction or regret . Burr thought it expedient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and travelled in the Southwestern // States until the meeting of Congress in the autumn . His term expired in the following spring . Mr. Jefferson was re-elected President ; Mr. Clinton , of New York , was chosen Vice-President . Burr delivered a valedictory upon his retirement from office . Such an occasion had always been one of interest ; but upon this occasion it is said to have been impressive beyond former example . The Senate contained at that period a constellation of talent , to find whose parallel we must come down to the time of the immortal triumvirate so recently removed . The lobbies were crowded in expectation of the event . There were to be seen side by side the stately dignity of beautiful women , and the noble bearing of accomplished and high-spirited men . Burr , the duellist politician , did not command the sympathies of his audience ; but his talents were extraordinary , and his oratory , though not brilliant , possessed an earnestness , point , and energetic vigor , which to an enlightened audience are far more attractive than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kindly amenities which he had experienced from the members . He recommended a rigid adherence to the most trivial points of decorum and order , and urged them to maintain the dignity , which he had endeavored to inculcate by precept and example , so requisite for legislative bodies , and commensurate with the high position of Senators . In closing , he challenged their attention to considerations more momentous than any which regarded merely personal honor and character . He told them in the most earnest and impressive manner : " This house is a sanctuary and a citadel of law , of order , of liberty ; and it is here - it is here , in this exalted refuge - here , if anywhere , will resistance be made to the storms of popular frenzy and the silent arts of corruption ; and if the Constitution be des- ( A tined ever to perish by the sacrilegious hands of the dernagogue and the usurper , which may God avert , its expiring agonies will be witnessed on this floor . " Thus closed his val- ; edictory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public construed that neglect into the sullen contumacy of guilt . All the avenues of honorable distinction were now closed against him , and his lot was thenceforth to be cast with that of the adventurer and the outlaw ; but ignominy and // disgrace could not extinguish the ambition which had carried off the honors of Princeton , and the energy which had penetrated the forests of Maine . He could hope for no executive appointment under the administration of Jefferson . Hated by the Republicans for having nearly defeated their champion , hated by the Federalists for having slain their idol , stung by the rebukes of a justly indignant community , he angrily turned to projects as reprehensible as the annals of ill-regulated ambition have ever recorded . Far away , toward the tropics , lay an extensive and magnificent empire . Rumor had invested it with the wealth of some fabulous El iDorado . Its climate was mild and genial , its soil of spontaneous fertility , and its mineral wealth had long poured a silver stream into the treasury of Spain . No ordinary share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mexico , but with those blessings appeared to have been mingled a curse ; and , possessing all the natural elements of national greatness , - a territory of immense extent , and a soil no less productive than that of Belgium or France , - she held no position among the nations . That beautiful country was inhabited by a degenerate race . There were to be found in contemptible perfection the fierce vices and the abject pusillanimity of the coward , the bigot , and the slave . No trace remained of the ancient civilization of the Aztecs , whose character and polity , though rugged and cruel , were not entirely destitute of ennobling attributes . An ignoble submission to a foreign yoke now extinguished every vestige of nationality . They languished under the despotism of their Spanish masters , and were kept in cringing subjection by the weak arm of an inefficient and profligate soldiery . The state revenues were monopolized by tyrannical viceroys , and by a church already rich in everything but those principles of enlightenment which are the origin of national prosperity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil discord and the dominion of the Jesuit . The government had become a stake for political gamesters . The vice-regal palace was a Gehenna of pollution , and those creeping reptiles , the intriguers for office , without integrity or talent , rioted in the corruptions of the body politic . Such was the condition of // this unhappy land , when a new Cortez was meditating the seizure of what prosperity and power remained to its inhabitants . The project of its revolution had at one time been considered expedient in the highest diplomatic circles of Washington . Miranda , in 1797 , had sounded Hamilton concerning a similar enterprise in South America . The British ministry had seconded his views , and was to supply a fleet ; the United States was to furnish the invading army . The scheme had been discountenanced by the President , and abandoned , but the affair had given direction to the public mind . Burr now turned his thoughts to the conquest of Mexico , and with no unreasonable hopes of success . The government was weak and unstable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its subjects . The daring conspirator possessed , in an eminent degree , those qualities of intellect and bearing which would have enlisted the admiration , and a force of will which would have curbed the outbreak , of the abject nation which he aspired to confrol . His marvellous talents for intrigue and persuasion were now brought into full play for the accomplishment of his designs . By touching upon the interest , ambition , or philanthropy of those he wished to enlist , he presented the plan to each in its most plausible and attractive shape . To the avaricious , he would point to the mines of Potosi , and hold up to miserly eyes a vision of booty not less splendid than that with which a Peruvian Inca had essayed to purchase his life ; to the ardent and imaginative mind of youth , he would offer a prospect of distinction and martial glory , sounding titles of office , the dazzling insignia of orders , and all the gorgeous pomp and ceremonial of a splendid court ; while he would gain the sympathies of prudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downfrodden people , of diverting into their legitimate channels the ample resources of agriculture and commerce which were now stagnant from the oppressive restrictions of a narrow-minded colonial policy , and establishing a free and independent government over one of the fairest portions of America , whose advantages to the civilized world would be immediate and inestimable . No man could present these allurements with more skill or argumentative force than Aaron Burr . // In 1797 , an Irishman had fled , with his family and fortune , from the political agitations of his native land . He had purchased an island on the Ohio , the most beautiful of Western rivers , and there surrounded himself with all that could minister to the enjoyment of a refined and cultivated taste . Burr found in this retired scholar a valuable accomplice for his purposes . His fortune was ample , his nature was pacific and averse to the excitement of war , and it was in the pursuit of quiet and seclusion that he had sought a home in the Western wilderness . To such a person the ordinary allurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little success by most men ; but the persuasions of Burr were irresistible . Herman Blennerhassett was no match for that consummate master of all the arts of diplomacy ; and , in a short time , the ascendency of Burr was complete . General Wilkinson was at that time commander-in-chief of the American army stationed in the Louisiana Territory , and his cooperation was requisite for the success of the enterprise ; for he commanded the pass of the Mississippi at New Orleans , and Burr would derive an important advantage from the assistance of Wilkinson , in being able to hold it out to the scrupulous as an evidence of the tacit sanction of the government to his design . Burr was desperate , and would have dared approach any man of known integrity who could have aided him ; but the virtue of Wilkinson was not supposed to be incorruptible . Stationed upon the border of the Spanish provinces , and intrusted with the defence of our Southern frontier , popular report had accused him of being the pensioner of the Spanish viceroy , in Mexico . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was in danger of court-martial and displacement . Burr rightly supposed that a man of lax principles would not be unwilling to exchange an office he held by so uncertain a tenure , for the prospect of greater emolument and almost supreme command of the armies of a military despotism . Burr proceeded from Blennerhassett 's Island down the Ohio , to Fort Massac , near its junction with the Mississippi . - He spent several days with Wilkinson , who was stationed there ; and we have every reason to believe that the result of this // conference was a promise , on the part of the commander-inchief , of his own cooperation and that of the American army . Our relations with Spain were at that time very unsettled , and the strong probability of a war gave a plausible coloring to the preparations of Burr . This was held out to the pioneers of the Southwest , whom he designed to engage . The usual sagacity of Burr did not forsake him . To have presented his unlawful design in its real nakedness to the mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of those he had undertaken to seduce . They were an impulsive and high-spirited people , the outbreaks of whose temper contrasted strangely with the cool mental equipoise of the North . There was in their nature a patriotism , perhaps not unminoled with an eagerness for excitement , which would b have taken up arms upon the first declaration of war with Spain ; but one element of that very patriotism was a loyalty which would have revolted from a scheme unsanctioned by the Federal government , and would have been little disposed to assist in , or even coxnive at , the ambitious projects of a disappointed political adventurer . For security against the suspicious eyes of his enemies , who were both numerous and influential , Burr gave out , to account for his presence in the Southwest , that he proposed cutting a canal around the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville , and was engaged in land speculation on the Washita . Blennerhassett was superintending the construction of barges for transports down the Mississippi , whilst Burr travelled in the Southwest , enlisting recruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed of the scheme , which was also confided to the Superior of the Ursnline Convent of New Orleans . They undertook to secure the coiperation of the Mexican Jesuits . The network of preparation now began to assume a strength and unity which gave the fairest promise of ultimate success . General Dayton was also a conspirator ; and on the 16th of July , 1807 , he writes to Wilkinson thus : - " It is now well ascertained that you are to be displaced next session . Jefferson will pretend to yield reluctantly to the public sentiment ; but yield he will ; prepare yourself , therefore , for it . You know the rest . 27 // You are not the man to despair , or even despond , especially when such prospects offer in another quarter . Are you ready ? Are your numerous associates ready ? Wealth and glory ! Louisiana and Mexico ! I " Again he writes thus - " As you are said to have removed your head-quarters down the river , and there is a report that the Spanish intercept our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in order to reach you , I think proper to address you in cipher , that the contents may be concealed from the Dons , if they make so free as to open the letters . Everything , and even Heaven itself , seems to have conspired to prepare the train for a grand explosion . Are you also ready ? For I know you flinch not when a great object is in view . Your present is more favorable than your late position ; and as you can retain it without suspicion or alarm , you ought by no means to retire from it until your friends join you in December , somewhere on the river Mississippi . Under the auspices of Burr and Wilkinson , I shall be happy to engage ; and when the time arrives , you will find me near you . Write and inform me by first mail what may be expected of you and your associates . In an enterprise of such moment , considerations even stronger than affection impel me to desire your cordial cooperation and active support . " Burr writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus - " I , Aaron Burr , have obtained funds , and have actually commenced the enterprise . Detachments from various points , and under different pretences , will rendezvous on the Ohio , 1st November . Everything external and internal favors our views : protection of England is secured ; T- is going to Jamaica , to arrange with the admiral at that station . It will meet on the Mississippi . England , - Navy of the United States is ready to join , and final orders are given to my friends and followers . It will be a host of choice spirits . Wilkinson shall be second to Burr only . Wilkinson shall dictate the rank and promotion of his officers . Burr will proceed westward , 1st August , never to return ; with him goes his daughter ; the husband will follow in October with a corps of worthies . Send forthwith an intelligent and confidential friend , with whom Burr may confer ; he shall return immediately with further interesting details . This is essential to concert and harmony of movement . Send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains , who may be useful , with a note delineating their characters . " By your messenger send me four or five of the commissions of your // officers , which you can borrow under any pretence you please . They shall be returned faithfully . Already are orders to the contractors given to forward six months ' provisions to points Wilkinson may name . These shall not be used until the last moment , and then under proper injunctions . The project is brought to the point so long desired . Burr guarantees the result with his life and honor , with the lives , the honor , and fortune of hundreds , the best blood of our country . Burr 's plan of operation is to move down rapidly from the falls on the 15th of November , with the first five hundred or one thousand men , in light boats now constructing for that purpose , to be at Natchez between the 5th and 15th of December , then to meet Wilkinson , then to determine whether it will be expedient in the first instance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this send an answer , and draw on Burr for all expenses . The people of the country to which we are going are prepared to receive us . Their agents now with Burr say , that if we will protect their religion , and will not subject them to a foreign power , in three weeks all will be settled . The gods invite to glory and fortune : it remains to be seen whether we deserve the boon . " These letters were written in a cipher known to all three of the parties , Dayton , Wilkinson , and Burr . The organization was not so widely extended as the hints thrown out might lead us to suppose . It is impossible to ascertain , or even approximate to , the number of adventurers whom Burr had engaged ; but they were certainly sufficient , had their plans been conducted with secrecy , to promise success . Had they organized at the mouth of the Ohio , passed rapidly down the Mississippi , and seized New Orleans before it had time to prepare for defence , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every community , would have joined their standard , plundered the banks , secured from the shipping a number of transports , and sailed down into the Gulf on their nefarious expedition , under the specious pretext of revolutionizing Mexico from her ignominious vassalage to Spain . But Jefferson was on the alert ; his vigilance was perhaps not a little quickened by considerations independent of his duties as guardian of the national welfare , and his emissaries were in the Southwest ferreting out the details of the conspiracy . The public had received intimations of what was going on around them ; and , as usual in times of popular excitement , the most absurd rumors were in circulation . // Burr was to seize upon the throne of the Montezumas , and found a magnificent empire . He would then revolutionize the Mississippi valley ; and , succeeding in this , would extend the frontiers of his dominion beyond the Alleghanies , and overthrow the Federal government . The keeper of the Castle of San Juan de Ulloa had sold himself to the conspirators . A force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deposited at Marietta . The idea of dismembering the Federal Union would have been wild and chimerical in the extreme . It is highly probable that Burr may at one time have meditated such a project , though upon his death-bed he solemnly averred that he would as readily have undertaken the conquest and partition of the moon . He certainly sounded upon the subject persons whom he had reason to regard as hostile to Mr. Jefferson , and vauntingly remarked , that with two hundred soldiers he could drive Congress , with the President at its head , into the Potomac ; but it is ridiculous to believe that the preparations on Blennerhassett 's Island were made with any such end in view . Urged on by resentment against an Executive that hated and a people that distrusted him , eager for action and ambitious of power , there can be no question , that , had his means been adequate to the accomplishment of so mighty a purpose , he would not have been deterred from it by any scruples of ( ntegrity . Burr was a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absolved from the imputation rather by visionary , he excellence of his judgment than by the strength of his atriotisun . There would not have been the most remote possibility of success . There had been local irritation in the country , but no widely organized popular discontent . Kentucky had threatened to establish an independent government , but had been quieted upon her admission into the Union . Whilst Louisiana was a province of Spain , the right of deposit had been guaranteed to the Federal States at New Orleans . This right had been suspended by Morales , the agent of Spain , - a measure vitally affecting the interests of Southwestern commerce . Outraged by such an encroachment upon their stipulated rights , the people had threatened the forcible // seizure of New Orleans . For a long time Kentucky had been the most fiercely democratic part of the country . The French Revolution had enlisted the deepest sympathy of the people . Jacobin clubs had been established , and they had been dissatisfied with the neutral and pacific measures of Washington and Adams . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct intervention for preserving the liberties of France . But these feelings had now subsided , the political party they favored was in power , and they gave to the administration of Jefferson a most cordial and active support . Spain had ceded Louisiana to France ; and Bonaparte , on the eve of war , in need of money to conduct it , and perhaps fearful that his tenure of so remote a province would be endangered by the naval superiority of England , was induced to negotiate for its transfer to the United States with Monroe and Livingston , their special ambassadors . Without precise authority to make the purchase , they assumed the responsibib ity , and closed the bargain , which was eventually ratified by Congress . There was a growing confidence throughout the country in the stability of our institutions , public feeling had become tranquilized , and the nation felt that the Confederacy would soon assume a consolidation , strength , and prosperity beyond any former example . The project of Burr was therefore unfortunate in the moment of its conception , - unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruined character of its principal . Wilkinson became frightened at the rumors which now agitated the whole Southwest , turned state 's evidence , and divulged the scheme to the President . A confidential messenger of Jefferson , sent to the scene of the enterprise at Marietta , found Blennerhassett , who , under the delusion that the spy was an accomplice of Burr , reiterated to him in effect the developments of Wilkinson . A proclamation was issued by the Executive , warning the nation of the dangers which threatened it , and calling for the intervention of the judicial authorities . Before it reached Kentucky , " The Western World , " a newspaper of Frankfort , had by some means gotten possession of the details , and unfolded the conspiracy // to the public . Some of the first men of Kentucky were accused of participation iii the plot ; among others , Harry Innes and Judge Sebastian . The latter had previously been arraigned before the House on the charge of being the pensioner of Spain , and the committee of investigation had reported him guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private censure . Burr was now openly accused in " The Western World " of aiming to plunge the country into the horrors of insurrection and civil war . The high position of the parties implicated , the bold confidence with which the charge was made , and the authentic proofs by which it was upheld , threw the people into a state of unprecedented excitement and alarm ; which was still further increased when , Colonel Daviess , United States District Attorney , having made application to Judge Innes for process of attachment , to compel the attendance of Burr to answer to the charge of high misdemeanor in organizing a military expedition against a foreign power with which we were at peace , within the territory and jurisdiction of the United States , Innes overruled the motion . Burr was in Lexington at the time , and , when he received news of the affair , at once hurried to the capital , and voluntarily challenged an investigation of the charge . The case was deferred from day to day , for the attorney to summon his witnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composure . At last , on the 2d of December , 1806 , the grand jury was finally summoned , and the case was to be brought to a couelusive issue . Burr entered the court-room with easy dignity and confidence , attended by his counsel , Henry Clay ,  --  unquestionably the first criminal advocate this country has produced ; for , without the subtle intellect of Calhoun , or the capacious understanding of Webster , in the power of enlisting the sympathies , and infusing into his audience the electric impulse of his own fiery sensibility , he has never been surpassed . Before undertaking the defence , he had exacted a solemn assurance from his client that he was engaged in no enterprise inimical to the laws or peace of the United States . It was readily given in the most explicit and comprehensive terms . The witnesses of Colonel Daviess were not forthcoming , and he // requested a further postponement . Says the historian of Kentucky : " Burr on this occasion remained silent , and entirely unmoved by anything that occurred . Not so his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intermingled with sharp and flashing personalities between Clay and Daviess . Never did two more illustrious orators encounter each other in debate . The enormous mass that crowded to suffocation the floor , the windows , the galleries , and the platform of the judge , remained silent and breathless for hours whilst those renowned and immortal champions , stimulated by mutual rivalry , and each glowing with an ardent conviction of right , encountered each other in splendid intellectual combat . " Judge Innes refused a further postponement , the grand jury retired with the evidence then before them , and returned with " Not a fine bill , " and also handed in a unanimously signed paper of complete exoneration and acquittal . Burr retired from the court-room with the same lofty bearing he had maintained throughout the affair , and thus ended the Kentucky episode of the conspiracy . Justice for a time was baffled , but the public mind was aroused and on the alert . Blennerhassett in the mean time had been superintending the cousfruction of barges up the Ohio . His island was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the executive proclamation , the Virginia militia had been called out , and were now marching toward the island , to seize the barges and munitions of the conspirators . They reached it on the 11th of December , but the expedition had started the midnight previous . Colonel Phelps , their commander , hastened on to the mouth of the Kanawha , by a short route , to intercept them at that point . Sentinels were stationed along the river banks , and fires were kindled at night ; but they escaped his Igilance , floated by under the cover of darkness , and joined Burr , who awaited them at the mouth of the Cumberland . Their united force now consisted of eleven barges , and sixty or seventy men . The proclamation of the President had by this time reached their vicinity , and elicited similar ones from the authorities of the Southwestern States . Their militia were called out , the passes of the Mississippi were fortified , and the country was // in arms , whilst Burr and his valiant army of undisciplined ragamuffins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdity of the whole affair finds its parallel only in the late expedition to Cuba . The condition of Burr soon became desperate in the extreme . Openly accused and hunted by the civil authorities , and befrayed by his accomplices , there must have rushed upon his mind , as he floated down the Mississippi , the fate of an ambitious adventurer from another continent , who , more than two centuries ago , ffound a grave in the depths of that majestic river . The enterprise , conceived in desperation and cupidity , was / now about to end in absurdity and shame . The Governor of Mississippi Territory had issued warrants for the arrest of Burr and his confederates . Burr , having first sunk his arms and ammunition in the river , and destroyed every clew to his warlike designs , landed at Bayou Pierre , and invited an investigation of his affairs . A place of conference was appointed with Judge Rodney of the Supreme Court , who demanded of Burr that his barges should be searched , and his own person surrendered , for trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poindexter , the Attorney-General , insisted that the offences of Burr , having been committed elsewhere , did not come within the jurisdiction of that court . Judge Rodney dissented , and a grand jury was summoned . Poindexter refused to have anything to do with the matter . The jury declined making a presentment . Burr was not yet safe ; and , learning that he was to be seized by military force as soon as he was released from civil custody , he escaped his keepers , and , disguising himself , fled into the interior of Mississippi Territory . Blennerhassett , having been discharged , returned up the Ohio , and was proceeding through Kentucky to his island , but was arrested in Lexington , and carried for trial into Virginia , within whose jurisdiction the overt act of treason was said to have been committed . The barges , with the subordinates of the expedition , had floated down to New Orleans , where they were seized by Wilkinson , and their occupants imprisoned by the same authority . On the 19th of February , Burr was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single companion , Major Ashley , who escaped . The midnight previous they had passed through the village of Wakefield , Alabama . The lateness of the hour and the mysterious conduct of the travellers had excited the suspicion of the sheriff , who followed them to Colonel Hinson 's , in the neighborhood , where they alighted for the night . Burr requested some refreshment of the hostess . The vivacity of his countenance and his courtly de .. meanor soon assured her that she was entertaining no common guest . The sheriff , who entered shortly after , had often heard of the extraordinary lusfre of Burr 's eye , which at that moment , excited by the exercise of his journey , shone with unusual brilliancy ; and he no longer doubted the identity of the celebrated man before him . Knowing his brave character and desperate position , he thought it expedient to go back for assistance . Burr had watched him , and started at daylight , before the sheriff had returned , but was pursued , captured , and sent off under a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , 1807 , the court convened at Richmond , under the presidency of Chief Justice Marshall . It is impossible to trace the events of that memorable occasion without recalling to mind the impeachment of Hastings . The intrinsic and derivative grandeur of Westminster Hall , - the devices of Gothic art , - the forms of procedure , whose origin was lost in the dim twilight and fable of a remote antiquity , - the transcendent talents of audience , advocates , and accusers , - all combined to invest the trial of the English Verres with a species of interest which is wanting to that of the American Catiine ; but in the latter instance the principles involved were no less important , and its termination was fraught with lessons of no less moment . The prisoner at the bar was no ordinary man . Great political influence can not be entirely the result of circumstances , and the dominion which Burr had so powerfully exercised over the men of his generation was not compatible with intellectual mediocrity . He had filled the Vice-Presidency , and was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confidence with which they had honored him , and accused of having sought the downfall and dismemberment of that // Union which he had sworn to support . When he entered the court-room his mien was not that of a guilty man . His step was firm , his person erect and symmetrical . A skilful physiognomist would have detected , in the compressed lip and finely cut nostril , the stern inflexibility of purpose which raises men to power , and , in the keen lustre of his eye , the fertility of expedient which enables them to retain it . He seemed " For contemplation and for valor formed . " His countenance bore the unmistakable superscription of one born to dictate and control . The preliminaries were conducted on the part of Rodney , Attorney-General of the United States , in a manner worthy of the position he occupied . He was at one time the host , and had long been the friend , of Burr ; but he stated in opening , that the natural impulses of private regard must become subordinate to the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his country . Burr had intrusted five eminent lawyers with his defence , but the accused himself was the mainspring of it all , and he handled every defensive legal weapon with masterly skill . Much time was spent in discussing points of law in regard to the admissibility of certain evidence before the grand jury . It required the discrimination of an ingenious casuist to determine precisely how far the offences of Burr came within the jurisdiction of American law ; yet Marshall fully upheld his reputation for justice and clear-headed sagacity . Every point which could give an advantage to either party was pertinaciously contested . The result of the preliminary examination was the commitment of Burr to answer the charge of high misdemeanor . The court convened a gain on the 22d of May , and the jury this time brought in indictments for both treason and misdemeanor ; and Burr was notified to attend and answer to the charges on the following 3d of August . John Randolph of Roanoke was the foreman . Burr plead " Not guilty , " and occupied himself until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in August , much difficulty was experienced in finding a jury . Several panels were necessary to complete the proper number . Such was now the popular feeling in Vir // ginia against Burr , that he was compelled to receive men of known hostility in selecting his jurors , and we venture to say that a more prejudiced jury never pronounced upon a prisoner at the bar . When some objection was made to a proposed candidate , he tauntingly observed , that a sufficient ground for his rejection might be found in his name , which was Hamilton . The remark was conceived in a spirit of illiberality and malice , and would never have escaped the lips of a man of any magnanimity or honor . No change of countenance befrayed the terrible recollection which must at that moment have rushed upon the mind of Burr ; - he merely rejected the candidate , and proceeded to complete the impanelling . After much difficulty , it was finished . Sixty witnesses were examined , and the evidence was sifted on both sides with extraordinary diligence and acumen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely from the heat of a Southern climate . Burr was a man of great physical strength , and , after studying and arranging his defence until near daylight , would snatch a few hours of repose , and appear at the bar fresh and vigorous , giving no indication of the midnight 's toil . For the sake of expedition , he proposed that the court should sit for ten consecutive hours daily . The judge and prosecuting officers shrank from testing their powers of endurance with the iron frame and inflexible will of the accused , and after some discussion they compounded for seven . Yet Burr seems to have found time for other pursuits . Blennerhassett remarks in his journal : " The vivacity of Burr 's wit and the exercise of his proper talents , now constantly solicited here in public and private exhibition , while they display his powers and address at the levee and the bar , must engross more time than he can spare from the demands of other gratifications , while they display him to the eager eyes of the multitude like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm step and manly grace , the pledges of easy victory . " At one stage of the proceedings , Burr rose and stated that he had no desire at the present exigency to derange the affairs of government by demanding the presence of its officers , but that papers known to be in the hands of Mr. Jefferson must // be forthcoming , or he should certainly issue process of attachment , to compel the attendance of the President himself . Such a concession on the part of Jefferson would have been the last resort . Every expedient would have been tried before he would have allowed himself to mount the witness stand and be stretched upon Burr 's inquisitorial rack . That legal anatomist would have laid his subject on the dissecting-board , and , with keen scalpel and steady hand , every ingenious method of torture would have been applied , until Jefferson would have wished himself a heretic , in the more tender clutches of a Romish inquisitor . The prosecution was driven by the potent enginery of executive influence . When we remember the private relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson manifested an unbecoming zeal . The author of the immortal protest for the rights of nations stooped to an ignoble part . The conduct of Burr throughout the trial was commendable in the highest degree . His reputation was ruined , but his life was at stake , and he might yet save himself the final degradation of the gibbet . He abstained from all personality , and enfreated his counsel to do likewise ; he was respectful to the august tribunal before which he was arraigned ; to his accusers he was even courtly , J and his bearing was in all respects worthy of a better cause and a nobler man . - Generals Eaton and Jackson were present as witnesses , to the former of whom Burr had hinted at the dissolution of the Confederacy . Eaton left the grand jury in rage and tears , protesting that his evidence had been probed , sifted , and handled as though he were a villain . Wilkinson had also been summoned , and when he made his appearance in the court-room his bearing is said to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifested a haughty contempt upon being confronted with his perfidious accomplice . Wilkinson was sent in to the jury , where perjury was clearly proved against him . He had altered the celebrated hieroglyphic letter from Burr , deciphered it , and transmitted a translation to the jury , upon oath that it was an exact counterpart of the original . The forgery was detected , and the guilty man forced to make an acknowledgment of his shame . // It would be irrelevant for us to enter into the minute details of the trial in the limited space of a revi'ew article ; but there was one brilliant episode in the imposing drama which is deserving of especial mention . The government had engaged the services of William Wirt , second to no lawyer of f that time , in a State fruitful in splendid legal talents . A motion was made by the counsel of Burr to exclude certain evidence , upon the ground of Burr 's absence from Blennerhassett 's Island during the assemblage of the conspirators , thereby endeavoring to thrust Blennerhassett into the foreground as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The skill of the accomplished rhetorician was made to embellish the learning of the fine jurist and the elegant scholar . The flowers of his exuberant fancy served to conceal the solid strength of his argument , and obstructed the march of his logical deductions . His diction was perhaps too ornate for the occasion , and he manifested an impassioned vehemence that strongly savored of personal hate , though such a feeling was altogether inconsistent with the high-toned magnanimity of Wirt . The secret of his unusual fire is to be found in his thorough conviction of Burr 's guilt , and , as it was justly remarked of Burke , his reason was carried away and made redhot by the impulse of an ardent sensibility . In opening , he characterized the measure as a bold and original stroke in the noble science of defence , indicating the hand of a master , but highly dangerous to the administration of impartial justice , and sanctioned by no precedent in the annals of equity . Its legality was handled in his peculiar rapid and felicitous manner , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shield the principal behind the mere instrument and accessory . In language of Isocratean elegance he depicted the island paradise of the unfortunate Irishman , and invested a wild spot in the Western backwoods with the sunset colorings of romance and poetry . Seldom had his audience listened to such a display of eloquence , and it would have been difficult for them to believe that the glowing pictures existed chiefly in the vivid imagination of the orator . All who listened to his oration , ( for it possessed little compactness or unity as an argument , ) bore witness 28* // to the exquisite grace and the passionate volubility of its flow . The motion was allowed by the Chief Justice , and the jury consulted upon the admitted evidence , and agreed upon the following verdict : " We , of the jury , say that Aaron Burr is not proved to be guilty under this indictment , by any evidence submitted to us . We therefore find him Not guilty . " ' Burr protested that it was an unusual and improper verdict . The judge allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court then took up the indictment for misdemeanor . The prosecution , from the insufficiency of their evidence , moved a discharge of the jury , and the dismissal of the case ; but Burr , now elated by success and confident of victory , insisted upon a verdict . The judge decided for the accused , and the jury , after a short consultation , pronounced a concise and unqualified verdict of " Not guilty . " Burr left the court-room an acquitted and a ruined man . The collateral evidence , decided to be inadmissible to the jury until the overt act of treason was proved by at least two responsible witnesses , was quite sufficient to prove him guilty of high misdemeanor . The verdict on the charge of treason clearly showed that they were satisfied of his criminality , but could not convict him under their instructions . Under the English constitution , where meditated treason is a capital crime , Burr would have suffered the highest penalty of the law . He was ordered to give bail for his attendance in Ohio to answer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was never brought up for trial . The miserable man , completely ostracized in his . native country , sought an asylum in Europe ; but the mark of Cain was on him , and he found himself an outcast and an alien in the land of his forefathers . After wandering four years over Western Europe , he applied for passports to return ; but they were refused by the United States officials , one of whom had assisted in the prosecution at Richmond . Burr submitted to the outrage with characteristic equanimity , and some time afterwards found means to return without their sanction . When he arrived in New York , he was unnoticed . He commenced practising law ; but with little success , for public // confidence in him was destroyed , and men shrank from contact with him as from a leper . Henry Clay , his former advocate , had now become convinced of his guilt , and refused his proffered hand in the Supreme Court . He earned a bare subsistence by his profession . Even at this time , for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was that of a heartless and profligate libertine . It is pleasing to turn from so repulsive a picture , and contemplate the noble youth of 1776 , flushed with collegiate honors , - the hero of Quebec , greeted upon his return with the unanimous " All hail ! " of his admiring countrymen , and like a vigorous athlete , with sinewy limbs and elastic tread , entering the arena of life in which he gave the fairest promise to enact a glorious , an immortal part . At this time he lost his daughter , an only child , who had married Mr. Aliston , and removed with him to South Carolina . She is said to have been a remarkable woman , possessing , in addition to the strong practical sense of her father , that bewitching grace and gentleness which is the peculiar gift of her sex . Upon her father 's return from Europe , she embarked for New York on the Patriot , which was never heard from after leaving Charleston , and is supposed to have been lost in a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time infested the South Atlantic main . All the ordinary consolations of age were denied to Burr . He had no family in which he could seek for happiness and a refuge from public disgrace ; the men of his own generation had nearly passed away , covered with honors and grateful remembrance ; and he was to survive them , clouded in ignominy and shame . At last , in 1836 , he died , and for years there was over his ashes not an epitaph , which is accorded to the obscure , not even a tombstone , which is the privilege of the stranger . When we consider the fundamental and *recognized political axiom , that the best government is that which secures the largest amount of happiness to a people , it becomes a point of reasonable conjecture whether the success of Burr 's enterprise would not have materially benefited Mexico , though there can be little doubt that his government would have been that of an autocrat , - a military despotism . His administra // five talents were great , and though his rule would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic yoke , they might have been more than counterbalanced by the abolition of bloodshed and violence , the protection of property , and the restoration of social order . Burr 's letter to Wilkinson clearly indicates an understanding between the writer and the recipient . Otherwise , Burr was far too sagacious to have committed himself by so direct an acknowledgment of his unlawful enterprise to a man holding high office under the government , whose participation or even tacit sanction would have been a betrayal of the national trust . *Tilkii*son*s conduct toward Burr does not bear the stamp of a noble mind filled with regret at the errors of a misguided friend , but rather of the anxiety of a frightened and perfidious accomplice to clear his own skirts of the affair , even at the sacrifice of his coadjutor and principal . Had Burr addressed him in such familiar terms in the hope that they would presuppose an implication in the project on the part of Wilkinson , an exposure of which would involve the recipient , thereby compelling his secrecy , what would have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have given the letter publicity , and disclaimed participation in the plot ; he would have challenged investigation , and denounced the man who had attempted to coerce him into unlawful measures by the dread of apparent self-crimination , and who , unable to secure his cooperation by the hope of advancement , would at least compel him to silence by the fear of infamy ; and then he would have boldly thrown himself upon his former good name for acquittal and support . Wilkinson was finally guilty of the consummate impudence of sending a messenger to the Spanish Viceroy , demanding the modest amount of two hundred thousand dollars for having saved that country , at great personal sacrifice , from the audacious machinations of Burr , or , as the General characteristically expressed it , " for throwing himself , Leonidas-like , into the Pass of Thermopyla* . " Though he was an accessory to schemes which he must have known were reprehensible , the mention of Blennerhassett awakens emotions of another nature than those with // which the memory of his principal is associated . Ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he died . His wife came back to America to seek indemnity for the outrages committed by the populace upon their beautiful home on the memorable 11th of December . Her claims were eloquently supported by Henry Clay , and would have been allowed by Congress ; but before the bill was passed , they received intelligence from New York of the death of the brokenhearted petitioner . Seldom has romance afforded so dark a tale of misfortune , as reality has woven around the name of Blennerhassett . The passengers on the steamer gliding down the beautiful Ohio crowd the guards in silence , as they approach the island that still bears his name , and seek to find some trace of the paradise described in the passionate language of Wirt . The stately residence was long since burned to the ground , its site is overgrown by the wood bine and wildbrier , and a few giants of the forest , isolated and alone , are the sole memorials of the sylvan beauty that has departed . Aaron Burr was certainly an extraordinary man . Bold to conceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest military commanders the world has ever seen . His mental equilibrium was too finely adjusted to be much disturbed either by success or disaster . As a lawyer , he possessed a marvellous instinct for seizing upon the vulnerable points of an argument ; as a politician , his judgments of character were sagacious , and his skill in arranging the minor details and machinery of an election was invaluable to his party . Wirt speaks of the light and beauty of his conversation , the seductive and fascinating power of his address . The proper field for the successful display of Burr 's remarkable talents was not where a few intrepid minds , in defiance of obloquy and of personal sacrifice , were to make a stand for the great principles of liberty and progress ; but when there was a demand merely for ambition , adroitness , and courage , he would have been among the foremost . Under Charles the Second he would have contested with royalty the smiles of those frail beauties whose images have been preserved to us by the pencil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed him in the frojit rank of those great // captains of the Prussian army , long renowned for being the first tacticians of Europe ; under Lorenzo de ' Medici , his tab ents for diplomatic intrigue might have given Machiavelli some reason to fear the influence he would have exercised over his beloved Italy . Burr 's heart was hard ; his ambition was selfish ; his public life was guided by no fixed principle ; his private life was that of a debauchee . These are the crimes for which he stands arraigned before the judgment of all good men and patriots . The obloquy his memory has had to endure is not so much because he violated the laws of his country , which are local , but because he systematically outraged and set at defiance the broad principles of common honesty and decency , which are universal . It was for this that he fell ignominiously from his high position , became acursed of his race for ever , and his name a by-word and a shaking of the head to the nation ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an example of the evils which may result from the dangerous union of moral depravity and intellectual power , and virtue congratulated itself upon escaping the contaminating presence of a man whom neither public disgrace nor private affliction had contributed in any degree to chasten or to purify . The offences of some other men may have resulted in greater injury to their race ; but the errors of Burr were not those of a lofty and heroic mind , and it requires nothing beyond the ken of human prescience to say , that the age is remote when the most lenient of moralists will venture to urge anything in extenuation of the faults that have darkened his fame . There are two men whose deeds have blackened the page of our national record , and the men of the present generation have shown no disposition to mitigate the sentence which their forefathers passed upon the characters of Benedict Arnold and Aaron Burr . We can not have the pride of remembering that our greatest benefactors have always been honored with office , yet we can justly reflect that ignominy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us.
