Stock Markets . September , STOCK MARKETS . NOTWITHSTANDING that a Stock Market has existed in New-York , to a greater or less extent , for half a century , and has been regulated by a constitution and by-laws since 1820 , stock-jobbing , comparatively speaking , is scarcely known in the United States . It is the offspring of the funding system. , which was introduced into England by William and Mary , as a means of government revenue . Not that debts had not been contracted hy former governments back to the earliest times , but that the system of issuing and registering the evidences of the debt , and providing the means of paying at least the interest , was introduced , in order that the ability of the overnment through improved credit , might extend to larger sums . All the former governments had borrowed and neglected to pay . Henry VIII . robbed monasteries . Elizabeth sold monopolies . Charles I. seized money without law , and sold his promises at church doors to the highest bidder . his restored son became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedient that would supply his wants , and royal credit was utterly destroyed . This credit William restored , and the foundation of the nation 's debt was laid . The charter of the Bank of England was granted in 1695 , and the " moneyed interest " became thenceforth a recognized feature of the body politic . It was at about the same time , 1689 , that Louis XIV . created the first **tontine. *** From that time to the present , public debts and corporations , for banks , for companies , insuring lives and property , canals , manufactories , mines , pawnbrokers , savings ' banks , buildings , and for every possible object for which capital may be associated , has continued to ni ultiply ; and with the multiplication of their stock certificates and evidences of debt , the business of dealing in stocks has continued to increase in importance . The English debt , which commenced with ? 600,000 , of which Charles robbed the London silversmiths , and which was afterwards recognized and funded as a public debt , has since increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , owned by 200,000 recipients of dividends . The aggregate capital of all other corporate companies will reach an equal number-making the almost incalculable amount of eight thousand millions of dollars , in securities negotiable on the London Stock Exchange . These vast amounts of merchantable securities afford an almost limitless field for the operations of unscrupulous speculative genius in command of means , and , accordingly , men have risen upon the London Stock Exchange , developing a power greater than that of most princes . The immense volume of stocks , their imperishable nature-for rarely do any securities disappear entirely from the market  --  and the facility with which their value may be affected by combinations of sales and purchases , by the merest political rumors or reports affecting the credit of companies , that , * Tontines are but little known in this country . By this plan a number of persons , say 100 , subscribe a loan , on condition of which they receive an annuity from the government . This annoity is divided equally among the survivors until the longest liver gets the whole-at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case t'iat a building is created by a company which divides its income in the same manner , unil the whole property ultimately falls to the sole survivor . In New-York and Boston there are instances of this . // for speculative operation , they afford far greater attractions than any other articles of commerce . The strategy , so to speak of the Stock Market , is very similar in its principles to that military system developed by Napoleon , in rapidly concentrating a superior force upon the point of attack . That great chief conquered Europe in establishing this principle , and many a money king has risen in the London world by its skilful use in application to stocks . As in an army a too great supply of force at the desired point defeats the adversary , so in stocks , too great a supply at the proper moment breaks the market to the advantage of the operator . As in military affairs there is a broad distinction between tactics and strategy , so in stock operations there is an immense difference between the mere knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prices , the genuineness of the paper offered , the legal forms requisite to pass titles , and the modes of transfer , and that intellectual scope which , taking in the whole commercial and financial horizon , so combines its operations , as , with the aid of the general movement , to produce important results . To know how to drill soldiers , form companies , regiments and c4Aumns , to advance , to retire , and perform all the evolutions of a modern army , is tactics . To know when and where to do all this is strategies . Thus , to know bow to buy and sell stocks , recognize titles , detect irregularities , make transfers , and adjust settlements , is the tactics of the Stock Exchange . To know when to combine large operations either for sale or purchase , or both , in connection with the general movement of commerce , so that the former may mature at a prosperous moment , and at the latter , at a crisis when holders are glad to realize , is the strategics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine des grandes chances , or " of chances on the long reckoning , " could only have occurred to an extensive dealer in war like Napoleon ; so neither could the grand combinations of the Stock Market have been illustrated by such men as Rothschild , without the extensive creations of floating promises , with which he was surrounded . It is in these operations that the intellectual character of the Exchange has advanced . The mere common-place rogueries that attend the details of the Stock Market , the advantages taken by " cornering " through time contracts , and multifarious false rumors spread to alarm the timid and ensnare the credulous , scem not to have been improved upon in the last 130 years . No sooner had stocks multiplied in number , than the gambling spirit inherent in man fastened upon them as the instruments of play . The avarice of the Duke of Marlborough soon made him a conspicuous operator in connection with Thomas Guy , the Bible contractor , Sir Henry Furness , a director of the Bank of England , and others . Government credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of succession , " with its varying fortunes , caused prices to fluctuate , and Marlborough furnished the earliest news of his operations to his coadjutors , in order to share in the gains effected by them upon the Stock Market ; and it may well be supposed that adverse rumors from head-quarters always preceded the news of victories . A pamphlet , which appeared in 1719 , called " The Anatomy of Exchange Alley , " describes , with great force , scenes which are now daily occurring as well in New-York as in London . That the reputation of the Stock Exchange was sufficiently established in that day , is pretty clear from the following extract from the work mentioned " In a word , they are all a gang of rogues and cheats , and I 'll pay none of them . Besides , my lawyer , Sir Thomas Suhtle , tells me there is not a man of // 254 Stock Markets . them that dares sue me ; no. though 1 had no protection to fly to ; and he states the case thus " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stock at a high price ; East India at 220 , Bank at 160 , South Sea 120 , and the like . Very well . They come to put it upon you , the stock being since fallen . Tell them you can not take it yet ; if they urge your contract . and demand when you will take it , tell them you will take it when you think fit . If they swagger , call names ,  --  as rogue , cheat , and the like ,  --  tell them , as to that , you are all of a fraternity ; there is no great matter in it whether you cheat them , or they cheat you ; t is as it happens in the way of trade ; that it all belongs to the craft ; and , as the Devils broker , Whiston , said to parson Giffbrd , tell them you are all of a trade . If they rage , and tell you the Devil will have you , and such as that , tell them they should let the Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of their business ; but when he comes for you , tell them you would advise them to keep out of the way , or get a protection , as you have against them . " After this , it is supposed they will sue you at law . Then leave it to me ; I 'll hang them up for a year or two in our courts ; and if ever in that time the stock comes up to the price , we will tender the money in court , demand the stock , and saddle the charges of the suit upon them . Let them avoid it if they can . ' * If the whole range of professional tricks as now practiced was exhausted more than a century and a quarter since , the operations upon a grand scale were then not so well developed as now . With the French wars the funding system really pi*t forth its strength , and the giants of the Stock Exchange stalked forth to astonish the world with the success of their combinations . The name of John Law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper money bubble , although it embraced all that is known of the nature of that instrument of fraud at the present day . The great loan contractors , on whose operations the march of armies and the destinies of empires depended , rose with the circumstances that called them forth . Abraham Goldsmith , Rothschild , IRicardo , Barings and their compeers , are the men of the present century . A late English work thus describes the House of Barings " It has been stated ,  --  but as the writer is uncertain of his authority , he gives it with caution ,  --  that they were originally German weavers , who came over to London , and , being successful in business , were , through the interest of William Bingham , of Philadelphia , appointed agents to the American government . Consilering , therefore , the large resources at their command , it is not surprising that , during the loyalty loan in 1797 , the head of the house made one hundred thousand pounds for three consecutive days ; or that , in 1806 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases so largely in Hampshire , that he soon expects to be able to inclose the country with his own park paling . ' " In 1 805 this gentleman , the first algebraist of the day , retired from business with a princely fortune , and shortly afterwards died , full of years and honors . A green old age , a career closed at the pinnacle of prosperity , and a death-bed surrounded by sons and daughters . whom the descendant of the German weaver had lived to place in splendid independence , was his enviable lot . The great commercial house which he had raised to so proud a position was continued by his sons , and may be considered the most important mercantile establishment in the empire . Freehold estates to the amount of half a million , besides enormous personal property , rewarded his great capacity , and his yet greater integrity . // " The house of Baring , notwithstanding some periods when doubt and almost dismay hung over it , yet retains the power and position hequeathed by Sir Francis ; and , as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be mentioned that the late Lord Ashburton , when bearing , as Sir Robert Peel feeling expressed it , the honored name of Alexander Baring , realized ? 170,000 in two years by his combinations in French Rentes . " The most eminent loa&amp;contractor of the world was N. M. Rothschild , and of this person we have the following sketch " By his own report , Nathan Meyer Rothschild came to Manchester because Frankfort was too small for the operations of the brothers , although the immediate cause was some offence to a customer ; and it is characteristic of the intrepidity of the man , that , with scarcely any hesitation , and with an absolute ignorance of the English language , he came to the country in which he realized such great results . On Tuesday he told his father he would go to England , and on Thursday he started . With ? 20,000 be commenced his career ; and in a short time his capital was trebled . At Manchester he soon saw there were three profits to be made ,  --  in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It need hardly be added , that his great mind had stomach for them all , and that , having secured the three , he sold goods cheaper than any one else . This was the foundation of that colossal fortune , which afterwards passed into a proverb ; and , in 1800 , finding Manchester too small for the mind which could grapple with three profits , Rothschild came to London . It was the period when such a man was sure to make progress , as , clear and comprehensive in his commercial views , he was also rapid and decisive in working out the ideas which presented themselves . Business was plentiful ; the entire Continent formed our customers ; and Rothschild reaped a rich reward . " The name of Rothschild , as contractor for an English loan , made its first public appearance in 1819 . But the twelve millions for which he then became responsible went to a discount ; it was said , however , that Mr. Rothschild had relieved himself from all liability before the calamity could reach him . From this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New World alike bore witnes ' * to his skill ; and with the profits on a single loan he purchased an estate which cost . ? 150,000 . Minor capitalists , like parasitical plants , clung to him , and were always ready to advance their money in speculations at his bidding . Nothing seemed too gigantic for his grasp ; nothing too minute for his notice . His mind was as capable of contracting a loan for millions , as of ' calculating the lowest l ) ossible amount on which a clerk could exist . Like too many great merchants , whose profits were counted by thousands , he paid his assistants the smallest amount for which he could procure them . He became the high-priest of the temple of Janus ; and the coupons raised by the capitalist for a despotic state were more than a match for the cannon of the revolutionist . From most of the speculations of 1824 and 1825 , Mr. Rothschild kept wisely aloof . The Alliance Life and Fire Assurance Company , which owes its origin to this period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its great success is a proof of his forethought . None of the loans with which he was connected were ever repudiated ; and when the crash of that sad period came , the great Hebrew looked coolly and calmly on , and congratulated himself on his caution . At his counting-house a fair price might be J ) rocured for any amount of stock , which , at a critical time , would have depressed the public market ; and it was no uncommon circumstance for brokers to apply at the office of Mr. Rothschild , instead of going to the Stock Exchange . " He was , however , occasionally surpassed in cunning , and , on one occasion , a great banker lent Rothschild a million and a half on security of consols , die price of which was then eighty-four . The terms on which the money was lent were simple . If the price reached seventy-four , the banker might claim the stock at seventy ; but Rothschild felt satisfied that , with so large a sum out of the market , the bargain was tolerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew as Rothschild , had a plan of his own . He immediately began selling the // consols received from the latter , together with a similar amount in his own possession . The funds dropped ; the Stock Exchange grew alarmed ; other circumstances tended to depress it ; the fatal price of seventy-four was reached ; and the Christian banker had the s*tisfaction of outwitting the Hebrew loanmonger . " But , if sometimes outwitted himself , there is little doubt he made others pay for it ; and , on one occasion , it is reported thaj his finesse proved too great for the authorities of the Bank of England . Mr. Rothschild was in want of bullion , and went to the governor to procure on loan a portion of the superfluous store . His wishes were met , the terms were agreed on , the period was named for its return , and the affair finished for the time . The gold was used by the financier , his end was answered , and the day arrived on which he was to return the borrowed matal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and those who remember his personal appearance may imagine the cunning twinkle of his small , quick eye , as , ushered into the presence of the governor , he handed the borrowed amount in bank-notes . He was reminded of his agreement , and the necessity for bullion was urged . His reply was worthy a commercial Talleyrand . Very well , gentlemen . Give me the notes ! I dare say your cashier will honor them with gold from your vaults , and then I can return you bullion . ' To such a speech the only worthy reply was a scornful silence . " One cause of his success was the secrecy with which he shrouded all his transactions , and the tortuous policy with which he misled those the most who watched him the keenest . If he possessed news calculated to make the funds rise , he would commission the broker who acted on his behalf to sell half a million . The shoal of men who usually follow the movements of others , sold with him . The news soon passed through Capel Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . Men looked doubtingly at one another , a general panic spread , bad news was looked for , and these united agencies sunk the price two or three per cent . This was the result expected ; and other brokers , not usually employed by him ; bought all they could at the reduced rate . By the time this was accomplished , the good news-had arrived , the pressure ceased , the funds arose instantly , and Mr. Rothschild reaped his reward . " But it was not an unvaried sunshine with this gentleman . There were periods when his gigantic capital seemed likely to be scattered to the four quarters of the globe . He lost half a million in one english operation ; when the French entered Spain in 1823 , he was also in the utmost jeopardy ; but . perhaps , the most perilous position in which he was placed was with the Polignac loan , although his vast intelligence again saved him , and placed the burden on the shoulders of others . With this , however , he suffered greatly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Rothschild could use when his anger overbalanced his discretion , was a license allowed to his wealth ; and he who , when placed in a position which almost compelled him to subscribe to a pressing charity , could exclaim , Here , write a check ,  --  -J have made one-fool of myself ! ' was courted and caressed by the clergy , was feted and flattered by the peer , was treate ( l as an equal by the first minister of the crown , and more than worshipped by those whose names stood foremost on the roll of a commercial aristocracy . His mode of dictating letters was characteristic of a mind entirely absorbed in money-making ; and his ravings , when he found a bill unexpectedly protested , were translated into mercantile language ere they were fit to meet a correspondent 's eye . It is painful to write thus depreciatingly of a man who possessed so large a developmemitof brain ; but the golden gods of England have many idolaters , and the voice of truth rarely penetrates the private room of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be serviceably held up as a wari*ing . There was , however , an occasional gleam of humor in him , sternly as his thoughts were devoted to heaping up riches . I em as much as you , ' he said to the Due de Montmorenci , when his title was // granted : you style yourself the first Christian baron , and I am the first Jew baron . ' " The honor enjoyed by the father , being the first Jew baron , has been extended in the person of the son , who is the first Jew elected to Parliament , although his seat is being hotly contested . He recently appeared in the House of Commons , presented his credentials , and demanded to be sworn upon the Old Testament . This gave rise to a fierce debate , not yet terminated . The unscrupulous conduct of Rothschild is characteristic of most eminent dealers in stocks , and distinguishes them from other classes of dealers . The maxim that " all is fair in war , " applies also , it would seem , to stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that of the world at large . There are , however , very few men who arrive at the eminence which marked the career of the persons named . The London Stock Exchange embraces some five thousand members , a majority of whom fail . It is " Governed by a committee of twenty-eight , with a chairman and deputychairman , annually elected by the members . Their power to expel , suspend , or reprimand is absolute ; their decision final ; and that decision , adds one of the rules , must be carried out forthwith . ' In cases of expulsion , the committee should not consist of less than twelve ; and of these , at least two-thirds must concur in the sentence . No bill or discount broker , no clerk in any public or private establishment ,  --  excepting those to the members of the Stock Exchange ,  --  no one in business , either in his own name or in that of his wife , can be received as a member . Every applicant must be recommended by three members of two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 for two years The committee meets every alternate Monday , at one o'clock ; but a special meeting may at any time be called by the chairman and deputychairman , or by any five members . Brokers and jobbers , or dealers , as they are politely termed , are not allowed to enter into partnership ; and , when a defaulter is excluded , his clerk is excluded with him . " Directly the books are closed at the Bank of England , the price of stocks , excepting only bank stock , is quoted without the dividend . When a defaulter , or one who can not or will not pay the just claims on him , is posted , a libel is avoided by the following words : - Any person transacting business with A. B. , is requested to communicate with C. D. ' " The rules of the Stock Exchange amount in number to 159 , and are calculated to meet every difficulty . The charge to the public for buying and selling English stock is 2s. 6d. per cent . " The terms used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a century ; and the origin of many may be traced to the early transactions in the stock of the East In ( lia Company . Buying for the account has been described ; but bull and bear , ' backardation ' and continuation , ' are , inderstood only by the initiated . " Bull ' is a term applied to those who contract to buy any quantity of government securities , without the intention or ability to pay for it ; and who are obliged , therefore , to sell it again , either at a profit or loss , before the time at which they have contracted to take it . " Bear ' is a term applied to a person who has agreed to sell any quantity of the public funds , of which he is not possessed , being , obliged , however , to deliver it against a certain time . Lame Duck ' is applied to those who refuse or are unable to fulfil the contracts into which they have entered . " Backardation ' is a consideration given to keep back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time than for money . " Continuation ' is a premium given when the price of funds in which a peraun has a jobbing account open is higher for time than for money , and the // 258 Stock Markets . settling day is arrived , so that the stock must be taken at a disadvantage . In this case a per percentage is paid to put off the settlement , and continue the account open . Jobber ' is applied to those who accommodate buyers and sellers of stock with any quantity they require . The dealer or jobber 's profit is generally oneeighth per cent . The Broker ' is the person employed by the public to sell or purchase stock at a certain per percentage . " Omnium ' is a term used to express the aggregate value of the different stocks in which a loan is usually funded . " Scrip ' is embryo stock , before the whole of the instalments are paid . " The Londou Exchange has two classes of dealers  --  the jobbers and brokers . The latter are supposed only to fulfil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy or sell at a price . These occupy a particular place on the Exchange . A broker goes to that corner of the Stock Exchange where the business of the particular stock in which he wishes to deal is generally transacted ; he asks of a single jobber the buying and selling prices ; in au instant he is surrounded by the whole herd of that class of jobbers : if he finds that the price will not allow of his operation being done , he retires with closed lips ; otherwise , he either effects it at once , or if the prices are near his limits , he remains hanging about the market until the fluctuations allow him to earn his commission . The New-York Stock Board , as it is called , is essentially different from the London " House " in its operations . There is no field for those extensive combinations which , as in the case of the elder Baring , would yield a profit of a million and a half in three days . Such a profit would require to realize three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the federal government . ' Nor is the market here so extensive as to permit rival Rothschilds to outwit each other in the sale of tens of millions . The transactions are comparatively very limited , and confined mostly to speculations among brokers , who combine the functions of jobbers and brokers . There are no crowds of wealthy nobles and landlords resident at the commercial emporium , drawing immense revenues from every working arm in the country to one common centre for investment . Here , every locality earus and employs its own surplus . There is no national debt , comparatively speaking , to concentrate the means of the whole country for a national object . The whole principal debt of the federal government is less than half of the annual interest on the English debt . The stocks which arc negotiable in the New-York market are nearly all local , and their utmost aggregate value will not reach two per cent . of the amount of English stocks negotiable in London . There is , therefore , comparatively no ground to support the growth of such gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the probability is , that there never will be , because there is now no machinery by which to concentrate the earnings of the whole country upon a focus . The old federalist national bank system , the internal improvement system , and the protective system , &amp;c. , were all devised to produce such an effect , by building up a great and overwhelming money power , against which , labor might in vain struggle for emancipation . All those projects have been abandoned , with the exception of the last , which still has adherents among a portion of the people , who , in spite of experience , listen to the sophis // try of those who pretend that it is labor , and not capital , which is sought to be protected . The English court journals are filled with the descriptions of the splendid costume of the daughter of the American minister* who , among duchesses and peeresses , was presented to the Queen , vieing even with her majesty in costly apparel . All this display of the American Croesus resulted from what protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of the operatives who earned that wealth under those laws have the means of subsistence without constant and daily labor . The existing constitution of the New-York Stock Exchange was revised in 1820 , and has therefore operated for more than thirty years . Its rules provide that no person shall be eligible to a seat , who has not been a broker one year , or a clerk with some member for ten years immediately preceding his election . He must be proposed by some member , at least ten days before the election . The votes are by ballot , and three black balls excludes him . When elected , he is notified of the fact , and must pay four hundred dollars admission fee . The theory of the business is , that all the members buy and sell on commission ; but the practice varies so much , that probably not five per cent . of the transactions are really of that character . Where the quantity of stock in the hands of the community is very large , and divided among a great number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them would wish to have stocks sold or purchased every day , and would give an order to a broker for that purpose . For this service , he must . charge one quarter of one per cent : but they sometimes evade this requisition on behalf of speculating customers , by charging one-fourth per cent . for buying and selling it for them for nothing . All the members of the board are required to take the bids of any member , and can not raise the question of his ability to meet the contract , but they may require on a time contract a deposit of ten per cent . Hence , when a " weak " man accepts an offer , an expressive " ten up ! " warns him of his shattered credit , while it protects the responsible bidder . A broker who fails in his contracts is suspended until he makes settlement . A committee of five investigate his accounts , and report the result , when a vote of twothirds of the members present reinstates him , unless his failure was caused by speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons . This rule is , however , seldom enforced . The defaulting broker may , however , surrender his principal by one o'clock on the day of contract , and the other party is allowed until five o'clock to accept him , and release the broker or not . When the board assembles , usually at half-past 10 , A. M. , to adjourn at 12 , M. , the president , who is chosen annually , and enjoys a salary of $2,000 per annum , c6mmences calling a list of all the stocks bought and sold at the board , and as each stock is called , offers to sell and buy on every possible variety of terms are made , amid a din and confusion that would perfectly bewilder a stranger . Of these offers , none are made under $500 , and no bid tendered less than one-quarter per cent. , unless for sums above $1000 . While this calling and bidding pro6resses , any person leaving the room , or interrupting the calling , or coming in , or absent , is fineable by the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are time contracts , which neither in England nor New-York are legal . Sales are made for " cash , " to be delivered and paid for immediately after the board- " regular way , " to be delivered and paid for on the following day , or at the option of the // 260 buyer , within a certain number of days mentioned , from three days to twelve months , or at the option of the seller . The contract may be closed at a day 's notice , either by buyer or seller , the buyer always paying interest from the date of the contract to the delivery of the stock . As very many of the brokers are possessed of cash means very little proportioned to the amount of their operations , the whole turns upon the privilege of drawing checks upon some bank where they have no money , the checks to be made good before three o'clock . Thus , if a broker has twenty contracts come due , as seen as a stock is transferred to him , he gives his cheek for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more , and he may not have $1000 in bank when he draws them . The stock he receives , however , has been already sold , and Li immediately transfers it to the buyer , and receives his check , which he either collects , or has " certified " at the bank on which it is drawn . All these are deposited against the checks he drew in the morning , making his account good , and something over , if his operations were successful . On this system , if a speculator gives an order to buy or sell on time , when the contract comes due , the broker takes in the stock in his own name , and sells it again by this check system . Sometimes when stocks have been sold , and the buyers demand them , they may be too high to buy in at a profit . In this case , the stock is " borrowed ; " that is to say , the market price is paid for it , the stock to be returned when called for , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the chances of a fall . If there is a profit , he deducts the commissions , and pays over the balance , and he generally requires a deposit from the client , to secure him against loss . These transactions are , however , illegal , and it has occurred that speculators , under cover of an infamous law , have turned round and sued the broker for the deposit . Many serious losses have been sustained by the check system . Persons have been known to pay out checks for stock , sell the stock , draw the money , and walk off , leaving the checks to look out for themselves . There being no legal obligation for time contracts , and the hazards being immensely great , the extremest caution and prompt dealing are requisite to raise the credit of a broker so that his contracts and checks will be freely taken ; and the history of the market shows that there are very few who do not fail , sooner or later . Thus , in 1840 , the funds of the New-York board having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was resolved to divide this among the sitting members . The money was not given , but loaned without interest , to be called for by vote of the board , at sixty days notice . It was found that ninety.one members were entitled to it , but of these , thirty had failed within the previous twelve months , and only twelve had continued solvent foi five years , and a very considerable portion of those ninety-one members have since lost their standing . This fact illustrates the great hazards of the business . In fact , since the great speculative years of 1835 ,  --  36 , the operations of the Stock Market have dwindled to a very comparatively unimportant point . When these members assemble to transact immense moneyed operations , it would naturally be inferred that their deportment would be grave , or at least sedate ; but , on the other hand , the very spirit of frolic and mischief seems to possess the whole , from the white haired veteran to the tyro , and endless practical jokes are perpetrated without hesitation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of the British Stock Exchanger varied by that inherent , cowardly bru // tality so characteristic of John Bull when he can oppress with impunity . The following anecdote is given in illustration , from the work already alluded to I turned to the right , and found myself in a spacious apartment , which was nearly filled with persons more respectable in appearance than the crew I had left at the door . Curious to see all that was to be seen , I began to scrutinize the place and the society into which I had intruded . But I was prevented from indulging the reflections which began to suggest themselves , by the conduct of those about me . A curly-haired Jew , with a face as yellow as a guinea , stopped plump before me , fixed his black , round , leering eyes full on me , and exclaimed , without the slightest anxiety about my hearing , So help me Got , Mo , who is he P Instead of replying in a straightforward way , Mo raised his voice as loud as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred new fives ! ' A hundred voices repeated the mysterious exclamation : Fourteen hundred new fives ! ' Where , where-fourteen hundred new fivesnow for a look ; where is he ? Go it , go it !

And then Mo , by way of proceeding to business , repeating the war-cry , staggered sideways against me , so as almost to knock me down . My fall , however , was happily prevented by the kindness of a brawny Scotchman , who , humanely calling out , Let the mon alone , ' was so good as to stay me in my course with his shoulder , and even to send me back towards Mo with such violence , that , had he not been supported by a string of his friends , he must infallibly have fallen before me . Being thus backed , however , he was enabled to withstand the shock , and to give me a new impulse in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with another hoist as before , and 1 found these two worthies were likely to amuse themselves with me , as with a shuttlecock , for the next quarter of an hour . I struggled violently to extricate myself from this unpleasant situation , and , by aiming a blow at the Jew , induced Moses to give up his next hit , and allow me for a moment to regain my feet .
