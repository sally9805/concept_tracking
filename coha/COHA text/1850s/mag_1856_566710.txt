txt ART . V.-IS THE PULPIT LOSING ITS POWER * THE Pulpit is the right arm of Christianity . Whatever affects its purity or its power should command the instant attention of the churches , and especially of their teachers and guides . The apprehension that the pulpit in the present age is losing the effectiveness which once characterized it , is becoming too general and too painful to be overlooked . The description of the deterioration complained of is far from uniform , and the remedies proposed are as various almost as the voices that have spoken . Perhaps we shall aid our readers in the investigation . of the subject , by collecting some of the numerous utterances which have arrested our own attention . The eminent Dr. Spring , in his work on the " Power of the Pulpit , " in a most earnest chapter on ministerial education says : " We have intimated that the pulpit is less powerfui than it was in the days of our fathers , and this acknowledgment. // comes to us from . quarters from which it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in announcing the monAiful fact . " One of the most venerable and experienced teachers in the Theological Seminary at Princeton makes the following faithful statement on this subject , in an address to the students in that institution , which has been read with great interest , and has given great satisfaction , both to the churches and pastors . Says Dr. Miller : A little more than three-quarters of a century ago , there was a considerable number of ministers in the Presbyterian Church in this country , who deserved to be called illustrious ; men at once eminent for the fervor of their piety , the activity of their teal , the vigor of their talents , the extent of their erudition , and their commanding influence . The generation of ministers next to them were as a body little if any less distinguished . But , I ask , have we an equally illustrious list to show at this hour , in proportion to our greatly augmented numbers and advantages ? It would rejoice my heart if I could think it possible . We can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to deem it possible . The most mortifying facts of a contradictory character stare us in the face . ' " Dr. Spring then quotes from Professor Park , of Andover , the sentence : " The effectiveness of the pulpit in comparison with other efficiencies , has declined among us to an alarming extent within the last fifty years . " The cause , or at least one prominent cause of this deterioration , in the opinion of Dr. Spring , is to be found in the modern Seminary system of theological education , which produces learning and intellectual finish , rather than piety , practical wisdom , or true ministerial strength . The remedies he proposes are , a more faithful and truly pastoral supervision of the young men in Theological Seminaries , and by that means a more thorough sifting of their qualifications for the sacred work ; and the filling of theological professorships exclusively with men of proved devotedness , of ripe experience , and of distinguished success in the pastoral office . What are the causes and the remedies of the evil in question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are not informed . In the New York Observer of Dec. 30th , 1852 , a remarkable series of articles on the Degeneracy of the Modern Pulpit , was introduced with the following among other editorial remarks : " We have for some time past been inclined to fear that there is a tendency among the junior preachers in the orthodox pulpit . to ignore the system embraced in the doctrines of grace , // and to substitute an intellectual , sentimental and humanitarian divinity , in the place of repentance , faith , and the great atonement . As Daniel Webster said , they take a text in the Bible and preach out of the newspapers , instead of addressing the heart and conscience of men with those gospel truths which are as essential to salvation as air to animal life . But before venturing to make any remarks , we addressed a letter to a venerable clergyman , whose position , acquaintance and wisdom would enable him to speak advisedly and prudently . We invite attention to his discriminating and judicious reply . " The seat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly indicated . The doctrines of the Cross are ignored , and a system , the product of human reason , substituted in their place . Any one acquainted with the Observer can easily develop this idea , and point out the remedy required . From the letter thus introduced , and which we may be permitted to state , came from the theological chair in New Haven , we quote as follows : " I am well convinced that the preaching of the Congregational ministry of Connecticut , has within these some years past changed for the worse . " The doctrines of grace are not as they once were , stated , explained , proved , dwelt on as themes for sermons , used as the word which has spirit and life . Instead of this , the tendency has been to rhetorical excellence , to novel and ingenious , and especially original modes of exhibiting truth , to adopt themes that shall entertain , instead of the old worn-out and disgusting topics of doctrinal theology . Theology is getting out of date , at least with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pulpit is the place for Ilowers and flourish , not to say the clouds and nebulosity of transcendentalism . The people must be made to wonder and gaze , and to be attracted , and if truth willuot do it , presented in its naked simplicity and power , it must be hyperbolized into falsehood , or monstrosities . For some years I have been talking on the subject with ministers , and young men destined to the ministry , but , as I fear , to little purpose . Fashion , the popular taste and standard , are against me . The causes of the change need investigation . I should be highly gratified to see a thorough discussion of it by one able to do it justice . I have often conversed with some ) f our older ministers concerning it , whose views , I am sure , correspond with my own. ** These extracts will sufficiently indicate the views of Dr. Taylor . We may , however , remark , that although he concurs in the expression used by the Observer , that the doctrines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grace something a little different from that which is in the mind of the Observer . That journal means the simple gospel of the Westminster Assembly , free from any philosophy , save the philosophy of hyper-conservatism ; while Dr. Taylor means the gospel as illustrated and vindicated by his own philosophical system , and commended to every man 's intelligence and conscience by its intrinsic reasonableness . The letter of Dr. Taylor , with the remarks of the editor , drew out a series of communications from a correspondent to us unknown , who begins by fully endorsing the views already expressed as to the deterioration of the pulpit . He says to the editors- " The great body of that class of ministers and Christians who constitute the salt of the earth , ' thank you for the timely and effective manner in which you have called attention to the subject . Your Connecticut correspondent has indeed drawn a startling and melancholy picture of the existing tendency and fashion within his circle of observation . But to the best of my knowledge and belieS he has not overdrawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " It is one of the unfavorable circumstances of the present nay , that there is a decline in the spirit and power of preaching . " He also quotes , through Dr. Woods , from Professor Shepard of Bangor , observations such as these : " It seems to be generally admitted that the pulpit has not the power it once had . Both in deep piety , and sound practical talent , there seems to be a falling off . " " Another unfavorable circumstance , " says Dr. Woods , " is an abatement in the fullness and strength of doctrine . Another enfeebling device is , to mix the truth with something else . The intellect insists upon showing itself in some curious feats . There must be a display . There is an effort to make literary sermons , intellectual sermons , great sermons . The hearers feel it  --  the pious and discerning mourn over it . There is a sad missing of the great object of preaching , viz , to meet men 's souls with God 's truth . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this state of things ; and he concludes that " the deep and fundamental cause of the evil , to which both people and priest are accessory , most manifestly is , a decay of viUd piety , in other words , of faith in God and his word . Whether the people in reality love this flashy rhetoric and sky-rocket brilliancy better than truth , or whether they reluctantly patronize it , as the most promising means , in the public taste , of building up congregations , or whether ministers for like reasons run into it , they all alike // betray unbelief in the perfection of God 's character , word , and ordiances . " Of course , the fundamental remedy for all this , in the view of this writer , is , " a higher tone of piety among the ministers and Churches . 0 how greatly does the Church in this , and all her other interests , need a plentiful effusion of the Spirit . " The Observer informs us that during the progress of this discussion , very numerous testimonies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various and the highest sources . Substantially harmonious with the above , though taken from a different stand-point , are the views of Dr. Hawes , as given in his sermon before the Albany Convention , Oct. , 1852 . Some of his words are these " Preaching may be learned , may be eloquent , may be very interesting and stirring as an exhibition of talent and genius , and yet have no claim whatever to the character of evangelical preaching . It may discourse elegantly and forcibly on moral topics , it may discuss the nature and destiny of man as rational and immortal , the law and government of God , the guilt and punishment of sin , and the retributions of a future judgment ,  --  all subjects of importance and not to be excluded from their proper place in the instructions of the pulpit , and yet , there may be in all this so little reference to Christ and him crucified ; so little of the peculiar spirit of the gospel as a system of mediation and mercy for lost men , that it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evangelical in its character . And here , there can be no doubt , lies a chief defect in the preaching of the present day . It does not give sufficient prominency to Christ , to his person , to his character , to his work in giving himself to die for the sins of the world . It dwells not enough on topics immediately connected with the atoning sacrifice and mediation of Christ , and the subjects which it does discuss are not viewed sufficiently in their relation to Christ . But the preaching which is essentially defective in this particular , can not deserve the name of evangelical preaching , nor can it convince of sin , nor bring the soul to Christ , nor build it up in joy , in faith , and hope . It is not owned of God as his wisdom and power unto salvation . " This language speaks for itself The evil and the remedy , in the judgment of Dr. Hawes , need no clearer indication . In the Presbyterian Review for September , 1855. is an interesting article entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This article opens with the declaration , that " a less than intimate acquaintance with the condition of American // Christendom , as to its ministry , is sufficient to convince any unprejudiced and thinking man , that our pulpit is not now equal to the work which it is its office to perform , the work which the church expects , and which the condition of the world demands that it should accomplish . " After adding that in expressing this opinion , he speaks not for himself alone , but for many of his brethren who are masters in Israel , this writer proceds to notice the various and partially conflicting views upon this subject , which different writers express . " Some denominations are calling for more learning in the pulpit , while others seem ready to allow it to be superseded if only unction can be secured . Some cry out for the entire abandonment of " Notes ; " much more of the completely written discourse ; while others tenaciously contend for the presence and even the rigid use of the manuscript . One writer asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let us have a return , says one , of the old expository style of presenting truths ; the finished , essay , says another , is more in keeping with the intellectual conditions of the age . Thus some are saying one thing , some another , while all agree in demanding a change in the preaching of the present . " This writer does not propose to show conclusively the causes or the remedy for the evil which he deplores ; he rather seeks to awaken attention and provoke the investigations of others . He remarks , however , that " we can not spare from our pulpit any of its learning ; " and that " our pulpit needs adaptation 1*p the mind and heart of society . " Under the latter head are some suggestions on the subj ect of unwritten sermons , to which we desire to call attention . He says , very forcibly , " Reading is not preaching . Will an advocate who conducts the cause of an alledged murderer , content himself with reading a stale , dry learned law paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? We object not to the written sermon , if it be composed as a sermon ,  --  - composed , we nmean , in the midst of all the excitement of the public occasion preconceived , brought into existence beforehand , in the study , by the student 's imagination , preached as one might say , to his people sitting before his mental eye , hanging upon his lips for words of life , their various states and needs rising up before him ; preached from the overflowings of a burdened , ardent , believing mind , and then transferred to the pages of the manuscript to be preached again ou the Sabbath . On no other terms , as we believe , is the manuscript , the entirely written sermon , admissible ; and if a man can not do this , if he has not power enough to preach in his // study , to call up his congregation before him by a stroke of genius , we strongly urge him to study and to practice the extempore art . There will then be hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will occasionally escape from his mind , and that thus a little relief will be obtained from the written , frigid , powerless essay . We presume to advise our brethren of the ministry to throw themselves more upon their Own lingual resources , at least once upon the Lord 's day , as well as at the weekly lecture . " We have now to present some expressions of views , quite from a different quarter and not altogether harmonious with those already noticed . They are from a.discourse delivered to the Alumni of Andover Theological Seminary , at its anniversary in 1851 , by the Rev. Worthington Smith , ID . D. , then President of Burlington College , but now gone to his rest . We quote from a synopsis of this remarkable discourse , in the Independent . The text ,  --  " If I have told you of earthly things and ye believe not , how shall ye believe if I tell of heavenly things ? " yielded as a subject , " the true metlwd of religious inquiry and instruction . " Upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their light . ( 1 . ) " Certain elements of religious truth may be assumed as potentially present in the great end of his own coming . ( 2 . ) Christian knowledge is progressive , and follows the law of growth , ex*mplifled in the things of life . Nothing is truth to us , except as it awakens into a conscious state those germs of truth which exist in every mind . ( 3 . ) The higher truths of religion can be apprehended only as we begin with the more simple and obvious . The beginning of the gospel is to be found , in an important sense , in our own breasts . ( 4 : . ) The true method of religions inquiry requires that Divine truth become subjective . Assent is not enough , nor necessarily leads to the inward knowledge required . An inward , imperishable conviction is needed , by which the heart receives the testimony . . . . Inferences. ( 1 . ) The validity and force of the a priori method of investigating truth . By ignoring it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system to an aggregate . ( 2 . ) Not to dis . parage the aid of Reason . Nor does this disparage Revelation , whose office is to call forth and answer questions from within . ( 3 . ) In imparting religious instruction to men , not to invert the order of Divine truth . ( 4 . ) The chief reason why the higher truths of religion are so often rejected . It is because the work is not begun within , that errors have so extensively prevailed . // Many cavil against the truths of religion for no other reason than that they have not been led forward to them from first and acknowledged principles . ( 5 . ) The inexcusableness of those who reject those first principles . The truth is nigh thee 0 man , in thine own soul , in these first principles . Wilt thou say , I had no Bible , ' God will answer , thou needest none . ' Wilt thou say , I could not reconcile Reason with Scripture , nay , Scripture with itself , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , but only to reconcile thyself to God . ' In your own heart lie first principles which , if rightly used , will carry you on to salvation . ( 6 . ) The source whence is to come the revival of that power of the pulpit over the popular mind , which is to introduce the final triumph of religion . Never were the altars of the Church loaded with such wealth of learning and sdiolarship , and cultivated taste , and artistic power , as at present . Yet never did the mind of Christendom show less subjection to its influence than now . The people have been elevated , and he who would move them must begin within . Until thc preacher becomes the interpreter of the soul as well as of the Word , the pulpit will fail to assert its true powers . " It will be seen at a glance , that the philosophy of preaching , in the view of President Smith , is widely different from that embraced by nearly all the writers previously quoted . The two views thus indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Divine and human , and they constitute the two most important phases of the general subect . The grand problem is rightly to estimate , and thus to harmonize , these two ideas . Whatever opinions men may hold concerning the pastor of the Plymouth Church in Brooklyn as a preacher , and whatever may be his real merit , the extent to which he commands the popular ear renders his theory and practice worthy of study . A recent utterance of his , in the form of a letter to the Independent , from the scene of his early ministry in the West , has attracted the writer 's attention . He says : " In this room we preached the first real sermon that we ever uttered . We had delivered hundreds before , but till then the sermon was the end , and not the means . We had a vague idea that truth was to be preached , and that then it was to be left to do its work , under God 's blessing , as best it might . The results were not satisfying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Apostles ' days ? Why should it be a random and unrequited effort ? These thoughts gr*ew , and the want of fruits was so painful , that we determined to make a careful examination of the Apostles ' preaching , to see what it was that made it so imme // 417 mediately efficient . We found that they laid a foundation first , of historical truth , common to them and their auditors ; that this mass of truth was then concentrated upon the hearers in the form of an intense personal application and appeal ; that the language was not philosophical and scholastic , but the language of common life . We determined to try the same . We considered what moral truths were admitted by everybody , and gathered many of them together . We considered how they could be so combined as to press men toward a religious state . We recalled to mind the character and condition of many whom we knew would be present ; and then , after as earnest a prayer as we ever offered , and with trembling solicitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new sermon . The Lord gave it power , and ten or twelve persons were aroused by it , and led ultimately to a religious life . This was the most memorable day of my ministerial life . The idea was born . Preaching was a definite and practical thing . Our people needed certain moral changes . Preaching was only a method of enforcing truth , not for the sake of the truths themselves , but for the results to be sought in men . Man was the thing . Henceforth our business was , to work upon man ; to study him ; to stimulate , and educate him . A sermon was good that had power on the heart , and was good for nothing , no matter how good , that had no moral power on man . Others had learned this . It was the surest of means in every man who was eminent for usefulness in preaching . But no man can inherit experience . It must be born in each man for himself . After the light dawned I could then see how plainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications of his were only the stretching out of the arms of the sermon upon the hearts and lives of the audience . I could see now , and wondered that I had not seen it before . But having caught the idea , I went eagerly through Edwards , to see how he took aim . I found his sermon to be , either a statement and establishment of a plain principle , or an exceedingly abundant collection of scriptural teachings around some great central truth . This was not , however , the sermon , it was only a battery thrown up . The canonading was yet to come on . Then from those bulwarks and batteries , came a fire upon the life , the hearts , the character , the conduct of living men , just as they lived in Edwards ' days , such as I think no uninspired man ever surpassed , if any ever equaled it . I never could read that sermon , Sinners in the hands of an angry God , ' at one sitting . I think a person of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful discourse , would well nigh go crazy . He would hear the judgment trump , and see the advancing heaven , and the day of doom would begin to mantle him with its shroud . The Acts of the Apostles , and Edwards ' Sermons were the two masters at whose feet we sat , while learning that preaching is only another name for taking hold of men , and molding them . " Precisely what Mr. Beecher means in the sentence , " We had delivered hundreds of sermons before , but till then the sermon was the end , and not the means , " we do not understand . We can not easily conceive of an intelligent minister so forgetful of the principle which Mr. Beecher is asserting , as to have experienced precisely the change which he describes . We can see , however , that superior earnestness , directness , and closeness , especially in the application of the discourse , are involved in the new idea . And although the passage , as a whole , much needs a more philosophical , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richly worthy to be cast into the crucible of thought , in reference to this subject . Among the works mentioned in terms of respect in the article in the Presbyterian IReview , already quoted , is one entitled " Preaching required by the Times , " by Abel Stevens , a prominent preacher , writer and editor , of the Methodist Church , in the cfty of New York . This writer swells the complaint , that the pulpit is losing the power which it wielded in*a former age ; but his idea of the causes and the remedy of the evil , differs from that of others whom we have noticed . He is an admirer of the old Methodism , and thinks that , in true power the genuine Methodist pulpit has been second to none since the days of the Apostles . The principal elements of its superiority , he thinks , are four , viz , its extempore address its aim at direct and immediate results ; its free , simple , familiar style , in distinction from the straight jacket of scientific homiletics and conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elementary truths of the *ospel . Other denominations , in his view , have lost in power , in so far as they have possessed all , or a part of these elements , in an inferior degree , and the Methodist pulpit is losing , if it is learning to look abroad , rather than to its own history , for objects of imitation . There is much truth and good sense , which we should do well to consider , in this volume ; and there is much also , to which neither we nor our readers would be likely to assent , and which was not intended for our use . In support of his demand for a more untrammeled and martificial style in preaching , Mr. Stevens introduces a quotation from no less an authority than the late Henry Ware , Jr. , as fol // lows : " When a young man leaves the seclusion of a student 's life to preach to his fellow men , he is likely to speak to them as if they were scholars . He imagines them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be affected by the same sort of sentiment , illustration and cool remark which affect those who have been accustomed to be guided by the dumb and lifeless pages of a book . He therefore talks to them calmly , is more anxious for correctness than impression , fears to make more noise or to have more motion than the very letters on his manuscript , addressing himself as he thinks , to the intellectual part of man ; but he forgets thaL the intellectual man is not very easy of access , and must be approached through the senses , and affections , and imagination . " Prof. Ware also makes a statement concerning Chalmers which will be unexpected to many of our readers , but which we shall leave to be verified by themselves . " Chalmers , " says Ware , " abandoned the pure and measured style , and adopted a heterogeneous mixture of the gaudy , the pompons and the colloquial , offensive to the ears of literary men , but highly acceptable to those who are less biased by a standard taste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chalmers , for there is no necessity for false taste , but we should doubtless gain by adopting his principle . " Mr. Stevens also cites the authority of Prof. Ware in favor of extemporaneous preaching . " There is , " says Prof. W. , " at least one consequence likely to result from the study of this art and the attempts to practice it , which would alone be a sufficient reason for nrging it earnestly . I mean its probable effect in breaking up the constrained , formal and scholastic mode of address which follows from his college duties , and keeps him from immediate contact with the hearts of his fellow men . " Prof. W. has also some remarks on the relation of extemporaneous preaching to the best intellectual habits , which are worthy of notice . " The minister must keep himself occupied , reading , thinking , investigating , thus having his mind always awake and active . This is a far better preparation than the bare writing of sermons , for it exercises the powers more , and keeps them bright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort less time , because he can think at once fast and well . Some discourses , indeed , ought to be written , for the sake of writing , and some demand a sort of investigation to which the use of the pen is essential . But then , with a large proportion of the topics on which a minister should preach , he is perfectly familiar , and an hour to arrange his ideas and collect illustrations , is abundantly sufficient . " Mr. Stevens himself , // it should be remembered , disclaims in the strongest manner , all sympathy with the practice of preaching with little preparatory thought . His rules for extemporaneous preaching are very stringent and comprehensive , in requiring the most perfect previous digestion , not only of the principles , but even of the subordinate thoughts and illustrations . The original object of the present writing is now accomplished . It was our design to provoke and facilitate investigation by collecting the thoughts of others , rather than to present the results of our own thinking . But thoughts are crowding for utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributiou toward the discussion which we hope the subject will receive . In the firs place the complaints of deterioration in the preaching of the present day , are not to be taken without some abatement . Different causes in different cases contribute to give to these complaints something of the air of exaggeration . Some of these are made by old men , who , by a natural infirmity of age , can see no brightness , or beauty , or glory like those which shone on the earth when they were young . Other complainants are men of narrow minds and one idea , who can appreciate only their own single aspect of gospel truth and gospel power ; and since that does not monopolize the attention of the Christian world so much as they think it ought , they are disheartened and out of humor , and think that " Ichabod " is written upon the churches and pulpits of , the age . Others still can not see the difference between the mutable and the permanent in religion , and so when times and ages change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion , they suppose religion itself to be corrupted , and the ark of God in danger . Many also ascribe to the weakness of the pulpit that which is really due to the waning power of authority in matters of faith , and the increased freedom of thought which belongs to the present age . Fifty or a hundred years ago men believed on the authority of parents , ministers , churches , and of society , far more generally than they do now . There was less freedom of thought , less self-confidence to doubt and defy . Hence they quailed and melted under the thunders of the pulpit as men will not now . Many circuurstances attending our national and social growth have developed the business and cares of this world to a state of burning activity unknown in a former age ; and it need scarcely be said that this renders it much more difficult so to bring the truths of the gospel home as to reach the heart . Intellectual excitement , also , in all its various forms , connected with subjects of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false , of invention and discovery , and of everything on earth or in heaven that can interest , legitimately or illegitimately , the mind of man , has reached a pitch in this century-so prondly giving us to understand that it is the nineteenth-at which our fathers , if their spirits are ever " rapped " down within cognizance of mortal affairs , must stand amazed . Many persons do not appreciate these differences between the present and former ages ; and therefore they lay at the door of the pulpit all the blame of the apparently diminished influence . And finally , there are constitutional croakers-men who are born to grumble , as an Englishman is said to be , and who , if they chance to be interested in religion , must exercise their indefeasible rerogative in reference to this , as other subjects . Nor should the sovereign pleasure of God , in giving his word success , as in every other event , be overlooked . Paul planted and Apollos watered , but " God gave the increase . " God has never promised that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cases and in all ages , to the faithfulness and energy employed in planting and watering . There are " set times to favor Zion , " and if the present age is not such a time , this is not positive proof that the pulpit has lost anything valuable which it once possessed . Nevertheless , after all abatements , we do not think the complaints of the inefficiency of the pulpit in these days , are altogether groundless . It must be admitted that , absolutely considered , the results of pulpit labor throughout this country are far less than might be desired . Probably a majority of churches in towns and districts where the population is stationary , are not increasing in numbers . In those parts of the country which were formerly most religious , church-going habits are less general than in a former age . Special revivals are not frequent , or where frequent , are less deep and permanent in their results than could be wished . In the older and more thoroughly evangelical portions of the country , the question is beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system capable of holding the ground it once gains . Where churches are advancing , it is often by a process of accretion rather than growth , and Christians too generally are looking to fixtures and outward surroundings as the sources of strength , more than to the unseen power of the Holy Ghost wielding with resistless force the " sword of the Spirit which is the word of God . " Finally , iii the most favored communities , those in which the gospel has produced its most glorious effects , how large a proportion of the population yet remain unreconciled to God , and at heart hostile to his Church and his word ? // Indeed , what minister of Christ does not often send up the cry from the depths of a sorrowing heart , " Who hath believed our report , and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed ? " when compared with other influences , also , the diminished relative power of the pulpit appears in the most striking light . The periodical press was once scarcely a competitor of fihe pulpit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly turned . We say sadly , for , taking the press , especially the p ? litical press , all in all , how immeasurably below the pub pit , in the purity and truth of its teachings , does it appear . Nay , how painfully appropriate would be the remark even to the religious periodical press of this country . With what fatal facility has it caught the uncandid , uncharitable , and sometimes virtually untruthful spirit of belligerent and partisan warfare ! Yet how largely has the press usurped the throne of influence over even the Church itself once occupied by the Griflins , the Masons , the ilallocks , the Alexanders and the Porters ! Schools too , divide the power of the formation of character with the pulpit to a far greater degree now than formerly . Other influences have also arisen , unknown in a former age , which , though too often they " lead to bewilder , and dazzle to blind , " have seized upon a portion of the power which once had its dwellings beneath the canopy of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grandiloquent and shallow , now asspires to be a leader , and from the throne of entertainment , sparkling with jokes , effervescence and small talk , looks down with ludicrous pity upon the homely truth , and serious , every day earnestness of the pulpit . If , therefore , the pulpit has uot itself degenerated , other influences with which it must at every turn stand in comparison , have awakened to an activity and power unknown in the days of our fathers ; and , relatively if not absolutely , the preachers of fifty years ago were stronger than their successors now . But has not the pulpit degenerated absolutely ? We fear to answer in the negative . Where are now the equals of the Wesleys , the Whitfields , the Edwardses , the Bellamys , the Davieses , the Tennents of former days ? Is the difference iu the results due wholly to the difference in the times ? Is there not a difference also in the men ? Is there not at least a degree of truth in the sentiments of Miller and Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we are sure there are few of our brethren in the sacred office so confident of the contrary as not to feel the deepest interest in the inquiry , Tfhere lies the true secret of pulpit power , and who shall unlock and lring forth its treasures for our use ? // Among the conditions of pulpit effectiveness , earne8tne&amp;9 is justly acknowledged to hold the first and fundamental place . But earnestness in the Christian ministry should be something more than constitutional energy ; more than ambition of success , as such ; more , even , than a sense of duty to be faithful and laborious . It should be nothing less than the very " live coal from the altar of God , " which kindles in the heart and burns on the tongue . and makes the truth a flaming sword , " piercing to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit . " Such earnestness springs from the baptism of the Holy Ghost alone . It is then depth and fervor of inward piety , entire consecration , body , soul and spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ in God , " which preachers want as chief and fundamental to all other qualifications , to enable them to preach in " demonstration of the Spirit and of power . " And here , we can not but apprehend , lies the root of the difficulty with the preaching of the present age . We do not wish , extravagantly or rashly , to disparage the piety either of the churches or of the ministry in our times . We are aware that piety may assume different hues , so to speak , according to the character of different ages . The same degree of devotion to God may be manifested in different ways ; and so the narrow minded may say there is less of it than there is . Still we think it deserves the most serious investigation whether the deep communion with God , the living holiness , which characterized such men as Edwards and Brainard in other days , can be found among our ministers now . And we feel constrained to judge that any answer to the question , " How shall the effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial , which did not give to " a new baptism of the Holy Ghost , " the most prominent place in reply . The true secret of power lies , more than anywhere else , in " living near to God . " There is an atmosphere close around the cross , which inspires with more than mortal strength , those who come near enough to breathe it . What the truths of the gospel are without the accompanying Spirit , such-so inefficient-are the finest human powers and accomplishments in the ministry , without the " baptism of the Holy Ghost . " 0 , if the fervor , the energy , the soul , were spent in seeking more intimate communion with God-more absorbing sympathy with Christ ; which are spent in seeking the applause of men , or in controversies of a personal or by no means vital nature ; how many ransomed spirits might praise God in eternity for this change ! There are , however , other elements of pulpit power , which though second to that just named , are yet of universal impor // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , in some quarters , room for a sounder and a wiser practice . Two of the most important of these are involved in the apparent antagonism , hinted above , between Reason and the Cross , as represented in the extracts from Pres. Smith , on the one hand , and from Drs . Taylor , Ifawes , and others , on the other . No Christian can doubt the vital nature of those truths characterized by Dr. Taylor and the New York Observer , as the " doctrines of grace * " and no one who understands the times will question the necessity of clinging closer than ever , if possible , to those great pillars of Christianity , in this age of the pride of human sufficiency , and the mist and emptiness of human philosophy , falsely so called . Those mighty doctrines are the Spirit 's sword ; and they alone can pierce the proudest , hardest heart . Any and every other element of power would produce but the mockery of results , were this , the " fire and the hammer , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophic mind can fail to see , that there is a great and momentous . truth , and one which has been in a measure overlooked , in the views of Pres. Smith . It is true that " certain elements of religious truth are present by nature in the mind of man ; and if these are appealed to , and developed , they lead on to those which are higher ; while if these are ignored , or neglected , other outward authorities will often prove powerless . " It is true , therefore , that divine truth must become subjective . The man must be made to see that his own reason confirms , and even , when scrutinized , affirms those great principles which constitute the pillars of the gospel system . It has long been our conviction , based upon experience and observation , as well as upon reflection , that neither the friends nor the foes of the gospel are generally aware how extensively the human reason reveals , yes , actually reveals , when clearly and fully developed , the substance of Christianity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective against the infidel , the rationalist , and the cavils of every class , may be those inner voices which God has made to speak from the soul . The preacher , therefore , must appeal to those inner voices ; and Scripture must be used , not to cast discredit upon them and weaken itself by creating the impression of an antagonisin between itself and them , but to awaken , to call forth , and to point that testimony from within . And we can not doubt that in the neglect of these all-important witnesses , lies one cause of the skepticism which prevails so widely , or that the more frequent and skillful use of these witnesses would add to the power of the pulpit . A thinking mind can scarcely fail to see that the intellec // 425 tual character of the present age renders the recognition of these subjective authorities vastly more important than formerly . Men can not now be crushed by the mere force of external authority , as they once might be . In the depths of the soul itself , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect beneath its resistless screws . That engine must be sought out , studied , and handled without stint or fear by the preachers of the gospel . In the complete unfolding of what is here but hastily suggested , one of the noblest works of the age lies waiting the appointed hand . Here , then , are the two views , apparently antagonistic : the " doctrines of grace , " with Dr. Taylor , or what is nearly the same thing , the " Cross of Christ , " with Dr. IIawes* and the inn ate principles , the inextinguishable convictions named by Pres. Smith . Each of these ideas contains a great and indispensable truth . Whoever ignores the one , loses a principal source of the power of the gospel ; whoever ignores the other , loses the gospel itself . Here has been an error . Some have fallen to the one side , and some to the other . The man of practical , objective , Anglo-Saxon mind ,  --  the man of simplest , warmest piety ,  --  and generally the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often has neglected , despised , and even feared the natural light of reason ; while the man of metaphysical or germanized mind , and many a young man , has trusted in. the sword of reason , perhaps more than in that of the Spirit . But must these two ideas thus stand as extremes , and antagonistic to each other ? Is there no common ground , upon which what is really valuable in both may be made to stand together ? Of course there must be ; since all truth is of necessity harmonious . May not the method be something like the following ? Let " Christ and his cross be all our theme . " Let the doctrines which most closely surround the cross be held up as our banner ; and proclaimed as the power of God to salvation . Still , there is a choice of means by which these doctrines shall be commended to the hearts and minds of men . And ' here , let the views of President Smith be called to mind . Let these doctrines be placed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , and proved , as they may be , by the afirmations of universal right reason ; instead of resting alone upon the authority of a church , which perhaps the hearer despises , or even on the sole authority of a Bible , which he does not firmly believe . Is it not true that many preachers have been led , by their reverence for the Bible , to rely upon its authority , as well as upon its light , too exclusively ? May we not , on the contrary , make full use of the instructiona of the revealed // word ; and , at the same time , make full use of the powers within ourselves , to support and confirm those instructions ? It seems to us that this may be ; - that it is possible to hold the doctrines of the Cross as firmly , and make them as prominent as Dr. ilawes does , and yet to appeal to the voice within for this confirmation , far more confidently than most preachers do . But if this is possible , then in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . And if such a reconciliation could be effected , who can calculate how much the effectiveness of the pulpit would be increased . Of course we have here been speaking with reference to the peculiar character of a limited class , though an interesting and increasing class , of minds . We do not forget that there is another , and possibly a larger class , whose susceptibility of impression by subjective and apriori reasonings is very slight , and to whose hearts the very words of Scripture , on its own Divine authority , will find their way far more certainly than all the arrows forged by human thought . Two thoughts , connected with each other , may be suggested here , but rather as questions than as confirmed opinions . First , is not too large a proportion of the time and strength of many ministers expended in the writing of sermons ? The evils incident to such a disproportion , need only be suggested . Among them , are , too little time for general intellectual cultivation ,  --  too little strength for the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that studying to express , is not always the same as studying to learn , ) - too little of the life and power of the soul thrown into each written effort ,  --  - too little time for pastoral labor ,  --  too little recreation ,  --  too little physical exercise , and consequently , enfeebled bodily strength ; and , as a consequence of all these , a dull , plodding , over-wearied , feeble condition of mind , without originality , without comprehensiveness , without depth , without glow , elasticity , fervor , or power . The advice of the aged minister to a young brother , who desired to know how he should always find plenty of thought as material for sermons- " Keep the barrel full , and tap it where you please , and it will run " - cannot be followed by chaining one 's self to the sermon paper , like a galley slave to the oar-bench . We remember , at the outset of our professional life , asking one of the most distinguished and successful pastors of the State in which he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write each week ? " He replied , " I never wrote two sermons yet in any one week , and I never intend to do it , if I should live ever so long . " And , as the result of many inquiries , we believe it to be the undoubted conviction // of three-fourths of the soundest and most experienced minds in the ministry , that as a general rule , two sermons in a week can not be written , habitually , without ineuring serious inj ury and loss , either to the sermon or to its writer The effectiveness of thousands of sermons  --  the elasticity , depth , and force of hundreds of minds  --  and often bodily health , and life itself  - -  have , in our opinion , been offered a sacrifice on the altar of this custom ,  --  a custom , the continuance of which rests , we believe , on the lack of sufficient courage to break through it , rather than on any real respect with which it is regarded . And here is the connection , already hinted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one of the two sermons on each Sabbath to be prepared and delivered without writing ? One important advantage of such a practice is already before us , and was also suggested in a quotation from Professor Ware , on a previous page . " With a large proportion of the topics on which a minister should preach , he is perfectly familiar , and an hour to arrange his ideas , and collect illustrations , is abundantly sufficient . " Although the above estimate of the time necessary to prepare an unwritten discourse will be generally considered too short , it is evident that the practice which is here recommended , would relieve , in a measure , the unnatural and often ruinous practice which has been described . The preacher who divides his discourses between the written and the unwritten , will of course select for the latter those subjects with which he is most familiar , and those occasions upon which , whether from excitement previously aroused , or from other causes , he may most safely expect the rallying of his latent powers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not doubt that by some such practice , many a mind would be vastly the gainer in depth , elasticity , and force ; many a parish , in its pastoral care and cultivation , and many a body , in health and life preserved . Should we not also reach in this way , effectively , a larger number of hearers , since it is unquestionable that in almost every community , there are many persons whQse attention is more engaged by extempore address , than by the reading of a manuscript ? Should we not , by this means , cultivate a more energetic , engaging , and effective style , both of writing and of delivering that which has been written ? Certainly , the freedom of extempore speaking favors the formation of that earnest and animated manner , so essential to popular effect . And it is questionable whether the influence of the practice is not quite as valuable upon the style of writing , as upon that of delivery . Would not preacjers , sometimes at least , attain in extem // pore address , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never reach , and which would , on some occasions , give a great accession of power to the pulpit ? An exercise in extempore preaching has been adopted in some Theological Seminaries , as a regular part of the homiletic training . Professor Barrows , of Andover , in his " Life of Rev. E. Judson , " says , " To unwritten discourses undoubtedly belongs the highest and most effective style of oratory ,  --  that which has most flexibility , most capacity of adaptation to circumstances , and most power to move the human mind ; and it would be a difficult task for the gospel minister to show why he is not in duty bound to strive earnestly for the possession of so excellent a gift . " He remarks also on the effect of the exclusve reading of sermons in forming the essay style , instead of that of direct address ; and concludes , " that the preachers who would excel in the pulpit , ought to interchange with each other , more or less , the forms of written and unwritten disconrse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the score . True , the great fathers of the pulpit in New England produced their powerful impression , in many cases , by written sermons ; but not as exclusively so , as is often imagined . Edwards , we are told , often preached extempore , and in the judgment of some who heard him , with his highest eloquence and power . But the fathers , as already suggested , had a calm , quiet , thoughtful people to listen to them  --  a people more predisposed to appreciate the characteristic qualities of a written discourse than most of our present congregations . Times change , and we must in some respects change with them . We hope that , on the part of our younger preachers at least , this topic will be considered with the attention which it deserves . We have but a single additional thought to offer . The ministry , if it would increase its power , must increase its physical strength . Surely we need not labor to enforce this thought . How many valuable men , in the prime of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their health ? How many others are clogging on a pitiful " life-in-death " existence , *unfit for thought ,  --  unflt for speaking ,  --  unflt in many cases , even for pastoral labor , and destined soon to abandon the unequal struggle ; and with crushed hopes , an aching heart , withdraw from the field of glorious achievement , ere half life 's work is done . And what is the true theory , so far as a single word can express it , of clerical weakness and failure ? It is , the nervous system shattered and crushed by the constant action of the
