txt GREAT SPEECH , DELIVERED IN NEW YORK CITY , BY HENRY WARD BEECHER , ON THE Conflict of Northern and Southern Theories OF MAN AND SOCIETY , January 14 , 1855 . ROCHESTER : STEAM PRESS OF A. STRONG &; CO. , COR . OF STATE AND BUFFALO STREETS . 1855 . Conflict of Northern and Southern Theories OF MAN AND SOCIETY . The Eighth Lecture of the Course before the Anti-Slavery Society , was delivered , January 14 , 1855 , at the Tabernacle , New York , by the Rev. HENRY WARD BEECHER . The subject , at the present time , is one of peculiar interest , as touching the questions of Slavery and Know-Nothingism , and , together with the popularity of the lecturer , drew together a house-full of auditors . There were a number of gentlemen of distinction , occupying seats on the rostrum  --  among whom were the Hon. Joshua R. Giddings , James Mott , of Philadelphia , and Mr. Dudley , of Buffalo . Mr. Beecher was introduced to the audience by Mr. OLIVER JOHNSON , who said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform on Tuesday evening last , in the course of his remarks upon the wide degeneracy of the American Clergy on the Slavery Question , reminded us that there was in a Brooklyn pulpit , A MAN . We thought you would be glad to see and hear such a rara avis , and therefore have besought him to come hither to-night to instruct us by his wisdom and move us by his eloquence . I trust that , whatever you may think of some other parts of the lecture of WENDELL PHILLIPS , you will , when this evening 's performance is over , be ready at least to confess that in what he said of the Brooklyn preacher he was not more eulogistic than truthful . MR . BEECHER , on presenting himself , was received with loud and hearty applause . He spoke as follows : The questions which have provoked discussion among us for fifty years past have not been questions of fundamental principles , but of the application of principles already ascertained . Our debates have been between one way of doing a thing and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ; and so through , it has been a question between good and better . We have discussed policies , not principles . In Europe , on the other hand , life-questions have agitated men . The questions of human rights , of the nature and true foundations of Government , are to-day , in Europe , where they were with our fathers in 1630 . In this respect , there is a moral dignity , and even grandeur , in the struggles , secretly or openly going on in Italy , Austria , Germany , and France , which never can belong to the mere questions of mode and manner which occupy us  --  boundary questions , banks , tariffs , internal improvements , currency ; all very necessary but secondary topics . They touch nothing deeper than the pocket . In this respect , there would be a marked contrast between the subjects which occupy us , and the grander life-themes that dignify European thought , were it not for one subject  --  Slavery . THAT is the ONLY question , in our day and in our community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Slavery were a plantation-question , concerning only the master and the slave , disconnected from us , and isolated  --  then , though we should regret it , and apply moral forces for its ultimate remedy , yet , it would be , ( as are questions of the same kind in India or South America , ) remote , constituting a single element in that globe of darkness of which this world is the core , and which Christianity is yet to shine through and change to light . But it is not a plantation-question . It is a national question . The disputes implied by the violent relations between the owner and the chattel may only morally touch us.  --  But the disputes between the masters and the Government , and between the Government , impregnated with Slavery , and the Northern citizen , these touch us sharply , and if not wisely met , will yet scourge us with thorns ! Indeed , I can not say that I believe that New England and the near North will be affected locally , and immediately by an adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the North will be an utterly dead force in the American nation . She will be rolled up in a corner , like a cocoon waiting for its transmigration . The whole North will become provincial ; it will be but a fringe to a nation whose heart will beat in the South . But New-England was not raised up by Divine Providence to play a mean part in the world 's affairs . Remember , that New-England brought to America those principles which every State in the Union has more or less thoroughly adopted . New-England first formed those institutions which liberty requires for beneficient activity ; and from her , both before and since the Revolution , they have been copied throughout the Land . Having given to America its ideas and its institutions , I think the North is bound to stand by them . Until 1800 , the North had distinctive national influence , and gave shape , in due measure , to national policy , as she had before to national institutions . Then she began to recede before the rising of another power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stood arrayed two champions in mortal antagonism  --  New-England and the near North  --  representing personal freedom , civil liberty , universal education , and a religious spirit which always sympathises with men more than with Governments . The New-England theory of Government has always been in its element  --  first , independent men ; then democratic townships ; next republican States , and , in the end , a Federated Union of Republican States . All her economies , her schools , her policy , her industry , her wealth , her intelligence , have been at agreement with her theory and policy of Government . Yet , New-England , strong at home , compact , educated , right-minded ; has gradually lost influence , and the whole North with her . The Southern League of States , have been held together by the cohesive power of Common Wrong . Their industry , their policy , their whole interior , vital economy , have been at variance with the apparent principles of their own State Governments , and with the National Institutions under which they exist . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without general education , without general wealth , without diversified industry . And yet since the year 1800 , they have steadily prevailed against Representative New-England and the North . The South , the truest representation of Absolutism under republican forms , is mightier in our National Councils and Policy to-day than New-England , the mother and representative of true republicanism and the whole free North . And now it has come to pass that , in the good providence of God , another opportunity has been presented to the whole North to reassert her place and her influence , and to fill the institutions of our country with their original and proper blood . I do not desire that she should arise and put on her beautiful garments , because she is my mother , and your mother ; not because her hills were the first which my childhood saw , that has never since beheld any half so dear ; nor from any sordid ambition , that she should be great in this world 's greatness ; nor from any profane wish to abstract from the rightful place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our whole country . But I think that God sent New-England to these shores as his own messenger of mercy to days and ages , that have yet far to come ere they are born ! She has not yet told this Continent all that is in her heart . She has sat down like Bunyan 's Pilgrim , and slept in the bower by the way , and where she slept she has left her roll  --  God grant that she hath not lost it there while she slumbered ! By all the love that I bear to the cause of God , and the glory of his Church , by the yearnings which I have for the welfare of the human kind , by all the prophetic expectations which I have of the destiny of this land , God 's Almoner of Liberty to the World , I desire to see Old Representative New-England , and the affiliated North , rouse up and do their first works . Is it my excited ear that hears an airy phantasm whispering ? or do I hear a solemn voice crying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the glory of the Lord is arisen upon thee ! " I am quite aware that the subject of Slavery has been regarded , by many , as sectional ; and the agitation of it in the North needless , and injurious to our peace and the country 's welfare . Whatever may have been the evils , the agitation has only come through men , not from them . It is of God . It is the underheaving of Providence . Mariners might as well blame you for the swing and toss of their craft when tides troop in or march out of your harbor , as us , for heaving to that tide which God swells under us . Tides in the ocean and in human affairs are from celestial bodies and celestial beings . The conflict which is going on springs from causes as deep as the foundations of our institutions . It will go on to a crisis ; its settlement will be an era in the world 's history , either of advance or of decline . I wish to call your patient attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The conflict between Northern theories and Southern theories of man and of Society . There have been , from the earliest period of the world , two different , and oppugnant , doctrines of man  --  his place , rights , duties and relations . And the theory of man is always the starting point of all other theories , systems , and Governments which divide the world . Outside of a Divine and Authoritative Revelation , men have had but one way of estimating the value of man . He was to them simply a creature of time , and to be judged in the scientific method , by his phenomena . The Greeks and the Romans had no better way . They did not know enough of his origin , his nature , or his destiny , to bring these into account , in estimating man . Accordingly they could do no better than to study him in his developments and rank him by the POWER which he manifested . Now if a botanist should describe a biennial plant , whose root and stem belong to one season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that were the whole of it which the first year produced , he would commit the same mistake which the heathen idea of man commits in measuring and estimating a being whose true life comes hereafter , by the developments which he makes in only this world . From this earthly side of man springs the most important practical results . For the doctrine of man , simply as he is in this life , logically deduces Absolutism and Aristocracy . If the power of producing effects is the criterion of value , the few will always be the most valuable , and the mass relatively , subordinate , and the weak and lowest will be left helplessly worthless . And the mass of all the myriads that do live , are of no more account than working animals ; and there is , no such a theory , no reason , a priori ; why they should not be controlled by superior men , and made to do that for which they seem the best fitted  --  Work and Drudgery ! Only long experiment could teach a doctrine contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no doctrine of human rights . It would be simply a doctrine of human forces . Right would be a word as much out of place as among birds and beasts . Authority would go with productive greatness , as gravity goes with mass in matter . The whole chance of Right , and the whole theory of Liberty , springs from that part of man that lies beyond this life . As a material creature , man ranks among physical forces . Rights come from his spiritual nature . The body is of the earth , and returns to earth , and is judged by earthly measures . The soul is of God , and returns to God , and is judged by Divine estimates . And this is the reason why a free , unobstructed Bible always works toward human rights . It is the only basis on which the poor , the ignorant , the weak , the laboring masses can entrench against oppression . What , then , is that theory of man which Christianity gives forth ? It regards man not as a perfect thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect flower doth . Man is a seed , and birth is planting . He is in life for cultivation , not exhibition ; he is here chiefly to be acted on , not to be characteristically an agent . For , though man is also an actor , he is yet more a recipient . Though he produces effects , he receives a thousand fold more than he produces . And he is to be estimated by his capacity of receiving , not of doing . He has his least value in what he can DO ; it all lies in what he is capable of having done TO him . The eye , the ear , the tongue , the nerve of touch , are all simple receivers . The understanding , the affections , the moral sentiments , all , are primarily and characteristically , recipients of influence ; and only secondarily agents . Now , how different is the value of ore , dead in its silent waiting-places , from the wrought blade , the all but living engine , and the carved and curious utensil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stocks  --  but half-built , and yet building  --  to one who has no knowledge of the ocean , or of what that helpless hulk will become the moment she slides into her element , and rises and falls upon the flood with joyous greeting ! The value of an acorn is not what it is , but what it shall be when nature has brooded it , and brought it up , and a hundred years have sung through its branches and left their strength there ! He , then , that judges man by what he can do , judges him in the seed . We must see him through some lenses  --  we must prefigure his immortality . While , then , his industrial value in life must depend on what he can do , we have here the beginning of a moral value which bears no relation to his power , but to his future destiny . This view assumes distinctness and intensity , when we add to it the relationship which subsists between man and his Maker . This relationship begins in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are connected with God , therefore , not by Government alone , but by nature . This initial truth is made radiant with meaning , by the teaching of Christianity that every human being is dear to God : a teaching which stands upon that platform , built high above all human deeds and histories , the advent , incarnation , passion , and death of Christ , as a Savior of men . The race is a brotherhood ; God is the Father , Love is the law of this great human commonwealth , and Love knows no servitude . It is that which gilds with liberty whatever it touches . One more element to human liberty is contributed by Christianity , in the solemn development of man 's accountability to God , by which condition hereafter springs from pure character here . However heavy that saying is , every one of us shall give an account of himself before God  --  in it is the life of the race . You can not present man as a subject of Divine government , held responsible for results , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plied with influences accumulating from eternity , and by powers which though they begin on earth in the cradle , gentle as a mother 's voice singing lullaby , go on upward , taking every thing as they go , till they reach the whole power of God ; and working out results that outlast time and the sun , and revolve forever in flaming circuits of disaster , or in sacred circles of celestial bliss ; you can not present man as the center and subject of such an august and eternal drama , without giving him something of the grandeur which resides in God himself , and in the spheres of immortality ! Who shall trifle with such a creature , full bound upon such an errand through life , and swelling forth to such a destiny ? Clear the place where he stands ?  --  give him room and help , but no hinderance , as he equips for eternity !  --  loosen the bonds of man , for God girds him !  --  take off all impediments , for it is his life and death and struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was felt by the inspired writers , can not be doubtful to any who weigh such language as this : " So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God . Let us not , therefore judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block , or an occasion to fall in his brother 's way . " By making man important in the sight of God , he becomes sacred to his fellow . The more grand and far-reaching are the divine claims , the greater is our conception of the scope and worth of being . Human rights become respected in the ratio in which human responsibility is felt . Whatever objections men may hold to Puritanism  --  their theory since the days of St. Augustine has constantly produced tendencies to liberty and a prevalent belief in the natural rights of man  --  and on account of that very feature which to many , has been so offensive  --  its rigorous doctrine of human accountability . Here , then , is the idea of man which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions of man . He is a being but begun on earth  --  a seed only planted here for its first growth . He is connected with God , not as all matter is by proceeding from creative power , but by partaking the divine nature , by the declared personal affection of God , witnessed and sealed by the presence and sufferings of the world 's Redeemer . He is a being upon whom is rolled the responsibility of character and eternal destiny ! Of such a creature it were as foolish to take an estimate , by what he is and what he can do in this life , as it would be to estimate by an eagle 's egg , what the old eagle is worth , with wings outspread far above the very thunder , or coming down upon its quarry as the thunder comes ! It is the Future that gives value to the Present . It is Immortality only that reaches down a measure wherewith to gauge a man . If a heathen measures , the strong are strong , and the weak are weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their shadow must dwarf all others . If a Christian measures , he hears a voice saying : " There is neither Jew nor Greek ; there is neither bond nor free ; there is neither male nor female ; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus . Whosoever shall do the will of my Father , which is in heaven , the same is my mother , and sister , and brother . " These are the things that give value to man . It is not to be said that there is no difference between men ; that one is not more powerful than another ; that one is not richer in genius than another ; that one is not more valuable to society than another ; that education , refinement , skill , experience , give no precedence over their negatives . But God takes up the least of all human creatures , and , declares , " inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these , ye have done it unto me . " In a household , a babe is vastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as if it were as worthless as it is weak ? So God pleads his own relationship to the meanest human creation , as his protection from wrong ; as the evidence of his rights , as the reason of his dignity ! There is something of God in the meanest creature . He is sacred from injury ! In these truths we find the reason why Christianity always takes hold so low down in human life . Things that have got their root need little from the gardener ; but the seeds , and tender sprouts , and difficult plants , require and get nurture . A Christianity that takes care of the rich , the strong , the governing class , and neglects the poor , and ignorant , and the unrefined , as the antitype of Christ . It is in this direction only , that the declaration of man 's equality is true . No heathen nation could say that " all men are born free and equal "  --  for in more earthly respects it is false . But it is a truth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustains to God , to Eternity , and to future dignity  --  all are equally subjects of these . Man is ungrown . All his fruit is green . If he must stand by what he is , how surely must he be given over to weakness , to abuse , to oppressions . The weak are the natural prey to the strong , and superiority is a charter for tyranny . But if he be an heir , waiting for an inheritance of God , eternal in the heavens , woe be to him that dare lay a finger on him because he is a minor ! I dwell the longer upon this view because it carries the world 's heart in it . We must deepen our thinkings of man , and bore for the springs of liberty far below the drainings of surface strata , down deep , Artesian , till we strike something that shall be beyond winter or summer , frost or drouth . I do not believe that there is a doctrine of individual rights nor of civil liberty that can stand outside of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is none to interrupt them with authority . Christ is the World 's Emancipator , for he hath declared that men belong to Him ; and an oppressor thus becomes a felon , a robber , and a wronger of God , in the person of every poor and wretched victim ! A Christianity that tells man what his origin is  --  of God ; his destiny , to God again ; his errand on earth , to grow toward goodness , and make the most of himself  --  this Christianity is rank rebellion in despotisms , and insurrection on plantations . It can not be preached there . These two radical theories of man  --  man , a physical creature to be judged by effects produced in Time ; or man , a spiritual creature , to be judged by the development to which he is destined , are at the root of all the antagonisms between the spirit of northern and southern institutions : northern policy and southern policy . In the North , it is the public sentiment of the people , that all men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inalienable right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness , forfeited only by crime . The North believe that personal and political liberty are not only rights of man , but their necessity , that man can not thrive nor develop , with the true proportions of manhood , without liberty . It is the northern sentiment that a man must be prepared for liberty , and that the act of birth is that preparation ; that no creature lives which is the better for oppression , and who will not be the better for freedom , which is the natural air appointed for the soul 's breathing . The North disdains every pretense that men are injured by sudden liberty . A famished man may injure himself by over-feeding ; but that is an argument not against food , but against famine . It is the northern sentiment , and justly deduced from the Christian theory of man , that society should redeem all its own children from ignorance , should secure their growth , equip them for citizenship , make all the influences of society enure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment is the reverse of this . It holds that all men are not born free and equal ; that men have not an inalienable right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness ; and that men are not in their very constitution fitted for liberty , and benefited by it . They hold that liberty is an attribute of power ; that it is a blossom which belongs to races , and not to mankind ; that a part were born to rule , and a part were ordained to serve ; that liberty is dangerous to the many ; that servitude , the most rigorous , is a blessing ; that it accords with the creative intent of God , and with his revealed institutions ; that a nation can not be homogeneous , and should not aim at it ; that there is a law and scale of gradation , on which the top is privilege and authority , the bottom labor and obedience . These are the radical theories of the respective sections of the land . Men often are profoundly ignorant of the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rudder that steers her . Many are found , both North and South , whose conduct over-rules their theory , and who are better or worse than their belief . There are southern men who are more generous than their theory , and there are northern men who are grossly untrue to the northern theory , which , with their lips , they profess . There are southern men with northern consciences , and there are northern men with southern consciences . But , in the main , these respective theories reign and regulate public procedure . There is not a man so poor in the North , or so ignorant , or souseless , as not to be regarded as a Man , by religion , by civil law , and by public opinion . Selfishness and pride , avarice and cunning , anger or lust , may prey upon the heedlessness or helplessness of many . Society may be full of evils . But all these things are not sequences of northern doctrines , but violations of them . If sharks in great cities consume the too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric of life with invisible teeth ; if landlords sack their tenements and pinch the tenant  --  all these results are against the spirit of our law , against public feeling , and they that do such things must slink and burrow . They are vermin that run in the walls , and peep from hiding-holes , and we set traps for them as we do for rats or weazels . But , in the South , the subordination of man , to man , in his earnings , his skill , his time and labor  --  in his person , his affections , his very children  --  is a part of the theory of society , drawn out into explicit statutory law , coincident with public opinion , and executed without secrecy . A net spread for those guilty of such wrongs against man , would catch States , and Legislatures , Citizens , Courts , and Constitutions . In the North the most useless pauper that burdens the Alms-House  --  the most uncombed foreigner that delves in a ditch  --  the most abject creature that begs a morsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is , not in theory only , but in the public sentiment , a sacredness of rights , which no man , except by stealth , can violate with impunity . There is no other law for the Governor of New-York or of Massachusetts , than for the beggar in your streets . That which protects the dwelling and the property of the rich man , belongs just as much to the hovel of the beggar . God sends but one sun , and it is the same light that kindles against the roof of a mansion , that dawns upon the thatch of a hut . The same air comes to each , the same showers , the same seasons , summer and winter . And as is Nature , so in the North , is law , and the distributive benefits of society . They bathe society from top to bottom ! The rich , the learned , the refined , the strong , may know how to make a better use of the air , but they have no more air of privilege to breathe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reverse is true , not by stealth , not by neglect of a recognized principle , but as the result of men 's ideas , and by organized arrangements . Touch a hireling 's wages , in the North , and the Law stands to defend him and beat you down ! Take the laborer 's wages in the South , and the law stands to defend you , and beat him down . Beat a man , in the North , for a private wrong done , and the law will strike you . But in the South , it is the right of the white , unquestioned and unquestionable to beat every third person in the community . Let the proudest mill-owner break but the skin of the poorest operative in Lowell or Lawrence , and both law and public sentiment , alike , would grasp and punish him ! But in the South the law refuses to look at any degree of cruelty in chastisements upon the universal laborer , short of maiming or death , and public sentiment is but little better than the law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South , to a master , incensed , passionate , vindictive in justice executed upon all symptoms of resisting manhood ! In the North , nothing is more sacred than a man 's family and his children . It would not be possible for a man to do public violence to a family circle without vindictive penalty . Let him separate a mother from her daughters , let him employ a hireling ruffian to carry off the boys into the country and parcel them out there  --  let him scatter the flock , and leave the children motherless , and the parents childless , and what do you think would become of him ? In the South it is a part of the civil rights of men to do these things whenever they please . And though public sentiment is better than law , yet as no public sentiment on earth is a match for legalized lust , or avarice , or the grip of misfortune , these things are continually done , and remorselessly . Cruelty , chastity , virtue , do not mean the same things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blemished by deeds and indulgencies , upon a plantation , among slaves , which in the North , would strike him through with infamy and house him in the penitentiary . In the South , there are many roads leading from the top of society to the bottom , but not one , not ONE from the bottom to the top . In the North , if the citizen chooses to walk in it , there is a road from every man 's door up to the Governor 's chair or the Presidential seat ! It needs no words , now , to convince you , that out of such different theories of men , there will exist in the North and in the South , extremely different ideas of Society , Government , and Public Policy . In the North , first in order of consideration is man , the individual man ; next the family , made of those of common blood , and by far the strongest , as it is the most sacred of all institutions . Then comes the township , which presents the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , do citizens assemble in mass and vote , directly and not by representation . Next comes Society at large , or the mass of citizens grouped into States . And in Society , in the North , there are no classes except such as rise out of spontaneous forces . Wealth , experience , ability set men above their fellows . There they stand as long as there is a real superiority . But they stand there , not by legal force , nor to exercise any legal power , or to have one single privilege or prerogative , which does not belong just as much to every citizen clear down to the bottom . All that a class means in the North is , that when men have shown themselves strong and wise men give them honor for it . Death levels it all down again . Their children inherit nothing . They must earn for themselves . There is no division of society into orders , by which some have privilege and some have not , some have opportunity and advantages which others have not . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent classes  --  the ruling and the obeying  --  the thinking and the working . The labor of the South is performed by three million creatures who represent the heathen idea of man . All the benefits that have accrued to man from Christianity , are appropriated and monopolized by the white population . Here is a seam that no sophistry can sew up . Here is a society organized , not on an idea of equal rights , and of inequalities only as they spring from difference of worth , but on an idea of permanent , political , organized inequality among men . They carry it so far that the theory of Slave law regards the slave not as an inferior man , governed , for his own good as well as for the benefit of the society at large , but it pronounces him , in reiterated forms , not a man at all , but a chattel . When a community of States , by the most potential voice of Law , says to the whole body of its laboring population , Ye are not men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd to speak about kind treatment  --  about happiness . It is about cattle that they are talking ! Our vast body of laboring men do not yet feel the force of such a theory of human society . But , if that political system , which has openly been making such prodigious strides for the last fifty years , and effecting , secretly , a yet greater change in men 's ideas of society and government , shall gain complete ascendancy , they , in their turn , and in due time will know and see the difference between a Republican Democracy and a Republican Aristocracy ? Out of such original and radical differences , there must flow a perpetual contrast and opposition of policies and procedures , in the operation of society and of business . We will select but a few , of many , subjects of contrast , Work , Education , Freedom of Speech and of the Press , and Religion . I. WORK . Among us , and from the beginning , Work has been honorable . It has been honorable to dig , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hammer at the forge , and the saw at the bench . It has been honorable because our people have been taught that each man is set to make the most of himself . The crown for every victory gained in a struggle of skill or industry over matter is placed upon the soul ; and thus among a free people industry becomes education . It is the peculiarity of Northern labor , that it thinks . It is intelligence working out through the hands . There is more real thought in a Yankee 's hand than in a Southerner 's head . This is not true of a class , or of single individuals , or of single States . It pervades the air . It is Northern public sentiment . It springs from our ideas of manhood . These influences , acting through generations , have been wrought into the very blood . It is in the stock . Go where you will a Yankee is a working creature . He is the honeybee of mankind . Only Work is royal among us . It carries the sceptre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its treasures and disclosing its secrets . But with all this industry , you shall find nowhere on earth so little drudging work as in the North . It is not the servitude of the hands to material nature . It is the glorious exercise of mind upon nature . They vex nature with incessant importunities . They are always prying , and thinking , and trying . In California , gold is found in quartz formations . But in New England , and the free inventive North , in the geology of industry , gold is found everywhere  --  in rye straw and bonnets , in leather and stone , in wool , felts and cloths ; in wood , in stone , and in very ice . It is wrapped up in the beggar 's raiment , which unroll in our mills into paper  --  yesterday , a beggar 's feculent rags ; to-day , a newspaper , conveying the world 's daily life into twenty thousand families . And so great are the achievements of labor that everybody honors it . It stands among us as an invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England  --  religion , social virtue , intelligence , and work ; and this last takes something from them all , and is their physical exponent . So that not only is work honored and honorable , but the want of it is an implied discredit . The presumption is always against a man who does not labor . In the South , the very reverse is true , as a general proposition . It is true , because labor is the peculiar badge of Slavery . It does not stand , as with us , a symbol of intelligence , but a symbol of stupid servitude . It is the business of those whom the law puts out of the pale of society and accounts chattels , and who , by the opinion of society , are at the bottom , and under the feet of respectable men . To work is , therefore , prima facie evidence of degradation . It is ranking oneself with a slave by doing a slave 's tasks ; as eating a beggar 's crust with him would be a beggar 's fellowship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefest and more potent reason of the difference between public feeling about WORK , North and South . The ideas of men in the South do not inspire any such tendency . Men are judged there not by what they are and are to be , but by what they can now do . Only such things as have an echo in them , that reverberate in the ear of public opinion , that produce an effect of notice , honor , advancement in the OPINIONS of men , are relished . In the North , men are educated to be something  --  in the South to seem something . The North tends to doing  --  the South to appearing . And both tendencies spring from the root of opposite theories of men and notions of society . And it is this innate , hereditary indisposition to work that , after all , is the greatest obstacle to emancipation . Laziness in the South and money in the North , are the bulwarks of Slavery ! To take away a planter 's slaves is to cut off his hands . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in himself . And it is this , too , which leads to the contempt which southern people feel for northern men . They are working men , and work is flavored to the Southerner with ideas of ignominy , of meanness , of vulgar lowness . Neither can they understand how a man who works all his life long can be high-minded and generous , intelligent and refined . Not only is there this contrast in dignity of work , but even more  --  in rights of industry . Work , in the North , has responsibilities that are prodigious educators . We ordain that a man shall have the fullest chance , and then he shall have the results of his activity . He shall take all he can make , or he shall take the whole result of indolence . It is a double education . It inspires labor by hope of fruition , and intensifies it by the fear of non-fruition . The South have their whole body of laborers at work without either responsibility . They cut it off at both ends . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be lazy , for all that you earn shall do you no good ; be lazy , for when you are old and helpless we are bound to take care of you . " It is this apparent care for the helplessness of slaves , that has won the favor of many northern men , and of some who ought to have known better the effect of taking off from men the responsibility of labor , in both ways , its fruition and its penalty . Once declare in New York that Government would take care of poverty and old age , so as to make it honorable , and it would be a premium upon improvidence . With us , it is expected that every man will work , will earn , will lay up , will deliver his family from public charity . There is , to be sure , an Alms House to catch all who , by misfortune or improvidence , fall through . But such is the public opinion in favor of personal independence springing from industry , that a native-born American citizen had rather die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paupers . Our charity feeds the poor wretches whom foreign slavery has crippled and cast upon us . But the whole South is a vast work-house for the slave while young , and a vast alms-house for him when old , and neither young or old , is he permitted to feel the responsibility for labor . And this , too , explains the apparent advantage which the South has over the North in the matter of pauperism and distress . The northern system intends to punish those who will not work . It it not a system calculated for slaves nor for lazy men . If indolence comes under it , it will take the penalty of not working . And nowhere else in the world is the penalty of indolence , and even of shiftlessness , so terrible as in the North , as nowhere else is the remuneration of a virtuous industry so ample and so widely diffused . II . There is just as marked a contrast upon the subject of education , and especially of Common Schools . In the North we have COMMON Schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a public school . It is a Common School , in distinction from a select , or class school . It is a public provision for bringing together , upon a perfect equality , the children of the rich and the poor , the noble and ignoble , the high and the low . It is a provision of our institutions , by which every generation is led to a line and made to start equal and together . There will be inequality enough as soon as men get into life . Some shoot ahead ; some , like dull sailors in a fleet , are dropped behind , and men are scattered all along the ocean . But the Common School gathers up their children and brings them all back again to take a new start together . Thus our schools are not mere whetstones to the intellect ; they are institutions for evening up society ; they resist the tendency to separation into classes , which grows with the prosperity of a community ; they bind together , in cordial sympathy , all classes of citizens . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last things that we forget are playmates and schoolmates . The South may have schools . But never Common Schools . The South has no common people . There can be States , there , but never Commonwealths . There is no common ground , where the theory of society grades men upon a perpendicular scale . It is a society of classes , and a society of classes can never be a community . When the whole labor of a State is performed by a degraded class , that are not included in the State as citizens or social beings , it is impossible but that the class next above them should feel the force of those theories and ideas which have produced such a state of things . It is so . The poor white population of the South is degraded . They are ignorant  --  they are not fertile in thought or labor . They are not so low as the slaves , nor so high as those who own slaves . There are three classes  --  the top , the middle , and the bottom ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed and legal , the middle is modified by them both . In such a Society , there can not be a Common School , in any such sense as we mean it . Indeed , there can not be general education in any State where ignorance is the legal condition of one-half the population , as is the case in many Southern States . Ignorance is an institution in the South . It is a political necessity . It is as much provided for by legislation and by public sentiment , and guarded by enactments , as intelligence is in the North . It must be . The restrictions which keep it from the slave will keep it from the whites , excepting , always , the few who live at the top . There can not be an atmosphere of intelligence . Slaves would be in danger of breathing that . There can not be a common public sentiment , a common school , nor common education . Knowledge is power , not only , but powder , putting the South in the risk of being blown up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Closely connected with this , and springing from the same causes , is a contrast between the North and the South , in respect to free speech and open discussion by lip and by type . The theory of the North is , that every man has the right , on every subject , to the freest expression of his opinions , and the fullest right to urge them upon the convictions of others . It is not a permission of law ; it is the inherent right of the individual . Law is only to protect the citizen in the use of that right . It is the theory of the North that society is as much a gainer by this freedom of discussion as is the individual . It is a perpetual education of the people , and a safeguard to the State . There is the utmost latitude of speech and discussion among our citizens . The attempt to abridge it would be so infatuated that the most dignified Court that ever sat in Boston would become an object of universal merriment and ridicule , that should presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free speaking in old Faneuil Hall . Merriment , I say , for who would not laugh at a philosopher who would set snares for the stars , and fix his net to catch the sun , and regulate their indiscreet shining . Darkness and silence are excellent for knaves and tyrants ; but the attempt to command the one or the other in the North , changes the knave to an imbecile and the tyrant to a fool . But should any power , against the precedents of the past , the spirit of our people , the theory of our civil polity and the rights of individual man succeed , and make headway against free speech , and put it in jeopardy , it would convulse the very frame-work of society . There would be no time for a revolution  --  there would be an eruption , and fragmentary Judges , Courts and their minions would fly upward athwart the sky , like stones and balls of flame driven from the vomiting crater of a furious volcano ! No . This is a right like the right of breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere . The grand American doctrine that men may speak what they think , and may print what they speak  --  that all public measures shall have free public discussion  --  can not be shaken ; and any party must be intensely American that can afford to destroy the very foundation of American principle that public questions shall be publicly discussed , and public procedure be publicly agreed upon . Right always gains in the light , and Wrong in the dark . An owl can whip an eagle in the night ! The South , holding a heathen theory of man  --  an aristocratic theory of society ,  --  is bound to hold , and does hold , a radically opposite practice in respect to rights of speech and freedom of the press . There is not freedom of opinion in the South and there can not be . Men may there talk of a thousand things  --  of all religious doctrines , of literature , of art , of public political measures  --  but no man has liberty to talk as he pleases about the structure of southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and southern internal questions that searching investigation and public exposure which , in the North , brings every possible question to the bar of public opinion , and makes society boil like a pot ! Yes , you may speak of Slavery , if you will defend it ; you may preach about it , if you shingle its roof with Scripture texts ; but you may not talk , nor preach , nor print abolition doctrines , though you believe them with the intensity of inspiration ! The reason given is , that it will stir up insurrection . And so it will . It is said that free speech is inflammatory . So it is . That it would bring every man 's life in the South into jeopardy ; that , in self-defence , they most limit and regulate the expression of opinion . But what is that theory of Government , and what is the state of society under it , in which free speech and free discussion are dangerous ? It is the boast of the North , not alone that speech and discussion are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every part so rarely , wisely , and justly , that they can endure free speech ; no file can part , but only polish . We turn out any law , and say , Discuss it ! that it may be the stronger ! We challenge scrutiny for our industry , for our commerce , for our social customs , for our municipal affairs , for our State questions , for all that we believe , and all that we do , and everything that we build . We are not in haste to be born in respect to any feature of life . We say  --  probe it , question it , put fire to it . We ask the experience of the past to sit and try it . We ask the ripest wisdom of the present to test and analyze it . We ask enemies to plead all they know against it . We challenge the whole world of ideas , and the great deep of human interests to come up upon anything that belongs , or is to belong , to public affairs . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure comes to birth , from out of the womb of such discussion , we know that it will stand . And when our whole public interests are rounded out and built up , we are glad to see men going around and about , marking well our towers , and counting our bulwarks . May it do them good to see such architecture and engineering ! And it is just this difference that distinguishes the North and the South . We have institutions that will stand public and private discussion  --  they have not . We will not have a law , or custom , or economy , which can not be defended against the freest inquiry . Such a rule would cut them level as a mowed meadow ! They live in a crater , forever dreading the signs of activity . They live in a powder magazine . No wonder they fear light and fire . It is the plea of Wrong since the world began . Discussion would unseat the Czar ; a free press would dethrone the ignoble Napoleon ; free speech would revolutionize Rome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty champions , that go with unsheathed swords the world over , to redress the weak , to right the wronged , to pull down evil and build up good . And a State that will be damaged by free speech ought to be damaged . A King that can not keep his seat before free speech ought to be unseated . An order or an institution that dreads freedom of the press has reason to dread it . If the South would be revolutionized by free discussion , how intensely does that fact show her dying need of revolution ! She is a dungeon , full of damps and death-air . She needs light and ventilation . And the only objection is , that if there were light and air let in , it would no longer be a dungeon . IV . There is a noticeable contrast between Northern and Southern ideas of Religion . We believe God 's revealed word to contain the influence appointed for the regeneration and full development of every human being , and that it is to be employed as God 's universal stimulant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universal stimulants of vegetation . We preach it to arouse the whole soul ; we preach it to fire the intellect , and give it wings by which to compass knowledge ; we preach it to touch every feeling with refinement , to soften rudeness and enrich affections ; we build the family with it ; we sanctify love , and purge out lust ; we polish every relation of life ; we inspire a cheerful industry and whet the edge of enterprise , and then limit them by the bonds of justice and by the moderation of a faith which looks into the future and the eternal . We teach each man that he is a child of God ; that he is personally one for whom the Savior died ; we teach him that he is known and spoken of in heaven , his name called ; that angels are sent out upon his path to guard and to educate him ; we swell within him to the uttermost every aspiration , catching the first flame of youth and feeding it , until the whole heart glows like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , and sweet , by the incense-smoke and aspiring flame of perpetual offerings and divine sacrifices . We have never done with him . We lead him from the cradle to boyhood ; we take him then into manhood , and guide him through all its passes ; we console him in age , and then stand , as he dies , to prophesy the coming heaven , until the fading eye flashes again , and the unhearing ear is full again ; for from the other side ministers of grace are coming , and he beholds them , and sounds on earth and sights are not so much lost as swallowed up in the glory and the melody of the heavenly joy ! Now tell me whether there is any preaching of the Gospel to the slave , or whether there can be , and he yet remain a slave ? We preach the Gospel to arouse men , they to subdue them ; we to awaken , they to soothe ; we to inspire self-reliance , they submission ; we to drive them forward in growth , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into men , they to make them content to be beasts of burden ! Is this all that the Gospel has ? When credulous ministers assure us that slaves have the means of grace , do they mean that they have such teaching as we have ? Or that there is any such ideal in preaching ? The power of religion with us is employed to set men on their feet ; to make them fertile , self-sustaining , noble , virtuous , strong , and to build up society of men , each one of whom is large , strong , capacious of room , and filled with versatile powers . Religion with them does no such thing . It doth the reverse . With them it is Herod casting men into prison . With us it is the angel , appearing to lead them out of prison and set them free ! In short religion with us is emancipation and liberty ; with them it is bondage and contentment . It is very plain that while nominally republican institutions exist in both the North and South , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a different purpose . In the North , they aim at the welfare of the whole people ; in the South they are the instruments by which a few control the many . In the North , they tend toward Democracy ; in the South , toward Oligarchy . It is equally plain that while there may be a union between Northern and Southern States , it is external , or commercial , and not internal and vital , springing from common ideas , common ends , and common sympathies . It is a union of merchants and politicians and not of the people . Had these opposite and discordant systems been left separate to work out each its own results , there would have been but little danger of collision or contest . But they are politically united . They come together into one Congress . There these antagonistic principles , which creep with subtle influence through the very veins of their respective States , break out into open collision upon every question of national policy . And , since the world began , a republican spirit is unfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But an aristocratic spirit always has aptitude and impulse toward power . It seeks and grasps it as naturally as a hungry lion prowls and grasps its prey . For fifty years the imperious spirit of the South has sought and gained power . It would have been of but little consequence were that power still republican . The seat of empire may be indifferently on the Massachusetts Bay or the Ohio , on the Lakes or on the Gulf ; if it be the same empire , acting in good faith for the same democratic ends . But in the South the growth of power has been accompanied by a marked revolution in political faith , until now the theory of Mr. Calhoun , once scouted , is becoming the popular belief . And that theory differs in nothing from outright European Aristocracy , save in the forms and instruments by which it works . The struggle , then , between the North and the South is not one of sections , and of parties , but of Principles  --  of principles lying at the foundations of governments  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must hate each other , and contend , until the one shall drive out the other . Oh ! how little do men dream of the things that are transpiring about them ! In Luther 's days , how little they knew the magnitude of the results pending that controversy of fractious monk and haughty pope ! How little did the frivolous courtier know the vastness of that struggle in which Hampden , Milton and Cromwell acted ! We are in just such another era . Dates will begin from the period in which we live ! Do not think that all the danger lies in that bolted cloud which flashes in the Southern horizon . There is decay , and change , here in the North . Old New-England , that suckled American liberty , is now suckling wolves to devour it . What shall we think when a President of old Dartmouth College goes over to Slavery , and publishes to the world his religious conviction of the rightfulness of it , as a part of God 's disciplinary government of the world  --  wholesome to man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to liquidate the long arrearages of Ham 's everlasting debt ! and avowing that , under favorable circumstances , he would buy and own slaves ! A Southern volcano in New-Hampshire , pouring forth the lava of despotism in that incorrupt , and noble old fortress of liberty ! What a College to educate our future legislators ! What are we to think , when old Massachusetts , the mother of the Revolution , every league of whose soil swells with the tomb of some heroic patriot , shall make pilgrimages through the South , and , after surveying the lot of slaves under a system that turns them out of manhood , pronounces them chattles , denies them marriage , makes their education a penal and penitentiary offence , makes no provision for their religious culture , leaving it to the stealth of good men , or the interest of those who regard religion as a currycomb , useful in making sleek and nimble beasts  --  a system which strikes through the fundamental instincts of humanity , and wounds nature in the core of the human heart , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the family , like a bale of goods , to be unpacked , and parceled out and sold in pieces , without any other protection than the general good nature of easy citizens ; what shall be thought of the condition of the public mind in Boston , when one of her most revered , and personally , deservedly beloved pastors , has come up so profoundly ignorant of what we thought every child knew , that he comes home from this pilgrimage , to teach old New-England to check her repugnance to Slavery , to dry up her tears of sympathy , and to take comfort in the assurance that Slavery , on the whole , is as good or better for three millions of laboring men as liberty . He has instituted a formal comparison between the state of society and the condition of a laboring population in a slave system and those in a free State , and left the impression on every page that Liberty works no better results than servitude , and that it has mischiefs and inconveniences which Slavery altogether avoids . Read that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignant ghosts would come flocking there , as if they heard the old roll-call of Bunker Hill . Yea , read those doctrines on Bunker Hill  --  and would it flame or quake ? No . It would stand in silent majesty , pointing its granite finger up to Heaven and to God  --  an everlasting witness against all Slavery , and all its abettors or defenders . At this moment , the former parties that have stood in counterpoise have fallen to pieces . And we are on the eve , and in the very act , of reconstructing our parties . One movement there is that calls itself American . Oh , that it were or or would be ! Never was an opening so auspicious for a true American party that , embracing the principles of American institutions , should enter our Temple of Liberty and drive out thence not merely the interloping Gentiles , but the money-changers , and those , also , who sell oxen , and cattle and slaves therein . It is not the question whether a Northern party should be a party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is simply a question whether , for fear of these things , they will ignore and rub out of their creed every principle of human rights ! I am not afraid of foreigners among us . Nevertheless , our politicians have so abused us through them , that I am glad that a movement is on foot to regulate the conduct of new-comers among us , and oblige them to pass through a longer probation before they become citizens . In so far as I understand the practical measures proposed and set forth in the Message of the Governor of Massachusetts , I approve them . But I ask you , fellow-citizens , whether the simple accident of birth is a basis broad enough for a permanent National party ? Is it a principle , even ? It is a mere fact . Ought we not to look a little at what a man is after he is born , as well as at the place where ? Especially , when we remember that Arnold was born in Connecticut and La Fayette in France . If then , a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents those principles which are fundamental to American Institutions and to American policy ? principles which stand in contrast with European Institutions and policy ! Which of these two theories is the American ? The North has one theory , the South another ; which of them is to be called the American idea ? Which is American  --  Northern ideas or Southern ideas ? That which declares all men free &c.,; or that which declares the superior races free , and the inferior , Slaves ? That which declares the right of every man to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness  --  or that which declares the right of strength and intelligence to subordinate weakness and ignorance ? That which ordains popular education , freedom of speech , freedom of the press , public discussion  --  or that which makes these a prerogative , yielded to a class but denied to masses ? That which organizes Society as a Democracy and Government , and Republic  --  or that which organizes Society as an Aristocracy , and Government as an Oligarchy ? Which shall it be  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that resisted taxation without representation  --  that covered Boston harbor with tea , as if all China had shook down her leaves there  --  which spake from Faneuil Hall , and echoed from Bunker Hill ; or that policy which landed slaves on the Chesapeake  --  that has changed Old Virginia from a land of heroes into a breeding-ground of slaves  --  that has broken down boundaries , and carried war over our lines , not for liberty , but for more territory for slaves to work , that the owners might multiply , and the Aristocracy of America stand on the shores of two oceans , an unbroken bound all between ? If a National American party is ever formed , by leaving out the whole question of Human Rights , it will be what a man would be  --  his soul left out ! An American National party  --  Liberty left out ! An American party  --  Human Rights left out ! Gentlemen , such a party will stink with dissolution before you can get it finished . No Masonry can make it solid  --  no art can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infernal stythy can go deep enough into political mud to hold it ! If you rear up an empty name ; if you take that revered name American , all the world over radiant and revered , as the symbol of human rights and human happiness  --  if you sequester and stuff that name with the effete doctrines of despotism , do you believe you can supplicate from any gods the boon of immortality for such an unbaptized monster ? No . It may live to ravage our heritage for a few days , but there is a spirit of liberty that lives among us , and that shall live . And aroused by that spirit , there shall spring up the yet unaroused hosts of men that have not bowed the knee to Baal  --  and we will war it to the knife , and knife to the hilt . For , IT SHALL be ; America shall be free ! We will take that for our life 's enterprise . Dying , we will leave it a legacy to our children , and they shall will it to theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers are answered , and this whole land stands clothed and in its right mind  --  a symbol of what the earthly fruits of the Gospel are ! If a National party is now to be formed , what shall it be , and what shall its office be ? It shall be a peacemaker , say sly politicians . Yes , peace by war . But an American party , seeking peace with the imperious Aristocracy by yielding everything down to the root  --  one would think no party need be formed to do that . Judas did as much without company . Arnold did that without companions . An American National party must either be a piebald and patched-up party , carrying in its entrails the mortal poison of two belligerent schemes , former legendary disputes , and agitation , and furious conflict ; or , to be a real national party , it must first be a Northern party and become national . We must walk again over the course of history . Here in the North Liberty began . Its roots are with us yet . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having once given forth this spirit of liberty , now fading out of our Southern States , the North should again come forth and refill the poisoned veins that have been drinking the hemlock of Despotism with the new blood of Liberty ! Let us give sap to the tree of Liberty , that it may not wither and die ! When Hercules was born , but yet a child , the jealous Juno sent two serpents to his cradle to destroy him . Hercules or the serpents must die . Both could not lie in the same bed . He seized them and suffocated them by his grip , while his poor brother , Iphiclus , filled the house with his shrieks . An infernal Juno , envious of the destined greatness of this country , hath sent this serpent upon it ! What shall we do ? Shall we imitate Hercules or Iphiclus ? Shall we choke it ; or shall we form a timid National party and shriek ? Gentlemen , you will never have rest from this subject until there is a victory of principles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become American , before there will be peace . If the North gives to the Nation her radical principles of human rights and democratic Governments , there will be the peace of an immeasurable prosperity . If the South shall give to the country a policy derived from her heathen notions of men , there will be such a peace as men have overdrugged with opium , that deep lethargy just before the mortal convulsions and death ! All attempts at evasion , at adjourning , at concealing and compromising are in vain . The reason of our long agitation is , not that restless Abolitionists are abroad , that ministers will meddle with improper themes , that parties are disregardful of the country 's interest . These are symptoms only , not the disease ; the effects , not the causes . Two great powers that will not live together are in our midst , and tugging at each other 's throats . They will search each other out , though you separate them a hundred times . And if by an insane blindness you shall contrive to put off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children , it will go down , gathering volume and strength at every step , to waste and desolate their heritage . Let it be settled now . Clear the place . Bring in the champions . Let them put their lances in rest for the charge . Sound the trumpet , and God save the right ! * * * * * The latter portion of the lecture was frequently interrupted by boisterous applause . * * * * * After Mr. Beecher had taken his seat , there were loud calls for Mr. GIDDINGS , whereupon that gentleman came forward and said that he had not come to make a speech , but , like a good Methodist brother , he would add his exhortation to the excellent sermon of his clerical friend .
