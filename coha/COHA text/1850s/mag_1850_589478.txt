txt STATE OF PARTIES . FEDERALISM , our national evil genius , which has striven for more than half a century to undermine the liberties of the people and overthrow our popular institutions , was never nearer the attainment of its wishes than at the present moment ; corruption is the instrument with which it forks , philanthropy is its cloak ; the oligarchy of England , brought with in reach by improvements in steam communication , is its ally ; and party treachery , with national treason , are openly promoting its views . Amid these many dangers , the hopes of the patriot at home , of the friends of human protress abroad , and the fortunes of future generations yet to cover this continent , hang with fear and trembling upon the Democratic party , in its struggle to maintain those great principles on which alone are based the practicability of self-government ; and never had the friends of freedom greater occasion to be vigilant , firm and cautious , than at the present crisis . The Federalist party never ( under what name soever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident ) attained power , but a system of corruption , through special privileges and reckless expenditure , was put in operation with the boldest and most lavish hand . The vast system of internal improveinents that had sprung up under the administration of J. Q. Adams , which was the offspring of corrupt bargain , presented its gigantic front to the indomitable Jackson , on his accession to the presidential chair , in the shape of *2OO , OOO , OOO of contracts , claimedby unscrupulous jobbers and speculators in all parts of the country as the price of their support . And this machinery of corruption was systematized and strengthened by the Na. tional Bank with its affiliated branches at every commercial center of the Union . To a weak-minded and corrupt man , arriving at power in such a state of affairs , two courses presented themselves . He could , like Louis Philippe , who at about the same time reached the throne of France , embrace the power offered by the patronage of the government , foster extravagance in every possible mode , and , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up for the purpose of reaching the treasury , place himself at the head of an unscrupulous class of speculators VOL* XXVII. - NO . V. 1 // dependent upon a government antagonistic to the interests of the great body of the people , whose rights would daily yield to the increasing pressure of the speculative interests . Such a course was pursued by Louis Philippe , and he sustained it for eighteen years , being finally driven , by an indignant and oppressed people , from the throne and the country , to die in exile amid kindred oppressors . To Jackson , a sagacious , upright and honest patriot , there was only open the alternative of this course , viz.-to adhere to the Constitution in its strict construction , abide by the interests of the people , and crush the whole system of corruption , placing its supporters at defiance . Two state papers sufficed for this  --  the Maysville IRoad veto destroyed the one branch , and the bank veto the other ; and his triumphant second election was an evidence that his course was appreciated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sixteen years to overcome the evils which the former federal administrations had engendered . The accidental circumstances of 1840 again gave power to federalism , and again the moneyed power exerted itself with singular ferocity to regain its position . The early death of General Harrison did not check the movement , it only altered its direction , although the isolation of Mr. Tyler made the application of the patronage more markedly personal . The whole patronage of the government and its means were at the disposal of those who would adhere to the executive . The vast machinery of the federal patronage was applied directly to the buying of a party . The system of corruption by banks , tariffs and internal improvements , by which large classes of borrowers , capitalists , contractors and jobbers , controlling those in their employ , should be bound to the party in power and perpetuate its ascendency , was renewed by Mr. Tyler , as far as his means went , for his own emolument . Fortunately for the country , at that moment the government was without credit -- money could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market and hawked over Europe at " any price ; " the state of trade was such , that customs yielded a revenue far less than was actually necessary for even an economical expenditure . Although Mr. Tyler vetoed Mr. Clay 's bank , he proposed a far worse one in its place , but failed to get it established . There remained , therefore , only the naked offices at the disposal of the executive . These were so freely and unscrupulously used , as to present a novelty in our national politics . The system scattered broadcast through the land , seeds of demoralization which could scarcely fail , almost everywhere , to find at least a little soil adapted to their too-ready germination . A deeper mischief was by this means wrought to the political morality of the country , than could have been attained by the signing of fifty bank charters . The old federal system of corruption had been somewhat on the principle of " take c*ire of the rich , and the rich will take care of the poor . " Their bribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the means , by special privileges , of accumulating at the expense of labor , with the understanding that it might control , and , if need be , coerce dependent voters to the support of a " paternal government . " Tylerism , thanks to the " root and branch work " of Jackson , had not the means of doing this ; but it sought to coi-rupt the people directly with the small offices , thereby bringing down to the electors personally that demoralization which before existed with classes in their relations to the government . The effect of this has been to make speculators bolder , and corruption // in high places more unscrupulous and daring . The torrent was stayed by the triumphant return of Mr. Polk to the Presidential chair . The " attempt and not the deed , " had destroyed federalism for the time , and the economy and credit with which that administration was conducted , were no less conspicuous than its brilliant success . The modification of the taxes upon labor , and the steadiness of the currency under the independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy a larger portion of the things produced . The interchange of exchangeable values has been greater , as manifested upon all the avenues of trade , than ever before , and the federal revenues have reached an amount never before attained . This restored prosperity has renewed the material for federal corruption . The consummation of the measures for which the democratic party had so long contended , unfortunately left no recognized issues before t:he people , when Taylorism presented its specious pretensions to the people ; While some of the usually democratic states were seduced by the false glare of military service to abandon the representative of principle for the misrepresentations of the unprincipled-others were betrayed from their allegiance by the defection of secret federalist allies , and federalism was once more installed in power . The slave-holding soldier of the south became the puppet of coalesced abolitionism and federal corruption . For the first time in the history of the government the cabinet officers became the avowed prosecutors of false claims against the treasury over which they presided , and the system of corrupt expenditure was renewed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that within the decade of 1840 to 1850 , a minister of each of the most important commercial nations has been charged with duplicity and fraud . The cause of the suicide of Teste in France , the censure of Lord Palmerston for duplicity by the House of Peers , and the Galphin discoveries at Washington , mark the growing corruptions of modern governments . The general state of affairs now presents this dangerous aspect . The federal party attained power through the instrumentality of the sectional cry of " free soil , " and of attacks upon the rights of the south tending directly to disunion . The moment it attained that power , the system of consolidation , or centralizing the federal power , by means of money corruptions , was resumed . It seeks to draw from labor through enhanced duties on articles of consumption , the means of feeding a lavish expenditure necessary to the organization of a moneyed oligarchy . That is to say , the old basis of our progress in the regard for states ' rights adherence to the compromises of the Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been disturbed by the agitation of sectional questions which have divided the Democratic party and given the government into the hands of federalism . That power is now attempted to be consolidated , not upon the old democratic states ' rights basis , but upon a system of lavish expenditure , in imitation of the government of Louis Philippe ; and a high tariff with limitless loans , are the proposed resources whence the means to meet this expenditure are to be derived . Already we have had instances where a law of Congress has encountered a seditious resistance fomented by that free soil faction , whose schemes defeated the Democratic party ; and that resistance has been suppressed by the troops of the Federal Govcrnment. * Thus far have we gone in two years // of federal rule ! If the enforcement of federal laws already requires the support of a standing army , and the money power which is to support that army is rapidly concentrating at Washington , how distant are we from a. military despotism ? It is true , resistance to the law couies only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interest of the British government-persons who come here for the purpose of acquiring a position , and exerting their influence for the disturbance of our institutions . The British government has long been noted for the sagacity with which it seeks out talented agents , and it is a known fact that those popular English writers who have most distinguished themselves at home for the rancor of thelr attacks upon American institutions , have , under the administration of that turbulent , unscrupulous and dangerous minister , Lord Palmerston , left the British Islands for the United States , and filed papers . of naturalization in the northern states . The machinations of Turubull in Cuba , may already be finding a parallel in New-York . In order to bear in mind the strength of the government patronage which may be extended by money appropriations in a limitless degree , and applied to the consolidation of federal power , we will recur to our remarks pending the election in which the country was betrayed to federalism The leading schemes to extend the power of the Federal Government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its patronage , may be thus enumerated : - lst , the fishing and salt bounties ; 2d , the protective system ; 3d , a national debt ; 4th , a national bank ; 5th , a system of internal improvements ; 0th , assumption of the state debts ; 7th , distribution of the public lands ; 8th , to abolish postage , and make the post office dependent upon the treasury ; 9th , to arrogate for Congress powers over new territories and new states that may be created , not granted to it by the Ccnstitution . The first eight of these schemes were of a nature to make the private pecuniary interests of individuals in all the states dependent upon the Federal Government . The fishing interests have drawn from the Federal Treasury , since the formation of the govern ment , over $4,000,000 in direct bounties , being money collected from all other citizens , and paid over to them as a gift : a natural result has been , that the recipients of those bounties are those who have prospered less . than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can not now exist without them . They are stipendiaries of the federal treasury . The manufacturing interest , which , as reported by the census of 1840 , comprises *9l,749 out of 4,798,870 active citizens , or 1-17 of the whole population , have long asserted that their interests depend entirely upon the patronage of the government . That unless that government maintains for them a high tariW admitted to be mostly a tax upon consumers , for the patriotic motive of supporting manufacturers too feeble to compete with foreigners , they must discontinue work and become paupers . It was long contended by the friends of a strong government , . that a " national debt was a national blessing , " inasmuch as that every holder of national scrip was a bound adherent of the government which undertook to pay him by extracting the means to do it from his fellow-citizens . A national bank was long clung to as a most notable scheme for giving strength and consistency to the Federal Government . In 1841 , Mr. Clay proposed that Congress should establish a bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus become the partner of at least 20,000 persons , who would subscribe the remainder , . // and this joint proprietary would become the money centre of at least 100,000 borrowers in all parts of the Union . The greatest scheme of all was , probably , that for internal improvements . This policy was commenced nearly a quarter of a century since , and grew steadily with increasing impetus , until , in 1830 , the demands upon Congress for appropriations reached $200,000,000 , to be expended in all parts of the Union on the wildest schemes for personal emolument at the public expense . The policy was crushed by the Maysvifle Road veto of President Jackson . The vetoed bill was reconsidered by a vote of yeas 96 to 92 nays , in the House , and yeas 21 to 17 nays , in the Senate , both votes showing a majority in favor of the bill , but not sufficient to overrule the veto . The national treasury being thus relieved of the burden of local improvements , these were taken up by the states* the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speedily swelled to over $200,000,000 , and the accumulation was stoppcd only by loss of credit . The holders of those stocks then made the most vigorous attempts to have them assumed by the Federal Government , because , as it was expressed in the circular of the Messrs . Barings , of London , it was necessary to have a more comprehensive guarantee ' than state faith for the payment of the debts . Failing in this , the distr*ution of the public lands was contended for . On that plan , the machinery of the land office was to remain in the hands of the Federal Government , and the money so collected paid out to states . The question of post office reform was also seized upon to extend the influence of the government-it was sought , under the delusive cry of cheap postage , to continue the lavish expenditure among some 3,000 contractors , and to throw the whole expense upon the federal treasury without seeking to reform abuses . All these plans formed parts of a great whole , the direct tendency of which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the states in the hands of the federal executive . In order to estimate the power which would thus have been created , had all these schemes been carried out , we may recapitulate the number of persons interested , and the debt which would have been created , as follows : Amount of Number dependent upon expenditure . Federal Government . U. S. National Bank $25,000,000 Stockholders and borrowers 120000 Internal Improvements 500,000.000 Contractors , land ; jobbers , &amp;c 250.000 Debts ussumed from States .  - -  -  - 75,00() 000 Stockholders and jobbers 50,000 Distribution of land revenues . - 40,000,000 Lund agents and d isbursingoflicers .. 10 , OOO Post-office expenses 20,00l* , O00 Post-masters and contractors .. 19,000 Protective system .. . 40000,000 Manufacturers 791,749 Fishing bounties 4,000,000 Cod and mackerel catchers 10,000 Total $704,000,000 Total 1,250,749 The number of active persons in the United States by the census of 1840 , was 8,000,000 . Thus one-fourth of the whole would have been employees of the Federal Government , which would have equalled in corruption that of Louis Philippe . This is a moderate computation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maysville Road bill instead of its veto , and the adoption of the other measures proposed . The amount demanded from the Federal Government for internal improvements in 1830 , being about $200,000,000 , had the policy been adopted by the Federal Government , that amount would have been expended by it instead of by the states , and it would have been increased // by an amount as much greater as the credit of the Federal Government exceeded that of individual states , and we have estimated it at $500,000 ,  - -  000 . There would also have been some $75,000,000 expended by some of the states for banks , &amp;c. , to he assumed . The distribution of the public land revenue would have been about $4,000,000 per annum  --  the post office expenses would have been $3,500,000 per annum . Inasmuch as the revenues have not exceeded the current expenses , the amount of debt would have been increased by all these figures to a sum making over $700,000,000 , bearing over $42,000,000 interest per annum , on the expenditure of which , one and a quarter millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed that this $700,000,000 would have becn borrowed , and the lenders would have swollen the government adherents by at least 200,000 more persons . This picture is no idle conjecture ; it is what we have barely escaped by two executive vetoes against majorities of Congress , produced by the corruption of patronage . Had this mass of patronage been now in existence , what would have stayed the progress of centralization ? The actual officers holding from the executive , are , as we have said , but the machinery through which these different patronage-seeking interests act upon the elections . The campaign of 1840 affords a singular instance of the successful combination of these interests . The chief schemes that led to that election were , tarifl national bank , distribution , and assumption of state debts . All these interests acting with 800,000 office-seekers , and most efficiently aided by the 34,000 bankrupts , who subsequently took advantage of the bankrupt law then clamored for , carried the election . The debts of those bankrupts amounted to $440,934,615 . When we consider the origin of our present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger which would have resulted to its permanence if the above mass of patronage had been created . The Federal Constitution is the offspring of a convention of delegates from the several states . That convention , with much caution and jealousy , delegated certain specified powers to Congress , reserving the infinity of sovereign authority to the several states . From that moment , as we have seen , the strife has been continually to give latitudinarian construction to the powers delegated to Congress . If those constructions had prevailed , and an immense debt , with numberless stipendiary interests depending on the Federal Government , all chafing against the restraints of the Constitution , were in being , a new convention would doubtless be called , and what would be the results of such a convention ? As the present Constitution was framed by a convention which represented the several states , a like extraordinary convention may alter or annul it at their pleasure . The aggregate of the several states , as represented by such a convention , is , therefore , sovereign throughout the Union . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the states ' governments , whose powers it can modify at its pleasure , are equally subordinate to it . A convention growing out of interests , all formed under the influence of a central government , would naturally feel a desire to strengthen that government , and would doubtless proceed by taking from the states all but specified powers , and endowing the Federal Government with the infinite residue , thus giving it a character of absolute sovereignty , which would easily be perpetuated through its improved strength , by taking from it its constituent character as dependent upon a // convention of delegates to alter or abridge it . The rapid and obvious tendency to such results is manifest in the fact , that the veto of the National Bank Bill , in 1841 , drew from Mr. Clay a denunciation of the veto power ; and the abolition of this power was made one of the issues at the election of 1844 . The new attempt to arrogate for Congress the power of laying new states , on their admission into the Union , under disabilities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold and singular position for any party to assume , and belongs peculiarly to that class of projects meant to raise the supremacy of the Federal Government . Congress , under the Constitution , is entirely without the power to interfere with the domestic concerns of any persons , either in states or territories . The attempts to force such a construction upon the powers of Congress , is a singular indication of the recklessness of political aspirants . If this system again gathers force , how long will the institution of the south stand before a moneyed power having control of a convention , and to the patronage of which a standing army will be an eagerly sought appendage ? The federal party obtained power at that election , and the latitudinarian construction of the Constitution has made fearful progress . Under these circumstances , the defeat of General Cass , at the election of 1848 , will prove what we then apprehended and earnestly urged , viz. , the greatest calamity which the country has ever experienced . Under the constant wAtation which has been kept up upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the amount to be provided in the fiscal year , 1851 , will not fall short of $60,000,000 ! Although the present revenue tariff yielded $40,000,000 in 1850 , a larger sum than ever was before obtained from that source , a loan will be demanded to make good a peace expenditure . The public lands , as a source of revenue , can now no longer be depended upon . The enormous figure to which the appropriations of this year have attained , were under the constant urging of the departments . The committees of both houses were harassed by the bureaux in a manner seldom witnessed , and they reported what was demanded of them by the executive . While the constant state of terrorism in which the country and Congress was kept by the abolitionists , represented by Mr. Seward , who was the ally of the Gaiphin cabinet , was a part of the tactics for procuring large appropriations , and the result has been an immense extension of executive patronage , and an unparalleled squandering of money in new directions , with the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific railroad as a government measure , looming up in the background as a lure to future support . The palpable corruption which everywhere pervades federalist rule , particularly in New-York city and state as well as at Washington , affords melancholy evidence of the desperate and reckless manner in which the next campaign is to be conducted . Although the schemes of the Galphin cabinet were promoted by Mr. Seward , who used the federal patronage in this state for the promotion of his own views and to the injury of rivals , the sudden death of General Taylor , followed up by the policy of Mr. Fillmore , has tranferred to him the strength which Mr. Seward had erected for himself . The unprincipled and active politicians who had attached themselves to Mr. Seward as the influential man , and who had been rewarded with office through that influence , suddenly found themselves dependent upon his enemy , Mr. Fillmore . Instead of // turning them out , to form an irritated and formidable opposition under their old leader , he retaiaed them in office and paralyzed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after sinking to a lower level at Washington than ever senator before reached , and which it is to the last degree mortifying to the empire state to contemplate , has raised and forced upon his party the standard of abolitionism , which has thus again become a whig principle . This singular turn in affairs has destroyed the third party , and restored whiggery to its old platform ; but the free-soil movement and slavery agitation may now be considered as at an end . That the repealof the fugitive slave law may be agitated for the present election , is possible , but the ordinance of 1787 and the fugitive slave law , which is only a reiteration of its provisions , will be respected . The ordinance of 1787 was as follows " ARTICLE V 1. - There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territories , otherwise than in punishment of crimes , whereof th' party shall have been duly convicted : Provided always , that any person escaping into the same , from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid . " This article has been called the palladium of the liberties of the northwestern territory . To this alone have the abolitionists ascribed the freedom of the states north of the Ohio from slaves . Before that ordinance , the laws of Virginia permitting slavery prevailed . Those laws were abrogated on the condition that fugitive slaves should be restored . The new law of Congress simply enforces that condition . We are a law-abiding people , and suffer no persons to resist the operation of a law . Those who have the temerity to resist will be made a melancholy example of the consequences of sedition in a country where respect to the law is the only guarantee for the continuance of civilization . None will attempt it , however . The unprincipled , cowardly miscreants who get up meetings to urge others to incur the danger of their own mischievous advice , will skulk from the public indignation . It is not a little singular , however , that a Massachusetts man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , and who is also the grandson of that President who was the author of the famous sedition laws of 1798 , should council sedition in 1850 to a knot of aliens and negroes . The ordinance of 1787 , as we have shown , required the surrender o fugitives , and under the administration of General Washington , February 12 , 1793 , the following law was passed in accordance with the condition on which slavery had been excluded from the north-western territory : " SEc. 3 . And be it also enacted , That when a person held to labor in any of the United States , or in either of the territories on the north-west or south of the river Ohio , under the laws thereof , shall escape into any other of the said States or Territory , the person to whom such labor or service may be due , his agent or attorney , is hereby empowered to seize or arrest such fugitive from labor . and to take him or her before any judge of the circuit or district courts of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any magistrate of a county , city , or town corporate , wherein such seizure or arrest shall be made ; and before proof to the satisfaction of such judge or magistrate , eithe by oral testimony or affidavit taken before and certified by a magistrate of any such State or Territory , that the person so seized or arrested doth , under the laws of the // State or Territory from which he or she fled , owe service or labor to the person claiming him or her , it shall be the duty of such judge or magistrate to give a c ? rtificate thereof to such claimant , his agent or attorney , which shall be sufficient warrant for removing the said fugitive from labor to the State or Territory from which he or she fled . " SEC. 4 . And be it further enacted . That any person who shall knowingly and willingly ol ) struct or hinder such claimant , his agent or attorney , in so seizing or arresting such fugitive from labor , or shall rescue such fugitive fiom such claimant , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority herein given or declared , or shall harbor or conceal such person , after notice that he or she was a fugitive from labor as aforesaid , shall , for either of the said offences , forfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars ; which penalty may be recovered by and for the benefit of such claimant , by action of debt in any court proper to try the same , saving , moreover , to the person claiming such labor or service , his right of action for or on account of the said injuries on either of them . " This law was obstructed in its operation , and more stringent measures were thought to be required . In July , 1798 , the government of John Adams passed a law which read as follows " That if any persons shall unlawfully combine or conspire together , with intent to oppose any measure or measures of the government of the United States , which are or shall be directed by proper authority , or to impede the operation of any law of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place or office in or under the government of the United States , from undertaking . performing or executing his trust or duty ; and if any person or persons , with intent aforesaid , shalt counsel , advise , or attempt to procure any insurrection , riot , unlawful assenibty , or combination , whether such conspiracy , threatening , counsel , advice or attempt shalt have the proposed effect or not , he or they shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor , " &amp;c . The punishment was $5,000 fine , and imprisonment not over five year , and to find sureties for future good behaviour . In the pursuance of the same general policy , the son of John Adams , aided by a corrupt coalition , reached the presidential chair a minority President , and the son of that person is now in connection with an assemblage of aliens and blacks , perpetrating such sedition as his grandfather 's law was directed against ; and he is not the only son of an ex-Presidcnt who has lent himself to treasonable schemes ; such are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new law has been on the ground of its alleged unconstitutionality , and suspension of the habeas corpus act . This allegation was made only by the dishonest , for fraudulent purposes . It is one of the cheats , the loaded dice of political gamblers . The Attorney-General , Mr. Crittenden , in reply to an official note of the President , as to the constitutionality of the fugitive slave bill , remarks " The act of 12th February , 179* , before alluded to , so far as it resp ects any constitutional question that can arise out of this bill , is identical with it . It authorizes the like arrest of the fugitive slave , the like trial , the like judgment , the like certificate , with the like authority to the owner , by virtue cf that certificate as his warrant , to remove him to the state or territory from which he escaped . And the constitutionality of that act , in all those particulars , has been affirmed by the adjudications of state tribunals , and by the courts of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " I conclude , therefore , that so far as the act of the 12th February , 1 793 , has been held to be constitutional , this bill must also be se received , and that the // custody , restraint and removal , to which the fugitive slave may be subjected under the provisions of this bill , are all lawful , and that the certificate to be granted to the owner is to be regarded as the act and judgment of a judicial tribunal having competent jurisdiction . " The slavery agitation having effected the defeat of the Democratic party in New-York , and of the national candidate , is now subsiding into those ranks whence it originated . The Democratic Convention of New-York re-asserted its national principles in the nomination of its candidates , and the Whig party has adhered to its sectionality , in the person of Mr. Seward , taking precisely the same course that it did on the Missouri question . Mr. Jefferson , writing to Lafayette , in 1S*23 , said , on this question " On the eclipse of federalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up the Missouri question , under the false front of lessening the measure of slavery , but with the real view of producing a geogra* ) hical division of parties , which might ensure them the next President . The people of the north went blindfold into the snare , followed their leaders for a while with a zeal truly moral and laudable , until they became sensible that they were injuring , instead of aiding , the real interests of the slaves ; that they had been used merely as tools for electioneering purposes ; and that trick of hypocrisy then fell as quickly as it had been got up. * , How accurately does this describe the course now taken ! The federalist leaders have led the " people of the north blindfolded into the snare , " and it may require another election to awaken them to the fraud that has been practised . The national Democratic party has rallied back upon its old principles , so nobly maintained by General Cass and Senator Dickinson . It has been the happiness of this Review to have agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party and country , amid the perils that have arisen from the slavery question . Early in 1847 we urged the non-intervention principle as the only democratic ground ; and we have cause to congratulate the friends of republicanism , that after the most stormy and protracted debate that Congress ever witnessed , a general return to th t principle became the basis of settlement . A great good has , however , * rown out of the debate . It has exposed the hollowness of the free-soil abstraction . It has attracted the attention of every American to the subject , and the clear , good sense of the people has rejected it . The Democratic party being now purged of this pestilence , although some of the traitors are still permitted in the ranks , will rally upon its ancient ground , and federalism , with its corruption , treason and hypocrisy , will again resume its wonted minority . The national Whig party having again , as before , attained power by the free-soil fraud , will rally upon that patronage which is now so fully in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Constitutioa removes all resraint in the exercise . The first attempt will be a loan , at the coming session , to be followed up by an increase of the tariW the necessity for which will be urged on the ground , not of excess of expenditure , but of inadequate revenues . An abolition of postage , and a transfer of its expenses to the federal treasury , will be demanded on pretence of postage reform , but really for the purpose of extending that patronage in all branches of the service , already large in the direction of ocean steamers , but destined to be much larger . The land bounty bills have greatly extended executive patronage , while they have diminished revenue . The Democratic party must again take ground in opposition to federal extravagance and taxation . The attempt to raise the tariW which // *397 will be earnestly made , if successful , would diminish the revenue by checking trade . The customs ' revenues are levied upon the proceeds of United States produce returning from abroad , and to confiscate a portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shun the business , and necessarily to curtail the markets for flirm produce , now becoming important . A deficiency of revenues caused by a protective tariff and inordinate expenditure , will be made good by borrowing , thus constantly increasing the money power and patronage of the government . The government bank system is dead forever , and the time is now come when the people should look steadily in the face , the fact that they have a Federal Government to support ; that that government should be as economical as possible , and that the sum necessary for its support should be raised in such a manner as will the least interfere with the operations of labor . The principles of political economy are now well settled , and they show that direct taxes upon accumulated property are tbose only which should be levied in a free country . All indirect taxes or imposts upon consumable goods are levied upon labor and not upon capital ; they interfere with the reward of the laborer , check the interchange of products , and therefore diminish their value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor poorer . These effects were never denied , but in monarchical governments were conceived to be a good . Indirect taxes were favorites with absolute rulers , because among an unenlightened people they were paid without remonstrance . This can not be urged in this country . The people do not wish to be cheated out of taxes , but are ready to pay what is requisite in the most economical way . An abolition of customs ' duties will have the effect , not only to promote the sale of very large quantities of the products of labor , but will deprive the government of the patronage of 6,000 office-holders , who divide $3,000,000 of the people 's money among them annually . The amount now yielded by the customs can be assessed , pro rata , among the states , and paid in by the state treasurer to the general treasurer , without any federal machinery whatever . The wants of the community , also , require a relinquishment of the old post-office establishment , by the federal government throwing the mail-carrying open to private competition , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18,000 political agents will close their connection with the federal government , and a source of immense corruption be cut off : The great object to be attained is , to deprive the federal government of patronage , without disturbing the constitution . That government now has the right of raising money by direct or internal taxes , by customs ' duties , and by the sale of land . The latter source has been dried up , and the first-mentioned nenlected . It is only niw to abandon customs , and resort to internal taxes , assessed upon the states . All these have the machinery for state taxes in operation , and they have only to raise an additional amount and pay it over to the Secretary of the Treasury . The post-office arrangement may simply be abandoned , and the services , as in the case of expresses and telegraphs , will be much better performed by public competition . Responsible companies would be glad to carry letters for one cent each , almost to any distance , and danger of mail robberies would decrease . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal treasury , the farmers and laborers will have to pay the postage of the rich . By throwing it open to competition , every man will have to pay his own postage . The great end to be // achieved by substituting internal taxes for customs ' duties is , to restrain the expenditure of the government . Money can not be squandered on *alphin claims , and corrupt contracts , when the constituency of the members voting for it will directly feel in their assessments the result of such votes . Instead of reaching office through the aid of expectant contractors and speculators , the candidate must appeal to economy , and urge reduction of expenses as the means of popular favor .
