THE " HUNDEB BAYS OF NAPOLEON . " WHATEVER relates to the career of Napoleon Bonaparte possesses ai interest that belongs to no other portion of the world 's history . His sudden rise from obscurity , being flung , as it were , from the vortex of the French Revolution upon the stage of action ; his brilliant course and his downfall , come to us so full of romance , that we hardly know whether to credit them as realities , With no other friend than his sword , he entered the lists with the titled nobility of Europe , and soon outstripped them all in the race ; and without the influence of birth or fortune , he seated himself upon the throne of Saint Louis , and swayed the sceptre of France . For almost a quarter of a century , he was , by turns , the benefactor and the scourge of France and the rest of Europe . He obtained a mastery over the minds of men , which no other one in modern times has ever possessed , and he swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . His downfall and retirement into almost the same obscurity from whence he came , furnishes us with one of the most truthful lessons ever written in history , and wisdom , which speaks alike to the hearts and minds of men , may be gleaned from every page . It teaches us how frail is all human greatness-that the honor and power of kings , as well as the hopes of humble men , can pass away in a single day . It shows us how uncertain is worldly glory , and that we should fix our hopes of happiness upon something more stable than that which ceases to exist with the downfall of dynasties . How sudden and terrible was his reverse of fortune ! One day he was the emperor of millions , who feared and obeyed him ; the next , he was shorn of his power , and his name the jest of the lowest rabble of the Faubourgs . These changes are the vicissitudes of life , and they never occur , either to men or nations , without leaving to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days of Napoleon " embraces that period extending from his return from Elha , where he was banished , in 1814 , to his final abdication in 1815 , and is the most ifiteresting portion of the history of Europe , either ancient or modern . The history of this period is so called , because the time between the happening of these two events was just one hundred d%rs . Probably no portion of history for the same length of time presents to the reader a train of events which have caused more wonder and admiration , or had a greater influence upon the European world . The decline of Napoleon 's power may be dated from his unsuccessful campaign in Russia in the year 1812 ; but it is useless now to stop to de-* tail the causes which led to these reverses ; they are known to every rea-* ' der of history . The advantages which the Russians gained over him in this disastrous expedition gave new energy to the allies , and afterwards new foes presented themselves on every side . Instead of having a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The campaigns of 1813 and 1814 were replete with brilliant &amp;vents , and they called into ac // 20 The " Hundred Days of Napoleon . " tion all the talents and energy of Napoleon . By his untiring activity , he raised new armies as fast as old ones had disappeared before the murderous fire of the allies , and always presented a formidable front to the enemy . us genius never shone with more brilliancy , and he performed feats of valor , and gained victories , which appear to have been the result of efforts almost superhuman . Always combating with superior numbers , he had to rely solely upon his own skill for success . These two campaigns are marked by some of his finest strokes of generalship , and alone would be sufficient to give him rank among the first commanders of ancient or modern times . But overwhelming numbers finally triumphed , and he was driven back upon the frontiers of France , and at last to Paris . The allies , flushed with victory , entered the territory of France in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they entered the last day of March . The battle of Paris , the closing act in the bloody drama , was fought on the 30th day of March , and Napoleon was compelled to surrender his crown and throne to the victorious enemy . The entry of the allied armies into Paris was a splendid sight to gaze upon , but deeply humiliating to the French soldiers , many of whom were obliged to witness the pageantry . All was activity in the allied camps , after the victory under the walls of the capital , and the whole army was placed in the most perfect order , that the display in marching into the city might be as brilliant as possible . At noon-day , on the last day of March , 1814 , a hundred thousand men , the most splendid troops in Europe , detiled through the streets of Paris , and took possession of the city . Napoleon , with the small force under his command , retired to Fontaineblean , from which place lie opened negotiations with the allied powers , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished him to abdicate in favor of his son , which he refused to do ; but afterwards , consulting with Ney , Berthier , Lefebvre and others , he had drawn up and signed such an abdication , with the empress as regent . These terms he sent to Paris , but were rejected by the allied sovereigns , who obliged him to sign an unconditional surrender of his throne . A scene of baseness now commenced at Fontainebleau , which was disgraceful in the extreme , and everlastingly sullied those who were guilty of it . As soon as Napoleon 's abdication was known , and the power which he had so long possessed was about to pass into other hands , almost every person of any note around him , deserted to the allies . What baseness ! what perfidy ! So great was their anxiety to hear of his abdication , in order that they might hasten to Paris , and make favor with the new dynasty-every time the door of the emperor 's room was opened , it was filled with heads to learn if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few others of the host whom he had raised from obscurity , with a nobleness of soul which rose far above any selfish desires , remained firm to the fortune of their fallen chieftain to the very last . A formal treaty was concluded , and signed by Napoleon and the allied sovereigns , on the 11th day of April . By this treaty Napoleon renounced , for himself and his descendants , the crowns of France and Italy , but he was allowed to retain the name of Emperor , and his brothers and sisters , nephews and nieces , were also allowed to retain their respective titles . The island of Elba was selected as his future residence , which was recog*ized as an independent principality  --  a sort of miniature kingdom . They // decreed him , as a yearly revenue , two millions five hundred thousand francs from the treasury of France , and a separate allowance to Josephine of one million francs yearly . He was allowed to take with him all his personal effects , and four hundred of his old guards . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His parting from his fkithful troops and the few personal friends who yet remained loyal to him , was affecting in the extreme , and drew tears from all who witnessed it . The old guard , who , a.s it were , had borne his imperial diadem on their bayonet points , and carried his victorious banners into every capital in Europe , wore drawn up on the plains of Fontaineblean to receive his farewell . Napoleon , surrounded by a few faithful generals , went among the soldiers , and amid a breath-. less silence and tearful eyes , addressed them a few parting words . So strong had the attachment become between the . great leader and these trusty followers , that his emotions in saying farewell almost overpowered him . With a great effort he tore himself from the embrace of those who surrounded him , sprang into his carriage , and rode off . He was escorted by a large body of troops to the port of Fejus , where he embarked on board an English frigate for his place of destination . Louis XVIII . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession established as it was before the revolution . He entered Paris on the 3d of May , from England , where he had passed an exile of twenty-five years , and immediately ascended the throne of his ancestors . The treaty of Paris was signed on the 30th of May , which provided that France should be reduced to its original limits as they were on the 1st of January , 179* . Holland was to be an independent state , governed by the house of Orange . Germany was to be independent , under the guarantee of a federal union . Switzerland was also to be independent , under a government of her own , and Italy divided into sovereign states . Provision was also made for the free navigation of the Rhine , and the restoration of the West India Islands to the powers from which they were captured . And in addition to these public provisions , there were some secret articles in the treaty , which related chiefly to the disposition of a large district of territory which Na .. poleon had taken from different states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allied sovereigns made a visit to England , and upon their return , withdrew their respective forces from France , and left Louis in quiet possession of his throne . The events which now follow are considered as the principal causes which led to the return of Napoleon from his exile at Elba , and again involved Europe in a bloody war . Every reader knows the simple fact , that Napoleon returned to France from his place of banishment , and after being in a short was overthrown at the battle of Waterloo ; power time , but few , comparatively , are familiar with the train of events which led to his return . Napoleon being in exile , and the allies having returned to their respective countries , it became the dutty of Louis to reorganize the governmen ; and a task more difficult to perform , than that which now devolved upon the French monarch , never fell to the lot of a sovereign . During the dreadful struggle which had preceded the fall of the Empire , the lesser evils were forgotten in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stricken down , and the cause which firmly bound together all who opposed him had ceased to exist , and they came to remodel the government , difficulties , which were almost irreconcilable , appeared among // them . While they were arrayed against Napoleon , whom they deemed a common enemy , there was a unity of sentiment , and a concert of action ; but he had no sooner surrendered his power , than jealousies , as rancorous as those which had severed the Empire , arose . In remodelling the government , so many different and conflicting interests had to be conciliated , and so many desires satisfied , that the king found it utterly impossible to establish it upon a stable foundation . The historian of those times says " The seeds of the disunion which paralyzed the restoration , were beginning to spring up even before Louis XVIII . had ascended the throne , and his subsequent reign , till the hundred days , was but an amplificati n of the causes which produced the return of Napoleon . " The veterans of the revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tafleyrand and the royalists to overthrow Napoleon , with the express understanding that in the formation of the new government they were to be amply provided for . A great difference of opinion prevailed as to the extent to which the popular power should be revived upon the restoration . This was the source of much angry feeling . Some mentioned openly , that the constitution of 91 was to form the basis of the new government , with strong guarantees against any encroachment b* the monarch on the rights of the people . These divisions of opinion soon created parties , who took sides under leaders , and arrayed themselves against each other . Unmindful of advice from any quarter , the French king determined to have his own way , and to form the government upon such a plan as he deemed most conduewe to the glory of his kingdom . He had made up his mind to take a middle course , and by conciliating both the royalists and the republicans , obtain their united support , and thus render his seat on the throne firm and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned from history , that that ruler who endeavors to draw to himself the support of two rival parties by conciliating them , gains the ill will and opposition of both , and thus paves the way to his own overthrow . In a few days after the king had ascended the throne , he called a convention for the purpose of forming a constitution , or rather a charter of government ; and after a session of five days , they promulgated one , by which the French people were to be governed under the new order of things . It made the government a monarchy , and in many instances gave the king almost absolute power . Under the Empire , suffrage was universal-this was now abridged , and a property qualification for electors was introduced , which deprived a majority of the people of the right of voting . It was a serious cause of alarm , and the people showed an unwillingness to he deprived of a single right they had enjoyed under the reign of Napoleon . Without a doubt , the joy at the restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement was over , and the allies had been withdrawn , the losses and reverses which had overtaken them , together with the sadness of the change , seemed to sink into the very soul of the nation . Whole classes were in a state of uneasiness , caused mainly by the uncertainty of the future . The holders of national domain , which had become private property under the laws of the Empire , considered the guarantee the government gave them , as insufficient to secure their possessions . The regicides , whose hands had been stained in the blood of the revolution , con*-sidered the restoration as a judgment upon their former bad . conduct , and // trembled lest punishment should yet be meted out to them . The marshals and generals who had received large estates from Napoleon , in the different conquered provinces , flow separated from France , as a compensation for their valuable services , felt great disquietude at the thought of being deprived of them , and left in their old age without the means of support . The army , driven back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ready for any change of fortune that might enable them to regain the laurels they had lost . The excitement of the camp and the battle-field , the march and the bivouac , were now at an end , and distributed in the various provincial towns , they were compelled to lead an inactive life . The tens of thousands of workmen who had been employed on the different public works in the various provinces now severed from the Empire , came flocking in crowds to Paris . The palace of the Tuilleries was besieged from morning until night by clamorous crowds  --  the republicans asking for employment and relief-while the royalists , who had shared a twenty-five year 's exile with their monarch , demanded some remuneration for the losses they had sustained . With an empty treasury , and no immediate means of supplying it , it was impossible to answer these pressing demands . The army was several months in arrears in their pay , and both officers and men were loud and angry in their claims . In this state of affairs , the course pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was weak in the extreme . The king , trying to please everybody , pleased nobody . He worked to retain in office all the imperial functionaries whom he knew were much more competent to manage affairs than his own friends , the royalists . At this the latter were highly displeased , and considered themselves but illy repaid for all the sufferings and privations they had endured for their exiled king . The army was treated in a manner well calculated to create discontent . The national colors , which had become an object almost of holy reverence to the French soldiers , and which were associated with all their victories and glorious memories , were abolished , and the white flag of the hated Bourbons substituted in their stead . The organization of the army was changed , and in such a manner that the different corps almost entirely lost their old identity under their new names . The numbers of the different regiments of infantry , artillery and cavalry , were altered , thereby , in a great measure , destroying the association of names with their former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with the newly-raised recruits . The eagles were wrested from the standards , but generally concealed by the officers ; and the tn-color cockade , which the men were now forbidden to wear , was hidden by them in their knapsacks . The tn-color standards , which had waved in triumph over so many victorious fields , were ordered to be given up , but the soldiers generally burned them , saying they would , at least , preserve their ashes . The grades of all the officers were changed , substituting those of the old monarchy . The old imperial guard , which had always occupied the post of honor at the palace , were removed , and their place supplied by the Swiss guard , and other foreign troops . Neither the officers nor soldiers were allowed to make any allusion to the name of the Emperor . The army was much reduced-first , to one hundred and forty thousand , and then to eighty thousand men . An ordinance was passed which placed every officer not in actual employment , on half pay , and those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Paris , unless already living there . These changes had a powerful effect on the troops , and they brooded over their wrongs in sullen silence . All parties laid aside their previous animosities , and directed their combined effbrt* to make the new government unpopular , hoping by this means to overthrow it . They found fault with everything that was done , and took care always to throw the blame on Louis . Although the king had selected able men for his cabinet , yet the steady opposition they encountered from all parties , brought his government into difficulty daily . The errors of his civil administration were numerous , and contributed towards his downfall . An ordinance was passed prohibiting the ordinary work on Sunday , which caused a large portion of the lower classes to murmur . During the days of the revolution and the empire , they had been allowed to pursue their labor on all days alike , and now they did not like this restraint . The old noblesse treated the wives of the nobles of the empire with marked disrespect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The king abolished the order of the Legion of Honor for that of Saint Louis . This measure was very unpopular with the officers and soldiers , many of whom had been decorated with the former for their bravery on the field of battle . While the king wished to conciliate the imperialists , and have their aid in the administration of affairs , he took no pains to conceal from them his aversion to the principles of the revolution . In fine , Louis possessed neither the courage nor the ability to contend successfully with all these difficulties , and it is not at all surprising that lie gave way under them . While the French King was then endeavoring to heal up the wounds caused by the revolution , and to establish order in his dominions , events of the most vital importance were taking place in another quarter of Europe . We allude to the Congress of Vienna . The allied sovereigns originally intended that the Congress should meet about the latter end of July , ( 1814 ) , but by reason of their visit to England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not convened until about the first of the following November . Probably no legislative body of men , which have assembled in Europe in modern times , have attracted more attention than this Congress of Sovereigns at Vienna . The eyes of the whole civilized world were upon them , and it was expected that their proceedings would have an important bearing on the general welfare of Europe . But the true cause of their meeting was very different from that alleged , and as , much as they endeavored to conceal it , they were unable to hide from the people of Europe the real objects they had in view . For many years previous to the overthrow of Napoleon , liberal principles had been gradually making their way among the people of Europe . Kings were denied the divine right to rule . The people were becoming awakened to a sense of their own legitimate rights , and were determined to loose the shackles which had hung around them , and to stand forth as their own masters . They now began to feel within them , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made them free . Their hearts beat a hearty response to the sentiments which the western winds wafted from their brethren in the new world , and like them , they desired to say who should be their rulers and make their laws . This freedom of thought-this newborn energy which was quickening in the hearts and in the minds of the people , made the monarchs of Europe tremble . To meet a crisis like // this , and also to arrange matters arising out of the Treaty of Paris , were the immediate causes which induced the assembling of the Congress of Vienna . They there formed the " balance of power , " which , in plain English , is nothing more nor less than a union of the most powerful states of Europe , who pledged themselves to use their combined force to put down any attempt of the people to reform their governments . This combination of kings against the liberties of the people , was remodelled at Paris in 1815 , after Napoleon 's second abdication , under the name of the " Holy Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world . This " Holy Alliance " ( unholy it should have been called ) , since that time has had two important meetings , one at Trappeau in Austrian Silesia , in 1820 , after the close of the Neapolitan revolution  --  and the other Layback , in January , 1821 . Among other matters which claimed the attention of the allied sovereigns at Vienna , was the disposition of a territory containing more than thirty millions of people , which was to be divided among them for their services in dethroning Napoleon . They found as much difficulty in agreeing about the disposal of this territory , as the French king had in organizing his government . It was found almost impossible to satisfy the various interests which were claiming indemifi. cation , each demanding more than the others were willing to allow . The alliance was completely broken for a time  --  the breach was widened daily , and nothing but the sudden return of Napoleon from Elba at this juncture of affairs , prevented an open rupture between the allied sovereigns . The Emperor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an indemnification for the losses he had sustained , and said it would be worth his crown and throne to return home without an adequate remuneration . In support of this claim , he offered a very potent argu. ment , which was , that he had three hundred thousand troops ready to march , at a moment 's warning , to any point in Europe . In this demand Alexander was supported by the King of Prussia , who was wholly in his interest . France , Austria and England opposed these ambitious views . The divisions ran high , and each party prepared for war . The Emperor Alexander halted all his troops who were returning to Russia , in Poland , and the Grand Duke Constantine , who commanded them , issued a flaming proclamation to the Poles , telling them that the Emperor wished to restore to them their old nationality , calling upon them to rally around his standard . In the meantime a secret treaty had been concluded between Austria , England and France , and signed at Vienna the 3d day of February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to support each other , in case of war , and to carry out in full force the treaty of Paris . Affairs were in this situation when the news was brought to Vienna , that Napoleon had secretly left Elba , and had landed on the c9ast of France . It was like a bomb-shell in the camp of the allies-all was consternation and alarm . Minor difficulties were healed at once , and they thought only of preparing to meet their common enemy . The Congress soon adjourned , and the sovereigns hastened to their respective capitals , to prepare for the conflict . The news of the return of Napoleon astonished all Europe , and so well aware were the allies of the danger that menaced them , that soon they had more than a million of troops in arms , and converging from different points towards France . The saying of Chateaubriand , " that if the cocked-hat and surtout // of Napoleon , were placed on a stick on the shores of Brest , it would cause Europe to run to arms , from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this instance . Let us now turn from the allied sovereigns and their schemes of European aggrandizement , to the situation of Napoleon on the Island of Elba , and trace his course from his landing upon the shores of France , until he was again reseated upon the imperial throne . Elba is a small island in the Mediterranean Sea , within sight of the coast of Tuscany , and within a few days sail of France . The act of his leaving this island has been much animadverted upon by his enemies , and much pains taken to place him in the wrong . By the terms of the abdication , this island was given to him as a sovereignty , and a certain revenue guaranteed to be paid to him , to maintain his imperial honors in his kingdom . These terms the allies failed to comply with , band the contract having been violated on one side , he was no longer bound to fulfill it , on his part . They failed to pay to him his annual revenue , and instead of recognizing him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had guard-ships stationed around his island . Sir Neil Campbell was the English spy commissioner , and each of the other allied sovereigns had a similar functionary there , whose duty It was to make reports to their governments of every movement of the Emperor . Thus he was watched like a felon from day to day , and smarting under this ungenerous treatment , he determined to leave his place of confinement , and make a bold stroke to regain his lost throne and empire . Thus situated , Napoleon kept up a brisk correspondence with his friends in France and Italy , and by them was advised of every movement of the allies at the Congress of Vienna . A vast conspiracy was formed , with its centre in Paris , whose ramifications extended into every province and department in France . The officers and soldiers of the army were , more . than any others , the grand movers in it . Although they had taken an oath to support the new government , they had , by no means , renounced their allegiance to Napoleon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardships they had undergone were forgotten , and they thought of him only as their victorious Emperor  --  the idol of their hearts . He opened a direct correspondence with Murat , who again threw himself into his interest , and promised to furnish him with numerous troops the moment he should put his foot upon the shores of France . Every thing was now prepared for leaving the island . His friends throughout France were warned of his intended movements , and were both ready and willing to aid him . As extensive as these plans of revolution were , they had been thus far matured , without the allies having the least suspicion that such an event was about to take place , and all this in spite of the close surveillance over the Emperor and all his movements . On the 2Gth of February , 1815 , he gave a grand ball at the town of Porto Ferrajo , which was graced with the presence of his mother , and his sister ,  --  the Princess Pauline . While they were doing the honors of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon that occasion , the Emperor appeared in his most fascinating mood , and going around the room , talked with his guests in the most familiar manner . In the meantime , he had despatched orders to his troops , to hold themselves in readiness at the quay . During the afternoon* he secretly left the ball-room and went to the quay , where he found his troops drawn up , about eleven hundred strong , under the command of // Bertrand , Drouat and Cambronne . They immediately began embarking , and by seven o'clock all were on board . To the wondering inhabitants who witnessed the embarkation , he said , " that he was going to the coast of Barbary to chastise the pirates , who , from time immemorial , had infested the coasts of Elba . " Sealed instructions were given to the captain of L'Jnconstant , on board of which was Napoleon , which were not to be opened until they were several leagues at sea . When fairly out at sea , he opened them , and for the first time learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast of Province . The prows of the ships were immediately turned in that direction . When the soldiers knew tbey were on their way to the coast of France , they burst out into wild shouts of joy , and made the welkin ring again , with cries of " long live the Emperor . " After the first manifestation of feeling was over , a sadness seemed to take possession of both officers and men , and a deep silence prevailed throughout the ships . Their minds were filled with sad presentiments of the future , and a recollection of other times came full and fresh to their memory . The vessels pursued their way without interruption , and on the first of March cast anchor in the Gulf of Juan . The troops immediately disembarked , and kindling some watch-fires on the sand , bivouacked near the shore . A little incident occurred on the passage , which sbows what admirable presence of mind Napoleon was possessed of at all times . On the evening of the 27th , when off Leghorn , a French brig came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board of . To prevent his soldiers from being discovered , he made them lie flat upon the deck with their caps off The captain of the French vessel inquired of Napoleon himself about the Emperor 's health , who answered , that he was well . The hrig suspecting nothing , passed on . The officers , as well as the men , were impressed with the importance and magnitude of the expedition they were engaged in . With a force of only twelve hundred men , they had landed upon the coast of France , and arrayed themselves in arms against all Europe . Napoleon infused into this small band of faithful followers his own sanguine hopes , and raised somewhat their drooping spirits . As there was no time to be lost , he immediately commenced his march . He took the road by Gap , to Grenoble , through the mountains , everywhere distributing his proclamations to the inhabitants . On the 7th of March they approached the fortress of Grenoble , where General Marchaud was in command , who hearing of his advance , sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded the advance-guard , first encountered this force , and seeing no signs of disaffection among the troops , sent word to Napoleon , who was in the rear . The latter remarked to Bertrand , who was at his side , " we are betrayed , " and immediately rode forward , dressed in his wellknown surtout and cocked-hat . Arriving before the opposing force , he rode in front of them , and said : " Comrades do you know me ? " " Yes , sire , " they answered . " Do you recognize me , my children ? I am your Emperor ; fire on me , if you wish . " This appeal of their beloved Emperor was overpowering , and they immediately threw down their arms and rushed to embrace him . As soon as their manifestations of joy had subsided , they mounted the tan-colored cockade , and arrayed themselves under his banners . Colonel Labedoyerfl , who commanded a regiment in the same garrison , in disobedience to the orders of his superior officer , marched // with his men to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garrison , he drew an eagle from his pocket , and embraced it before his soldiers . They immediately broke in the head of a drum which was filled with tan-colored cockades , and soon one was mounted on each cap . When Napoleon appeared , they made the air resound with their cry of " Vive L'Emperor , " and joined his forces . His column , now near three thousand strong , marched upon Grenoble , and breaking down the gates , entered the town in triumph . He rested there that night . The citizens , in crowds , flocked to see him , and bid him welcome again to the shores of France . He was busily employed during his stay there , making civil appointments , and other arrangements to secure himself in favor . The next morning he continued his march towards Paris , meeting with no opposition . In every part of the country his old soldiers joined his standard , and the middle and lower classes welcomed his return with many demonstrations of joy . Let us now turn from Napoleon and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris and the king . Louis was entirely ignorant of the dangers which had been gathering around him , for a longtime ; he had not even a suspicion , founded upon anything tangible , that such a vast conspiracy was on foot , to wrest from him his crown and throne . A close watch was kept upon all the movements of the Imperialists , but to no purpose ; and neither he , nor his ministers , dreamed of what was about to take place . Meetings were held nightly in different parts of Paris , and even in his very household their plans were being matured . Being in fancied security , the astounding intelligence he received of the movements of Napoleon made a deeper impression . All Paris was in commotion , and the king and his government in the greatest alarm . He endeavored , in vain , to rally the royalists to resistance , but all seemed paralyzed , and incapable of making headway against the tide that was rolling up towards the capital . He convoked the Chamber of Deputiesdespatched messengers to different parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Napoleon-sent large bodies of troops against him , who in every instance joined his standard , and recommended other measures which the emergency seemed to require . All these efforts were useless  --  the finger of destiny had marked the Bourbon throne for overthrow , and no power that Louis could control was able to save it . Marshal Ney , at the head of a large force , was sent by the king , from Paris , to stop the advance of the Emperor , and when he set out promised his royal master to bring him back in an " iron cage . " But the iron cage and his promises to the king were all forgotten when he arrived in sight of Napoleon , whom he and his troops immediately joined , without any attempt to resist his march . Napoleon entered Lyons on the 12th , amid the acclamations of the populace , and the keys of the city were surrendered to him with much ceremony by the municipal authorities , who gave in their allegiance . When the news reached the king that Ney and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have fled-as great confidence had been placed in the fidelity of the old Marshal . But the king , seeing such general disaffection in the army , and failing in support even from his own partisans , and losing all hope of retaining the crown , determined to leave Paris . He and the royal family set out on the evening of the 19th , attended only by a few friends , and a small guard , and went in the direction of Flanders . The same evening Napoleon arrived // at Fontainbleau , and the next afternoon set out for Paris , which he reached in the evening , and took possession of the palace of the Tuilleries . Thousands had assembled there to welcome him , and he was received with the most unbounded demonstrations of delight . The extensive courtyard around the palace was filled with his faithful troops , who bore him aloft in their arms , to the grand saloon , where he was welcomed by the kisses and smiles of the imperial ladies who had assembled to greet his coming . Never before did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus far his triumph had been bloodless-everywhere opposition had fled from before him , and both soldiers and peasants hailed his advent with joy . History furnishes no parallel to his march through France , and victorious entry into Paris . He had landedupon the coast of a distant province , marched from one end of the kingdom to the other-subdued every thing which had opposed his course , and finally wrested a crown and throne from a powerful monarch , without shedding on ediopof blood . The like had never been known before . Although again seated upon the throne of France , he well knew his situation was a precarious one , and that all his energy would be required to prepare for the important crisis that was approaching . His first duty was , to reorganize the government , and in doing so , he had double the difficulties to contend against that beset Louis XVIII . And in addition to these civil duties which pressed upon him , he had also to prepare to meet a million of armed men who were arrayed against him . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Napoleon , and the amount of labor which he performed in so short a time seems almost incredible . The arsenals were entirely empty of military stores and arms-among other items , twelve hundred pieces of cannon had been ceded to the allies by the treaty of Paris . The army had been almost entirely disbanded during the reign of Louis , and not more than a hundred thousand men were now under arms , scattered throughout France , in*tbe different garrison towns . The first step Napoleon took towards reorganizing the army , was to return the eagles to the different regiments , which was done with great pomp and ceremony . All the old veterans who had retired from service , were called in by proclamation-additions were made to all the regiments , and thirty new battalions of artillery were organized from the sailors of the fleets . Both the old and young guard were strengthened , by adding a new battalion to each regiment , and filling up the old ones . By these means he calculated to have , at least , four hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the first of September , he expected to have six hundred thousand foot , and sixty thousand admirable horse in the field . He found it a herculean task to provide arms and clothing for these troops . Manufactories of arms were established in different parts of the empire  --  the old arms everywhere called in , and the workmen in all the armories doubled . Horses were purchased at fairs at different parts of the country , and each department was ordered to furnish a certain amount of clothing . He found as much difficulty in reorganizing the civil government as the army , and no other man could have so soon , brought order out of chaos . Many of the imperialists , who were most anxious for his return , now that he was on the throne , declined taking any responsible trust under him ; - with Europe in arms against him , they felt a disquietude and uncertainty as to his success . The public // treasury was empty , and with an impoverished country , it was with great difficulty Napoleon could raise funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open negotiations with the allies , but failed in the attempt ; they would not entertain any propositIons coining from him . Murat was so much elated at the return of Napoleon , that he immediately raised the standard of revolt , and with an army of fifty thousand men attempted to wrest Naples from the hands of the allies , and secure himself upon the throne . He was defeated in the first engagement with the Austrians , and fled to France . The Royalists attempted to raise a rebellion in La Vende* , a district in the southern part of France , where the Bourbon feeling ran high , and by this means distract the plans of Napoleon , and draw his attention from the allies . He was aware of their object , and at once sent a strong force into the district , and put down the rebellion . While Napoleon was making these preparations , the allies were assembling their forces , and advancing towards the frontiers of France . England had now thrown all her influence into the coalition , and had sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wellington . The time was now approaching when the fate of France and Europe was again to he decided by force of arms , and the respective combatants were exerting all their strength . The efforts of Napoleon to meet the crisis which he saw was drawing nigh , were amost superhuman , and his abilities as a great commander were never more clearly exhibited . He had made up his plan of the campaign with the greatest care and attention , and was almost confident of success . He made Paris the base of his operations , which had been strongly fortified by General Haxo and his engineers , and mounted with seven hundred pieces of cannon . Lyons was also strongly fortified . Lie had assembled armies at different points on the frontiers to watch the movements of the enemy , who had made their arrangements to advance upon Paris from several points . - The chief reliance , however , was placed upon the main army , commanded by Napoleon in person , one hundred and twenty thousand strong , with three hundred and fifty pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive operations in Flanders , on the frontiers of which they were already collected . The object of Wellington was , to invade France direct from Flanders , and the better to conceal his intentions , and divert the attention of Napoleon from the real point of attack , he suggested to the Austrian and Russian commanders , to make a demonstration further south . The ruse however failed , as Napoleon was not to be diverted from the objects he had in view . The force of Wellington and Blucher , and with which the Emperor was likely first to come in collision , numbered one hundred and ninety thousand men , all veterans , and inured to war . As the British and Prussians had not yet united , Napoleon determined to interpose the whole of his force between them , and by striking first upon the right and then upon the left , beat them in detail . His plans were skilfully laid , and well nigh proved successful . Napoleon left Paris on the 12th of June to join the army , and arrived at Avernes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole force by the returns on the morning of the 14th , was one hundred and twentytwo thousand four hundred men under arms . The camps were placed behind some hills , about a league from the frontiers , which hid their position from the enemy . The Emperor addressed the troops , calling to their // minds their former deeds of glory-their enthusiasm was raised to the highest pitch . Wellington and Blucher in the meantime were inactive . Their troops were scattered over several leagues of country , and they were waiting for secret intelligence from Paris , of Napoleon 's movements . He had taken every precaution to pr*vent the allies from knowing his situation . Wellington had , however , learned , by his usual system of brihery and corruption with the worst scoundrels of France , of the collection of large bodies of troops on the frontiers , but waited for confirmation before he should move-his inactivity was almost fatal to him . On the morning of the 15th , the active operations of the campaign began . At daylight on that morning , the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Prussians , who had been in possession of that place , retired upon the advance of the French , in the direction of Fleurus . It was evident that Napoleon had taken Blucher by surprise , and he had the most sanguine hopes of being able to separate the Prussian and British armies . In order to accomplish this more effectually , he despatched Ney to Quatre Bras with the left wing , fortysix thousand strong-this was an important position , at the intersection of the roads leading towards Brussels . A severe action was fought there the next day . Napoleon , with the main army , seventy-two thousand strong , marched towards Fleurus , from which place the Prussians fell back to Ligny , where he gave them battle the next day , and gained a splendid victory ,  --  the loss of the Prussians was about twenty-five thousand . The victory at Ligny exposed the left flank of the allies , and Wellington seeing that he could not maintain his ground with his left flank uncovered , fell back to Waterloo , and took up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely followed by Napoleon . The beginning of the end was now near at hand , and the contending armies knew the fate of the campaign was to be decided on the spot where they were then assembling . The field of Waterloo was admirably adapted for a great battle , and had previously been examined by Wellington and the English engineers . It is situated about nine miles from Brussels , and one mile south of the village of the same name . It extends from right to left about tWo miles . Let the reader imagine two ridges of hills running parallel to each other , and from a half to three-quarters of a mile apart . The descent is gradual into the valley , through which winds a small stream . The position is cut nearly at right angles by a high road running from Brussels to Charleroi ; and an unpaved country road runs along the northern crest of hills . Between this field and Brussels , to the north , was au extensive forest , called the " forest of Soignies . " The two armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied the opposite ridges of hills , the English the north , and the French the south- ridge . On the right of the British lines was a strong built country-house , surrounded by a thick stone-wall , in a grove of trees ; the left was protected by an almost inaccessible hedge and deep ditch : these with r* strong farm-house in the centre , added much to the strength of the English position . The French right rested in the village of Blanchenois , and in the centre was the village of La Belle Alliance , where Napoleon took up his head-quarters . Both armies took up their position on the evening of the 17th , and during the night rested on their arms . It had rained incessantly during the 17th , and the great number of horses and carriages passing over the ground reduced it to a state of mud . The // soldiers slept upon the ground in their wet blankets , and passed a cheerless night ; but , as uncomfortable as their situation was , there was no despondency in either army . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnitude of the stake that was at issue . A quarrel of nearly twenty-five years standing , was now to be settled by the two greatest commanders of the times . There never were two armies which appeared to greater advantage than those which were drawn up at Waterloo . Napoleon had again collected around his standard his old veterans , which the treaty of Paris had set at liberty . They had been victors with him in an hundred battles , and now their feelings were raised to the highest point of enthusiasm . Wellington had also just cause to be proud of his troops-those which had fought under him in Spain were there , and they never appeared in finer array . The memorable 18th of June opened with a drizzling rain , but the sun soon cleared the clouds away , and a bright day beamed down on the work of death . The two armies , as they took up their positions in the order of battle , presented a beautiful spectacle , and struck all the beholders with admiration . The rays of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hundred and sixty thousand men ; and the music of an hundred bands fairly made the earth resound with sweet sounds as the heavy columns wound over the opposite hills . The battle commenced about 11 o'clock , and lasted until dark ; both armies fought with bravery bordering on desperation . The world knows the result . Treachery and superior numbers accomplished what English valor and discipline had essayed to do , in vain  --  the defeat of the French . From a retreat , it soon became a total rout  --  and so hotly were the French pursued by the victorious Prussians , that they were obliged to throw away their arms to save themselves . Napoleon 's loss was from thirty to forty thousand men-that of the allies , including the former actions , was much greater . When all was lost , the Emperor set off for Paris , and was the first who carried the news of the defeat . He immediately appeared before the Chamber of Deputies , when a stormy time took place . After much persuasion , he abdicated , and retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josephine . Napoleon determined , at first , to come to America , but finding this impossible , concluded to throw himself upon the supposed generosity of the English . For this purpose , he left Malmaison on the morning of the 29th of June , and arrived at Rochefort on the 3d of JulyA* lie addressed the following letter to the Prince Regent of England , and sent it to Captain Maitland , of the Bellerophon , then lying in the harbor : " Exposed to the factions which divide my country , and to the hostility of the great powers of Europe , 1 have terminated my political career , and I come , like Themistocles , to Seat myself by the hearth of the British people . I put myself under the protection of its laws , and claim it from your Royal Highness . as the most powerful , the most constant , and the most generousof my enemies . " On the morning of the 14th he went on board , and was received with the honors due to his high rank ; and Captain Maitland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner .. From England he was taken to the island of St. Helena , which had been fixed upon by the allies as his place of exile . He died there , May 5th , 1821.
