ART . JX. - MORALITY OF THE NEBRASKA BILL . Right of Petition . New England Clergymen . iRemarks of Messrs . EVERETT , DOUGLASS , HOUSTON , MASON , BUTLER , ADAMS , PETTIT , SEWARD , BADGER , 011 the memorial from some 3,050 clergymen of all denominations and sects in New England , remonstrating against the passage of the Nebraska Bill . Senate of the United States , March 14 , 1854 . Letter of Senator DOUGLASS , vindicating his character and his position on the Nebraska Bill , against the assanits contained in the proceedings of a public meeting composed of twentyfive clergymen of Chicago . Speches in Congress on the JATebraslea Bill . THE conspirators at Washington have not relinquished their purpose of abolishing the existing prohibition of slavery in the territory west of the Mississippi . They are rallying and re6rganizing their forces . They are making new bargains and alliances of faction with faction . They are watching for an opportunity of carrying their measure by some sudden movement . No moment since the beginning of the agitation-no moment perhaps , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical in respect to the destiny of our common country , than the present . No sentinel on the ramparts of freedom should relax his vigilance . No man who loves righteousness and dreads the progress of oppression , should cease from his efforts to enlighten and concentrate public opinion against the intended iniquity . It will be understood then , without any explanation on our part , why it is that although the subject has been treated , under some of its aspects , by another pen , in a foregoing article of this Number , we resume the consideration of it here . We do this , as we are aware , at some risk of repeating what may have been already more forcibly expressed-possibly at some risk of a seeming discrepancy among the collaborators in the New Englander . But writing on the great question of the hour , and writing from the fnlness of our convictions , we are willing to trust that iteration , if we happen to repeat , may be useful , and that even some slight discrepancy , if there should seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has already passed through the hands of the printer , may do no harm . Our aim is to disentangle the question from the // complicatibn of sophistries which have been drawn around it ; and to show how simple and intelligible a question of duty it is which is now pending in Congress , and on which rep*esentatives and senators , if wavering , should be admonished by the utterance of public opinion , or , if faithless to justice and to freedom , should be rebuked by the thunder of public indignation . The question pending , is whether a great national crime shall be perpetrated . It is , therefore , a question which concerns not statesmen only , nor economists , nor men of political science , nor the managers of parties , but everycitizen . There is such a thing as national responsibility to God for national sins . The government of God , in this world , deals not with individuals only , but also with communities and nations . Crimes committed even by kingly rulers often bring not upon those rulers only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visitations of God 's displeasure against sin . So in a republic where the will of the majority is supposed to rule , the national crimes that spring from the popular will , are visited not upon that majority only-still less upon those only who contrive to deceive and mislead the masses  --  but upon the nation as a whole . Not even the protests of the minority can deliver them from their share in the common responsibility . God 's voice thunders along the track of national crime , " Shall not I visit for these things ? - shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ? " All history resounds with the echo of it ; and poetry itself , tremulous with the wail of nations suffering for their national sins , confirms the word of prophecy . But while there is this responsibility of nations and communities as such , there is an individual responsibility also in regard to national sins . There is the responsibility of those who sit in places of power ; the national crime conceived in their counsels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual crime , the personal guilt of it is on their souls . There is the responsibility of those who have influence over the currents of opinion and over whatever controls the course of public affairs ; and if they fail of doing all their duty in the hour when a national crime is pending , they are individually partakers in that crime . And in a country like ours , where every citizen has his sphere of influence , and every elector his share in the national sovereignty , the humblest citizen has a distinct responsibility in regard to matters of legislation and government ; and whatever national crime is consummated which his performance of his whole duty might have defeated , or against which he , having had the opportunity of protest , has not protested , he is distinctly guilty // before God . How self-evident to the moral sense are those words of ancient inspiration : " If thon forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death , and those that are ready to be slain , if thon sayest , behold we knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? and H e that keepeth thy soul , doth not he know it ? and will not he render to every man according to his works ? " For the wickedness which we might have prevented , we are responsible . How significant are those words concerning ancient Israel , when the leaders of opinion-on l*he one hand , men of wealth and power , greedy for gain , and on the other hand , courtly and time-serving preachers-were united in supporting and corrnpting each other , and in misleading and corrnpting the people : " Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain . And her prophets have danbed them with untempered mortar , seeing vanity , and divining lies unto them , saying unto them , Thus saith the Lord God , and the Lord hath not spoken . The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery , and have vexed the poor and needy ; yea they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully . And I sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land , that I should not destroy it ; and I found none . " The sins that bring God 's jud*-ments upon nations and races to the uttermost , are also , in their origin and growth , and in their consummation , the personal sins of individual men . Guided by these suggestions from the book of God , let us inquire what responsibilities American citizens , as citizens of the United States , snstain in relation to the great political question of the day . We open another book  --  a document framed by the wisdom ( only less than that of inspiration ) which God in his goodness gave to the fathers of our national union . The first sentence of this angust document announces its nature and its aims , and is our guide to the interpretation of the whole . " WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our posterity , DO ORDAIN AND E5TAI3LI5II THIS CONSTITUTION FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . " The authority that ordains and establishes this instrument , and gives it all its force , making it " the supreme law of the land , ' is the authority not of the States , but of the people . In reference to this instrument and the ends which it is to subserve , the people of all the United States are one , great , organized whole . " We , the people of the // United* States , do ordain and establish " - what ? Indentnres of partnership for the purpose of trading in real estate ? Away with such nonsense ! Articles of confederation between separate communities , for mutual defense and advantage as political communities in all respects distinct and independent ? No ; " articles of confederation " there had been , and a continental congress of plenipotentiaries representing separate and equal sovereignties ; but the articles of confederation were vanishing away , and in their place comes now a " Constitution , " the constitution of a government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great people ordain and establish this constitution ? We do it , they tell us , " in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . " For these ends , and no other , a government is instituted , which , in its own sphere , is complete and sovereign with all the powers and officers of government , legislative , executive , and judicial . For these ends , each State gives up to the one great people of the United States , all those portions of its sovereignty which the united nation demands for the government ordained and established by this Constitution . As citizens then of Connecticut or of Massachusetts , of New York or of Ohio , or of whatever State , we are also citizens of a greater and more comprehensive commonwealth . We owe a divided yet united allegiance ; we are under a double guardianship . The State protects us at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our farms , and along the highways ; it cares for justice between man and man ; it guards the peace and purity of fami lies ; and it provides free education for our children in its schools . The greater republic of the Union-known and feared by all nations-is our protection abroad ; its shield of power is over our persons and our rights in every other State ; its certificate of citizenship is the warrant of our safety in every land ; its public posts and mails bring us into close communication with every inhabited district from the Atlantic to the Pacific ; it stamps its symbols of empire and of freedom on our coins ; and under its flag our commerce floats on every sea , and brings to us the wealth of every clime . As subjects of government , we find two sovereignties over us , each limiting and each upholding the other . The State has certain powers and duties not derived from the Constitution o he nited States , but prior to it , and independent of it ; and as citizens of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties* The great republic of the Union as owers and duties of its own , which were // claimed by the nation and conceded by the States at the formation of the Constitution ; and in those powers and duties we share , as citizens not of the State only but of the Union . In our unique political system , these coordinate sovereignties acknowledge and honor each other . Each of them is the counterpart and complement of the other ; nor does either of them recognize any third kind of sovereignty within the boundaries of our republican empire . On the one hand , there is the sovereignty of the people of each particular State , with the government which that sovereignty ordains upon its own soil . On the other hand there is the sovereignty of the people of the United States , with the government which that national sovereignty exercises under the concessions and limitations of a Constitution ordained and established for union , for justice , for domestic tranquillity , for the common defense and general welfare , and for the security and perpetuity of liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution of the United States , is that of the power over the national territory not included within the boundaries of any State . " The Congress shall have power to dispose of , and make all needful rules and regulations concerning the territory or other property belonging to the United States . " The obvious meaning of this is , that all the territory not belonging to any particular State-both that which had been already ceded to the Union when the Constitution was established , and whatever has since been acquired by purchase or by conquest-is to be regulated and disposed of , not by the State , nor by the people of the States acting in that capacity-still less by such individuals as may happen to be earliest in the occupancy of the soil  --  but by the one whole people of the great republic , acting through their own national government . The Congress , as the organ of the national will , may make " all needful rules and regulations . " Where the public domain is within the boundaries of a particular State , there the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for sale , and having no rights or exemptions in distinction from other proprietors , save such as it has retained by special reservation , or acquired by special compact ; and there the " needful rules and regulations " to be made by Congress , are of small account . But where the public domain is beyond the limits of every State , there the great republic is the sovereign , and the only sovereign ; for the sovereignty of each particular State-its* legislation , its executive power , the entire jurisdiction and action of its government-is of effect only within its own geographical boundaries , and has no more to do within the territories of the Union , than it has to // do upon the soil of another State or of a foreign nation . The " needful rules aud regulations " then , which Congress is to make concerning all territory of the United States not included in any State , are nothing less than the rules and regulations necessary to the existence and order of civilized society-all the rules and regulations needful to the protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of property or every man 's right to the possession and enjoyment of what his own industry produces , and of marriage and the family relations and duties . The sovereign will of the great republic is to give law to all such territories . Congress , as the organ of that will , is to determiue how , and under what conditions and restrictions , the vacant soil shall be occupied and settled , and what arrangements shall be made there for the protection of human rights and the punishment of crime . At the time when the Constitution was formed , in 1789 , there was a wide region " Northwest of the Ohio " which had become the property of the United States by acts of cession from New York , Virginia , Massachusetts , and Connecticut . The memorable ordinance of 1787 had already made provision for the temporary government of all that region . Though the ordinance was enacted by the Congress of the old Confederation , it was expressly designed to be in its great principles a perpetual compact between the original States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the less occasion for incorporating with the Constitution any more definite provision for the government df territories , because of the preexisting compact which covered all the territories then belonging to the , Union  --  a compact not only older but in its nature less mutable than the Constitution itself . Accordingly , at the first session of the First Congress under the Constitution , the ordinance of 1787 was neither re*inacted nor confirmed , but was recognized as having a validity independent of the Constitution ; and an act was passed adjusting some of the details of the plan of territorial government to the change which had taken place in the government of the Union . That ordinance is in many respects a landmark in our history . It provided , with wise and patriotic forethought , for the temporary government of the territories as provinces or colonies under the sovereignty of the Union , till in one territory after another the population , trained and habituated to the working of the republican institutions , would become sufficiently numerous to be a complete State . Meanwhile all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all their rights and for the advancement of their interests as communities . The plan of those great statesmen // and patriots who established the ordinance , was that States should grow up under the protection and tutelage of the sovereign nation ; and that when the period of their minority should have passed , they would themselves be invested , like the orignal States of the Union , with the attribute of sovereignty . By that previous ordinance , as every American knows , " slavery and involuntary servitude , except in punishment for crime , " was forever prohibited throughout the fertile and beautiful regions between the Ohio and the Mississippi-broader and fairer than the Mesopotamia of old renown , which spreads from the liddekel to the Euphrates . Out of that ordinance has grown the democratic grandeur of the States of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin . At a somewhat later period , certain territories at the Southwest were acquired by cession from the States of North Carolina ( 1790 ) and Georgia , ( 1800 . ) For those territories also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were applied the principles of the ordinance of 1787 , with one melancholy exception . It was impossible for Congress to prohibit slavery there , for the jurisdiction over those territories had not been ceded to the Unkn without a proviso in behalf of slavery . Thus arose the States of Tennessee , Mississippi , and Alabama . In 1804 , a new and equally magnificent domain was acquired by treaty with France . The country at the mouth of the Mississippi , from the Pearl river to the Sabine , south of the thirtyfirst degree , and all the territory beyond that mighty flood , northward to its source , with an indefinite extension westward , came under the sovereignty of the great republic . The European inhabitants of the whole territory at that time , so far as there were any , were chiefly French , with a few Spaniards . None regarded them as having any sovereignty over the territories in which they were planted . None thought of asking them what kind of a government their wisdom and patriotism would prefer . Without any consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sovereignty of which the Congress of the United States is the only legislative power , and the President of the United States , with his subordinates , the only executive . Those inhabitants , among whose rights guaranteed to them by the treaty no right of sovereignty or jurisdiction over the territory was included , were taken , with great propriety , under the tutelage and training of the republic ; and the territory of Orleans , as it was then called , ( now the State of Louisiana , ) was not permitted to become a State , or to acquire any shadow of sovereignty , till it had learned to use in its public proceedings our mother-tongue , the language of the one // American people . So long as the territory of Orleans remained under the sovereignty of the Union , no law was in force there but by virtue of that sovereignty . Whatever power the local government exercised , was derived not from the people of the territory , but from the people of the Union through acts of Congress . The slavery which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might have been abolished by an act of Congress ; but in the peculiar circumstances of the country at the time that question was not agitated , and Louisiana , in fulfillment of the treaty , became , after a brief apprenticeship , one of the United States-sovereign within the limits of State sovereignty . The second territorial government instituted by act of Congress within the vast domain acquired from France , covered what is now the State of Missouri . There , also , for similar reasons , the slavery which had been legalized under former sovereignties , was not abolished . But when , on a petition from the inhabitants of Missouri , a movement was made in Congress to authorize the formation of a State in that territory , a feeling of horror at the prospective growth of slavery was rouse d throughout the free-labor States . A majority in the House of Representatives insisted on excluding Missouri from a participation in the sovereignty of the Union , till she should give some pledge for the gradual abolition of slavery . The opposP tion-strenuons as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . The time for Congress to act on the question for abolishing or prohibiting slavery in a territory , is not when a state , full-grown , asks for admission to the Union , but rather when the territorial government , in its earliest form , is yet to be organized . The question concerning the extension of slavery over the domains acquired from France , after agitating Congress and the whole country with violent controversy , was at last settled by what was then called , and has ever since been called , a compromise . The friends of the bill for the erection of Missouri into a State , finding at last that its passage through the House of Representatives could be secured in no other way , incorporated with it an enactment that in all the remainder of the Louisiana purchase , west and north of Missouri , slavery and involuntary servitude , except in punishment for crime , should be prohibited forever . Thus a few representatives , who had previously resisted the bill , were induced to give their votes in its favor-just enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some sense , a compromise . It has been so denominated in subsequent acts of Congress . But such a word is altogether inadequate to express the sacredness // of that provision against slavery , or the shameless baseness of the proposal to abolish it . That enactment " to prohibit slavery in certain territories , " was not inserted in the act for establishing a State in Missouri , asa mutual agreement between the two opposing parties . It was more than a compromise . It was a pledge of the public faith in the form of an act of Congress approved with constitutional exactness by the President , after having obtained in its favor the deliberate opinion of every member of his cabinet-not excepting John Caldwell Calhoun . The public faith was pledged to posterity and to the civilized world , that in all that central region of the continent , " slavery and involuntary servitude , otherwise than in the punishment of crime whereof the parties shall have been duly convicted , shall be , and is hereby forever prohibited . " iNo pledge was asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited by act of Congress elsewhere , but there-in homage to the love of liberty-in homage to the conscience of the nation -- in homage to the public sentiment of the civilized world-  --  the prohibition was absolute and forever . The territory of Arkansas , formerly the southern part of the Missouri territory , had already received a government without the prohibition of slavery , and when the territory had become sufficiently populous , the State of Arkansas was established and admitted to a participation in the sovereignty of the Union . When the territory of Iowa received its temporary government , the plighted faith of the nation was not disregarded ; and the State of Iowa , therefore , was in due time admitted to the Union as a State in which slavery was forever prohibited . At a still more recent date , the territorial government of Minnesota was instituted over a wide region north of Iowa , and there , too , the prohibition of slavery remains as enacted Li 1820 . Some old disputes with Spain were settled in 1819 , by a treaty which added the peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida had inhabitants of European descent when it was purchased ; but the sovereignty over them had been among the attributes of the Spanish crown . The purchase was not understood in any quarter as transferring the sovereignty over the province from the King of Spain to the few inhabitants who had been his subjects , and who , by the stipulations of the treaty , were allowed to become citizens of the United States . A government was instituted there , as in other territories , by act of Congress . Florida was dealt with , not as a sovereign power , nor as partaking in the national sovereignty , but as being in a state of dependence and pupilage , till the // time should arrive when the judgment of the American people , expressed through Congress , should recognize that community as prepared aud qualified to partake in the sovereignty of the Union . Slavery existed in the Spanish province before the cession , aud not having been prohibited by any act of legislation afterwards , its legality was taken for granted during the period of territorial dependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Iowa was admitted to the Union with a constitution founded on liberty , Florida was admitted with a constitution which forbids the abolition of slavery . The territory of Oregon was acquired under the two-fold claim of purchase and discovery , and its limits were gradually defined by successive treaties with Spain and with Great Britain . In advance of the final adjustment of conflicting claims between Great Britain and the United States , a few adventurous pioneers had threaded the passes of the Rocky Mountains , to establish for themselves new homes upon the shore of the Pacific ; and finding themselves beyond the jurisdiction of all governments , they had set up a provisional government of their own , under the law of nature . After the treaty of 1846 , which left the great republic at liberty to exercise its sovereignty there , the formation of a territorial government for Oregon , by act of Congress , was delayed awhile by the opposition of the slave-holding interest to the prohibition of slavery . But at last that opposition was overruled ; and , in 1848 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact of the settlers , was set aside , and the territory was incorporated , with the perpetual prohibition of slavery wrought into the first foundations of society . That prohibition protects , of course , the new territory of Washington , which , within a few months past , has been set off from Oregon and placed under a separate government . By the annexation of Texas , in 1845 , a new State was added to the Union , but no territory was ceded to the national government . A provision in the act of annexation pledges the public faith that additional States may be formed within the domain of Texas , not exceeding four in number , and that such of them as may be south of 360 30 ' north latitude , shall be received into the Union with or without slavery , as the people of each State asking admission may desire ; but at the same time the promise is given that in such State or States as may be formed north o a me , there shall be no slavery . Tliese guarantees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stand on no firmer basis than the stipulation which it is now proposed to repeal . The admission of a State into the Union is , // of course , irrepealable ; but if the stipulations and provisions which accompanied and procured the admission of Missouri are repealable , the stipulations which accompanied the admission of Texas are no less liable to be repudiated , whenever a majority in Congress may choose to disown the obligation . The war with Mexico conquered for the Union certain territories ; and our possession of them was confirmed , by purchase and by cession , in the treaty of 1849 . All the territories thus conquered were territories which no compromise had covered . They were territories in which slavery had long been abolished by law . Before the treaty of peace , it had been voted in the House of Representatives , by way of proviso to a bill granting money for the prosecution of the war or the negotiation of a treaty , that in the territories which might be ceded from Mexico , slavery and involuntary servitude , except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Wilmot Proviso . " The bill to which it was appended was lost in the Senate ; and thus the question whether slavery should be tolerated in our new acquisitions , was still open for decision . On this question parties in Congress were so nearly balanced , that the proposal to incorporate a distinct prohibition of slavery in the laws by which governments were to be provided for the new territories , made it impossible to pass those laws ; and , accordingly , the territories remained under such provisional governments only as had been established at the conquest by military authority . Meantime , the discovery of gold in California had attracted thither a great rush of free and hamizly men , mostly from the Northern and Western States ; who , finding themselves unprotected and left as outlaws by Congress , took the business of government into their own hands , ( not without the consent of the provisional military authorities , ) and framed a constitution for themselves as a State . Because that constitution prohibited slavery , the most strenuous opposition was made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at last admitted by one of the five acts* of Congress , now known as " the compromise measures of 1850 . " Another was the act which defined the northern and western boundary of Texas , by buying off a portion of her unfounded claim to lands that never were in her possession ; and which provided a territorial government for New Mexico , with no other security against slavery than the unrepealed Mexican law of abolition . A third was the establishment of a similar government for the Mormon territory of Utah . The half-way act for abolishing the slave trade in the District of Columbia , and the disgraceful Fugitive Slave law , completed the series . // We have made this brief historic statement simply for the sake of exhibiting in the clearest possible light the political relation of the territories to the people and government of the United States . From the moment when the territory northwest of the Ohio was ceded to the Union-even before the formation of the present constitution-down to the close of the last session of Congress , it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty over the territories , the supreme power from which all law and government over them must proceed , so long as they continue in the condition of territorial dependence , is in the people of the United States . With the doubtful exception of here and there a politician , like Gen. Cass , stupidly or cunningly trying to dodge an unpleasant question , all men have understood this subject alike . Men of all parties and of all sections-federalist and republican , democratic and whig , North and South , East and West-have agreed in holding , that while the right of the United States to public land within the boundaries of a State is only that of ownership , their right in respect to all other public land is that of full and exclusive jurisdiction , limited by no coordinate sovereignty . The people , then , of the United States have a right to prohibit slavery in their own territories . We are not writing for readers who can be imposed upon with the representation that the Constitution gives to slavery the character and sacredness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which it may not even mitigate . Northern c*ome-outers , on the one hand , and Southern lire-eaters , on the other , may agree in maintaining that a Constitution which , from first to last , studiously and elaborately , refuses to recognize human beings , in any circumstances , or under any jurisdiction , as articles of property , or as anything else than " persons , " - is a compact that nationalizes slavery ; but we do not stop to argue against them . The entire genius and scope of the Constitution , the nature of the case , and all the history of our national legislation , concur in showing that when the letter of the Constitution gives to Congress , as representing the sovereignty of the Union , " power to make all needful rules and regulations " concerning the territories belonging to the Union , the power to prohibit slavery in those territories is included . Slavery in the States is beyond the power of Congress , or of the people whose legislative sovereignty Congress represents . Within the limits of a State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all inalienable human rights . Whatever system of oppression or of barbarism the State may choose to // organize-whatever license it may give to cruelty or to lust - whatever arrangements it may make to plunder and to crush the poor-there is no redress but in the justice of God . Within State limits the people of the United States have no jurisdiction , and no power for the protection of personal rights . But where there is no State , there the legislative power of Congress is limited only by the prohibitions of the Constitution and the conditions and reservations of treaties . There Congress has the same power which the State has in its own territory , for the protection of personal rights ; the same power to punish murder or robbery ; the same power to take care that every man shall be the proprietor of his own limbs and faculties , and that the rich and the poor , the landlord and the peasant , the capitalist and the laborer , the white man and the man of any other complexion , shall be equal before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibit slavery in their own territories , may be regarded as undeniable . All that has been said by Senator Douglass and others of that sort about " the great principle of self-government , " and " the right of the people*to regulate their domestic concerns in their own way , " and " the propriety of leaving to the people of the territories what is the undoubted right of the States to govern themselves in respect to their local and domestic concerns - is only so much dust attempted to be thrown into the eyes of the unwary . Senator Douglass himself does not believe-we doubt whether with all his audacity he has ever ventured to say-that the great republic has not the rightful power to guard its own territories against slavery , polygamy , human sacrifices , cannibalism , and such like domestic institutions ; or that it can not constitutionally exert that power in the form of an act of Congress . The proposal now before the country , in the Nebraska Bill , is a proposal to repeal , or ( as it is somewhat daintily expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibition of slavery enacted in 1820 . It is not too much to say of this proposition , that it has shocked the moral sense of all thinking men who have any moral sense that recognizes the first principles of justice . The propo*al is to repeal that enactment , not on the ground of its original invalidity , but only on the ground that , our years ago , the same law was not enacted for other territories in different circumstances . In its naked impudence , the argument runs thus : Slavery having been abolished long ago in the Mexican territories , the thirty-first Congress did not insist on re*nactin* that prohibition of slavery-ex ahundanti cauteld-as they might have done ; therefore , in the remaining // territories of the Louisiana purchase , where slavery was not illegal otherwise than by the law of nature , the prohibition of slavery enacted by the sixteenth Congress shall be repealed . Why should not such a proposal , backed by such an argument , shock the moral sense ? The question which Congress is to decide , is a very intelligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive jurisdiction of the United States  --  a region central to the continent , and more than ninety-nine times larger than the State of Connecticut . It is simply the question whether in that region , where slavery was made illegal more than thirty-four years a go , by an act of Congress which carried on its face a solemn pledge for its own perpetuity , slavery shall now be made legal by the repeal of that enactment . This is the question , and neither Mr. Douglass with his insolence , nor Mr. Toucey with his smoothness , can make anything else of it . Who does not see that such a question is a moral question  --  a question under a higher law than the Constitution  --  a question under the law of nature  --  a question not of policy merely , nor of constitutional exegesis , but of plain honesty , and of the *simplest natural justice . If slavery is now , by act of Congress , made legal in those territories , Congress and the people of the United States will be responsible for its legality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal in those territories . Ought slavery to be legal anywhere ? Can it be made legal without guilt on the part of those who , having full power of legislation , are responsible for the existence of the laws ? On that question every citizen has a right to utter his opinion , and is bound to utter it , in the name of the universal human conscience , and " in the name of Almighty God . " Every man knows what is meant by slavery iu this discussion . The thing which the act of 1820 makes unlawful in the territories , and from which this Nebraska Bill is to remove the stigma of illegality , is not some possible or hypothetical slavery , but that gross and well-known reality , American slavery with all its horrible particulars . Is that slavery with its inseparable accompaniment the slave-trade , a right thing ? Perhaps we can not better put this question to the moral sense , than by using for the purpose the language of an eminent Kentuckian , Dr. Iii . J. Breckeuridge . He , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by inheritance , once a lawyer at the bar , and not the less a man for having become a learned minister of the gospel , can not be charged with ignorance or with misrepresenting the matter . He understands the subject in its principles and in its details . He views it from no fanatical or seetional // position . He has no special sympathy with Northern prejudices-none at all with New England . Let him speak . " What is slavery as it exists among us ? We reply , it is that condition enforced by the laws of one-half the States of this confederacy , in which one portion of the community , called masters , is allowed such power over another called slaves ; as " 1 . To deprive them of the entire earnings of their own labor , except only so much as is necessary to continue labor itself by continuing healthful existence , thus committing clear robbery ; " 2 . To reduce them to the necessity of universal concubinage , by denying to them the civil rights of marriage ; thus breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 3 . To deprive them of the means and opportunities of moral and intellectual culture , in many States making it a high penal offense to teach them to read ; thus perpetuating whatever of evil there is that proceeds from ignorance ; " 4 . To set up between parents and their children an authority higher than the impulse of nature and the laws of God ; which breaks up the authority of the father over his own offspring , and at pleasure separates the mother at a returnless distance from her child ; thus abrogating the clearest laws of nature , thus outraging all decency and justice , and degrading and oppressing thousands of thousands of beings created like themselves in the image of God . " This is slavery as it is daily exhibited in every slave State . * * * * * A system which is utterly indefensible on every correct human principle , and utterly abhorrent from every law of God .

What matters it whether my horse is stolen or the value of him in my labor be taken from me ? Do we talk of violating the rights of masters , and depriving them of their property in their slaves ? And will some one tell us if there be anything in which a man has , or can have so perfect a right of property , as in his own limbs , bones , and sinews ? Out upon such folly !

" No absurdity can be more inconceivably gross than to think of making // slaves of the unborn , and no injustice more audacious than that which makes misfortune and crime descend from father to son , and dooms the child of Africans to perpetual slavery for no better reason than that his parents had been thus doomed before him . He who is not born can not be a slave . He can not be made so by conquest nor by prescription , before his existence .

Hereditary slavery , therefore , is without pretence , except in avowed rapacity. " - lbid , p. 303 . In all this there is nothing more than what everybody knows to be true . Senator Douglass knows it to be true . Senators Badger , Butler , Toucey and the rest-not excepting Senator Pettit-know that all this is true , and that " except in punishment of crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , no man can be made a slave , " without wrong . The President of the United States knows it . Every pensioned editor of an administration newspaper knows it . One and all they know that slavery-this American slavery as defined by the laws of the slaveholding States-is nothing less or better than the most atrocious injustice . If the captain and crew of a piratical slave-ship , hovering along the coast of Africa , know that the slave trade is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian land , know that the slavery is wrong which they are intending to make a lawful thing in regions where it is now unlawful . The conspirators and their tools all know that if there is any such thing as justice among the realities of the universe , slavery is a violation of justice . They know that unless right and wrong are words without meaning , the prohibition of slavery upon a virgin soil by the sovereign power , is right , and the taking away of such a prohibition is wrong . It is not strange then that the moral sense of the country has been shocked at this proposal . Never before did the question of pledging the legislation of the Union for the indefinite extension of slavery , come up as a practical question , in so unequivocal a form , or so completely disconnected from all other questions . The territory to be disposed ot ; except as encumbered with Indian titles , is wholly and absolutely under the control of Congress ; there are no treaty restrictions in favor of slavery ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual proprietor . The soil and climate , though well-suited to the business of breeding slaves for a southern market , are not supposed , in any quarter , to be such as would make slave-labor permanently profitable . Slavery being already prohibited there , a new enactment of prohibition is not called for . What is // now before the country is a naked proposal to legalize slavery just for the sake of the principle ; so that hereafter the system which trades in human flesh and has a price for unborn infants , which makes ignorance a great public interest , which permits fathers to sell their children , and brothers to get money for the beauty of their sisters by the mediation of the auctioneer-may have free scope to extend itself beneath the banner of the great republic , wherever the labor of slaves , under the discipline of coercion , can be converted into sugar or cotton . The speeches that have been made in the defense of the proposed crime , are a curious study . Mr. iDouglas speaks like a man who has no suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black man-whether really black or only black by a legal fiction-can have any human rights which legislation should protect . Mir . Pettit , as might be expected from his antecedents , scoffs at the " self-evident truths " of the Declaration of Independence , and in the name of democracy derides the idea that all men are created equal in respect to natural rights . Mr. Badger speaks in the style and strain commonly used by the cultivated , humane and intelligent class of Southern men . With him , slavery is a fact , and is to be accepted accordingly . To inquire whether it is right , or what the consequences are likely to be , is a speculation more curious than practical . Three millions of slaves are here , and nothing can be done to change their condition for the better . Shall the nation buy them and remove them to Africa ? That would be cruel tyranny and oppression , " for this is their country as well as ours . " But the true policy and " the true Christian philanthropy " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such portions of the territories as from climate and soil are adapted to slave cultivation . " So say we . Allow this population to dijjJ*u8e &amp;t8e*f wherever it can find the best market for its own labor and the best protection against injustice ; just as the peasant population of Ireland and of Germany is diffusing itself . But this is not at all what the Senator , with his horror of " tyranny and oppression , " and his Christian philanthropy , is thinkmg of . The self-diffusion of this population , as he speaks of it , is a diffusion not by its own spontaneity , but by the will of its owners-by the drifts and currents of the slave-trade . To remove these poor people as freemen , with their own consent , to Africa , would be cruelty , " for this is their country as well as ours but to remove natives of North Carolina ( who have as good a right to live and die there as the Senator himself ) to Cuba , in slave-ships , as soon as Cuba shall have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To shut up the owners of // three millions of slaves within an area of not much more than 800,000 square miles , would be exceedingly nngenerous towards the owners and the slaves ; for in such a case the increasing number of their slaves and the ever diminishing productiveness of their labor , would impoverish their owners , and then the slaves would suffer for want of the indulgences and comforts which a kind master , relieved in his circumstances by the sale of a portion of his stock , might bestow on the remainder . Philanthropy requires too that slaveholders from every State should be allowed not only to remove at their pleasure into every territory , but to carry their laws with them . It is not enough that Mr. Badger himself , for example , may carry his slaves with him wherever he pleases , and that , if they are as affectionate** ly attached to him as he is to them , they may continue to serve him as tenants , or at wages , or as his humble friends who desire only the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws with him into Nebraska , and his poor friends must be liable to be sold for his debts , or there is a great lack of " true Christian philanthropy " *towards him  --  and forsooth ! towards the slaves whom he loves so kindly . Mr. Toucey 's speech , representing as it does a more respectable type of Northern subserviency than can be represented by men like Messrs . Douglas and Pettit , is worthy of a more extended consideration . It seems like the argument of a professional advocate employed by a client to make the worse appear the better reason . It is just what might have been expected of him , if he had been all his life long a man with no other notion of political duty than that of allegiance to his party , and inconsiderate enough to assume that the will of a Democratic president is the true democracy . A professional advocate , regarding the Democratic party as his client , and understanding that the repeal of the Missouri prohibition is required by the determined policy of that party , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but flimsy to the touch of analysis ; hazy in its positions and reasonings , and inaccurate in its citation of facts . Mr. Toucey would have made a better speech in a better cause . We will not pronounce such a judgment without exhibiting some reasons for it , that our readers may decide on its validity . The Senator begins with regrets that the subject of slavery is agitated again ; but , inasmuch as it is there in the Senate , he is under a necessity of voting for or against that prohibition of slavery in IKauzas and Nebraska , which the bill proposes to repeal . He states the question as follows : " The friends of the bill insist that this restriction contains an assumption of unconstitutional power , that the disposal of the whole subject belongs of right // to the people of the territory , when properly in the exercise of legislative power ; its opponents , that the subject belongs to Congress , and that the representatives of remote States and of remote people may interfere and settle it for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " friend of the bill , " believes that the prohibition of slavery in the territories contains an assumption of unconstitutional power . This is what he wants the Senate to believe ; this is what he wants the people of Connecticut and of all the States to believe . It was to produce such belief on the part of readers generally that the speech has been printed and circulated . As careful readers , we are curious to know in what the assumption of unconstitutional power consists . 1 . Does he mean that any attempt by Congress to exercise a legislative authority over the territories , as distinguished from the States , is an assumption of unconstitutional power ? 2 . Does he mean that while Congress has jurisdiction over the territories in other respects , it can not legislate against slavery , or for the protection of personal freedom , without an assumption of unconstitutional power ? 3 . Or is it his meaning that , though Congress has power to prohibit slavery in a territory , it can make no prohibition which shall be valid against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State ; and that the word " forever " in the prohibition must be understood as limiting the sovereignty of States hereafter to exist , and as therefore including an assumption of unconstitutional power ? Which of these v.iews it is that the orator un dertakes to defend , he nowhere informs us . This uncertainty of position is what makes his argument so hazy . At one moment he is apparently arguing for the absolute exclusion of the jurisdiction of Congress from the territories ; speaking as if the legislative rights of the inhabitants in any territory were identical with the legislative rights of a State , and representing the question in such wor as ese : " Whether the people of the territory , and of the States to be formed therein , shall be left in the undisturbed enjoyment of the common rights of American citizens-that of governing themselves , and of regulating their own internal affairs according to their own views of a just and sound policy , subject only to the Constitution of the United States . " At the next moment he is talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is arguing that on the particular subject of slavery Congress is destitute of power ; and the question then is " Whether Congress has any such power , directly or indirectly , over the existence of the institution of slavery anywhere , unless it be within the purlieus of this capitol , and of the public buildings . " // point , or have received any notice that the question has been changed , he is hammering on the word " forever , " and is trying to make out that instead of being a pledge of the public faith that the prohibition shall never be repealed , it is an attempt to limit the sovereignty of States hereafter to be instituted . No doubt it is possible for one and the same man to hold all these Uifferent positions ; but even such a man , if he clearly understands his own views , and desires to make a clear and convincing argument rather than a hazy and plausible speech , will be very likely to state and argue each position by itself distinctly . But if this confusion were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another distinction , the recollection of which would destroy the whole effect which the discourse was designed to produce , and which it may prodnee upon heedless or prejudiced readers . Everything in the argument depends on the adroitness with which the orator assumes that the inhabitants of a territory are , in the view of the Constitution , a sovereign State , having all the rights which the States of this Union reserved to themselves when they formed the Constitution . He constantly , not to say carefully , confounds the individual rights of persons inhabiting a territory , under the sovereignty of the United States , with the political rights of a State'in the Union . He assumes that whatever Congress can not do within the limits of a State , it can not do in any territory ; and that whatever a State an do within its own jurisdiction , the inhabitants of any territory belonging to the United States , be they ever so few , can do the same for themselves , and by their own authority . He recognizes no difference between citizenship in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory which belongs to the United States , and in which Congress , as representing the sovereignty of the people to whom it belongs , is about to set up temporary arrangements and institutions preparatory to the being of a State . He reasons about State rights , and jumps to a conclusion about something very different . He argues that if the inhabitants of a territory are not a sovereign people , all their rights are at the mercy of Congress , thus confounding the distinction between personal freedom and political power . He assumes , without any seeming consciousness , that there is no difference between a man 's right , on the one hand , to the use of his own limbs and faculties , to the earnings of his own industry , to the love of his wife and the obedience of his children , in a word , to the protection of just laws ; and on the other hand , his right to participate by his vote in the power from which the laws proceed . // All this is very natural in an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants in a territory who shall have no rights at all ; and for whose protection against the most crushing oppression , the sovereign owner of that territory , when making the earliest arrangements for the alienation of the soil and the establishment of society there , can provide not even a temporary security . Of Mr. Toucey 's inaccuracy in regard to the facts pertaining to the subject of his argument , the statement which was corrected by Mr. Chase at the moment , might be a sufficient illustration  --  the statement that prior to the formation of the Constitution there was not only a Northwest territory in which slavery had been prohibited , but also a Southwest territory in which slavery had been established . It was a far more significant inaccuracy to omit the statement of the fact that when the territory south of the Ohio ( now the State of Tennessee ) was ceded by North Carolina , in 1790 , and when the Mississippi territory ( now the States of Mississippi and Alabama ) was ' at last ceded by Georgia , in 1801 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stipulation that slavery should not be interfered with by Congress in those territories . The fact that the prohibition in the ordinance of 1787 was not applied by Congress to those territories , is cited by the Senator to show that the Constitution gives to Congress no such power ; whereas , had he been more careful , he would have known that the fact , fairly stated , tends the other way . Tennessee is a slaveholding State , not because Congress under the Constitution has no power to prohibit slavery in the territories , but because North Carolina , in the deed of cession , being aware that Congress had the power , took pains to stipulate that in legislating for that territory , the power of prohibiting slavery should not be exercised . So Georgia was aware of the same power in Congress , and made the same proviso against the exercise of that power over the territories which she ceded . The Senator argues that if the prohibition of slavery by the Missouri act of 1820 " contains an assumption of unconstitutional power , " " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show what the effect will be , he says : " If it be declared inoperative , and these territories are left , as assuredly they will be , without any law on the subject of slavery , except the supreme law of the Constitution , two questions will arise . ist . Whether slavery is the mere ereature of municipal law , which can not live outside of the State whose laws uphold it ? 2d . Whether the Constitution of the United States , by its own intrinsic efficacy , will carry slavery into the territories and uphold it there ? One is the preponderating opinion of the North , the other of the South . Both involve mere judicial questions , and the bill provides for the transfer of them // to the courts of justice ; and finally , in the last resort , to that tribunal which the Constitution has established for the adjudication of all questions of this kind . " There is , then , a tribunal established by the Constitution for the decision of all questions of constitutional right . Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show of arguing in this speech , should be judicially decided by the Supreme Court ? And is it in. order to obtain a judicial decision that he votes to repeal the prohibition ? No ; he is perfectly aware that in order to have a case in which the legitimacy of the prohibition shall be tested , the prohibition must stand as it is . The inference then is a fair one , that in his interior belief the prohibition , if unrepealed , is valid , or at least wonld be pronounced valid if carried to the highest judicial tribunal . He knows that an act of Congress contrary to the Constitution is a dead letter without being repealed ; and that the duty of declaring it void and inoperative , without repealing it , belongs not to a later Congress , but to the judges . The question which he is willing to carry before the Court is , not whether Congress has power to prohibit slavery by law in territories belonging to the great republic , but the very different question , whether , in the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibition of slavery . We have a right , then , to infer that the immediate object of the Nebraska bill , so far as it repeals the prohibition of slavery , and the immediate object of this Senator in voting for it , is to take away from the Supreme Court the opportunity of pronouncing a decision on that constitutional question of the power of Congress ; and to make slavery a legal thing where it is now ille*a1 , and where it can not be legalized without a repeal of the existing prohibition . Here , then , in the light of Mr. Toucey 's speech , we identify the moral character of this Nebraska bill and of the proceedings in its behalf . The object is not , indeed , " to legislate slavery into the territories , " - as the supporters of the bill continually deny , with preposterous iteration ; but to provide that slavery may be a lawful thing where it is now unlawful , and where it will always continue to be unlawful , unless this measure is enacted . Of the ulterior views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( and for the sake of which , more than in reference to territories now in possession , this measure is urged with so much pertinacity , ) we need say nothing . It is enough that the immediate purpose is criminal . If the proposal becomes a national act , it involves the nation in a new responsibility for oppression . It opens a region wide as an empire , and beautiful as Eden , to the invasion of a barbar // barous injustice , that curses whatever it touches . It commits the legislation of the Union to allow aud sanction the indefinite extension of slavery , so long as slaves can be bred at a profit , or any new territory can be bought or seized , upon * the labor of human cattle can be employed at a profit . This is the crime in which the conspirators who have originated this measure are laboring to involve the nation . To them , and to their backers everywhere , the attempted national crime brings personal guilt . The establishment of this policy will draw after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which all who are personally concerned in the measure will be personally responsible to God . Thousands of human beings , with human sensibilities and affections , and with human rights divinely given , are to be torn from their native soil in the existiug slave States , and carried by ruthless force to toil , not for themselves but foi their owners , in distant regions , where that dim hope of freedom for themselves or for their children , under which they were born , can never overtake them . The blood and treasure of our common country shall be expended for the acquisition of territories in which , with the full consent of the national government , now pledged beforehand , new markets shall be opened for the slave trade . Every steamer floating down the Mississippi shall bear upon its decks despairing exiles , driven from all that their poor hearts clung to in their bondage . Slave-ships , freighted with wo , and black with omens of God 's wrath to come , shall vex with their abhorred keels the waters of the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blessings and adorned with the beauty of a Christian civilization , there shall be the fierce barbarism that tramples the poor into the earth and robs the laborer of his wages . Children shall be torn from their parents at the need or the caprice of an owner ; women shall be sold for their beauty at public auction ; and to teach the alphabet shall be a crime . No member of Congress who makes himself responsible for the bill-no man who , out of Congress , gives his influence in aid of it-no man who , through slothfulness or cowardice , refuses to do what he can towards defeating it-can by any protestations purge himself of this guilt . " if thou sayest , Behold , we knew it not , doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it , and he that keepeth thy soul , doth not he know it Y " He who " will render to evei'y man according to his works , " can not be cheated with the shallow pretence of " nonintervention . " Never did guilt attempt to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Non-intervention , forsooth ! The right of the people in the territories to manage and // legislate for themselves ! - when every section of the bill is itself an intervention . Non-intervention in regard to slavery ! - when the same conspirators are plotting and at this moment proposing an armed intervention , by authority of Congress , to forbid the abolition of slavery in the territories of a foreign government . These men , with all their diligence at varnishing , can not deceive themselves . They know what they are doing . Their non-intervention , as they themselves expound it , is nothing less than the widest possible extension of slavery , by the national power , in the name of the Constitution . No intelligent man can wonder that when it was determined to repeal the prohibition in the Missouri compromise  --  a prohibition which has stood unchallenged for more than half the time since the organization of our national government , and which virtually pledges the public faith in that word " forever "  --  the proposal was met with so many expressions not only of moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to exist by law , was taken up long ago as a religions question . The abolition of slavery by law has been demanded and carried , not only in the British empire , but in State after State of our own Union , by the importnnity ana activity of men whose profession that they were moved by conscientious and religious convictions , could not be questioned without implying some great defect of intelligence or of honorable feeling in the questioner . If ever any man was moved by an unaffected sense of duty to his fellowmen and to his God , Samuel Hopkins was so moved when , in 1770 , or about that time , he astounded the people of Newport by preaching against slavery . Eighty years ago , that devout man began his appeal , with an iron strength of logic , to the conscience and the religions faith of New England ; and the appeal , resisted for a while , wets at last effectual . The clergy of New England , and their churches , were awakened to a religious abhorrence of oppresssion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times when , the shadow on the sun-dial has seemed to go backward , while certain political or ecclesiastical questions connected with the subject have been agitated , the feeling that slavery itself as a system-slavery as it exists by law-slavery in its inseparable union with the ever-spreading slavetrade-is a " stupendous wrong , " abhorred of God , and adverse to every interest of Christianity , remains to this day an intense religious feeling among the religious people of New En gland . INor is this a New England feeling only . Nothing in W*esleyanism , as it came completed from its founder , was more characteristic or more characteristically expressed than its abhorrence of slavery , // " the sum of all villainies . " On the part of the Presbyterian Church , with its many Sonthern relations and sympathies , a succession of solemn acts and testimonies against slavery stands on the records of its highest judicatory , beginning even before the mother synod had expanded itself into a General Assembly . Of those testimonies , by no means deficient in strength of expression , all that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by " a full expression of the Assembly 's views on slavery "  --  a memorable document , which is still the unrepealed declaration of Presbyterian orthodoxy on that subject . It must be confessed that , within the last twenty-five years , there has been on the part of religious communities generally in the Southern States , a most ominous apostasy from the first principles of truth and righteousness . There-to the shame and horror of the Christian world-slavery , even in the meaning of Southern codes and courts , is held to be a righteous and divinely sanctioned thing ; and the doctrine that slavery is unjust and ought to be abolished , is anathenatized as if it were the worst of heresies . But though now and then some metropolitan northern doctor , after long feeding on the cold volcanic ashes of ancient metaphysical explosions , may give out some equivocal or unequivocal utterance in sympathy with the Southern apostasy , the deep religious conviction against the essential injustice of slavery remains unchanged in the churches of the North . The ministers of the Gospel in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late especially , they are shy-perhaps to a fault-of all public questions which have only an indirect bearing oii morals and the interests of religion . But when the question is , whether the government shall do that which violates natural justice , or that which dishonors the acknowledged institutions or directly counteracts the legitimate influence of religion , the clergy in these free States are accustomed to make themselves heard . Their right to discuss in the pubzdt all subjects of morality and religious duty , is inseparable from the existence of religious liberty ; and the exercise of that right , on any occasion , is a question which every pastor must decide for himsell% under his responsibility to his own congregation , or-as the case may be  --  to his ecclesiastical superiors . Their right to print and publish for the sake of addressing a wider public than their own congregations , is inseparable from the freedom of the press . Their right to send their memorials , either singly or united , into even thehighest place of legislation , is simply the sacred right of petition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // to Congress , bearing the signatures of one hundred and fifty-one clergymen of various denominations in that city and vicinity , and expressing their earnest remonstrance . It was a remonstrance on purely moral and religious *rounds . It imputed to the bill " the grossest violation of justice , good faith , and law . " With allusions to the " perilous dissension " likely to result from such an enactment , it protested " in the name of religion and humanity , " against " the deliberate and unnecessary extension of the evils of slavery , " and the " guilt " which would thus be brought upon the whole conntry , " exposing us to the righteous judgment of Almighty God . " A few days later came the great memorial froni New England , subscribed by three thousand and fifty clergymen . In substance and meaning it was the same with the memorial from New York but in language it was more condensed . The subscribers protested against the bill , " in the name of Almighty God and in his presence . " We protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breach of faith eminently injurious to the moral principles of the community and subversive of all confidence in national engagements , as a measure full of danger to the peace and even the existence of our beloved Union , and exposing us to the just judgments of the Almighty . " The memorial from New York , being presented in the ordinary course of business , found its place upon the table without exciting any apparent displeasure . The publication of it , however , in the newspapers , must have brought it under the eyes of those for whom it was specially designed . But the memorial from New England , presented to the Senate by Mr. Everett , was the occasion of a somewhat remarkable debate . It had already been laid upon the table in the usual form , when , in some way , it attracted the attention of Mr. Douglas , whose name is identified with the bill in question . At his demand it was taken up and was read in the hearing of the Senate . He immediately proceeded to utter his indignation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man , though disgraceful to his place and office . The memorialists , he said , " have here come forward with an atrocious falsehood and an atrocious calumny against this Senate , desecrated the pulpit , and prostituted the sacred desk to the miserable and corrupting influence of party politics . " " It is evident , " said he , " that these men know not what they are talking about . it is evident that they ought to be rebuked , and required to confine themselves to their vocation , instead of neglecting their flocks , and bringing our holy religion into disrepute by violating its sacred principles , and disregarding the obligations of truth and honor , // by presenting here a document which is so offensive that no o'entleman can endorse it without violating all the rules of b courtesy , of propriety , and of honor . " When the Hon. Stephen Arnold Douglas raves in this way against such men as the subscribers to that memorial , and to the corresponding memorial from New York-for the two come into the same condemnation-his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upon what meat doth this our Ca*sar feed , that he is grown so great ? " He tells the Senate-he proclaims to the people of New England and New York , that venerable men , speaking for their country and the law of God , in their sunset of life , with calm and passionless dignity  --  the aged Beecher , Lowell , Woods , Emerson , Humphrey , Day , Hawes , De Witt , not to mention others less widely known perhaps , but no less worthy of the reverence due to virtue finishing its course-are guilty of " an atrocious falsehood and an atrocious calumny . " With swaggering insolence he tells the world that men , the fame of whose studious and comprehensive learning , in various departments , and the renown of whose gefilus and eloquence is even wider and more lasting than his celebrity , - chancellors and presidents of universities , professors to whom the learned world pays homage , authors whose utterances quicken the thought of Christendom-men like Robinson , Skinner , Williams , Wayland , Walker , Hitchcock , Hopkins , Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what they are talking about , " and " ought to be rebuked " by his erudition and piety . And , as if something could be added to the ludicrous sublimity of this senatorial impudence , he , the self-same Mr. Douglas , volunteers a lesson about " the rules of courtesy and of propriety , " and of what belongs to a " gentleman , " and stoops to instruct the Bowery black*a*dism of Bishop Wainwright and Chancellor Ferris , and t e own-east clownishness of such Yankees as Dr. Blagden and Dr. Adams , Dr. Bellows and Dr. Frothingham , Bishop Burgess and Mr. Kirk . It would be tedious to describe at length , the debate which was thus begun . The old Texan general , who had already shown , in the discussion of this Nebraska question , how far a brave man 's sense of honor rises above the range of mousing pettifoggers ignorant of the difference between the trade of politics and the science of statesmanship ,  --  replied in effect that if the memorialists had brought into the Senate an " atrocious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same charge ; for they in pronouncing the Nebraska bill a breach of faith and a moral wrong , had said no more than he ( though not agreeing with them on all points ) had said when // the bill was under discussion . Mr. Douglas *was instructed by the hint ; and not another word was said that day about the " atrocious falsehood and calumny " which the memorial had brought into the Senate . Another position was taken by Mr. Mason of Virginia , with the ingenuity of a Virginia abstractionist . These memorialists had defined their employment and social position by calling themselves " clergymen of different religious denominations in New England " from which he inferred that they came to the Senate not as citizens , but as ministers of the Gospel . That Senator 's blundering ignorance , his heedlessness in regard to the meaning of words , his strange misconstruction of carefully written document , that la*y on the table before him , might even be amusing , if we could forget that , in the Senate , he represents the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave of Washington . The memorial does not purport to come from ministers of the Gospel . On the contrary it was framed to exclude that construction . It might have been subscribed by Jewish clergymen . It was signed by one well known clergyman who disowns the authority of the Bible , and ( we believe ) does not even profess to be a minister of the Gospel . The memorialists do not-as the Senator affirmed with reckless iteration-invoke upon the Senate the vengeance of the Almighty . Nor do they " put aside their character as citizens. ** They imply the contrary ; for surely they speak in the character of citizens and patriots when they protest against the measure as imperiling " the existence of our beloved Union , and exposing W9 " - not the Senate or the Senators , but the great republic of which we are citizens- " to the righteous judgments of the Almighty . " Mr. Butler of South Carolina proceeded in the work of misconstruction . He described the memorialists as " an oro'anization . " One moment 's recollection uiight have shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the record , but had contradicted well known facts . The subscribers were no more an organization , than three thousand shoemakers , petitioning for a repeal of the duties on leather , would be an organization . Having thus erected the memoriahists into a spiritual corporation , he charged them with coming to the Senate " as the organs of God . " Mr. Adams of Mississippi was more gentle and more sensible . His point was that when ministers of the Gospel " depart from their high vocation and come down to mingle in the turbid pools of politics , " they should be treated precisely like other citizens  --  a remark th at showed some sense of equal rights among white men . Mr. Pettit of Tndiana , when his turn came , spoke in character . He mildly rebuked Mr. Adams for what he had said about " the pool of // politics . " " I hold , " said he , with beautiful confusion of language , " that the waters of the pools of politics are infinitely more pellucid , and pure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounds their stagnant waters of theology-notwo of them agreeing on any proposition which can be presented : " though , strangely enough , more than three thousand of them had agreed on the proposition that the repeal of the existing prohibition of slavery in the territories is " a great moral wrong . He on his part , as might have been expected where clergymen were concerned , carried the preceding misrepresentations of the memorial to a higher pitch . He hit upon the discovery that the memorialists presented themselves as having an exclusive right to pronounce the will of God . His words-equally malicious and unwarranted-were , " They say that to them alone is given the power to divulge or to divine that law ( God 's law ) on earth ; " and on this one string he played his poor tune of ribaldry to the end . The memorial was defended not only by Mr. Houston in his generous and manly way , but by Mr. Everett in his elegant and diplomatic way , and by Mr. Seward in his dignified and conclusive way . We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for we have to do chiefly with Mr. Douglas . His brother Senators , Mason , Butler , and Pettit , had suggested modes of misconstruction and topics of abuse , which seem not to have occurred to him when he opened the debate . Resuming the subject , in reply to Gen. Houston and Gov . Everett , he said of the memorial , " It is an attempt to establish in this country the doctrine that a body of men organized and known among the people as clergymen , have a peculiar right to determine the will of God in relation to legislative action . It is an attempt to establish a theocracy to take chnrge of our politics and our legislation . It is an attempt to make the legislative power of this country subordinate to the church . It is not only to unite Church and State , but it is to put the State in subordination to the dictates of the church . Sir , you can not find in the most despotic countries , in the darkest ages , a bolder attempt on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of Government , and to say to the people : You must not think for yourselves ; you must not dare to act for yourselves ; you must in all matters pertaining to the affairs of this life , as well as the next , receive instructions from us ; and that , too , in the performance of your civil and official , as well as your religious duties . ' " Sir , I called attention to this matter for the purpose of showing that it involved a great principle subversive of our free institutions . If we recognize three thousand clergymen as having a higher right to interpret the will of God than we have , we destroy the right of self-action , of self-government , of selfthought , and we are merely to refer each of our political questions to this body of clergymen to inquire of them whether it is in conformity with the law of God and the will of the Almighty or not . This document , I repeat , purports to speak in the name of Almighty God , and then enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ban , we are excommunicated , the gates of Heaven are closed unless we obey this behest and stop in our course and carry out these abolition views . // We shall return to this passage in a few moments . But we can not refrain from noticing first some other points , on which the Senator betrays either his ignorance or his madness . What he says in regard to the intelligence of the memorialists ought not to be overlooked . " Probably they combine all the respectability which he Mr. Everett claims for them , but I will add that Ii doubt whether there is a body of men in America who combine so much profound ignorance on the question upon which they attempt to enlighten the Senate , as this same body of preachers . How many of them , do *ou suppose , sir , have ever taken up and read the act of 1820 to which I allude * Do you think there is one of them who has done so ? " This , and more of the same sort , is the estimation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englander by birth , pretends to hold the intelligence of the clergy of New England-men who are scholars by profession , whose employments bring them into constant and various intercourse with all classes of their fellow citizens , and who are the freely chosen and voluntarily compensated religious teachers of the most reading and thinking , and withal the most democratic , population on the globe . Again , he says , on another point , " I do not remember that any one of these three thousand preachers , at the time when in Boston and other points of this country , there were attempts to resist the fugitive slave law by force , came forward and said it was a divine duty to perform national en*agements . " Either the Senator 's memory is a short one , or his information is too limited for his place and his aspirations . He ought to know that among the subscribers to that memorial are not a few who , in 1850 , followed the lead of Mr. Webster and pleaded earnestly for acquiescence even in the fugitive slave law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly that all compromises are worthless , and that there is no end to agitation for the extension of the slave trade-it is due that the clergy of New England are thus united . We return now from these incid ? ntal topics to the passage which we have quoted . The memorialists say , " We protest in the name of Almighty God . " So the memorial from New York protested " in the name of humanity and religion . " " We remonstrate , " say the New England memorialists , " in his presence . " This , says Mr. Douglas , enlightened by Mr. Pettit , is " an attempt to establish the doctrine that a body of men organized and known as clergymen* have a peculiar right to determine the will of God . " " It *s an attempt to establish a theocracy . " It is an attempt " to put the state in subordination to the dictates of the church . " It means that these " three // thousand clergymen have a higher right to interpret the will of God than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of construction and argument is employed by Mr. IDonglas in his Letter to twenty-five clergymen of Chicago , written with more deliberation than he had time for in the rapidity of debate . He evidently has full confidence that his construction is correct , or at least that he can make some people think so . It is worth the while , then , to say a word on this point . When the memorialists say , " In the name of Almighty God , and in his presence , we protest against and repeal of the existing prohibition of slavery in the territories , - what do they mean ? When they say that such a proceeding will expose us as a people " to the righteous judgments of the Almighty , " - what do they mean ? They mean to have it understood that they do not speak as connected with any political party , or in behalf of any personal or local interest . They mean to have it understood that they speak as believing that there is a God , Almighty and Omnipresent , to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individuals , is an abhorrence . They mean to have it understood that they are speaking to men whose moral sense can be quickened by a solemn reference to that invisible and holy presence , in which all deeds are done and all words are spoken . They are speaking not to brutes nor to atheists , but to men with human souls , from which the deep consciousness of a perpetual relation to the unseen and the infinite can never be entirely effaced . They are speaking to men who have been entrusted with the august and awful work of legislation , and who are about to act upon a question in which is involved the welfare of millions yet to be ; to men who , when they took the oath of office according to the Constitution , accepted their high trust " in the name of Almighty God and in his presence . " Instead of claiming any exclusive knowledge , or any peculiar right to determine the will of God , or any theocratic power , their memorial implies the contrary ; for its whole force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are men with human capabilities , and not atheists in whom the highest faculty of humanity has been paralyzed by some physical or moral malady . These memorialists know that slavery is wrong . How do they know it ? Just as Mr. Douglas knows it when he looks at it in the light of God 's presence and of eternity ; by the intuition of the moral sense . Just as Mr. Pettit , with all his scoffs , would know it if he were himself a slave . They know that to repeal a prohibition of slavery , legitimately enacted , which has stood for // the third part of a century , and to which*the faith of the nation was pledged , so far as it could be by the Congress that enacted it , is wrong . How do they know it ? Just as all men may know it , to whom the first principles of right and duty are selfevident . They know that God , who rules the world by his providence , and according to his wisdom and his righteousness , abhors iniquity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar revelation made to them . All men know it , in whatever hour the serious thought of the invisible and the eternal as more substantial than the fading world , and of duty as the grandest reality beneath the throne of God , crowds into their consciousness . Nay , the criminal himself : , even while his hands and his soul are yet hot with the deed of crime , knows it in his lurking and whispering conscience . Therefore it is that these memorialists , looking at the question of the day in its bearing on the character and welfare of a people whose destiny carries with it the destiny of the world , and desiring to lift so great a question out of " the turbid pool " of party politics , make their united protest in the presence of God , with religious invocation of his name , and with that reference which the living conscience makes instinctively to his righteous judgments . Their purpose is to discharge their own responsibility as individual citizens ; and in so doing to demand that , before the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least for one moment the aspect which it wears to the moral sense , in the presence of Him who determines the doom of guilty nations as well as of individual oppressors , and whose will is violated wherever his children , created in his image , are enslaved otherwise than in the just punishment of crime . In part , at least , their purpose was answered . Even the explosion of madness and folly which followed the presentation of their memorial , has its value . It was an illustration of that mysterious law of human nature , by which light strikes on the moral sense at any earnest thought of the Almighty and Everpresent God , and of his righteous judgments . IMlen who are laboring to betray a nation into guilt and infamy , and to secure indefinite immunity and extension for a wickedness like the slave-trade , " do not like to retain God in their knowledge . " They hate the light and will not come to it , lest their deeds be reproved ; and they cry out in pain and terror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they love .
