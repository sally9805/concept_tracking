ART . VIIL-GOD ON THE SIDE OF THE OPPRESSED . GOD is actually at work in the unfoldings of history , and has an eye especially upon the weak and the oppressed . By his interposition , in manifold cases , the oppressed have been delivered , and the rod of the oppressor has been broken . No small part of the world 's history is made up of the facts and developments wrought into the world 's experience by oppression . From that ominous scene enacted on the borders of Paradise , when human blood was first shed by human wrath , until now , the spirit of oppression has contributed to fill this world with woe . In its thousand degrees of harshness , from the envious and domineering cruelty of Sarah , revenging herself upon her handmaid , to the *cool-blooded , mercenary atrocity of the tropical slave-dealer , this spirit of oppression has cursed our race . And surely that must be a more than human discernment , which can see , either in nature or in revelation , a Warrant for the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He who will coolly come to the task of proving from nature , or from the Bible , that oppression is God 's choice and preference , and stands approved by Him as a good and not an evil in the social economy , whether he be politician or theologian , betrays an utter misapprehension of the first principles of Christianity , and a great want of the nobler instincts and qualities of humanity . One who reads the h'story of the world with a discerning eye , sees clearly that against no other single manifestation of the devil has the restraining force of him who rules on high been more constantly employed than against this spirit of oppression . The supernatural developments which signalized the release of Israel from their hard bondage in Egypt , indicate to us the current of Divine sympathy in respect to oppression wherever it bears sway . And though no other Divine interposition has been so marked and miraculous as that which sent the marshaled tribes of Jacob in triumph and joy before the doomed cohorts of Pharaoh , yet by his unseen forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as really rebuked this spirit of oppression , and as effectually delivered the oppressed . Whether by turning the cruel counsels of ilaman against himself ; or by constraining a Cyrus to become a willing agent ; or by uniting the fleets of Europe , and pouring their // iron hail upon the Turk ; or in whatever way He has at different times effected the deliverance of the oppressed , his mark of disapprobation has been set against that unchristian and inhuman spirit which robs one man of his rights for the pleasure or the profit of another . To suppose that by any possible interpretation the providence of God can be fairly construed into an approval or a justification of oppression , is to reverse the entire code of Christian ethics , and cut adrift from the only safe anchorage in the sea of human opinion . When we say , therefore , that God is not in favor of oppression between man and man , we can not doubt that the unprejudiced judgment of every reader is with us . God , in history , is really and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself ; and God in revelation speaks with unmistakable directness in condemnation of every species of this sin . In history we deem it not the less a Divine intervention-not the less a rebuke of God for the perversion of his ordinance-when he works by silent forces , than when he works by startling revolutions , in breaking the oppressor 's rod . Nor is it the less true , that God arises for the sighing of the oppressed , *because he hangs before himself the veil of human instrumentality . He works by means in the natural world ; and it is only a shallow and heartless skepticism that doubts the reality and ceaseless activity of the Divine power in nature , because in her operations God is not visible to the eye of sense . In the moral world , too , God works by means . In all the social and political changes which occur in our land , and in every land , he works ; and his working is as real , when by a happy confluence of moral or social influences he brings deliverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by insurrections and carnage he deals out anguish and death to the oppressor . It is the same God , in the use of the same almighty power , who with his noiseless frost and dews slowly disintegrates the mountain , or with his pent up fire makes that mountain quiver in convulsions . In history , as in nature , his forces are diverse in their operations . Iis footsteps may be as clearly discerned in those milder and more silent changes that have passed upon the tribes and nations of men , as in the insurrections , carnage and bloody strifes that blacken the records of the past . Tie is by no means confined or limited to insurrections and civil wars with their attendant horrors , as the means by which to effect the . deliverance of the oppressed . A more palpable Divine interposition for the oppressed is not on record , than that by which the Lord stirred the spirit of Gyms , King of Persia , that he made proclamation of good will // to all the captive Israelites in his realm who were disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the land of their fathers . Kor was it less obviously God , working in this interesting event of history , who brought it to pass , that when " the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin " began to make ready for their return to the city of their pride , then , " all they that were about them helped them with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods and with beasts , and with precious things . " fiere was no carnage , no hostile attitude between the oppressor and the oppressed , no hot and angry words to pierce like arrows , and lie festering in the wounds they made . And yet this peaceful and bloodless deliverance of a captive people from their thraldom to a monarch whose boast was that all the kingdoms of the earth were subject to him , is the event referred to , as some believe , when the Lord by the lips of his messenger said : " For the oppression of the poor-for the sighing of the needy ncw will I arise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question or not , we see in the event itself an instance of God 's interposition for the oppressed . By many such instances , to be found in the records of the past , and in the written revelation of iHis will , God has evinced a sympathy with the oppressed , and a purpose to break ultimately the rod of every oppressor . We fully believe , and recognize it as an important item in every Christian creed , that what was thus accomplished for the oppressed Israelities will sooner or later be accomplished for the oppressed of every land who sigh for Divine interposition . Passing events seem to indicate that an interposition is now in progress by which God will ultimately cause oppression in this land to cease . We claim no superhuman insight into the future of this or any other people . The gift of prophecy has ceased . Excited passion may lead the controversialist and the partisan to speak with an air of assurance , where modesty , to say nothing of Christian humility , would dictate other language . When we say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this nation , we have reference only to what is before ns , as matter of fact , in the aspect of public affairs . Our confidence as to the final result , rests in God , and is sustained by his clearly revealed purposes . Whether this result will come now , or a generation hence , or in after time , we say not with assurance . Whether , when it comes , it will come like the dew of a summer morning , wrought into a visible form of beauty , by those silent forces in which God works ; or like the prostrate oak , riven and blasted for all time by the flash of God 's eye of wrath , it is not for us to say . // Our prayer is  --  and shall be until the indications of Providence are so clear as to make it wrong for us to offer it-that in mercy and in mildness the Great Ruler will arise for the oppressed who are crying to him in this land . And we believe it to be the duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also to shape their conduct and their entire influence in accordance with it . The great question of the age is coming to be somewhat clearly defined by the movements of the nations , and it bears with unmistakable directness upon the future of the oppressed . It is not our purpose now to dwell upon the fact , that the same question under different forms is engaging the attention of the old world and the new . It would not be difficult to show , that by a network of invisible connections , one spirit is gradually diffusing itself into all the workings of political society in the various nations ; and that this spirit , working against consolidated forms of assumed authority , is really the moving force in all the great events now transpiring in our world . At present , however , we can view this question only in those limited relations which it bears to the people of this nation . Shall freedom or oppression prevail in this land ? is the real question now before us as a people . There has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question to its present definiteness . There may be yet other steps necessary to complete its solution . But we are confident there is progress toward the result . Whatever transpositions , involutions , or evolution remain , each , as it transpires , makes the numberless ; and there is our end . We are approaching it . He who has said to the waves of the ocean , " thus far , " will yet say to human avarice and cruelty , " no further . " He who can at any time bring his hidden forces to bear upon the bosom of the quiet sea , causing each wave to reach a point upon the shore beyond its predecessor , until the appointed mark is gained ; can also move upon this nation 's mind , until the last wave of popular feeling shall reach the required limit , and , receding , leave our name cleansed of that foul stain which now rests upon it . We are not sure that wave of public feeling which is just now rolling upward from the depth of a troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One thing is certain , however . Those which have preceded it have not approached so near what seems to us to be the mark . By degrees they have risen higher and higher , and if this , which now awakens the apprehensions of not a few by its loud , and solemn , and steadily swelling sound , falls short of the appointed bound , then , another will succeed // it . The end may not be yet , but there will be an end . In God 's time it will come . There has been progress . One of the most encouraging signs of progress we discover in the events which have recently proclaimed , and which are signalizing the birth , and presaging the coronation of a sovereign state , to be in due time admitted into this great confederacy . Amid the conflicting opinions expressed respecting the ultimate influence of these events upon the question of American slavery , we find comfort in this fully authorized conclusion : the great problem will soon be one step nearer its solution than it has ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointed limits than any which has preceded it . What is now transpiring may bring us to that very point in the history of an oppressed and crushed race , when God will arise for their cry and bring deliverance . That God will employ men as instrumental agents , and the appliances of a Christianity far advanced in its acquaintance with the world 's wants , as means , in effecting this deliverance , is quite probable . That he will work , through their agents and means , we fully *believe . Whether this just now before us is the end , or only the beginning of the end , we can not doubt that oppression will ultimately cease in this land . It will cease because God is opposed to it , and is arrayed against it . Faith in an overruling Providence assures us that back of all the rancor , fierce debates , and reckless threats of men , the invisible hand of Jehovah is arranging this network of apparent causes and influences , and controlling this multitude of conflicting forces with reference to the desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly revealed in his word-if the past is a reliable criterion by which to ju4lge of the future - that result must ultimately come . We have no doubt in respect to the final deliverance of those who are now in bondage among us . How this deliverance is to be effected ; whether by the bloody process of civil war , or by the silently progressive influence of Christianity working its legitimate fruits in the hearts ot the people , it is not for us to say with assurance . But as Christian men we surely are in duty bound to act always and only upon Christian principles ; to cherish and utter only Christian sentiments ; and to send out through the entire circle of our possible influence the savor of a Christian spirit . It is therefore to be deeply regretted , when Christian men by profession , and especially when Christian ministers allow thenjselves to prate and bluster about blood and battle , in speaking // or writing upon this subject . It seems utterly out of place aud incongruous with his calling , when one who declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to preach the gospel of God , " takes it upon himself to say through the reckless political prints of the land , to a distinguished member of the national council- " If you be as wise as you are eloquent , you may comprehend what as yet you seem to have wholly overlooked , viz , the settled confidence of the entire slave states , that they are fully able to make the men of the North repent that ever they broke constitutions , and forgot ancestral ties , and outraged national obligations , in order to ruin ten millions ( ? ) of the most elevated race on the face of the earth , upon the hazard , if not the pretext , of benefiting a third part of that number of one of the most degraded races in the world. *** As if the soul of a slave was by the mere fact of his degradation , reduced in value and made of little or no account ! A strange arithmetic - peculiar mathematics for a Christian divine to use , and by which to estimate and settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it has been " the great business " of this divine to preach , was not the soul of a certain " degrade*d " Lazarus , by whose wretchedness the instinctive compassion of doo 's was awakened , of as much value as the soul of a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fared sumptuously every day ? But hear this preacher of the gospel still further . " Believe me when I state two facts , one of which I know better than you do , and the other of which you ought to know , perhaps , better than I do . The fact which I know better than you do is , that whenever the very faintest indication of the settled purpose of the men of the North to follow your advice becomes apparent to the men of the fifteen slave states of this Union , a million of armed men will be ready to receive you and your followers ; and if you come not speedily thereafter to execute your threats , your coming will not be waited for ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose no danger will ever come . The fact which you ought to know better than I do , is that after two or three hundred thousand lighting men , in the present state of the art of war , everything depends merely upon brains . . . . You will have battle , and that without truce or comproniise , and that whenever - you can reach us , and that until the field is entirely won . " Now it is quite obvious that the knowledge here so pompously vaunted , is not possessed . It is silly ostentation to parade such // language before a people who believe that there is One who doeth his pleasure in Heaven and on the earth , never failing , when he is so minded , to " restrain the wrath of man . " But there is somthing more inexcusable than ostentation in the language we have quoted ; especially when we view it as coming from a preacher of the Gospel . For the Gospel teaches , that when great questions are pending in the progress of this world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword unsheathed , just nothing , instead of everything , depends " merely upon brains . " A more glaring denial of Divine Providence could not well be uttered . Surely it might better come from a different source . But it was not our intention to comment upon this language . It is given to show that not all Christian men are sending out through the land with their words and influence the savor of a Christian spirit in respect to the great question now before the people . We deprecate such language , coming from such a source , as fitted to enhance a thousand fold the probabilty of a bloody termination of the oppressor 's sway among us . We hope to see  --  and we thank God that it still remains possible thus to hope ; nay , that the probabilities of such an issue are slowly increasing with the years of history-we hope to see the curse of American Slavery removed by the quiet , but sure and resistless progress of that Christianity , whose mission in our world is but just becoming apparent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public conscience restlessly alive to a sense of moral obligation toward the oppressed . This hope within us is not a little encouraged and strengthened by the events which have already transpired in connection with the opening history of Kansas . We have had side issues , and party feelers , and sectional touchstones introduced many times into our national politics . But never before has the que8tion which lies back of all these minor matters come so definitely and so necessarily before the nation , to be answered by a direct yea or nay , as now . It may be again compromised , but the probabilities of such an issue are less than ever before . By recent events connected more or less directly with the settlement of Kansas , it is rendered quite apparent that fifteen of the states are pledged to each other for the exten8ion , as well as the defen8e , of American Slavery , in a bond of such strength and such sworn devotion , as makes them indissolubly one in a struggle to the death , if need be , for the attainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that by a reverend champion too , for the other states to oppose // resolutely the extension of slavery , will be regarded by these fifteen sworn confederates in the cause of oppression , as good and sufficient reason for " war to the knife and the knife to the hilt . " It is not necessary , according to the modest expose of the platform of the slave power and party , that the advocates of freedom should meddle at all with slavery where it is , or as it is , in order to stir up the lion 's wrath , and cause him to open his terrible jaws , and make a quiet meal of them . They have only to oppose resolutely the spread of slavery , and that in a perfectly constitutional way , and a cause of war is given . The moment they say to this greedy beast of prey , " Let us alone , keep away from our hearths and homes , " that moment he will shake himself from his luxurious slumbers , and rising upon them in the majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is certainly bringing the matter to a somewhat definite point , upon which it will be quite practicable , we think , " for the friends of freedom " to join issue with a will . It has never come to this before . Hence , we believe there is progress toward the end . This distinct announcement of their object and determination on the part of the slave power , has removed in a measure what has hitherto stood as a grand obstacle in the way of united and earnest efforts by the friends of liberty . Up to this time , there has been a seemingly divided sentiment among the advocates of freedom  --  the people of the free states . This appearance has resulted in part from the fact , that a large number of men , pecuniarily interested in the profits of slavery , and not a few men who actually own and work slaves , live in the free states . They covet the gains to be realized from oppression , but desire also the advantages of a residence among the free . Whenever there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protest against " ultraism , " as they choose to call it , and so break the force of what but for them would be a united voice against this sin . But the aspect which this question has now assumed , will draw the lines in the free states . Heretofore , a man , even in the free states , could cry down the zealous opponents of slavery , and thus give aid and comfort to the system , under the pretext that it is wrong to interfere with what does not really concern us . Many a man at the North has thus defended and strengthened a personal pecuniary interest in slavery , while he seemed to be only opposing the wrong action of other men . But as the question is now brought before the Nation , this subterfuge is swept away , and he who speaks or acts at all in the matter , must be for or against slavery . This is a gain upon the past . // Among the developments which it will bring as its necessary result , one will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of men in the free states who are in favor of slavery , because of their pecuniary interest in its profits . But this appearance of a divided sentiment in the free states in respect to slavery , has resulted also from the fact that a large proportion of the people have been resting quietly in the slumbers of a selfish indifference . They have said , each to himself : " Slavery does not affect me or my interest , and I will not meddle with slavery . " Recent movements and events have greatly broken in upon this easy and selfish repose of the masses . It was a sudden jog of the quiet , contented dreamer , when the Federal Power , with an imperative tone and a lifted sword , said to him , " Up ! bestir yourself ! at the top of your speed follow that fugitive-lay hold of him-bind him-bring him back and rivet upon him again those chains which he has burst asunder-do all this , or , if you fail for lack of a will in the matter , I 5TRIKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave multitudes new ideas , and , with these , new purposes respecting their personal relations to slavery . It was another severe jog of the satisfied dreamer when the same Federal Power , with a voice of authority , said , ' " Slavery is , and shall be deemed to be , a national institution ; and may go under national protection throughout the national domain . " But it roused the dreamer to positive wakefulness , when , under the encouragement of this Federal proclamation , ruthless banditti , armed with rum and revolvers , went up from the councils of slavery and laid hold upon his poor but sturdy sons who had gone forth into the wilderness to hew out for themselves a fortune , saying to them , " Submission or death . " The time for slumber was then passed ; and many who were before quiet amid the pleasures of freedom , were aroused to a sense of the fact that slavery in this land aspires to the position and influence of a national institution . Hence there are fewer men among us than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of selfish indifference to this spreading curse . This surely is gain . Thus there is progress . We are evidently approaching the end . Compacts and compromises , whi cli have hitherto operated to put a quietus upon the public conscience , whenever it has showed signs of wakefulness , are divested of their charm . The deep sea of national feeling , which hitherto has been only a little ruffled upon the surface by a force without , is now moved from its very centre by a force within ; and though upon the surface it may appear as if inclining toward a quiet level again , // far down in its disturbed bosom there are forces at work which will never rest till their mission is accomplished . We may misinterpret present appearances . The sighs of the times may mislead us . It is human to err . Yet it surely is not presumption to hope , that we can now see the " beginning of the end " in this protracted struggle between liberty and oppression . A severe and even desperate conflict , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . It is not to be expected that a consummation so blessed , in a world so full of the curse , will be achieved without a struggle . Oppression may call to its aid in this struggle the force of arms . Such helps are in keeping with its tastes and its spirit . Blood and carnage may be its most weighty arguments . By a reckless use of these arguments it may provoke a civil war . Among freemen , self-defense is placed in the catalogue of duties , and when men fight for conscience ' sake , it is wont to be cool and serious fighting . Such may be the issue of this conflict between liberty and oppression in our land . But we hope not . We earnestly pray that it may not . Every social and moral impulse within moves us to such prayer . We rejoice in indications that this is to be in the main a different kind of conflict . We rejoice that this battle is not to be so much between men armed with carnal weapons , as between men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much a flourish of trumpets and drums , a booming of cannon , and a gleaming of sabres , as a meeting face to face in the more manly and ennobling struggles of argument and persuasion . In our view , this conflict is , and is to be , chiefly of a moral nature . As Christian men we are bound to believe , as well as say , in respect to this and all other great moral achievements in our world , that so far as we have to do with them , " the weapons of our warfare are not carnal . " There may be occasionally a sudden outbreak of bad passions , yielding as its fruit blood and death . In single combat , " a man of small stature , " whose chief glory is that " he is a centre shot , " may send the cold lead through the heart in a man of large stature , whose chief glory was , that " he was considerably over six feet ; his weight over two hundred pounds ; and he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , all armed ***and the advocates of oppression may vaunt over this , as indicative of what refined chivalry can do . But all such events are mere eddies in that silent current which is tending with resistless might toward the open sea . Duels , and mobs , and bloody conventions are but the scum and refuse // thrown out upon the surface by those purifying forces which are at work upon the Nation 's heart ; and which are sustaining a moral impulse , whose issues will be unspeakably glorious* That there is progress toward this result , they will see who remember , that from being a proscribed subject of discussion , even in limited social circles , the question of American slavery has come to shape the discussions and platforms of every political party , and every Christian denomination , and every great social conference in the land . From being a subject universally ignored by them , it has come to characterize the most effective productions of forum , pulpit , and press . From a question , admitted to be of no practical importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a question transcending all others in the directness and magnitude of its bearing upon their very existence . Tue state of things in Kansa* is just a practical realization of what must follow the footsteps of oppression where it appropriates to itself the soil of freedom . It is a new chapter in the history of the great curse . It proclaims distinctly these fixed purposes of the relentless invader , viz , to repudiate all compromise-to wield the Federal power not only for self-defense , but also for self-extensidn , and to destroy all true liberty where it ventures to stand upon an open defense . The real question now before us , and brought into a definite , tangible form , by the events of the last few years , but especially by the brief and rough history of Kansas , is-SHALL w* BE FREE ? What question more weighty ? What people more competent for its solution , than the freemen upon the free soil of America ? Others may talk of blood , and murder , and fury and lift themselves by the fervor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , and foes biting the dust ; but it is ours , as Christian men , to view this whole matter from a different stand-point , and think , and act , and speak , as if there were a God in Heaven , who will arise for the oppression of the poor when they cry unto him . He may arise in wrath against us as a nation ; but let us hope and pray that He will rather strengthen the things which remain-give wisdom to our judges , prudence to our counselors , integrity to our rulers , and inspire our citizens with the fear of the Lord , and the love of all men . And while we thus hope and thus pray , let us not rest in a state of inactivity . As American Christians we have a personal responsibility in this matter-we have a work to perform . God will indeed give the result , but he will give it through our instrumentality . Let us therefore buckle on our armor . Let // all the friends of freedom in every part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoulder in the struggle . A sublime spectacle is now presented to the view of witnessing nations by the posture of our affairs . Thirteen millions of free white inhabitants , upon free territory , fairly pitted against six millions of white inhabitants , partially free , upon slave territory , in a struggle for the possession and control of a country of unsurpassed magnitude and resources ! A stiuggle for freedom upon territory consecrated to freedom by the prayers and sufferings of a godly ancestry , and the blood and sacrifices of a Revolutionary war ! A struggle , not in the use of swords and spears , and deadly weapons of whatever sort , but in the use of those silent forces-truth , justice , humanity , and religion-by which the God of destinies is directing to a glorious issue , the clashing events of time ! This is the real character of the conflict . These are the effective weapons in the warfare . Come then , ye Christian men of every party , persuasion , and section of the land , let the inspiration of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital union , that by well directed effort , liberty , unembittered by any remnant of oppression , may pour its blessings upon all the future millions of this nation . The enemy has entered the field . The imperiled have already confronted him . The issue is joined , and the dust of the battle is rising on the prairies , and along the rivers , and in the young cities and villages of a territory , plucked by the grasp of avarice and oppression from the acknowledged domain of liberty , and at this moment lifting its half manacled hands before thirteen millions of free men upon free soil , with the imploring cry , " Come over and help us . " Let an answer to this cry go up from these homes of the free , that shall be as the sound of a great army , and give courage to the fainting hearts , and strength to the enfeebled hands of those whose altars and firesides are invaded and imperiled . And not upon Kansas only , but upon every opening territory , and every rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and every territory in this whole land , North , East , South and West , let us pour the light of truth , and send out the champions of liberty . A fair fight in an open field this , and let him who would reap enduring laurels buckle on his armor. - " The gift of a great Captain , " the enemy has said , will decide the contest . We accept the declaration , but in a sense not intended by him . Fellow Christians , that Captain has been given . He is our Captain . Jesus , whose religion is a religion of love , and whose // Gospel is the basis and the bulwark of our liberties , is his name . Under his banuer , then , let us go forth , assnred of a final victory . Breathing his Spirit-obeying his commandsrejoicing in his protection-strengthened with his might , let us unite in the settled purpose to fill every opening section of our fair country with Bibles , with churches , with schools , with the Christian ministry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the weapons of our warfare . And while we through these , speak the truth in love , and rebnke iniquity without wavering , and proclaim liberty to the captive ; let us not cease to plead with God , and beseech him to " arise for the oppression of the poor and for the sighing of the needy " in this land .
