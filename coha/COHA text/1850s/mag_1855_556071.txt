THE PERSISTENCE OF PHYSICAL LAWS . One hundred and eighty-six years after his death , A. D. 1000 , the seal of Charlemagne 's grave was broken for the first time . The young and enthusiastic Emperor Otho III. , who rebuilt the church , which had been partially destroyed by the Normans , had the vault opened . He took a piece of the holy cross away with him , as a sacred memorial of his great predecessor . It was also , probably , at this time that the sceptre , crown , and pouch were removed , to be used at the coronation of subsequent Roman emperors . They are now kept at Vienna . The marble chair remains , and is still shown at Aix-la- Chapelle . The vault was sealed up once more and remained undisturbed for a period of one hundred and sixtyfive years . At that time another great Emperor , Frederic Barbarossa , had it opened again , and by his command the remains of the body were laid in a coffin , and removed to a grander and richer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessors was so great , that he induced the Pope of his creation , Pascal III. , to signalize the gratitude of the pontifical chair for its most glorious protector by a canonization of the hero , after the lapse of more than three hundred years . ART . VII . -1 . The Elements of Intellectual Philosophy . By FRANCIS WAYLAND , President of Brown University , and Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy . Boston : Phillips , Sampson , &amp; Co. 1854. l2mo. pp. 426. 2 . Philosophy of the 3iliechanics of Nature , and the Source and 3iliodes of Action of Natural Iiliotive Power . By Z. ALLEN . Illustrated by numerous Wood-cuts . New York : P. Appleton &amp; Co. 1852. 8vo. pp. 797 . THE authors of these volumes need no introduction from us . They are already well and favorably known to the public . The published works of Dr. Wayland - his excellent treatises on Moral Science and Political Economy , his admirable volumes of Sermons , and , more recently , his interesting // Memoirs of Dr. Judson - have secured for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while his position for more than a quarter of a century at the head of one of the oldest and most honored colleges of New England , and his eminent ability as an instructor , have made his name and fame household words in every part of the land . Mr. Allen , too , has repeatedly appeared before the public as an author . His " Practical Tourist , " an agreeable book of travels , had in its time an extensive circulation ; and his " Manual of Improvements in the Industrial Arts , " intended especially for mechanics and manufacturers , is understood to have rendered important aid to these classes . In the present work , we have the fruit of more extended research and of riper investigation , as well as of loftier endeavor . Its aim is rather philosophical than practical . It seeks to unveil the hidden sources of all material power , rather than to furnish guides for its economical applications . It is the development of one great idea , which finds adequate expression only in a volume of seven hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather in support and illustration . The circumstances under which the work was produced impart to it additional interest . It was not a task imposed by the necessities of professional position . No hope of pecuniary advantage mingled with the motives which prompted it . A pure and simple love of the truths unfolded was sufficient to repay every sacrifice , and to render the labor , although continued through long years of patient thought and study , its own exceeding great reward . It was composed during periods of leisure gained from active business pursuits , - chiefly in the hours of early morning , when the faculties invigorated by brief slumber were prepared for their finest action ,  - -  -  a circumstance to which may be due , in part at least , the auroral freshness that breathes from its pages . When the work of composition was completed , the resources of a private fortune were put in requisition , that others might experience the philosophic joy and reflect it back by sympathy . The theory of natural motive-power unfolded in this volume assumes the entire passivity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extended to the domain of chemistry , and the material particles are supposed to be as utterly inert as the rriasses built up from them . The idea of inherent forces - of attractions and repulsions , of gravity , cohesion , and chemical affinity - is discarded , as wholly incompatible with the nature of matter . The component atoms of a body can no more possess the power of self-motion , than the body itself . Every change - whether from rest to motion or from motion to rest - must be impressed upon them by forces from without . The only power or capability which we can rationally ascribe to the atoms is that of receiving , modifying , and transmitting these forces . The sun is the great primary source of all the physical activities of which our globe is the theatre . Impulses of mechanical force are continually emanating from that mighty orb . Propagated through a universally diffnsed electric medium , they reach the earth , where , modified by the several elementary and compound substances , they appear under as many different forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carbonic acid , and ammonia are subtile mechanisms , each dependent for its power of changing the direction of the impulses reaching it upon the peculiar grouping of its component atoms . Light , heat , electricity , magnetism , cohesion , and chemical affinity are only different exhibitions of force , whose characters are severally determined by these mechanisms . They are readily convertible into one another , and are all traceable , either directly or indirectly , to the sun . The existence of a universally diffused electric fluid is inferred from the necessity of some medium for transmitting through space the impulses of gravity , as well as from the positive proofs of the existence of such a fluid aronnd and within the earth . Although a species of matter , it is snpposed to possess perfect mobility , and to be capable of propagating without loss or diminution whatever impulses are communicated to it ; and as it fills all space , such impulses when once imparted must continue to course and recourse its soundless depths through all time . They can no more be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indestructible as 14 // the fluid which they traverse . They can be annihilated only by the fiat of the Almighty . But bodies moving rapidly through the electric fluid disturb , as experiment shows , its equilibrium , and develop impulses of force . May we not , therefore , suppose the so-called forces of nature to be but diffusions of the strength of that arm which launched the planetary orbs in space , and gave to each its proper motions ? May not the tide of life and motion , ever ebbing and flowing within and around us , be only ceaselessly recurring waves of a divine energy poured into our system at the time of its creation ? Such in outline is Mr. Allen 's Philosophy of the Mechanics of Nature . Whether true or false , the conception of the material universe presented by it is one of surpassing simplicity and grandeur . Although some may not be disposed to grant the postulate upon which the system is based , and others may call in question the logical processes connecting its several parts , no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with rare philosophic genius . Considered as a theory for the explanation of phenomena , - the only light in which we suppose its author to regard it , - it is to be judged of solely by its adequacy and its simplicity . All such theories must , from the nature of the case , be incapable of demonstration . They relate to the causes or essences lying back of the phenomena , and consequently wholly hidden from human view . So long as they explain all the known facts in a natural and simple manner , they are to be regarded as sound and legitimate . When from the progress of discovery they have ceased to do this , they must be set aside , and others sought to take their places . That the physical sciences have outgrowu many of the hypotheses still connected with them , - that for some time past they have been advancing in spite of these hypotheses , rather than through them ,  --  will , we think , be generally admitted . More especially is this true of the branches relating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for explaining the laws of light , heat , electricity , and magnetism , although originally simple and satisfactory , have taken on so many additions in accommodatingthemselves to new phases // of these sciences , that they no longer conform to any of the requirements of a good theory . They are inadequate . They are complex . They are contradictory . The rich veins of truth to which they originally pointed have been exhausted , and they now serve only to prolong research in unprofitable directions . Instead of aiding , they hinder discovery by blocking the entrance to the paths that lead to it . Nor do we believe that any great advance will be made in this department of human knowledge until these obstructions shall be removed , - until some Samson arise , who , breaking the cords of theory and shaking himself free from the withes of hypothesis , shall bear away the gates of Gaza , and open new fields for investigation . Whether this has been accomplished in the work before us , must be left for time to determine . But whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mechanics of Nature , the generalizations connected with it are exceedingly beautiful , and are , moreover , in strict accordance with facts , so far as made known by science . They will constitute in the estimation of many , we presume , the most valuable portion of his labors . We can only indicate them in the briefest manner . Two processes , not only entirely dissimilar , but directly opposite in character and tendency , are everywhere in progress , - oxidation and deoxidation . The former occurs in ordinary combustion , in the corrosion of metals , in the wasting of animal tissue , and in the decay of all organic bodies . It is always attended by an exhibition of force varying in character according to circumstances . Steam power is due to the oxidation of the wood or coal placed under the boiler of the engine . Electro-magnetic power is due to the oxidation of the zinc element of the battery . Animal power is due to the oxidation of brain and muscle , and not to the will , which merely determines its manifestation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these , under the influence of the sun 's rays , carbonic acid , and water , the sulphates and the phosphates undergo resolution . The greater part of the oxygen is thrown off , while the carbon , the hydrogen , the sulphur , and the phosphorus are wrought into the vegetable tissues . These substances all exist naturally in // the state of oxides , and when reclaimed from that state more or less speedily return to it . The leaf of the plant is an apparatus specially devised for the application of sun-power to reclaiming them . All the vegetable products have been thus deoxidized , and may consequently be regarded as representatives of sun-power . Brain and muscle built up from these products also represent sun-power . Charcoal , and metals reduced from the state of ores by it , represent sun-power . The beds of bituminous and anthracite coal found in different parts of the earth - all of vegetable origin - represent sun-power . Steam-power , electro-magnetic power , and animal motivepower , resulting from the return , under different circumstances , of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , representatives of sun-power ; or , adopting the theoretical views of Mr. Allen , they are sun-power modified by the material mechanisms through which it is transmitted . The power of wind and of running water is also traceable , through a different channel indeed , to the same source . The currents of the atmosphere arise from disturbances of its equilibrium by solar heat . The currents of the ocean have a similar origin . Rivers are waters on their return from regions whither they have been borne through the agency of heat . XWind-power and water-power , therefore , still represent sunpower ; or , as Mr. Allen would say , are sun-power modified in its transmission through material mechanisms . Man can not originate force . He may discover and lay open the natural sources of motive-power lying around him , but he can create no new sources . Even volition , which metaphysicians have been accustomed to regard as the type of all proper causation , and from which many would derive the only idea of power , merely determines its manifestation . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telegraph . Without a supply of motive-power in the brain , the will could as easily create an arm as move it . Nature can not originate force . The different forms of matter , whether ponderable or imponderable , can only receive and propagate it . As well might we suppose the elements selfformed as self-moved ; as rationally ascribe to them spontaneity of origin , as spontaneity of motion . The varied impulses // to which they are continually yielding must all come from without . Every form of motive-power , wherever appearing , or however emerging , is but the welling-up of sun-power ; and sun-power is but the ceaseless flux and reflux of a force divinely imparted to our system at the time when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy . The work of Dr. Wayland is designed not so much to advance the science of Intellectual Philosophy , as to present its known and admitted truths in a simple and accessible form . Although well adapted to interest the general reader , it is intended more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of a text-book , chiefly , that we should regard it , if we would justly appreciate its merits . In the Preface the author says : " I have not entered upon the discussion of many of the topics which have called into exercise the acumen of the ablest metaphysicians . Intended to serve the purposes of a textbook , it was necessary that the volume should be compressed within a compass adapted to the time usually allotted to the study of this science in the colleges of our country . I have , therefore , attempted to present and illustrate the important truths in intellectual philosophy , rather than the inferences which may be drawn from them , or the doctrines which they may presuppose . These may be pursued to any length , at the option of the teacher . " The course adopted in this respect we believe to be a wise one . In addition to the cogent reasons assigned for it , others , of almost equal weight , present themselves . Even if , in the distribution of the brief period allotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge claiming attention , a larger portion of time were allowed to the metaphysics , we should doubt the expediency of introducing classes to the higher and more difficult problems of the science . As a general thing , they are not prepared for them . With here and there an individual exception , they have neither the age nor the mental training fitting them for such inquiries . As well might the young geometer be initiated into the mysteries of the calculus , or of the JIMcaniquc C*leste . The power of noting , comparing , and analyzing the mental processes is of comparatively late growth . The mind is at first occupied exclusively with the outward // and sensible , and it is only after long-continued and patient effort that it is able to attend to its own acts and states so as to gain an accurate knowledge of them , or to comprehend the terms by which they are designated . In the prosecution of no other science is the student in so great danger of mistaking words for ideas ; in no other science are such mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they liable to prove so fatal . It is not simply that the curiosity is dulled , and a habit formed of being satisfied with the mere symbols of knowledge ; that the mind ceases to feel the quickening impulses arising from the joyous , exultant perception of truth , and becomes accustomed to act mechanically and through formuke ; that originality is destroyed , and the power of real , genuine thinking lost . These evils may show themselves in any part of the academical course ; and the extent to which they are actually experienced is frequently such as seriously to impair the value of a college education , and to constitute one of the strongest objections to the ordinary modes of conducting it . Consequences far more disastrous are liable to follow the confounding of words with ideas , and the substitution of mere signs for the things signified , by the student in intellectual philosophy . This science discloses the sources of our knowledge , and indicates the grounds for confidence in it . It traces our beliefs to the several stocks from which they spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examines the foundations of our faith , and furnishes criteria for the decision of questions involving the whole future of our being Consequently , any want of distinctness here , any confounding of thought and expression , any blending of fact with hypothesis , of the phenomena revealed in consciousness with theories designed to explain them , - any commingling of well-established doctrines , truths of assured certainty , with questions of difficult and doubtful disputation , - not only endangers the intellectual habits of the pupil , but exposes to peril his moral and religions well-being . However gratifying , therefore , it might be to the admirers of Dr. Wayland - among whom we claim a place - to have his matured views of the problems chiefly occupying the German philosophies , it is not in a college text-book that they would either look for them or desire to see them . // Besides the negative merit to which allusion has been made , the work possesses other and stronger recommendations of a positive character . Not only is it a perfectly safe book to place in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his use . The order is natural , the method is simple , and both the language and the illustrations are remarkable for their clearness . The facts of the science are well grouped , and their relations to one another are exhibited in a broad and clear light . The truthfulness of the mental constitution is taken for granted . No guaranties are sought for the knowledge acquired under it . The testimonies of both reason and the perceptive faculties are received as trustworthy , and as of ultimate authority on the subjects to which they relate . We can not doubt them if we would ; and were proof required , it would be impossible to give it . The external world exists . Matter is in reality what our senses and the investigations of science lead us to believe it . Qualities imply substance . Powers can not exist by themselves . There must necessarily be that to which they belong , and by which they are manifested . Every change supposes a cause ; and like causes under like circumstances must produce like effects . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusory ; or whether the intellectual intuitions be not mere regulative principles of thought , without any objective validity , is not entertained . These and other analogous inquiries are excluded , by placing all knowledge , natural as well as revealed , on the common ground of faith in the Divine veracity . The doctrine of perception maintained is substantially that of Reid and Stewart , as we understand these philosophers , and not the immediate , presentive perception which Sir William Hamilton would impose upon them , and which he himself labors so earnestly , though we think ineffectually , to establish . The cognition of external existence is not direct . The mind perceiving and the object perceived are not in immediate relation . They do not come together face to face . There are always interposed between them certain physical and organic media , through which alone the perceptive cognitions are awakened . The existence as an outward reality // of objects with qualities corresponding to these cognitions , is inferred from the truthfulness of the perceptive faculties ; or in the last analysis , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in forming the senses , we must believe , designed them to be inlets of true knowledge . The philosophical system of Dr. Wayland , therefore , is a mode of what the distinguished Scottish metaphysician denominates cosmothetic idealism or hypothetical realism , and not his own natural realism . Neither has he followed the latter eminent authority in his doctrine of intellectual intuitions , or original suggestions , as he prefers to call them . These are not derived from a negative source . They do not arise from limitations of the mental faculties . They are not corollaries from the conditioned in thought under the law of relativity . They are not beliefs imposed through the weakness of the human intelligence . They do not spring up in the mind from an incapacity to conceive their contraries . They are direct affirmations of the reason , clear and explicit declarations of the intelligence , to every rightly constituted mind , " the unanswerable evidence of their own truth . " They have the same guaranties , derived from the same source , as our other knowledge . Not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the improvement of the mental faculties . The long experience of Dr. Wayland as an instructor gives him peculiar advantages in speaking on this subject , while his rare success in the culture of his own powers , as well as in training the minds of others , lends weight and authority to every suggestion . The section on the improvement of the memory is a perfect storehouse of practical suggestions , deserving the gravest consideration of every one who would either widen his intellectual resources or gain a more perfect command of the knowledge already possessed . The directions contained in the section on the improvement of the reasoning powers are equally worthy of attention . In speaking of the culture of the faculties specially employed in discovery , he says : - " Analysis , or the power of distinguishing and separating from each other things which differ , may be employed either objectively or subjectively , // as we are inquiring into the qualities and relations of the world without us , or the energies and relations of the world within us . " So far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much depends upon the delicacy of our senses , but probably no less upon the earnest attention with which we use them . A listless , careless observer never discovers anything . It is only by intense direction of the mind to the objects of our inquiry , that we are able to detect changes and relations which have been hidden from preceding observers . Truth reveals herself not to those who pay her mere formal and perfunctory service , but to those who render to her the earnest and heartfelt homage of the whole soul . " Acuteness in the analysis of mental phenomena fequires an equal earnestness , though it is differently directed . We here find it necessary to cultivate the habit of withdrawing from all external objects , and fixing our attention on the revelations of our own consciousness . Few men can do this without long-continued and patient effort . With such effort , however , most men can attain to it . We must learn to look calmly and steadily upon a mental phenomenon . If there appear in it the slightest indications of complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the least shade of difference be cognizable in our consciousness ; or if on comparing two forms of thought , which seemed to us identical , there arises within us the intellectual feeling of dissimilarity , we must pause until we are thoroughly satisfied on the subjects of our inquiry . It is by listening to the first suggestion of a difference , that we learn to determine the character and relations of our mental phenomena . " If we would enlarge our power of generalization , I know of no better method than to study the generalizations of nature . Admirable lessons of this sort are found in the natural sciences , - chemistry ; physiology , geology , etc . No finer exercise for the power of generalization can be desired , than to take a single important chemical law , and trace out its operations on the vast and the minute throughout the kingdom of nature . Having become familiar with these wide-spreading classifications , we shall be the better able to pursue the generalizations of the subjective . We may then take an intellectual or moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limitations , fol -- low out its effects on the character of individual and social man . The li* , ht which will thus dawn on the mind will frequently astonish the student himself . Patient thought in this direction will furnish explanations of phenomena , and suggest rules of conduct , which wonld hardly reveal themselves to any other mode of investigation . " To improve the power of philosophical combination , we need , most // of all , to study the actual combinations of nature . The more familiar we become with them , the clearer xviii be the light shed upon the unknown . Much may also be learned from the lives of those who have been so fortunate as to extend the limits of human knowledge . By observing the manner in which they have labored , we may hope to be able to follow their example . " - pp. 199-201 . " If these remarks be true , they throw some light upon the subject of education . The power of forming conceptions which shall lead to discovery in science , or to the practicable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power be cultivated ? On this question there can be no doubt . It steadily increases with the progress of the human mind . We naturally inquire whether the cultivation of this element of intellectual character has been regarded with sufficient attention by those who form our courses of higher education . A large part of the studies which we pursue add very little to our power of forming conceptions of any character whatever . A larger infusion of the study of physical science , not merely as a collection of facts , but as a system of laws , with their relations and dependencies , would be of great value in this respect . We thus study the ideas and conceptions of the Creator . We become acquainted with his manner of accomplishing his purposes , and learn , in some measure , the style of the Author of all things . Surely , this habit of mind must be of unspeakable value to a philosopher in the discovery of truth , or to a man of affairs in devising his plans , since these can only succeed as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolence. " - pp. 385 , 386 . Doubt is expressed of the propriety of giving to mathematical studies the prominent place which they usually occupy in our systems of education . Although admirably fitted for the earlier stages of mental discipline , they are supposed not to be so well adapted to the highest ends of intellectual culture . " On the use of the mathematics for the purpose of intellectual cultivation , however , the highest authorities on the subject of education differ . Sir . W. Hamilton contends , with great power and exuberance of learning , that they are , of all intellectual pursuits , the least adapted to produce the effect so commonly ascribed to them . It must be admitted that they discuss the relations of nothing but quantity , and the simplest of these relations ; and that the matter of which they treat , and the mode in which they treat it , are entirely unlike those which must be employed in the affairs of life and the investigations of the other sciences . Whoever will read this very able discussion will at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptedness // of the mathematics to mental discipline requires a thorough reexamination . It is also a duty manifestly imposed upon teachers to consider this question with a mind unbiased by preconceived opinions , and observe carefully the effect of this study on the reasoning powers of their pupils . In all our institutions of learning we require that every candidate for a literary degree shall devote a considerable portion of his time to the mathematics , not for any practical purpose , but purely as a means of special intellectual culture . It surely can not be inappropriate to inquire whether it actually produces the anticipated results . " In the mathematics , our reasoning concerns nothing but the necessary relations of quantity , and therefore we arrive at absolute truth . A very small part of our practical reasoning is , however , of that character . We desire to have the truth , not concerning abstract conceptions , but concerning matters of fact , or that into which fact enters as a necessary element . Hence , were we to confine our reasoning to the mathematics , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general ratiocination . It has been frequently remarked , that persons who have addicted themselves exclusively to this science , have been singularly deficient in the reasoning power which is required in the several professions , and in the ordinary affairs of life . I have not perceived that original ability in young men was at all measured by proficiency in the mathematics . Men of decided talent generally succeed well in anything , and , of course , in abstract science . The general reasoning power is not more closely connected with special talent for mathematics , than with special talent for philology , philosophy , physics , or any other branch of learning . " - pp. 343 - 345 . Although Dr. Wayland has evidently perused with great care the philosophical writings of Sir William Hamilton , and loses no opportunity of testifying the profoundest admiration for his genius , we find in the present work fewer traces of the peculiar views of the latter than might have been expected . On both perception and original suggestion , as already stated , he has followed the safer guidance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any moment which he has adopted from Sir William is his classification of the qualities of bodies , according to their objective , subjective , or objectivosubjective character ; and for this we think he will not receive the thanks of his pupils . To the greater number , we apprehend , the generalizations embodied in this classification will prove a stumbling-block , while to not a few its discrimina // tions will , we fear , seem foolishness . Both are beyond the capacity of the ordinary college student . Although well fitted for understanding and appreciating each other , the American President and the Scottish Professor possess minds cast in different moulds and characterized by different tendencies . In the one the moral predominates over the intellectual ; in the other , the intellectual over the moral . The one seeks truth from a conviction of its inestimable value ; the other , rather for the pleasure of the excitement attending the pursuit . " Fruit " is the motto of the one ; " activity** and " life** are the watchwords of the other . Both have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great strength and vividness . Both hold their conceptions with a steadiness that never wavers . Both mark with unerring precision their contents . Both know equally well , how to draw from them their several momenta . If the philosophic perceptions of Sir William are more varied and profound , those of Dr.Wayland are instinct with a deeper and more living earnestness . If the discriminations of the former are sharper and more penetrating , those of the latter follow with a finer sense the natural divisions of thought . If the former deals in larger , bolder generalizations , the latter conducts us to truths of greater importance , - of more immediate and practical value . As might be expected , both are occupie ( l chiefly with principles . Both lay hold of them with a most vigorous grasp ; both apply them with a bold hand ; and both abide unshrinkingly by their consequences . The form , however , under which they most habitually contemplate general truths , and the direction in which their minds naturally move along them , is different . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete . For the one they have the most interest as collected in formuke ; for the other , as developed in facts . The one , taking an ordinary experience , seizes upon some contained truth , and , stripping it of its accessories , carries it up to the heights of an inaccessible generalization ; the other takes this same truth , endows it with a bodily form , and , throwing around it the drapery of circumstance , places it before the eyes of all . The one " raises a mortal to the skies " ; the other " draws an angel // down . " Hence the different spheres of intellectual action in which they habitually and appropriately move . Criticism and argumentation are the peculiar province of the one ; exposition and illustration , the chosen field of the other . The one discusses with pre-eminent ability the first truths lying at the foundations of intellectual philosophy ; the other , taking these truths as granted , builds upon them with rare felicity the superstructure of the science . The two works named at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast . The subjects of which they treat are not more , dissimilar than the mental tendencies and habits of their authors . The one is wary and cautious , avoiding as much as possible the problematical , and cleaving to that which is by universal consent true ; the other is bold and speculative , occupying chiefly a region which is by most regarded only as the land of dreams and shadows , haunted everywhere by the ghosts of departed theories and slain hypotheses . The intellectual philosopher carefully examines his ground , and draws with the utmost precision lines of demarcation between the known and the unknown , - between that which is proved and that which is only rendered probable . It is the former that principally fixes his attention and interests him most strongly . Mere speculation has comparatively slight charms for him . Theories , however beautiful , do not attract him . He loves terra firma and keeps ever on it . The solid ground rings under every step . If he approach at any time its borders , it is not to peer into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall serve as guides to those who may follow him . With a courage equal to that of Milton 's hero , and a spirit caught from the place whence he fell , the more adventurous physicist plants himself fearlessly on the shore of the unknown deep , and , with one Herculean effort throwing a bridge across the mighty void , opens a pathway to the sun , along which , in orderly procession , Nature 's forces are seen continually passing and repassing . And this is as it should be . Speculation in the metaphysics is not always a harmless amusement , as the wrecked faiths so thickly strewn along its path abundantly testify . In physics , it is not only safe , but in the highest degree useful . 15* // It both stimulates inquiry and furnishes suggestions for guiding it . It is the mother of observation and experience , whence the entire family of the physical sciences derive their lineage . If the theory developed by Mr. Allen shall prove to be only a more potent hypothesis , which like Aaron 's rod swallows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . It is over these hypotheses , assuming the semblance of realities and mistaken for them , that , from the time of Aristotle till now , science in its onward march has been continually stumbling . By setting aside the dogma of the four elements , Stahl did more for the advancement of chemistr.y than by all his direct labors . And it may be doubted whether Priestley by the dis covery of rendered service of greater value to the oxygen a science , than Lavoisier by overthrowing the phlogistic theory . Hypotheses , in the physical sciences , assist the mind in holding and retaining phenomena , and , when they are the prophetic suggestions of genius , furnish invaluable guides to investigation . It should be constantly remembered , however , that at best they are only suppositions which the next discovery may require to be laid aside . Facts more or less generalized constitute all that is permanent of these sciences . And these are permanent . The regulated succession of events in the natural world remains unchanged , whatever cause or causes we may suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , whether Stahl or Lavoisier be allowed to account for them . Experiments on light , electricity , and magnetism disclose the same laws , whether we look to Newton or Leibnitz , to Da Pay or Franklin , to Descartes or Amp*re , for their explanation . In the sciences , the ordinary rule in architecture is reversed . The facts support the substructure of hypotheses , and not the hypotheses the facts . The occurrence of physical events in an unvarying relation of antecedent and consequent is a truth independent of all theories , resting upon the sure basis of observation and induction . The machine-like regularity with which the procession of nature moves forward , the unbroken order of phenomena observed through all its realm , the exact conformity to rule at each step of its progress , is the great , the outstanding fact in aid of whose explanation all theories and all hypothe // ses have been invented . Law , universal , persistent , withd*ut variableness or shadow of turning , regulating and determining all changes , but remaining itself for ever the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unalterable law , is the majestic and solemn idea unceasingly impressed upon the student of nature , whether in the laboratory he watch the play of affinities between invisible atoms , or in the fields of space trace the planetary bodies in their paths round the sun ; whether he observe the ceaseless and ever-varying evolution of phenomena in the world around him , or recall from the graves of the buried past the marvellous events of which the earth has been the theatre . It is this omnipotent and omnipresent law , which , throwing its mighty chain around each one of the innumerable suns blazing in the far-off depths of ether , and at the same time including in its golden links the minutest particles of matter , binds the several parts of the universe into one stupendous whole , - it is this all-embracing law , that the physical sciences investigate ; just in proportion as they disclose section after section of its vast ramifications , do they make real and permanent advances ; and just in proportion asthe hay and stubble of hypothesis are wrought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire of true criticism shall try their works , or when the light of further discovery shall reveal them . As the human mind has ever been prone to connect with observed phenomena certain explanatory suppositions , and as these suppositions have necessarily been modified from time to time , to meet demands made upon them by the disclosure of new facts , the mere general observer of the course of the sciences is not unfrequently led to look with distrust upon their teachings . The fixed and the variable , the merely hypothetical and the demonstrably true , are confounded , and together involved in common doubt . Light and slight notions of law itself are engendered . It is looked upon as in some sort factitious and conventional ; or if its real character be recognized , it is regarded rather as a certain phase of events turned towards us , than as the mode of the Divine action ; as existing V*Tith reference to man and for his benefit , rather than as having its seat in the bosom of God ; as a regulative prin // ciple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-varying requirements of human interests , rather than as a direct efflux from Him who changeth not , - who is the same yesterday , to-day , and for ever . In order to separate , therefore , from the pure element of law every extraneous ingredient , it may be well to recall several of the principal hypotheses which have been formed to account for the orderly succession of events in the outward world , - some one of which we suppose to be associated in the minds of most persons with the phenomenon . They may be divided into two classes , according as they do or do not suppose the intervention of material agencies . I. The first class includes two varieties . 1 . The first of these varieties supposes the elementary forms of matter to be eternal , and limits the exertion of the Divine power to educing from an original chaos the present order and harmony of the universe . This , although a favorite hypothesis among the ancients , and not without its advocates in modern times , is generally believed to be excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . The second variety supposes matter to have been created as well as organized by God . It divides itself into two subordinate varieties , according as matter is believed to be endowed with inherent powers , or only to be fitted for receiving forces from without . The first of these sub-varieties presents two aspects , according as the inherent powers of matter are supposed to be self-sustained ; or to be dependent upon the unceasing exertion of the Divine will , directed , either generally to the material masses , or specifically to the individual atoms composing them . The former is the supposition usually adopted by natural philosophers , while the latter is commonly preferred by theologians . The second of these sub-varieties presents also two aspects , according as the forces affecting matter are supposed to be directly impressed upon it by an unremitting exertion of the Divine power , or to come from an impulse originally imparted to it when cast from the hand of the Creator . The latter is the theory unfolded , as we have seen , by Mr. Allen , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second Class of hypotheses , dispensing with matter altogether , includes likewise two varieties , - one emerging still in realism and the other in idealism . 1 . The first variety , which admits the reality of outward and local developments of force , but denies their dependence upon material causes , includes two subordinate varieties ; one monotheistic , and the other pantheistic . The monotheistic sub-variety refers the displays of force usually ascribed to matter , to immediate , lobal , and voluntary exertions of the power of the Deity . These exertions are supposed to be so directed , timed , and measured as to evolve the phenomena of the outward world . The pantheistic sub-variety , rejecting the separate existence and proper personality of the Deity , supposes the so-called powers of matter to be inherent in the Divine substance , which is conceived not only as coextensive with the universe , but as actually constituting it . 2 . The second variety contained in this class , which transfers the supposed phenomena of an outward world to the mind of the percipient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the phenomena are conceived to be evolved . According to the first of these sub-varieties , the states of mind mistaken for perception are produced by the immediate agency of the Deity ; according to the second , they are spontaneously evolved through the laws of the mental organism . Both of these forms of idealism , - the theistic and the egoistic , - although reckoning among their advocates names of the highest distinction in philosophy , are now generally admitted to be at variance with the deliverances of consciousness in sensible perception . Such are some of the hypotheses by which the human mind has endeavored to account to itself for the regulated and orderly succession of events in the natural world . That adopted by Mr. Allen , and for the first time , so far as we know , articulately presented in his work , unites in the highest degree the attributes of simplicity and grandeur , and , if adequate and consistent with itself , * - of neither of which are we quite cer * We are inclined to think that the universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he found , on a careful analysis , to suppose properties discarded hy it as incompatihle with the nature of material existences . We // tam , - is to be preferred over all others . Next to it in simplicity and grandeur is the one commonly adopted , as we have said , by naturalists . This readily yields all the explanations demanded of it , and at the same time involves no contradictions . Two objections , however , have been urged against it , with greater or less force . In the first place , it is said that the supposition of inherent forces in matter is contrary to our conceptions of its nature . The natural reply to this would seem to be , Why not alter our conceptions of its nature ? As we have no knowledge of matter in itself , as we learn its existence only through the powers manifested by it , why not modify our conceptions of it so as to include these powers ? Again , it is said , that , if we concede to matter the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertion of the Divine will , - that the origination of independent existences , whether material or spiritual , with endowments self-sustained , is beyond the reach of creative power . On this point we do not see how it is possible to affirm or deny . Our ignorance of the whole matter is too absolute to justify even an opinion in reference to it . The subject is placed , as we think , in its true light by Dr. Wayland , in the following passage from the chapter on Original Suggestion . " If there be a universal , all-pervading Cause , what is the nature of his agency ? In material causation , is he the sole operator in every change , so that every event is an immediate act of the Deity , or the result of such an act ? Or , on the other hand , has he constituted matter with such attributes and relations that all which we see is the necessary consequence of the original creation , from which the Creator has withdrawn , and over which he now exerts no agency ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise . Does the free-will of man act independently of any controlling agency of the Deity , or is the Deity the cause of spiritual change , as in the first supposition above in regard to matter ? Or has he so created spirits that the changes of which we are conscious proceed by necessity from the elements of our original creation ? These questions , and many more , arise from the conception of an universal , all-pervading , and all-powerful Cause . " With respect to these inquiries , I would remark , in general , that I would speak with diffidence , however , as we are not sure that we have arrived at the exact conception of the author on this point . // believe the most opposite answers to either of them can probably be proved to be true , by arguments which it would be difficult to confute ; and that the clearest reasoning may lead us to results at variance with the simplest dictates of our moral and intellectual nature . To what conclusion , then , shall we arrive ? I answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of our understanding . The point in which the infinite and the finite come in contact has been , and must ever be , hidden from mortal eyes . " - pp. 167 , 168 . But we have recalled these different hypotheses , not for the purpose of subjecting them to the ordeal of criticism , or of pointing out reasons why one should be preferred rather than another , but to mark them all alike as hypotheses and nothing more , - to place the badge of their tribe upon them , in order that , if they at any time appear in our logical processes , we may recognize their true character . No argument can be built upon them . No inference , theological , philosophical , or practical , can be drawn from them . It is the great fact which they endeavor to explain , - the fact of an external world continually changing , never for two successive moments remaining the same , but in all its changes governed by invariable laws and ministering through them constantly to beneficent ends , - it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our reasonings ; and just in proportion as we exclude every hypothetical element will be the reliableness of the conclusions derived from it . But is the persistence of the laws governing external nature established on a sufficiently sure foundation to render it a safe ground of argument ? Are we not here making an assumption that may vitiate the results of our logical processes ? Although within the sphere of observation these laws continue unchanged , without that sphere may they not be subject to alteration or suspension ? Although events in the natural world follow one another in an unbroken line of antecedents and consequents so far as the eye can trace them , beyond that limit may we not suppose a higher power at times to intervene and change the order of their succession ? This ground has recently been taken by one whose opinions on questions // in physical science have deservedly great weight . " It requires but a few years ' experience in this world , " it is said , " to satisfy any observing mind , that natural operations are carried on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same circumstances are invariably followed by the same effects . We call this uniformity of operation the course of nature ; and the invariable connection between antecedent and consequent , we call the laws of nature . If we should see any new force coming in to disturb this settled order , we should call it a miracle . It might do this by a direct counteraction of nature 's laws ; and this is the common idea of a miracle . But if an unwonted force were added to those laws , the result would be a miracle ; and so would a diminution or suspension of these actions ; for in either case the effect would be out of the ordinary course of nature , and this we take to be the essential idea in a miracle . Perhaps the best and briefest definition of a miracle is , an event that can not be explained by the laws of nature . " If , however , the new force interposed do not come into view , if it only modify the observed course of events by affecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " then , it is said , there is no miracle , because there is no visible departure from the ordinary laws of nature , but all that is seen receives explanation from them . As interpositions of force thus circumstanced could never be known to us , so the absence of any indication of them affords no presumption against their actual occurrence . On the contrary , we are at liberty , it is maintained by this eminent philosopher , to suppose such interpositions , and to refer to them more or fewer of the changes transpiring in the world around us . Although the conversion of water into vapor without the supply of a certain quantity of caloric would , beneath the eye of the natural philosopher , be a miracle , taking place in mid-ocean , away from human observation , it would lose its miraculous character , and may , without violation of any of the rules of philosophizing , be supposed to occur . Although air in its expansions and contractions by change of temperature obey the most precise la*ys , so long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to do so when , escaping from him , it finds its way into the depths of the atmos // phere , where no mortal eye can follow it . There the winds may arise and take their course , wholly independent of these laws . Or if , instead of the ponderable , we would make the imponderable fluids the theatre of these interpositions , we may suppose the solar beams , when watched by no observer , to develop light and heat with unequal and varying degrees of intensity . But why suppose deviation at all ? Why limit the persistence of law to the narrow sphere of actual observation ? Why not suppose the elements to act in the same manner , whether in sight or out of sight ? Why not suppose Nature uniform and constant in her operations , seeing that whenever observed she is found to be so ? As all the facts are confessedly - nay , by a fundamental requirement of the theory - explainable on that supposition , why not so explain them ? Why introduce an unknown and purely hypothetical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes universally recognized and in actual and visible operation ? Does not the rule of parsimony forbid it ? But admitting this obvious principle in philosophizing , we can not know , it may be said , that such deviations do not in fact take place , as it is an express condition of their supposed occurrence that it be " out of sight . " We freely grant the impossibility of knowledge in reference to events under this category . But there may nevertheless be the best grounds for belief . The domain of demonstrative evidence is quite restricted . The number of truths absolutely known is comparatively small . The perceptions of sense , the intuitions of reason , and the deductions made from these , constitute the entire sum of human knowledge , in the stronger and technical sense of the term . All the great truths which either supply the conditions of our moral life , or furnish guides for its conduct , rest upon probable evidence . They are received by the mind on the ground of faith , and not of knowledge . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as perfect as the assurance of knowledge . The conviction of certainty may in either case be limited only by the finite capabilities of the soul . We do not know that to-morrow 's sun will rise , but do we on this account doubt it ? No man knows // that he was born , or that he will die ; but of what two truths has he a stronger conviction ? The recurrence of the seasons in their appointed order is expected with a confidence which knowledge could not increase . Any alteration of gravity , or the cessation in nature even for a single moment of this great force , is as little apprehended as the annihilation of time or space . The lecturer on chemical science proceeds to demonstrate the properties of oxygen or hydrogen or carbon , with as perfect assurance of finding them unchanged , as the mathernatician those of the cube , square , or triangle . In all of these cases , however , the evidence is purely inductive , and the state of mind produced by it is only what in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief attended by a confidence as absolute and entire as could be inspired by the most perfect knowledge . Now it is upon this same probable evidence , yet more cumulative , that we rest the persistence of physical laws . The induction here takes in the entire circle of the natural sciences . Every new discovery in them has only added to the weight of evidence , and caused to be repeated anew words already echoed and re-echoed through every part of the universe , - law , - invariable , persistent law . It is in exchange for a truth thus supported , resting upon an induction thus broad and exceptionless , that we are offered a mere supposition , without a shadow of support from fact or analogy , incapable of direct refutation indeed , because beyond the sphere of possible knowledge . The author of this hypothesis , whose labors for the enlargement of human knowledge in more than one of its branches have been so honorable to himself and his country , proposes it , we ought to say , for the purpose of relieving certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , himself feel . So far from it , he expressly declares the belief that , when experienced , they arise from limited views of the IDivine character and government . He further distinctly concedes , that all the known facts are equally explained , and that all the requirements of religion and of its miraculous history are equally answered by the supposition of the uniform operation of natural laws . After these admis // sions , we can hardly imagine why he should have placed , as he has done , the two suppositions in equipoise , unless it were from the laudable desire to save from offence some weaker brother . There is a beautiful science , which , though but lately exhumed , now stands under the open sky , in the full light of day , disclosing foundations as solid , and rising in a superstructure as massive and as well proportioned , as its sister of the skies . All the natural sciences are represented in it . Some have furnished the cement for binding together its compact masonry , while others support and buttress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble structure is inscribed a name which every lover of American science reads with emotions of joy and pride . On the application , however , of the principle admitted by the distinguished naturalist , this proud monument to his fame , this stately edifice , in raising which so many strong hands have labored , sinks , as by the waving of a magician 's wand , into the earth whence it rose . All that geology discloses of the past rests upon inductive evidence . Its alleged events occurred before man was placed upon the earth , and can be gathered only from memorials left in its rocky strata . Granite and graywacke , the shells of mollusks and the scales of fishes , trilobites and coprolites , bird tracks and saurian tracks , teeth and toe bones , are the interesting characters in which those memorials are written . Their interpretation , in every instance , proceeds upon the supposition of the stability , the constancy , the persistence of natural laws . Refuse to grant this postulate , and interpretation becomes impossible . Deny this inductive truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a few disconnected and unmeaning facts . If Nature is to be trusted only so long as our eye is upon her , we must abandon all inquiries into the past . If beyond the sphere of observation the laws governing her operations may be modified , or suspended , or events may take place independently of them , what ground have we for a single geological inference ? Why suppose the beds of bituminous and anthracite coal to be of vegetable origin ? Why imagine that these vast bodies of solid carbon were once floating in the atmosphere , and // that they were gradually withdrawn from it by the leaves of plants ? It is far more simple to suppose the carbon created just as we find it . Why dream of long ages of fishes and reptiles and mammals anterior to the appearance of man on the earth ? Why suppose myriads of centuries to have been occupied in preparing a suitable abode for him who was to be lord of the terrestrial creation ? But if the inductive principle be so rigorously carried out , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not they fall before it ? We answer , No ! a thousand times , no . It is this very persistence of law that makes a miracle when properly attested so impressive , and gives to the moral truths promulgated in connection with it their awful sanction . It should be remembered that it is not against facts testified to by competent witnesses , and known of all men , that we are pressing inductive inferences ; but against mere suppositions , - suppositions , too , explaining nothing , and confessedly explaining nothing , - suppositions , moreover , studiously placed beyond the sphere of observation , where direct investigation is impossible , and where nothing but induction can reach them . But is not the presumption from experience , it may be further asked , equally strong against interpositions in the moral world ? Do we not find the changes of mind , as well as those of matter , following one another in a definite and fixed order ? Are not the indications of law , invariable and persistent , as marked in the one as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of a contemporary journal , in which it is not difficult to recognize the graceful pen of its gifted editor , * the opinion is expressed , that on inductive grounds no distinction can be made between the two classes of phenomena . The question is regarded as " one of pure revelation . " In neither case should we be at liberty to suppose interpositions unless the doctrine were directly taught in the Scriptures ; while if so taught , the difficulties lying in its path are supposed to be no greater in one case than in the other . " The Scriptures assure us , that God operates on the soul of man by direct and supernatural interpositions of his power . " " Unless it had // been revealed that God interposes in the sphere of mind , we should have been obliged to trust to the entire uniformity of all mental laws , and to withhold our faith from the theory of his spiritual interpositions . So unless it be revealed that God interposes in supernaturally counteracting some of the laws of matter , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must withhold our assent from the theory of his physical interpositions . " We have no evidence , it is thought , of either closer or more constant relationship in the succession of material , than in the succession of spiritual phenomena . " Are not the operations of mind as regular as those of matter ? May we not as easily explain the laws which lead to every particular volition , as the laws which lead to every particular rising of a wave , or every particular gust of wind ? This accomplished theologian and scholar , whose love of truth , superior to all narrow prejudice , is equalled only by his rare powers of apprehending and unfolding it , would seem to overlook the important fact , that the winds and the waves are not the only theatre upon which the elements exhibit themselves . Were this so , we grant that the two cases would be parallel . But this same air and water which , subjected , on the uneven surface of the earth , to the conflicting impulses of gravity and solar heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on so varied and apparently so capricious movements , are found , when placed in circumstances admitting an exact measurement of the forces applied to them , to obey as precise laws as the planets in their revolutions about the sun . Gravity also , and the repulsive power of heat , when made , in like manner , the subjects of exact experiment , are found to be governed by invariable laws , which the language of mathematics alone can express with adequate precision . The same is equally true of all the elements , and of all the known forces acting upon them . The conditions under which they are placed being given , - and these , let it be remembered , are physical conditions , addressing the senses and capable of being accurately determined ,  --  the conditions under which they are placed being given , we can foretell their behavior with as perfect exactitude and certainty as the 16 // astronomer predicts an eclipse or a transit . The inference , therefore , that the elements , in evolving the changes of the outward world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumption , no mere analogical evidence . In making it , we are simply reasoning from oxygen in the laboratory to oxygen in nature ; from carbon in the laboratory to carbon in nature ; from gravity in the apple of Newton to gravity in the solar system . That there is nothing parallel to this , nothing in any way approaching or resembling it , in the case of mind , we hardly need say . No man can tell beforehand how his most familiar acquaintance will act in any given circumstances . No man can tell how he himself may act twenty-four hours hence under given circumstances . We do not say that the mental phenomena may not succeed one another in an unbroken line of antecedents and consequents . We only say that there is no proof , as in the analogous case of matter , that such is the fact . Even if the laws which determine human conduct were as fixed as those of material action , we could not from the nature of the case know it . The motives leading to action spring from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - sources without and sources within , - from character , itself the result of unnumbered antecedent influences , - from mood and from circumstance , - that we caiinot be sure in any single instance that we recognize all the conditions of conduct . Among the unrecognized conditions may be an influence divinely interposed . We do not say that interposition is indicated by the observed facts ; but we do say that the observed facts leave room for this supposition . No inference can be inductively drawn from them at variance with it . Were there any subtile chemistry by which the soul could be resolved into component powers or faculties , and each of these be shown to obey , under all conditions , precise and definite laws , then might spiritual and material phenomena be placed in the same category in respect to interpositions . But until the means of such analysis and such demonstration shall be discovered , it is unphilosophical to confound them . That the laws of mind are far more latent , if not less certain , than those of matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of knowledge in respect to them . The former were as well understood in the times of Plato and Demosthenes as they are at the present day . Not so the latter . Eloquence and the fine arts , founded upon a knowledge of the laws of mind , were in as advanced a state then as they are now . Not so the useful arts dependent upon a knowledge of the laws of matter . While the mysteries of external nature have been gradually , and for the last two or three centuries rapidly , clearing up , the same veil still rests upon the operations of mind . " The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth , " is now as apt a simile for illustrating spiritual phenomena , as it was when employed by omniscient wisdom nearly two thousand years ago . The doctrine of physical interpositions , if taught in the Sacred Scriptures , would undoubtedly be sufficient to overbear the evidence from induction of the uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evidence is overborne by testimony in the case of miracles . But placing the question on that ground , we should be entitled to claim that the teaching be clear and explicit in proportion to the difficulties attending the doefrmne . Forms of expression authorizing a belief in spiritual interpositions might be deemed insufficient here ; just as stronger proof is required to establish a miracle than to establish a fact not known to be out of the ordinary course of nature . We are not quite certain that the acute metaphysician to whose opinions we have referred , from whom it is not often wise , and with whom it is never safe to differ , had in view , when expressing them , the distinction between matter and mind here indicated . There may possibly have been present to his thought another and very different distinction , which some have endeavored to establish on a priori grounds . Causation in the two , it is said , is different . While in matter it is necessary and consequently fixed , in the mind it is free , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same conditions , always act in the same way , this is not true of mind . Although two atoms of hydrogen or of carbon must in like circumstances act in like manner , two // spiritual essences in every way precisely alike , and placed in precisely similar circumstances , may act differently . That regular connection between antecedent and consequent , which obtains so uniformly in the natural world , not holding , with the same constancy at least , in the moral , interpositions , it is said , which occurring in the former would be miraculous , may take place in the latter without the disturbance of any law . If it was this supposed difference in nature between material and spiritual causation that the learned Professor had in mind when penning the sentences above quoted , we agree with him that the distinction can hardly be maintained . The principle of causality , considered as an intellectual intuition , is wholly independent of experience . It knows neither matter nor mind as such . It affirms universally that every substance , every essence , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same manner , under the same circumstances . It affirms universally , we say , or it affirms not at all . But the position which we have sought to make good is so unlike this , that we should have deemed reference to it unnecessary , had we not known the two views to be confounded . That recognizes fully the metaphysical principle of causality ; this violates it . That supposes the mind in its ordinary operations to be governed by law as uniformly and strictly as matter ; this affirms a radical difference , in respect to regularity and constancy of action , between them . That asserts , that , as the conditions of spiritual causation are always to a greater or less extent hidden from view , and are never all known to us , so we can never be certain that a Divine influence specially interposed is not one of them , - we can by no form of experiment exclude in a single instance such a supposition . This declares , that as the will of a free spirit is independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the antecedents to volition , it would still be impossible to exclude in any the supposition of special Divine interposition . If the Supreme Ruler of the universe see fit to interpose and change the course of events in the moral world , why should he not , it is sometimes asked , do the same in the // natural world ? " If the welfare of man is sufficiently important to justify his direct mental influence , why is not the same welfare important enough to justify his direct physical influence ? " Is the setting aside of a material law more difficult to omnipotence , than the suspension of a spiritual ? - In reply to this , we would in the first place say , that , for reasons already stated , we are bound to proceed on the supposition of the uniform and constant operation of natural laws , until we have evidence to the contrary . The burden of proof clearly lies upon those who assert the opposite doctrine . In the second place , we would submit that in no case are we entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say mode , not ends - by what seems to us fit or proper , or by what we deem to be easy to a being of unlimited power . All suppositions resting upon such a basis should be at once and for ever banished from our reasonings on this subject . We have here no a priori knowledge , no intuitions , no moral instincts , enabling us to form judgments independently of experience . What is the mode of the Divine government ? is the only proper question to ask , the only question , in truth , which the human mind can ask . Having arrived at an answer more or less satisfactory from the various sources of knowledge open to us , we may then seek to discover the reasons which led Infinite Wisdom and Goodness to adopt the actual mode of government , - or , in other words , to find in that mode illustrations and proofs of these Divine attributes . The natural history of the lower orders of the animal creation throws light upon the manner in which it has pleased the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of its departments . Every species of animal , as naturalists inform us , has its habitat , or place of residence , from which it never voluntarily wanders . Within the limits of this habitat , each individual of the species finds itself holding the most definite and precise relations to the surrounding elements . Upon these relations is the continuance of its life dependent . Nay , its organic and physical life is made up of a continued series of actions and reactions taking place between it and the surrounding elements , through these relations . // Now there are two ways in which we may conceive these necessary relations to be established . We may suppose the individual animal to be stationary and passive , and the elements , forsaking their accustomed modes of action , to bend in unceasing ministry to it ; or we may suppose the animal to be endowed with appropriate organs , senses , and instincts , and the relations essential to life to be in this way established and maintained . The latter is the plan which the Divine wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the innumerable beings which people our globe , there is embodied an assemblage of provisions organic and spiritual , precisely adapting it to the physical conditions under which it exists , andrendering these conditions as unceasingly tributary to its welfare as if their ministrations were direct and personal . The different forms of locomotive apparatus - all holding relation to gravity as the force to be overcome by them - with which the inhabitants of air , earth , and water are supplied , would alone furnish study for a lifetime . Equally varied are the organs of the internal or vegetative life , all of which still have relation more or less immediate to great and permanent laws . The instincts and appetites which always accompany these structural endowments , as necessary for securing the ends proposed in them , present a corresponding variety of character throughout the whole animal world . All of these innumerable and endlessly diversified provisions , instinctive as well as structural , are incessantly ministering to individual safety and enjoyment . They are so many special providences , designed each for the good of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of his government , therefore , we perceive that the Supreme Being has seen fit to provide for the welfare of the individual by placing it , through appropriate organs and instincts , in such relations to the great laws of nature - his general providences - that these may be immediately tributary to its happy existence , without departure from a stern and unbending constancy . If we turn to that natural government under which man is placed , as a mere inhabitant of this world , we find that the same plan has been adopted . The only difference is , that // intelligence here supplies the more certain , though at the same time the more limited , guidance of instinct . Through this and his more generalized bodily structure , he is brought into relations to external nature - every one of which becomes a channel of benefits - incomparably more numerous and diversified than any of the lower animals . Air , earth , and ocean minister alike to his sustenance and enjoyment . And in proportion as he advances in knowledge , becomes acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places himself in the proper relations to them , is the range of his activities and enjoyments widened . To civilized and educated man , - to man possessing the resources of science and the mechanic arts , - every thing in nature pays tribute . The elements themselves , within their prescribed spheres of action , vie with one another in doing him service . But man is not simply an inhabitant of this world . He is in process of training for another . Besides ministering to his mere physical well-being , the circumstances in which he is placed are designed to be the means of spiritual culture . To fit him for this higher , educational government which is extended over him , in addition to an intellectual , there have been conferred upon him the endowments of a moral and religious nature . Under the guidance and through the influence of these , he may receive benefit - the fact of the reception , however , depending as before upon himself - from every possible occurrence in life . Events in themselves disastrous , which no human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no human power could have averted , may still subserve the purposes of important and needed discipline . If , however , these provisions connected with man 's spiritual nature should , from any cause , fail to secure to him all the intended benefits of his present disciplinary state , and it should please the Divine wisdom and goodness to make some new and further provision , of what nature should we expect it to be ? Judging from what we have thus far observed , would the remedy probably be external or internal ? The question has been answered . Christianity has been given to strengthen by new motives , and enforce by higher sanctions , man 's // moral and religious sentiments , while his external relations , except so far as created by himself , have remained unaltered . If in addition to all these provisions , in order fully to secure the ends proposed in them , direct and special interposition should prove necessary , of what character , reasoning still from the observed plan of the Divine government , might we expect these to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for changes without ? or for superadded guidance and strength within ? The latter undoubtedly . To this all analogy points . By this all the ends of interposition , whether protective or disciplinary , are equally accomplished . For this the investigations of science leave room , without supposing any known law violated . And above all , and more than all , this is directly taught in the Sacred Scriptures . On the other hand , the supposition of an adjustment of the relations of the individual to the outward world by external interpositions , is opposed by inductive evidence as strong as that which causes us to look for the rising of to-morrow 's sun , or to expect our own decease ; it is contrary to all that we know of the Divine government , and is , moreover , without support , as will generally be admitted , from the teachings of Scripture . In these circumstances , is it philosophical to hold it ? Ought it to be retained , merely because it is impossible to disprove it , - impossible to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between " some of the links of causation out of sight , " physical interpositions do not occur ? On such a ground , should the inductive teachings of all science and of the whole of human experience , as well as the strongest and most direct analogies , be set aside ? But we will not , we need not , pursue the subject further. * Having learned , we have said , from the various sources of knowledge open to us , the actual mode of the Divine government , we may reverently and without rebuke seek for the reasons which determined its adoption . The inquiry in its whole extent we suppose to lie beyond the compass of the human intelligence . To the question , why God works by means and instruments , or if not by means nud instruments , yet in conformity to modes and rules , equally limiting the manifestations of his energy , - why he makes the welfare of his creatures dependent upon their own exertions and upon external agencies , instead of bestowing directly the good which his benevolence has designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other answer can be given , than that such is his sovereign pleasure . But this fundamental fact being recognized , it is not difficult to see why the arrangements of his providence should // Having separated from the simple fact of law the diffi*rent forms of hypothesis that have been connected with it , and having determined , as far as possible , its length and breadth and constancy , it was our intention to inquire what consequences , theological , philosophical , and practical , legitimately flow from it . We designed more particularly to show that the supposition of the uniform and undisturbed operation of natural laws touches only the mode of God 's government , and not the government itself , or our relations to him under it . So far as we are concerned , it is wholly immaterial whether he bestows upon us a particular good , through some change in the course of outward events , or by so placing us and disposing our spirits that we may receive the intended benefit without external interposition . The obligation to gratitude and love , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety and duty of looking to him for desired blessings , continue precisely the same on either supposition . We purposed also to inquire how far , and in what circumstances , we may be authorized to ascribe to specific designs events occurring in the ordinary course of nature . Were these eyents isolated and independent in their origin , and did their influence extend only to the individual or individuals directly and principally affected by them , then we should in every instance be justified in assigning a personal interpretation . But standing as they do , in immediate relation to the laws under which they have arisen , and connected indirectly , it may be , with numerous other and perhaps higher ends provided for under those laws , the problem of the Divine purpose in any particular event becomes more embarrassed , and its be as they are . This primary inquiry being disposed of , the only remaining ques tion is a very simple one . It is in truth merely this : whether in the accomplishment of his purposes the general shall head to the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the particular be conformed to the general ; - whether the laws of external nature shalL accommodate themselves to the exigencies of the individual ; or the exigencies of the individual be provided for in conformity to the laws of external nature ; - whether , on the approach of winter , the " unforgotten , " still " cared for " sparrow , impelled by an unerring instinct , shall wing its way to a Southern home ; or a Southern home be brought to the sparrow ; - whether the pious invalid , whose life is precious in the sight of his Heavenly Father , shall he guided by an invisible hand to some friendly shelter ; or the cloud , laden with watery treasures , be turned from district in perishing need of them . // solution is attended with greater difficulty . As subsidiary to this inquiry , we intended to examine generally the doctrine of final causes , - to see whether teleology be in fact a possible science , or whether , like etiology , the supposed science of efficient causes , it occupies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human mind be not , like the fabled Antams , bereft of its strength when off the solid ground of facts . And if it should prove on examination , as we believe it would , that there are in man 's spiritual nature , and in the constitution of the outward world , real foundations for the science , we proposed to seek for certain principles which might serve as guides in interpreting its phenomena . But we have already extended our discussions so far , that we must leave these inquiries for the present . We may possibly return to them hereafter .
