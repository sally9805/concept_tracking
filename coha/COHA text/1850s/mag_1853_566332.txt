THE noise of this " New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though at some distance from its arena , and has induced us to attempt an acquaintance with its merits . We have not had the privilege of reading the three publications to which the third of the volumes ( " New Themes Condemned " ) is in part an answer , viz , " Some notice of A Review by a Layman ' " " Hints to a Layman , " and " Charity and the Clergy . " But we have carefully read and digested the three volumes whose title pages are quoted above ; and these give us the substance of the discussion . The first of these volumes , " New Themes for the Protestant Clergy , " which has originated this warm controversy , has great merits and great demerits . Its merits are that it declares and earnestly calls public attention to serious defects in our modern Christianity-not in Christianity as it is in the Bible , especially as it is in the life and teachings of Christ , ( for this the author expresses and evidently feels great reverence and affection : he deems it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all modern Christian churches or denominations , viz , the comparative neglect of the great law of Christian charity , or love , particularly of the " new commandment " gi yen by Christ // to his disciples , " Love one another , as I have loved you , " and of the " second great commandment , " " Love thy neighbor as thyself ; " the disproportionate attention which is paid to faith as compared with practice , to scriptural doctrine or orthodoxy as compared with the scriptural precepts , especially the precepts of Christ and their illustration in his exanple ; and above all the very limited and inadequate obedience to the precepts and imitation of the example of Christ in the obvious work and duty of removing or mitigating the poverty and miseries of men in this world . To call public attention to these defects in the religion of these times is a great merit , for which we cordially thank the author of New Themes . For " these things are so . " These alleged defects are real . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it requires much courage and self-denial to declare these defects boldly and audibly in the face of the proud and self-gratulating Christianity of these days . It is another merit of the work that it calls the attention of its readers to the discussions which are extant upon many important topics , particularly those connected with charity to the poor , and the prevention and relief of human misery . This is best done in the Notes ; which constitute the larger part of the matter , though being in fine print they do not occupy the larger part of the pages , of the book . Indeed , we regard the Notes as the most valuable portion of the work . They evince an extensive reading on the topics which are treated , and call the attention of the reader to a wide range of authors and to many able discussions . They express , also , with much that needs abatement and qualification , much that is just and valuable in sentiment . And this may be truly said of the work itself . We agree heartily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory of Malthus on Population , and of those who have accorded with it . After speaking of " the English feeling in regard to the poor , " it would have been more just to have said the feeling of many in England with regard to the poor , he says : " It was reserved for a clergyman of the established church to work up this feeling and these views into a system of philosophy . The sum of the Rev. Mr. Maithus 's work on population is thus given in his own words : - A man who is horn into a world already possessed , if he can not get subsistence from his parents , on whom he has a just demand , and if the society does not want his labor , has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food , and , in fact , has no business to be where he is . At nature 's mighty feast there is no cover for him . She tells him to be gone , and will quickly execote her own orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her guests . If these guests get up and make room for him , other intruders immediately appear , demanding the same favor . The report of a provision for all that come fills the hall with numerous claimants . The order and harmony // of the feast is disturbed : the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity : and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery and dependence in every part of the hail , and by the clamorous importunity of those who are justly enraged at not finding the provision they had been taught to expect . The guests learn too late their error in counteracting those strict orders to all intruders issued by the great mistress of the feast , who , wishing that all her guests should have plenty , and knowing that she could not provide for unlimited numbers , humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full . ' " Can inhumanity go a step farther ? Can disobedience and contempt of the Divine command to love our neighbor as ourself imagine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man , ' and consequently a total abjuration of Christianity . The remedial measure proposed by the Rev. Mi . Maithus is in strict accordance with his theory . He proposes that , notice being given , all children begotten afterwards should in every event be denied all official and private relief , or charity of any kind . If they perish , the responsibility will rest with the parents who brought them into the world after due warning of the consequences . By this means , the intruders into the hall of the great feast of life would be rapidly starve ( l out of existence , the order and harmony of the feast restored , and the happiness of the guests be no longer destroyed by the spectacle of misery ' around them-pp. 150-53 . This is good . It meets our cordial approbation . We have ever regardedthis theory , a theory made to be applied to the poor , as among the most cold-blooded , heartless , unbrotherly and ungodly of human speculations . And it has been a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Dr. Chalmers , could regard it with any degree of approbation . We will quote an instance of the manner in which this author treats the subject of " Socialism . " After giving some historical account of those who are included in this term , he says : " They received , finally , the name of socialists , a term intended to convey a characteristic of the whole . Properly explained , it is sufficiently significant - they are a body of men who deem themselves injured ; they point to the causes of their sufferings in the church and state , and demaiid a remedy ; they insist that society is bouiid to ameiid their social position . They insist that no institutions can be wise or just which encourage or permit oppression - which fail of giving fair scope to industry and knowledge-which do not , as far as practicable , secure to labor its proper reward , and to kiiowledge and enterprise an open field and due defense . It is true that those upon whom these doctrines have brought the epithet of socialists , have run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , perhaps , into absurd and crazy conceptions . But the mistakes of some , or all , by no means set aside or nullify the irrefutable truths they have announced . It is sheer nonsense to attempt to crush these truths by the cry of socialism : it is worse than nonsense not to know and appreciate truths which have already spread far and wide beyoiid the ranks of the socialists . * * * * * * * While we lament that the socialists have injured their cause by indulging in vagaries at once absurd and wicked , we lament still more that those who assume to kiiow so much better-those who do know better-those who have read the benign injunctions of Christ-should have so far erred in life and teaching as not to have exhibited to the socialists a living exemplification of that kindness , that mercy , that charity , that justice , that equality , that brotherhood for which they sigh . Can any one doubt that such examples would attract the eyes and the adniiration of all the socialists and well-wishers of humanity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example would correct the theories and repress and set right the erroneous speculations , now on all sides so rife , in r*gard to social progress ? // Such an argument would go farther to reclaim the socialists who are opposed to religion , than all the works on theology exh nt . It does not meet the objections which they offer , when the Catholic priesthood say to them that they must not oppose the authority of the church , that the church will take care of them , that she will make up in alms what may be wanting for their sustenance from the avails of industry . Nor is the case ma ( le better when they are told by Protestants that their position is the on* assigned them in the order of Providence , which can not be changed nor resisted without fatal consequences ; that their misery and sufferings are the natural results of that depravity inherent in our nature and inherited from our first parents , and that we can no more banish wretchedness and poverty than we can eradic* te original sin . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging that the laws of trade are founded upon the very nature of things , and , if some men suffer apparently under the operation of these laws , the evil is inevitable , and that these laws can not be altered because their working may not he equally favorable to all ; if some be less happy , others will be more ; if some are starving now , others will have plenty elsewhere or hereafter , and thus tbe average will be fair ; if many die , there will be inure for those who remain ; and if men are deprived of labor in one department of industry , they can turn to another ; and if they die in the transition , it is because they were not needed . So , neither is the complaint of socIalists met by statesmen , who tell them their demanrls can not possibly be conceded without the greatest iqjustice to vested interests , without disturbing society to its foundations without such a radicel change of political institutions as would wholly change the existing order of things , and thus revolutionize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who now hold wealth and power , advantages not to be surrendered without a struggle . No such responses as these can allay the excitement or stem the progress of socialism , the very object of which is to remove the barriers to progress , to open the career of industry to poverty-stricken multitudes , who now , when they labor at all , labor for the advantage of ethers more than for their own ; who insist upon the solution of the problem ,  - -  What will best promote the interests of the whole number of any community l " Althou* we totally dissent from the plans of reforming political institutions which the socialists h ye proposed , we cheerfully concede their having rendered a b reat service to social science by demonstrating the justice and necessity of reform . Their 4rong sympathy for human suffering throws un interest over many of their writings , very much in contrast with much of the theology , political economy , and politics of the present day . It would be a useful task to giance over pages thus in contrast , and entertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christians taking the part of wealth and power . If much cause of humiliation should be found in this comparison , it would not be the only lesson of that kind which might be administered to those who profess to be the followers of Him , who , when he took upon himself the form of humanity , became also its champion and friend-pp. 361-3 . With these sentiments in the main we accord . And we regard it as a mattel- of gratulation among liberal minded and humane Christians , that authors who have authority in the world , such as those who appear in the pages of the North British Review , are speaking in much the same way . But we can not dwell longer on the merits of the book . They are such in kind as we have indicated , and such in degree as to make us on the whole quite thankful that it has been published . We pass to its demerits . These are palpable and serious . The most striking of them is an extravagant and unqualified statement of the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partic // ularly with reference to the areat Christian law of charity and obedience to the precepts of Christ-so extravagant and unqualified as often to be false or to convey a false impression . We can see that what the writer probably intends is true , while what he says is often and evidently untrue , and offensive also because hearing hard upon Christians , who , notwithstanding their imperfections , are the light of the world . We suppose from what appears in the book of the author 's reverence and affection for the Christianity of the Bible , and indeed of his regard for Christians , that he would probably assent to modifications and qualifications of many of his statements , if they should be suggested , which would render them true and disrobe them of all needless offensiveness . And yet without such modifications and qualifications many of his statements are not true , and may justly be regarded as injurious . Of these extravagant and unjust statements we will quote a few examples from the multitude which the book affords . here is a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without Humanity , and Protestantism without Christianity . " A candid man takes up the book and reading the title , and then looking over its pages to learn what the author meant by this part of the title , would be very likely to conclude that he meant by it that modern Christians have creeds but not charity , have theology but not humanity , and that Protestantism is severed from Christianity . He says , indeed , in the second edition , on the page following the title page , " The foregoing title has created impressions not intended by the author . In making it short , it has become ambiguous . It would have better expressed the meaning had it run thus , " Creeds , but not without Charity , Theology , bbut not without Humanity , Protestantism , but not without Christianity . " Better late than never is this explanation . Yet it would have been better still , if it had accompanied the first instead of the second edition of the book . Unfortunately there are many expressions in the body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say contradictions , to make them true and just . And the motto of the title page , interpreted in the light of such expressions , means the exaggerated and injurious charge which it has been generally understood to mean . This explanation , however , confirms the remark which we have already made , that the author , if called on to explain the various extravagant statements or assertions in his book , would probably so qualify them as to render them true . But here are other specimens : " Apart from these flagrant departures from the spirit of Christianity , what does the current history of the various churches , ja greater or less degree , disclose ? // Intense and often unscrupulous nw iry , incessant and unkind competition , a selfglorifying and haughty demeanor . Whatever a few individuals may do to correct or overcome the evil , churches seldom treat each other in a spirit of love or forbearance . If , without , they are ever in a hostile attitude ; within , they are far froni being at peace with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If united , they are but too often frozen together ; if at variance , it has all the acrimony of a family quarrel . They build sumptuous temples for the worship of God , and sell the seats to the highest bidder : they neither attend nor allow others to attend-pp. 177-8 . " But the world now looks on and beholds , in Catholic countries , that great machine called the church , contrived by crafty and ambitious men to enrich themselves , to enslave and rule the masses under cover of ignorance and superstition : where Prot.estantism prevails , a free intellect , but a hard and unrelenting selfishness , a ( levotion to mammon never before equaled , a grinding competition in all the pursuits of life , a race for wealth and power , in which the multitudes are distanced by a few , who become masters , and wield their power with unpitying severity ; a scene of strife , of endless divisions , of hot discussions about trifles , of sectarian rivalry , in which every element of evil mingles , often without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will the world adopt Christianity while this picture is before it I No : the world has already risen in judgment upon Christianity as exemplitied by those who are called Christiaiis . What are the characteristics of Christendom in the eye of the world ? Civilization , discord , war , priesteraft , sectarianism , greediness of gain , vigor of mind , heartless competition , domination of capital , pauperism , crime-pp. 183-4 . " There are no greater friends of political liberty than Protestants , but it is that liberty which lets every man take care of himself , and ruin seize the hindmost ; it is that liberty which stimulates all to run , hut permits the heat of competition to rise so high that none can stoop to pick up the multitudes who fall exhausted by the way-p. 190 . " In chartism , in democracy , in socialism , there is not necessarily any ingredient of infidelity ; and yet in fact , we find them to a large extent blended and traveling together , because Christians , as such , and those who pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed every movement of reform , as dangerous to society-pp. 272-3 . " The mission of Christ was not merely incarnation , death , resurrection , mediation , and redemption . It was also an humble and lowly ministration among the poor and suffering : this was his daily work . He went about doing good , ministering to the hungry , visiting the sick , and restoring the leprous , the blind and the lame . He preached constantly the doctrines of His mission , which , wherever felt and apprehended , will secure a ministry engaged in the very same work . Now , whether e look upon the whole mass of those who are regarded as Christ 's ministers , or at those of any particular denomination , we shall be equally at a loss to find any class of them who are imitatiiig the ministry of their Lord arid M ster . Not only is there no sneb class of ministers , but it is rare to find one who walks in the footsteps of Him whom he professes to serve ; it is i'are to find one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as never man spake . ' - pp. 214-15 . " It is strange , indeed , that with the example and instructions of the Saviour before them , ministers should have so forgotten their duties to their fellow-men as not to perceive that the hand of charity roust accompany the tongue of truth ; the latter must enter into the heart , hut the former must open the door . In what Protestant country are the clergy regarded by the mass of the poor as their special friends ? or rather , in which do the poor look to or receive from riiinisters or bishops , as such , any evidences of special regard , temporal or spiritual , beyond what may be dictated by and subserve the interests of such ministers and bishops themselves ? - p. 224 . Now that there is something of truth in these representations we will not deny ; truth that should be spoken , and that the // churches and ministers of Christ should hear and regard . But they are so unqualified , so exaggerated and colored as to be on the whole false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears so small a proportion to the part that is false that it is hardly recognized . It is only another of the multitudinous exaruples of human inconsistency that a man , who is writing a book on purpose to commend obedience to the slighted law of charity or love , should in that very book so flagrantly transgress that law by a reckless , or at least an unregulated , tongue . A book like this , whose object is to expose and rebuke the defects of Christian churches and ministers , especially needs statements which are just , well qualified , modified and guardedstatements which give the truth in such fair measure and proportions , that they will be seen and felt and acknowledged to be true by at least the candid among those to whom they are addressed . In these days , exaggerated , intense , reckless , and galloping expression is very common and very cheap . But just and fair expression-expression which is so qualified and accurate as to make the impression of truth and truth only-is not so common . The latter , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all subjects , but especially on such a subject as this . The latter carries conviction and profit to those who are addressed . The former only offends and repels them . An author , many of whose charges against them are so extravagant and intense as to be false and to produce in them the impression that they are calumniated , does not gain their ear and credence even for the wholesome truths which he utters . They say , " We know he is unfair and unjust here ; we can not therefore trust him anywhere ; he is not worth minding . " It is much to be regretted that a book which contains so much timely and salutary truth should be so marred , and to such a degree nullified , by this common vice of modern authorship-so common as to be almost vulgar  --  the vice of extravagant , intense , and reckless assertion . We have no doubt that the very pertinent and weighty truths and reproofs of this volume might have been so stated as to command the assent of nine tenths of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians and their ministers . If the author had really done at first , what , in the following paragraph from the preface of his second , edition , he says it was his purpose to do , his book would have been quite acceptable . " It was our purpose to insist that the doctrine of Christian Charity is not sufficiently prominent , if it be not wholly omitted in Protestant standards , creeds , confessions , catechisms , and articles ; that it did not hold the place due to its importance in Protestant theology and literature ; that our Protestant theology was not // sufficiently imbued with the precepts and teachings of our Saviour himself ; that the moral law  --  the rule of Christian life and conduct-could be more safely drawn from the very words of Christ , than from any uninspired development of the Decalogue ; that it was wrong , very wrong , to pass over in silence or in neglect , the language of our Lord covering the whole ground of moral obligation , of duty to God and duty to man ; and attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decalogue ; that the moral law was re-enacted in a new commendment , and set forth by Christ himself with such fulness , such searching power , such deep discrimination , such ample comprehensiveness , that it savors of profane hardihood , if not criminal oversight , to attempt the deduction of Christian obligations by any mere human commentary upon the Ten Commandments . " We meant to urge that no document , proceeding from the Reformers or from the founders of any of our leading Protestant denominations , contains any adequate , or even fair statement of the Christian law of Charity as proclaimed by Christ and taught by his apostles ; that this omission in Protestant teaching had led to serious mistakes and omissions in Protestant modes of administering charity , and to a very inadequate conception of the obligations of Christians to their fellow men ; that the commands to love our neighbors as ourselves , and to do to others as we would have others do unto us , have not and are not receiving that close , faithful , and adequate application to the business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are entitled at the hands of the Protestant clergy ; that no such application is to be found in our religious literature ; that it does not comply with the law of Christian Charity to look upon our fellow-men merely as so many sinners-as so much material for conversion , or to be moulded and worked up into congregations-as so many subjects , upon whom the ecclesiastical organizations and their several modes of teaching should be brought to bear ; that this law clearly enjoins not merely loving our Christian brethren of the same denomination , or of any denomination , which is rising no higher in the scale of charity than the requirements of Free Masonry and Odd Fellowship , but it enjoins loving those who do not love us-even our enemies and those who despitefully use us . It is not enoun h for the Christian to be concerned only for the interests of men in the world to come , but for their best interests in this world . If a heathen poet could exclaim : Home onm : et nihil humani a me alienum puto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human concerns me ; ) the Christian must realize that the law of his charity carries him higher and farther , in regard for humanity , than any heathen conception could ever attain . " We maintain that Christ himself should have the chief voice in defining Christianity , and that this has been denied him in most , if not all the compends and summaries of Christian doctrine which are the bond of Protestant churches . Let them all be examined to see if a single one contains any full recognition of what Christ taught in his own ministry . " - pp. v-vii . Another demerit of the book is the vagueness and indefiniteness of its recommendations . It is difficult to ascertain what modes or measures it recommends of charity to the poor , if indeed it recommends any . We can not tell what our author would have Christians do . We know in general that he would have them administer charity and relief to the poor ; but how , specifically , we can not learn , and we think it would be difficult for any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable and troublesome because he condemns all the existing methods of charity to the poor . He tells us that on this subject all is wrong . And there he leaves us . He does not tell us what is right . He declares in a very sweeping manner , and with // severe censure , that there is a general neglect of the law of charity to the poor . lie condemns , as contrary to the gospel , the modes and measures by which Christians do the little which he admits is done in charity . And there , under the pressure of his rebukes for neglecting the poor , and of his exhortations to befriend them , he leaves us . He objects , if we understand him , to the doing of the work of charity by the church . He objects to its being7one by civil or municipal officers . He says , ( pp. 173 , 4 , ) " Alas ! how many poor are already among us , and how fearfully the numbers are increasing ! And what has been done for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounteous favors ? They have , as in England since the Reformation , been turned over to the public authorities . Christians , as such , have thus repudiated their highest obligations . They have not taken in Lazarus to clothe and feed him ; they have not taken up the wounded man ; they have sent all to the poor-house ; or rather they have virtually assented to the doctrine that that is the proper place for them . " Nor would he have this work of charity done by Christian associations . He says , ( pp. 187 , 8 , ) " Christ went from village to village , healing the sick , and personally solacing the cares of the poor : Protestants fulfill their charities not personally , but by delegation , or by machinery ; they visit the sick , feed the hungry , and clothe the naked by joint stock associations or by the hands of public functionaries . " He protests also against the common mode of procuring money for charitable purposes . He says , " It is not the voluntary offerings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasury of the churches . It is levied , nay , even exacted , by a system and under influences which do not permit denial ; under such penalties as the givers are afraid to incur . It would be hard to conjecture how much of the money levied in this way would be got if it were left to flow in solely by the spontaneous movements of the contributors . Certainly a very small portion . " This " mode of operation , " he says , is not Christian , but an excrescence upon Christianity which deforms it . How then , we ask , would he have Christians do this work of charity to the poor ? We can only infer that he would have them do it , individually , without association , organization , or the employment of agents of any kind or to any degree . Now we did not intend to discuss this topic at this point , but will say a few words in passing . We do not here give or withhold our approbation of the method of aiding the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : much may be said upon both sides of that question . But we do say that the mode of aiding the poor // by the church , that is by the church giving needful aid to its poor members , through the personal agency of pastors and deacons and private members , is one of the most unobjectionable , appropriate and delicate of all modes , and one of the most evangelical . We think every church should take adequate care of its own poor-unless the work is by fair judgment beyond its power . And we say , also , that the work of charity to the poor in any given place , especially a large place , can not be done well - that is , done adequately , uniformly , generally , completely , and without liability to frequent and gross imposition-except there is something at least of association , organization , " delegation , " and employment of agents , by the charitable . These criticisms on the author we make very reluctantly . For we have decided sympathy with him on the subject which he discusses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he expresses ; and we think we see evidence that he is a man , who , if he should sit down and talk with us , and give an opportunity for questions , and afford explanations , would evince a general and perhaps thorough agreement with us . We hope he will persevere in his good object , amending decisively his faults of method . He may discover , we think , various indications , both among the ministers and the members of our churches , that he has done much good already . We pass now to the second of the works at the head of this article . This is a thin volume of 139 pages in review and condemnation of " New Themes for the Protestant Clergy . " It is written in a style pure , clear , direct and forcible . It exposes with much severity many of the exaggerated and unjust statements of the author of New Themes . It pays a handsome tribute to the benevolent character of modern Christians , and to ti* seif-denying kindness of modern ministers . And it discusses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehensive manner , some of the topics into which it follows the " New Themes , " particularly pauperism and the British poorlaws . Of the manner in which he exercises the reviewer 's function of correction and reproof we will give one or two illustrations " About twenty years ago , there died in Philadelphia , a very opulent merchant , who bequeathed a portion of his property to the city , in trust , for the erection of a College for Orphans . Among other provisions in his will , was one which forbade the admission into the college of Christian ministers , even as visitors for an hour . This was felt to be a gross and gratuitous insult to this most respectable body of men . * * * * And yet , melancholy to relate , we find this avowed Christian , the author of New Themes , ' instead of sharing the indignation which we should suppose a Christian would feel at such an insult to Christians and such a stab to Christianity , we find him actually triumphing over the insulted clergy as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hear there is a feeling of resentment among many of the clergy of Pennsylvania , coupled with branding him always as an infidel , for the exclusion of their order from his college of orphans . We know nothing more of Girard 's reasons beyond what he says , nor of his religious sentP ments , but on the face of the transaction there is every reason why the clergy should bow in anguish before an event which speaks so loud a reproach to their order . That a man who could conceive so vast a project of charity towards children , the most favored class under the dispensation of mercy ; that one who could so proximate the spirit of the apostle 's declaration ,  --  ' Puie religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction , ' ( James 1 , 27 ; ) that one who knew the world so well , and had lived in it so long , and desired that the orphans taken in charge should be taught the purest principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active life , they may , from inclination and habit , evince benevolence towards their fellowcreatures , and a love of truth , sobriety and industry , ' - should not be willing to commit this teaching to the chirgy , or to their supervision , or even to their occasional inspection , should rather justify self-distrust and apprehension than a tone of reproach or condemna. tion ' - ( p. 275. ) " * * * * " Does not our author here contrast Mr. Girard 's character favorably with that of the Christian ministers who are excluded from his colleo'e ? And yet we presume he must know that Mr. Girard , so far from being a Chris*Ian , lived in notorious neglect of Christian duties , of public worship , and of the observance of that day of rest and devotion , which even worldly men have agreed to respect . We do not see why we should hesitate to speak of that which Mr. Girard 's habitual conduct so loudly proclaimed . If this admirer of Mr. Girard is ignorant as to his religious sentiments , he need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our more elderly citizens who can enlighten him on this subject . Does that man make any secret of his religious opinions , who names his ships , Voltaire , ' Rousseau , ' and Helvetius ? ' IHis own relatives have not hesitated to let us know what they thought of his religious opinions , when they have dragged his will before the supreme tribunal of his country , for condemnation and abolishment , as the will of an infidel , and a foe to Christianity- "  - -   - -  - pp. 39-46 . " We have said that our author can not tell what is doing , even in his own neighborhood and city ; and we now proceed to give a striking proof of his ignorance on this point . Speaking of the responsibilities of Christians in the United States , in regard to the suffering classes , ' he says , Have we not among us those who are hungry , and require to be fed ; those that are naked , and require to be clothed ; those that are fainting with thirst and require a cup of cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be visited l Alas ! how many poor are already among us , and how fearfully the numbers are increasing ! And what has been done for them by American Christians upon whom their Master has heaped such bounteous favors. ' ( p. 173 . ) Certainly the inference here is that , little or nothiub is done by American Christians , for the poor . Now let us examine a little into this matter . Let us take the author 's own latitude , ( not in assertions ! this requires more hardihood than we can summon , ) Philadelphia , and its environs , and endeavor to form an estimate of what some few Christians in Philadelphia , are doing for the poor . In addition to the vast sum of $189,000 distributed to the poor , by the public authorities , in 1851 , of which Christians , of course , contribute a large proportion , there are in Philadelphia , upon a moderate estimate , two hundred charitable societies conducted by private agency ; ( of which , about one hundred and sixty are directly connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothe the naked , ' and provide for the destitute . We have reason to believe that , at least twelve thonsand poor children ( we do not include those who belong to the better off ' classes ) are weekly gathered together on Sunday , for religious instruction . It is probably much within bounds to say that , five thousand five hundred male and female visitors are employed , snore or less , in visiting the lanes and alleys of our city and suburbs , ministering to the temporal and spiritual wants of the poor . In one case , alone , more than two hundred ladies divide the city and suburbs into sections , and appoint visitors , whose self-imposed duty it is , to visit every dwelling // where the existence of poverty is known , or suspected . These excellent women not only relieve immediate wants , but give counsel , calculated to improve the housekeeping of the improvident , or uninstructed .

For the young , places of profitable industry are provided ; and the in -- firmities of age are rendered more tolerable , by the hand of charity , and the voice of compassion . These ladies , during the year ending Oct. 21 , 1851 , had under their charge 856 families ; they made l*2OO visits to the abodes of indigence ; they clothed the naked , ' by the donation of 3,337 garments . There can be no objection urged here against interested agents ; nothing said against Societies ; - for , he it noted , all the laborers referred to above , are performing a self-imposed duty . So far from receiving any pecuniary reward , they are always liable to calls upon their own means , to relieve the destitute . If their associated character displease our author , let them be considered in the light of individuals , each working in his or her own sphere , and thus fulfilling their duty , however those who help to provide the means expended , may be neglecting theirs .

Does our author know a single Christian family of his acquaintance , whose master or mistress is not , more or less , in the habit of visiting the abodes of the poor 1 Let us give him a little more insight into the philanthropic history of his own city . He speaks of neglected prisoners : Have we not among us those that are sick *nd in prison , and require to be visited ?

And does he never encounter the visitors of the poor , when he takes his round among the hovels of the destitute ? He says that : If the preacher and people in our rich and well ordered congregations were , in the midst of the gravest sermon , ' suddenly brought to a sense of their duty that they would rush in a m* ss , preacher and people , from their splendid edifice , to the courts , and alleys and cellars , to the abodes of destitution , ignorance , crime and suffering .

It has serious demerits . It treats " New Themes " and its author in a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind to the merits of the work he criticizes . He does not admit at all the serious defects which it points out in // the working of modern Christianity . He does not appreciate the weighty and salutary truths which it utters . He seems to think that it has no merits , and that its influence is evil without mixture . He treats it as a work to be branded and banished from public regard . He relates some instances in which booksellers and others have examined the book and rejected it as the work of an infidel . He himself carefully acknowledges that the author of New Themes is not an infidel , but a sincere Christian ; yet he says that he writes like an infidel ; and if he should judge by his book alone , he should believe that he is an infidel . He quotes this language of " one of the largest publishers in an adjoining city : " " I have seen that book ; a number of copies were sent to me ; but on looking over it , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies back ; " and then adds ; now we are satisfied that the book was written by a Christian , and one of exemplary life and conversation . But had we only his book to judge by , we should have come to a far different conclusion . " iNow this affixing the odious name of infidel , or raising the cry , " He writes like an infidel , " is a common and economical way of putting down a man , or of destroying orimpairing his influence , who does not altogether agree with us or with the common opinion respecting the nature of the Christianity of the Bible and the application of its precepts to the existing customs and conduct of men , its requisitions upon Christian individuals and communities . It is sometimes a successful way ; though it usually reacts in favor of the person thus assailed . But it is a very unfair , illiberal and mean way . In the present instance its injustice is very manifest . In our judgment , it is not true that the author of " New Themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is abundant evidence in the whole plan and texture as well as in particular parts of the work , that he is a thorough believer in the Bible , a devout follower of Christ , and an earnest lover of his doctrines and precepts , bowing humbly to their divine authority , admiring their perfection , and desiring complete obedience to them in their true meaning . It does not become the reviewer to assume that he has arrived , or that the body of Christian people have arrived , at a full comprehension of the Christian doctrines and precepts , and a perfect understanding of the manner in which they should be applied to the conduct of individuals and to the institutions and customs of society . It can not be taken for granted that there is nothing new or further to be learned in this respect . Two centuries ago , men who took the Bible for their guide , good and earnest Christian men , were in some habits and practices which we now see to be utterly and plainly contrary // to the precepts and spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such blindness in these days and that there are no errors now respecting the meaning of Christian doctrines and precepts and their application to the conduct of individuals and to the customs and institutions of society ? Is it not rather to be expected that Christianity is to accomplish a vast deal more for the amelioration of man and his condition , not only by the vigorous prosecution of reformations already begun and the better performance of duties already known , but by new discoveries of serious and general errors in practice , the institution of new reformations , and the performance of duties to which now we are blind ? We do not believe in the infallibility of the Christians or the Christian Churches or the Christian ministers of the present age , or that they have nothing more to learn in the breadth and depth of God 's word . And therefore we can not justify casting stones at those who indicate existing defects among Christians and their institutions , and call them to new duties , even though the mode of indication is quite imperfect . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of this article we regard as a poor affair . Its title indicates its character : " NEW THEMES CONDEMNED : OR THIRTY OPINIONS UPON NEW THEMES ' AND ITS REviEwER . " ' The object of the book is bad , and the taste with which the writer attempts to accomplish that object , is worse . The object is to put down New Themes , and to put up the Reviewer of it , by authority - by publishing thirty opinions in condemnation of the one and in praise of the other , and those opinions for the most part anonymous . If a book can not be put down otherwise than in this mode , let it go without being put down . It would be better even that a bad book should live than that it should be put to death by the introduction and prevalence of such a vicious method . This voting down a book , and by a kind of secret ballot too , appears to us an irrational and unmanly device , and not very respectful withal to the community . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , when asked on Monday morning how he liked the sermon on the preceding Sabbath , replied that he did not know , for he had not " heard anybody say . " But the taste of the book is worse than its object . It is evidently given to the public by the author of the Review of New Themes ; yet the letters contained in it , condemning New Themes and its author , abound in extravagant praise of the Review and its author , and repre* sent his victory over his opponent as complete and annihilating ! Next door to writing puffs of ourselves is this publishing // other people 's puffs of ourselves . It is pulling ourselves by proxy . Our estimate of the Reviewer fell several degrees after reading this infelicitous sequel to his Review . We will now , in conclusion , discuss briefly one of the chief topics treated in this New Themes controvesy  --  the relation of Christianity to poverty  --  the duties which Christianity requires with i'eference to poverty . This subject , which might usefully occupy a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline . The duties which Christianity enjoins with reference to poverty may be considered in two departments , that of prevention , and that of relief . The first we esteem the most important by far , on the principle that " prevention is better than cure . " To prevent a man from becoming poor is far better than to let him come to poverty and then give him relief . To make a man and his family self-supporting and productive members of society , is much better than to allow them to sink to want , and then to aid them even in the kindest and amplest manner . Indeed , it is difficult to express adequately the superior value of the former . Of course , if it is a Christian duty to relieve poverty , much more is it a Christian duty to prevent it . To prevent poverty is to know and to remove its causes . There is difficulty , undoubtedly , in understanding all the causes of poverty . With respect to some of them there is wide diversi ty of sentiment . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plain and prominent , fearfully prominent . First among them all is intemperance or drunkenness . The Reviewer of New Themes very justly censures its author for his omission to speak of this prime cause of pauperism , and pertinently remarks that " a work on pauperism without treating on intemperance is the play of Hamlet with the part of Hamlet left out . " The Reviewer introduces on this subject some valuable statements of fact . From a discourse by Bishop Potter , of Pennsylvania , he quotes the followincr : " It is computed by Mr. Porter , an English statistician of distinguished ability , but of no special interest in the subject which we are now discussing , that the laboring people of Great Britain , exclusive of the higher and middle classes , expend no less than ? 53,000,000 ( $250 ,  - -  000,000 ) every year , on alcoholic liquors and tobacco . " * * * " In wasting $250,000,000 every year the laboring population of Britain put it beyond the power of any government to avert from multitudes of them , the miseries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the amount , directly or indirectly , consumed in Pennsylvania annually for the same indulgence equals // $ 10,000,000 . " He quotes from the lion . Edward Everett the following respecting intemperance in the United States in ten years . " 1 . It has cost the nation a direct expenditure of $600,000,000 2 . It has cost the nation an indirect expense of $600,000,000. 3 . It has destroyed 300,000 lives . 4 . It has sent 100,000 children to the poor-house. 5 . It has consigned at least 150,000 persons to the jails and penitentiaries. 6 . It has made at least 1000 maniacs. 7 . It has instigated to the commission of 1,500 murders . 8 . It has caused 2000 persons to commit suicide . 9 . It has burned , or otherwise destroyed , property to the amount of $10,000,000. 10 . It has made 200,000 widows , and one million of orphan children . " He quotes from a discourse of Rev. Albert Barnes to this effect : " The exact sum received in the city and county of Philadelphia for tavern licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for prosecuting for crime , and for the support of pauperism , consequent on intemperance , in the city and county , was for the same year , as accurately as it can be computed , $365,000 . The number of cases treated in the Hospital in the Blockley Alms House ( Phila. ) in 1851 , was 5000 . Intemperate men 2709 , intemperate women 897 , total 3,606 . There were , besides , cases of mania-a-potu 614 ; making nearly 4000 out of 5000 . " The author adds that of 5,199 received in one year into the same Alms house , 2,323 were drunk when received . Now let it be borne in mind that there are multitudes who , by intemperance , bring themselves and families into poverty and the necessity of charitable aid , that are never prosecuted in criminal courts or carried to an Alms-House , and we must conclude that intemperance is the chief cause of poverty . The testimony of the legal guardians of the poor , and of the members of Associations for the aid of the poor , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who are so poor as to need assistance are made so by the intemperance of themselves or others . Here , then , we have the cause of the greater part of poverty singled out . Intemperance stands before us identified as the chief author of all This evil . What , now , is the dictate of Christianity with reference to this matter ? Is it to allow this cause to continue its impoverishing effects , and then attempt to mitigate those effects by charity-allow it year after year to reduce its multitudes to poverty and then patiently and kindly to supply their wants ? Or is it to prevent this poverty , with all its attendant evil and misery , by removing its cause ? Is it to stand far down this dismal stream , and attempt to mingle soothing oil with its floods ; or is it to go to the fountains and // dry them up ? Which does true evangelical charity require ? Which does the law of love to our neighbor , the law of a wise benevolence , demand ? Surely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to do all in our power to remove this chief cause of poverty . While we kindly extend the hand of charity to those whom intemperance is plunging into the gulf of necessity , we should do with our might that which will prevent intemperance itself , and thus its work of impoverishment and ruin . All the calls of the word of God to charity are virtually so many calls to prevent or remove intemperance , if this be practicable . And it is practicable . It has been abunda*itly proved that the joint action of the principle of total a l5stinence , and of suitable laws for restraining the traffic in alcoholic liquors , will put an end to intemperance-at least to the greater part of it . If , on the one hand , the friends of good order and of charity will themselves practice , and , so far as they can , teach and inculcate , the principle of entire abstinence from intoxicating liquors as a beverage , and , on the other hand , will give their influence for the enactment and enforcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws as have practically proved their own efficiency-intemperance will be wholly removed , or at least restricted to narrow limits and small degrees . Here , then , is a mode in which friends of the poor , those who recognize the obligations of charity , can pr*vent three-fourths of all the poverty which calls for their aid-in which they can prevent three-fourths not only of the applications for aid , but of the mortification , the crushing of the spirit , the varied and countless mental sufferings , which are endured by those who are compelled to apply for aid or to accept aid ; and not only these , but the far greater mortification , degradation and suffering which is produced by that vice of intemperance in themselves or their natural guardians , which compels them to accept or to apply for aid . It is a plain way , a tried way , a practicable way . Let the orderly and the charitable practice themselves , and inculcate by their influence , total abstinence from intoxicating drinks , and do what they properly may for the existence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alcoholic liquors to their appropriate purposes , and poverty will soon be reduced to one-fourth of its present amount . This is the work of charity . This is a part of the requirements of Christianity . respecting poverty . It is required by all the force of divine authority in those precepts of charity so frequently uttered in the sacred Word . // And here it is very evident that the author of New Themes has made a serious oversight . Lie has overlooked , not only the truth that charity requires efforts to prevent intemperance in order to the prevention of poverty , but also the fact , honorable to modern Christianity , that such efforts have been extensively made , and that great success has attended them . In the last twenty-five years the Temperance reformation , imperfect as it has been and now is , has done more , not merely to relieve , but better still , to prevent , poverty , than ever was done for that end , during the same length of time , in any age of the world . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially Christian ministers , have been laborers and leaders . The author of New Themes should have seen and acknowledged this . Such acknowledgment would have mitigated , in some degree , the evil impression which he has made by sweeping and unjust censures on Christians and Christian ministers . Another cause of poverty , far less indeed than intemperance , yet widely efficient , is ignorance  --  the lack of intellectual discipline and culture . Ignorance tends to stupidity , indolence , thriftlessness and vice ; and these are sure causes of poverty . We would not indeed rely on intellectual culture alone , aside from moral and religious culture ; though even without these it is much better than ignorance , as far as thrift and even virtue are concerned , and with these surely it has a great influence to make a population ingenious , enterprising , industrious , productive and thrifty . Other things being equal , an intelligent people will have more of general abundance and fewer instances of privation than . an ignorant people . The general thrift of New England is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also indirectly to those higher institutions of learning which are essential to the life and success of Common Schools . General education , therefore , is demanded by true charity-that wise charity which prevents as well as relieves poverty . It is a duty which the gospel enjoins , indirectly , yet surely and earnestly , in its precepts of charity , to befriend our system of Public Schools . Every friend of the poor , every Christian especially , should give heed to these schools and do what he may for their excellence and success , and for the universal diffusion of their benefits , so that no portion of the children of the community shall be permitted to grow up in ignorance . We might urge this as a wise measure of police , self-protection and economy for society . But we urge it now as a measure of charity-wise charity . That is a short sighted charity indeed which labors to supply the craving wants of the poor , while it neglects the education of the children of the poor or of cmigrant // strangers , and allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thriftlessness and destitution . It is a very mistaken charity which occupies itself only with the relief of the destitute , and multiplies the occasions of charity by multiplying through neglect of the preventive measures of education the number and the miseries of the needy . By the like plain reasoning it is proved the dictate of charity to sustain Sabbath schools and missionary chapels for the instruction and evangelization of that part of the population of our cities and large towns which is not reached by the privileges of our churches . Such measures are indeed required by another and higher principle , love to the souls of men , regard for their spiritual welfare ; but they are also required by that charity which relieves or prevents the bodily wants and miseries of men . For nothing has been more thoroughly demonstrated than that irreligion and profanation of the Sabbath tend to moral degradation and miserable poverty ; while religious instruction and attendance at the sanctuary tend to moral elevation and material thrift . The gospel is fitted to save men from the miseries of poverty and vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery of the future life-is fitted to secure for them plenty , comfort and happiness in this world , as well as eternal purity and felicity in the world to come . Another mode of preventing poverty and privation , is by affording or facilitating employment for those who depend on their daily labor and chiefly on being employed by others for their daily bread-by bringing labor and laborers together . There are multitudes , especially in our cities and large towns , where impoverished emigrants land or first resort , who can find no employment , or can find employment but part of the year . The result is two-fold . The labor market in those places is more than supplied , and thus the price of labor is reduced below the equitable standard ; and many , very many , are without employment , and having nothing , must either starve or be fed by charity , and must dwell in crowded and death-breeding cellars or attics or be taken to the alms-house or the prison . Now , undoubtedly , there is labor enough to be done somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is simply hard-hearted advice to tell these unemployed and starving people to go and find it . They do not know where to look for it ; and if they did , they are wholly without means to go where they may obtain it . It would therefore be a wise as well as kind charity , it would prevent a vast deal of destitution and of demand for alms-giving , if some thorough and wide reaching system should be devised of finding employment for those who // need and desire it , but can not find it for themselves-of bringing the labor to be done and the people who wish to do it , together . This is done now to some extent by intelligence offices , but very inadequately . This subject commends itself urgently to all the charitable . It is well to help the poor , but it is far better to show them how to help themselves . There is hardly any sight more sad than that of a person who wishes work but can not obtain it , who wishes not to beg but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet can not find it , and the benevolent to whom he applies are obliged with bleeding hearts to say that they can not tell him where he can find it . There ought to be in every city and large town , some well devised and efficiently conducted system , which , by extensive correspondence and agencies in the country , and by other wise methods , should find work for every one who desires to earn a support by labor . It would accommodate employers as well as the employed . And it would prevent a vast amount of destitution and crime , and save the necessity of a vast amount of alms-giving . Another mode of preventing poverty is to secure , or at least promote , adequate or equitable remuneration of labor . Unquestionably , one cause of destitution is that operatives , in some departments of industry certainly , receive inadequate wagesso inadequate that it hardly suffices to keep soul and body together . That there are many of our fellow beings who , by constant work during unseasonable hours of the night as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when excessive labor or wearing anxiety brings sickness upon them , are the subjects of charity-who are thus , by their condition , in great temptation to dishonesty and to ruinous vice-surely this is a mournful consideration . We know that many say that this state of things is remediless-that the remuneration of labor must be governed by the law of supply and demand-by the rule of market price . We do not believe it . We prote*t against it . Without entering into any radical or socialistic theories , and without professing to have fathomed the subject of the relations between employers and employed , which we acknowledge to be a deep one , we do say that it is obvious that this condition of things may be at least mitigated by the application of the law of Christian equity , not to say Christian kindness . We insist that Christianity , the precepts of the gospel , as well as the law of supply and demand and the rule of market price , have a legitimate application to this matter . in whatever departments of industry the market price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay more than the market price , provided the profits of his business are such that he cart afford it ; and // they often are . This , the rules of justice , and much more , the rules of Christianity , demand . If the employer can remedy or mitigate the severe and inequitable bearing of the rule of market price upon those whom he employs , he is bound to do it . He is not indeed under any obligation to impoverish himself in a contest with the rule of market price . But if the profits of his business exceed a fair remuneration for his labor and skill and for the use and risk of his capital , then he is bound to devote that excess to the remuneration of his operatives , so far as to make that remuneration equitable ; or , if it is insufficient for that end , to make it go as far toward that end as it can . It is unjust , much more is it unchristian , for him to put into his pocket extravagant profits from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he does , the language of the Apostle James applies to him , and was meant for him . " Behold , the hire ( the just due ) of the laborers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud ( injustice ) crieth ; and the cries of them which have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbaoth . " And the poverty and necessity of receiving alms , which come upon those operatives by means of their inequitable wacre caused by him . He lays that * s , may fairly be said to be burden upon them and upon the charitable community . Nor does it remove his guilt in the sight of God , or of justly discerning men , if from the ill-gotten surplus of his profits he gives freely in charity to relieve their necessities . For he should be just before he is generous . And his generosity , even if it should be so uncommon as wholly to relieve them all , is a poor substitute for that justice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from all the trials and sufferings of soul which attend it . Yes . It should be remembered and thoroughly pondered by all men of business , and by all employers , that the law of Christian equity and the golden rule of the gospel applies to this matter ; and they should honestly make the application and abide by its results . A laborer comes to an employer for work , which is offered to him at a certain price . The laborer replies . " It is not enough . I need the work ; but that price for it is not equitable , and will hardly procure for me the bare necessaries of life . " The employer answers , " That is the market price , I can easily get it done for that . Do it for that or not at all . " Ah ! Mr. Employer , that will not do . That is not a sufficient answer . It will not suffice before the court of heaven . It does not suffice before the court of Christian equity . You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of market price . There are other references to be made . Does your business // enable you , after a fair profit to yourself , to give more ? If it does , you are bound to do it . And if you do it not , no rule of market price can shield you from the charge of injustice . We insist on it , that in this matter employers should not govern themselves by the market price alone , but also by the law of conscience , the dictates of equity and the golden rule of Christianity . The bearing of such action as we have indicated upon the prevention of poverty is particular and general . It would prevent destitution in the particular cases of the individuals receiving wages equitably raised above the market price ; and it would have a general effect on the market price itself . if only professedly Christian persons should adopt this course , it would seriously mitigate , if not wholly remedy , the evil of inequitable market prices for labor . In this connection it is worthy of remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sphere , will contribute to the more equitable remuneration of labor , and to the prevention of destitution and the need of alms-giving . It is female labor which is especially depressed . And this is chiefly because that labor is so confined in its range . The labor market within that limited range is crowded ; and thus the supply exceeding the demand , the market price of labor is sunk below the standard of equity , in many departments far below . According to the law of custom , which has widely , though we are glad to say not exclusively , obtained and governed , women can do but four things for a support-serve in families , sew , teach and marry . The result is that the prices of their sewing and teaching are often inequitably low , and that many are constrained to marry more from interest  --  to gain a respectable support-than from affection . Indeed , the result is that the prices of almost all female industry are too low . There are many things which women can do as well as men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as well paid as men . Yet they are not . It is with pleasure that we have noticed of late a tendency to enlarge the sphere of female labor , and we think it the part of wise charity and of Christianity to favor and increase this tendency . It is a hopeful sign to see women employed in the lighter work of printing , and as clerks in the less laborious departments of merchandise . And we see no reason why they should not conduct and receive the profits of these departments of business . In some instances within our knowledge they have done so successfully . indeed there are some kinds of business , now pursued exclusively , so far as we know , by men , which are decidedly more appropriate for women . For instance , we never see a woman in a shoe store , having a pair // of shoes fitted to her feet by a man , without the thought that that business would be done more appropriately and acceptably by women . We hope to see women extending their industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as employers and receivers of profits . It will do much to increase their worth , independence , and self-respect . it will do much to prevent destitution and the necessity of alms-giving . And what is still more important , it will do much to diminish the temptations to moral degradation and ruinous vice . We come now to the second department of the duties which Christianity enjoins with reference to poverty-that of relief . Until the preventive measures which have been indicated , or others better still , have produced theii- results , there will be many in such poverty as requires charitable relief . And it can not be expected that such measures , however successful , will prevent all poverty ; though we verily believe they would prevent nine-tenths of it . There will still be misfortune , and sickness , and insanity , and vice , and loss of natural guardians , and the infirmities of age-various causes of destitution and helplessness inseparable from our mortal state . rfhat the destitute , whatever the causes of their need , should receive suitable aid is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the spirit which the gospel inculcates , and by its numerous and positive precepts . We will , in a few words , indicate some of the methods in which such aid should be given . This general remark may be premised respecting them . They should be conducted with kindness and sympathy ; they should be adapted to the particular cases needing aid ; they should be safe , guarding against imposition , discouraging idleness and encouraging industry ; and they should be thorough , covering the whole ground in any given town or city , and reaching every case of suffering or necessity . The first and most obvious form of charitable relief is that which is administered privately by neighbors , kindred , acquaintances , and those who seek out the poor on errands of mercy . This is perhaps the best form of charity , useful to its authors , most grateful to the recipients , and usually bestowed wisely because bestowed by those who understand the circumstances of each case . Next in importance we rank the charity of churches to their poor members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its own poor , unless the work transcends its ability-unless the chuich itself is very poor , or has experienced extraordinary calamities among its members . This mode // of charity , if faithfully exercised , would of itself relieve a large proportion of the needy . But there is occasion , also , for wider associations than churches in the work of charity . For there are some cases of necessity which need peculiar treatment . The insane , the deaf and dumb , the blind and the idiotic , need to be cared for in institutions specially fitted to their condition . And orphans , also , need Asylums , where they will receive as nearly as may be the parental care and kindness which they have lost , and will be prepared for favorable situations in worthy families . Moreover , in order to render the work of charitable relief complete and thorough , there must be in every city or large town an organization for the aid of the poor , which divides the place into small districts , assigning to each district one who volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needy therein ; which shall have a central office , and a book of record containing the report of the visitors concerning every person or family applying for help ; and which shall secure the cooperation of the citizens , both in the form of sufficient donations , *and by their refusal to aid any applicant or beggar* except by referring him to the visitor of the district to which he belongs . Such associations exist , and have enjoyed a large amount of success , in New York and Boston . And these methods have been found absolutely necessary in order to reach efficiently and suitably all cases of need , and to prevent the grossest abuse of charity by imposture , and especially by bartering its gifts for intoxicating drinks . The proceedings of these associations are well worthy of study and imitation . They combine personal visitation of the poor , thorough acquaintance with their condition and a suitable supply of their wants , with careful prevention of imposture and of the abuse or misappropriation of gifts by the recipients , and with the encouragement of industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled us to treat the topic of the relief of poverty more briefly than we intended . Yet we do not regret that we have given most space to the topic of its prevention : for we deem that far the most important .
