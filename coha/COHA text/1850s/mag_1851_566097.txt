txt ART . VI. - STEPHENS ' FARMER 'S GUIDE . The Farmer ' 8 Guide to Scientific and Practical Agriculture . By HENRY STEPHENS , F.RS.E. , assisted by JOHN P. NORTON , M.A. , Professor of Scientific Agriculture in Yale College . In two volumes . New York Leonard Scott &amp; Co . New Haven : T. 1 . Pease . THIS work , which has been in course of republication during the past two years , is now complete , and is offered to the American Farmer at an extremely low price . Issued in 22 numbers , it now makes two large and handsome bound volumes , closely printed , and profusely illustrated with admirable engravings and wood cuts . These engravings , and in fact the whole letter press , are fac-similes of the second English edition of Stephen 's Book of the Farm , a duplicate set of stereotype plates having been sent out to this country . This second English edition is greatly altered and improved from the first ; in fact so much of value // has been added , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is in some respects almost a new one . In consideration of this , of the American notes by Prof. Norton , and of the fact that an American reprint of the first English edition was already in the market ; the New York publishers , with the concurrence of iN'fr . Stephens , felt justified in changing the title of their issue to that of the Farmer 's Guide . That this is an appropriate title will soon become apparent to every careful reader . The work is in the main English , and many of our farmers may therefore object that it can not be suited to them , but this objection though true in part , is also in part fallacious . The general system of English farming is too elaborate and expensive for a new country , where land is cheap , and labor high ; but the principles on which that system depends , are the same in all countries . The same succession of crops which ruins land here , would ruin it in England ; the same treatment in kind which keeps land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and render productive our prematurely worn-oat soils . The same habits of care and attention in the rearing and breeding of stock would produce the same effects on this side the Atlantic as on that . The same study of the am plications of science to agriculture would place our f*mcrs on an equal footing of advantage with those of Great Britain . There is then a wide field in common for the farmers of the two countries , a field where new discoveries benefit all alike . It is this field which is very fully occupied by Mr. Stephens . There are many minute details , many accounts of elaborate processes in cultivation , or in farm management , which would be inapplicable , in this country ; but even from among these , the attentive reader may collect ideas and hints of great value . Mr. Stephens belongs , in all practical matters , to what may be called the exhausting class of writers . Whether it is the handle of a plow , the manger in a stable , the ornamental work on a harness , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite evident that he has considered the matter thoroughly , in every possible light , and by the aid of every accessible authority ; in their proper sphere and position , he has bestowed as much consideration upon these as upon the most important points . This descent into all the minuti of his subject , whatever this may be , this particularity to omit absolutely nothing , which not content with specifying the manner of turning over and mixing a compost heap , also directs the arrangement of the laborers ' clothes that they may not be unnecessarily soiled , constftutes its charm for the practical man . If he is in want of a new process , a new tool , a plan for a building or any part of one , he is not put off with a // vague general description , but has the whole thing laid out , described and figured before him , with an accuracy and fidelity that scarcely admit of any improvement . This is all done so heartily too , he is himself so evidently absorbed and interested in every practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reader is quite led away by him , and is agreeably occupied with what would from most writers be a mass of insufferably dry detail . We find ourselves in the hands of a man who has evidently devoted every thought and energy to the contemplation and investigation of his present subject , and has taken it up as if it were a leading feature of his book , in place of being what another would perhaps have passed unnoticed ; in his company we insensibly imbibe his spirit and become strangely fascinated by the consideration of what shape is most proper for a turnip , or the question as to the direction in which the tail of a young pig curls , and are delighted with the suggestion that vulcanized india rubber strings may be substituted for twine , in fastening on the jackets of sheep . The farmer who commences , then , will find no difficulty in reading the book through , and it is not too much to say that in every department , and in every season , he will find a great variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work follows that of the seasons , commenciug with what may be called the beginning of the farmers ' operations for the year in winter , and following him through the seedtime of spring , and the maturity of summer , till the complete ingatl*ering of autumn brings him round to the starting point again . The character of the climate in the British Islands difters so essentially from- that of our Northern States , that the succession of farm operations can not of course be the same ; but this arran genment , extending through the year , has great conveniences in the definiteness of order which it gives to each kind of work , and our farmers can mentally carry their seedtime or harvest forward or backward , without disturbing the general arrangement . Hitherto we have spoken chiefly of the practical matter embraced in these volumes ; considerations of practice form the greater part of their bulk , and are evidently the favorite topics with the author , who is eminently a practical man . He has , however , in the present edition , been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ample store of informuation on various branches of science connected with agriculture , and has brought them to bear wherever they were important , or necessary , to the elucidation of his topics . In the early part of the work , near a hundred pages are occupied // with a distinct dissertation on the sciences most applicable to agriculture . ' IiTnder this head , mathematics , natural philosophy , chemistry , natural history , comparative anatomy , and veterinary science , are considered . These are again subdivided into mechanics , pneumatics , hydraulics , electricity , optics , heat , meteorology , botany , zoology , and zootomy . Each of these topics is taken up separately , and treated in a clear , condensed form , showing why its applications are valuable , and indicating the nature of some of the most important among them . They are not expanded treatises , for then each would make a volume in its present and possible future applications to agriculture alone , but they point out leading principles distinctly , and form a most valuable compendium of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the whole price of the work , to any farmer who wishes a very general , yet connected view of science , in its applications to his own business . But this is not all of science that we have ; it is brought in with every change of season , and with the maturity of every crop . The latest and best analyses have been collected and inserted in the proper places , so that the composition of each crop succeeds the account of its culture . It is the same with the soil ; the scientific questions connected with its improvement are discussed as well as the practical ; and in the same connection , numerous analyses are given , not only of soils but of manures . The various theories of feeding and fattening animals and of making butter and cheese are discussed and illustrated at great length , and in the same way . It is then not difficult to see that our farmers may derive very great benefit from the perusal of such a work , even in its applications to English practice alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , but of still more value as a book of reference , in almost every season and occupation of the year . It should be added , also , that the Notes of Professor Norton , pointing out the differences in farming operations between this country and England , make the work of much more practical importance to them , while the original matter which they contain enhances materially the value of the book . It is to be hoped that its circulation may be extended , that societies may distribute it among their premiums , and that it may be found in every agricultural library . The foregoing notice of the Farmer 's Guide naturally suggests some thoughts as to the present condition and the future prospects of the New England farmer . It is a melancholy but an indisputable fact , that in the midst of that busy whirl of productive manufacturing energy , of that // resistless , restless , far-reaching spirit of enterprise , and of that high intellectual progress , which marks New England above all other regions of equal size , the farmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vigor , the vivacity , the desire for improvement , and the love of novelty , which have characterized all other professions , are not the leading features among our farmers . An intelligent , law-abiding , and generally religions people , usually well-informed on political , social , and moral questions , with more , perhaps , of the real , sterling New England Pnritan virtues about them than any other class among us , they have shown much apathy , prejudice , and narrowness of conception , on the very subject where they should have been most alive and interested . The great wave of progress has left them stranded , but they act as if they were still afloat , performing the part of successful and skillful navigators . We must not be understood to speak here of all our farmers ; there are districts where decisive improvements have been made , and where a general desire for information prevails . There are also individuals in almost every district , who are advocates for progress , and who are gradually making inroads upon the prejudices around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail over the torpor of the agricultural mind ; a slight suspicion occasionally intrudes itself , that all is not right , or just what it might be ; the leaven of improvement is working , and we here and there see its effects . And is it not full time ? If we go through the far*ming towns of New England , we shall find a very great portion of the cultivated land poorer than it ever was before ; in few of the towns , if we take all of the farms into our account , is it as good as when first broken up by the plow , and in fewer still has it improved under cultivation . There is no disputing this state of things , for it becomes obvious to every careful observer . Manures are wasted or imperfectly preserved , special fertilizers are neglected , an immense quantity of the best land is useless from a superabundance of water , and wide tracts are studded thick with stones , while weeds innumerable struggle with the scanty crops for the possession of the vacant spots ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanty livelihood from those acres which are wide enough to afford an ample competence , and which will do so when he applies the energies of his mind as well as of his body to his own business ; and when he advances far enough in his studies to see that he has not attained positive perfection . But the world will advance , and especially the American por // tion of it , even if we do not ; the resistless tide of western eirngrat*on sweeps steadily on , and each year adds broad and fair kingdoms to the dominion of the plow-share and the sickle . Such wide fields of golden grain never before waved under the autumn sun ; such fertile , garden-like plains never invited the labor of the husbandman , as spread out in the central region of this vast republic . For many years to come the supply of surplus produce from the west will only be limited by the demand , and by the means of transportation . Each year sees new avenues opening . Pennsylvania , New York , and Canada , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the chan nels through which the teeming abundance of the west shall pour out upon the Atlantic coast . By the close of another year , lines of uninterrupted communication will have penetrated Michigan and Illinois , and ere long , one continuous railway will stretch from the Atlantic to the Mississippi ; and on still beyond are in progress the first forty miles of that road which is intended to span the whole broad continent . What limit can be fixed to the overflowing plenty which will roll in upon us through . this great artery of circulation ? The produce of millions of fertile acres , requiring nothing but the plow and the seed , of whole States , where the cry is , " for men to furrow our ground and gather our harvests , and we will feed the world , " comes swelling on in an ever-increasing tide , overpowering all competition , and almost defying rivalry . There is , moreover , no prospect of cessation , but rather one of indefinite increase . We have not yet come to the utmost capacity even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables them to do more ; the railways may be said , as to their power of transportation , to have done as yet little more than to make a commencement . That commencement , however , is an earnest of the steady stream that they will one day bear onward to the seaboard , alike in winter 's frost and in summer 's drought . Is , then , the New England farmer to sink in this torrent ? Can his rocky slopes and scanty meadows compete with that western garden ? Is not everything against him ? Before he gives up , let him make one effort , and bracing himself on his rugged hills , with the unquenchable spirit of his race , see if there is no chance of success left ; if there is no hope that he can do more than struggle on under disadvantage and discouragement . That the farmer has done much already has been admitted ; the great improvements in stock and in implements , within the past few years , have been evident to every observer . Still , even this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beheld in other departments of industry ; and when , according // to the views previously advanced , we come to the soil , the difference in comparison is still more obvious . We have then several points to consider . The present condition of our farming interest , advancing but slowly where it does advance , and in many districts retrograding in some respects , is evidently not what it should be . What is the precise difficulty , and what are the prospects of an improvement in this state of thin bs ? The disadvantages of our condition and course have been mentioned ; let us see if there are not some advantages to counterbalance them . In the first place , nearness to the great markets is a point of high importance . We hear of great crops at the far west , and are disposed almost to envy their fortunate producers ; but when we come to find what are the prices which they obtain , our illusion is in a measure dispelled , for we discover that the costs of transportation , and of commissions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , with twice the crop , does not probably receive as much as the eastern . This is one comfortable assurance for us , and should go far to make us contented . It does not , however , affect the great fact of the formidable competition to which we are exposed ; whoever gets the profit , the produce must come to the eastward ; if there is an immense surplus , so that prices are low at the west we are sure to feel it , and that in an increasing degree . But , now , suppose that our crops were as large as theirs ; the eastern farmer gets the highest prices of the seaboard , minus a very trifling amount for transportation ; he receives all that in the other cases is expended in passing over a thousand or more miles to market . Here , then , is a most important advantage , a difference that goes far to make up for the higher price of land , for the necessity of improvement , and of liberal manuring . There is no doubt but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better position than any others . But this is exactly the point where we fail , for it is well known that our crops are , as a whole , decidedly less than those of the west . This inferiority , however , it is fearlessly asserted , is not our necessary and nnchan*eable condition . Land can be , and has been brought , even in the roughest of these eastern States , to produce crops of the very largest amount . As much corn per acre is grown on some farms in Yermont and Massachusetts , according to well-authenticated returns , as on the most fertile alluvial soils of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois or ) XTisconsin . Some permnanent meadow land in Connecticut yields as much hay per acre as is taken from any fields in the Union . These are instances either of natural fertility or of skillful improvement , in // most cases of the latter . When the majority of our farmers will adopt similar courses , similar results will tollow . But this canuot be done by working at random , or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money , unless he knows what he is doing when he invests it . The farmer should study the principles of science as applied to his business , and upon those principles found his mode of procedure . He must seek to know of what materials his soil is composed , and then from comparison with highly fertile soils and with the ashes of plants , supply any deficiencies , or remedy any defects that exist , in the most speedy and economical manner . The systems of rotation , and of green cropping , which are founded upon such knowledge as this , should be well understood , and the land farmed accordingly ; not with a view to obtaining all that is possible now , without regard to ultimate consequences , but with the aim of keeping it in condition , and always improving . With this subject would naturally be connected the study of plants , as to their composition and arrangement into classes . There is so great a variety in the proportiops of their various constituents , that the soil which is suitable for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , in some instances be more advantageous to adapt the soil to some particular plant , or on the other hand , to select a plant best adapted to the soil . Here comes in too that system of special manuring , by means of which such remarkable effects have been brought about in Great Britain , enabling the farmer to supply special defects so completely and so economically , as to bring under profitable cultivation , tracts that were before deemed hopelessly barren . He may also by the introduction of draining , with stones or tiles , extend his domain over thousands of acres of the best land , which now lies wholly or partially useless . These improvements involve expense it is true , and are directly opposed to that leading principle of many farmers , to take off as much as they can from their land , and to put on as little as possible ; but it has been proved that they will pay in all cases , where land is within easy reach of markets . There are many farms in New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $70 per acre in improvements , and that pay the interest on even a larger sum than this . The farmer can see the advantage of investing in stocks ; why can not he comprehend that when he invests judiciously in the improvement of his soil , he is far more sure of a return ; no panic , no rival institutions or lines of traffic , can effect him here . It is well for him to reflect also , that when his land is thus brought up to a high state of cultivation , and of fertility , no more will require to be added to keep it // there , than he now expends in producing scanty crops on his worn-out soils ; the labor and general expenses of cultivation are but slightly increased , while the crops are perhaps doubled or tripled . Not less advantageons resnlts may be realized , from a study of the animal economy , with special reference to the various theories of fattening , feeding , the effects of perfect or imperfect shelter , &amp;c . Probably no part of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they are consequently in a great number of cases poor , rough , and scanty . Now , the farmer who desires to compete successfully with the rich prairies of the west , in raising stock , or in dairy produce , one or both of which must be the resource in our more remote mountain districts , should remember that for years he has been selling off flesh , bones , hair , wool , butter , milk , and cheese , all made up from the substance of his pastures . Let him then ascertain of what these articles of traffic consist , and then see how to add their materials to his exhausted fields . There is yet one otter department , to which the farmers in New England may turn their attention with great hope of profit . We refer to Horticulture . The apple , with care , and with a proper adaptation to locality , produces in this climate fruit of the finest quality , and in great abundance . Fine winter apples always command highly remunerative prices , and will of course be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great distance . Pears in perfection , are almost unknown except in the large cities , and even these are extravagantly**high ; fine specimens of the Louise Bonne de Jersey , of the White Doyenn6 , of the Duchesse d ' Angoul*me , and many other choice kinds , will always bring 10 , 12 and 15 cents each , in the New York or Boston markets , and are even then scarce . The White Doyenn6 or Virgalien , is sold in the New York market at $8 to $10 per barrel . And yet there is no fruit more easily raised than the pear . By dwarfing on the quince , it begins to bear in two or three years , and occupies no more room than a currant bush . Wherever there is an old pear tree , bearing those miserable representations of that fruit , that we see in most of our country towns , a few grafts of fine varieties put into its top , will in two or three years bear such specimens as can not be excelled for beauty and flavor . Peaches also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be brought to market in such condition as to bring decidedly higher prices than that from the south . The trees are short-lived , but easily replaced , and rapid in growth . // These are the larger fruits . In favorable situations , some of the smaller , such as raspberries , and strawberries , are equally worthy of attention . They are hardy , easy of cultivation , and sure bearers . With well prepared ground , and proper attention , the crop of strawberries that can be grown on a small plot is truly astonishing . In 1850 , half an acre on the outskirts of one of our cities , cultivated by the owner at leisure intervals , produced strawberries to the value of about $250 , besides a large number of plants that were sold . One or two acres then , in the neighborhood of any large town , or even large village , would remunerate the farmer more highly than any other kind of cultivation and produce more real cash profit , than do many farms of considerable size . It is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable a branch of remunerative cultivation has so long remained neglected . The towns lying along the seacoast , and even many of those quite inland , draw their main supply of fruit at high prices , from New York and New Jersey , while the farmers in their vicinity are contenting themselves with scanty returns from the common crops . In view of all these statements , it seems obvious that the case of our farmers is by no means desperate , if they will but arouse , and help themselves . This , however , is absolutely indispensable . The time has past when antiquity , or dislike of change alone , can sanction any habit of industrial life . It will not answer in this age of the world , even to maintain any fixed standard of excellence . The farmer who has kept his land , even with the utmost care , just equal to its best former condition , during the last ten or twenty years , is lagging behind when his oper*mtions are compared with those of the manufactory or workshop near by , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved , perhaps several times over ; if the same machinery were running there now as ten years ago , if the same processes were used , the goods would be thrown out of market as utterly unable to compete with those produced by means of more recent improvements . So it will be if all the farms in New England shall at once be improved , if the system of agriculture and horticulture shall be brought up fully to the best now practiced in this country . When this is done , as it may and will be some day , can the farmer then sit down to compose himself to r t again , with his work fully accomplished ? By no means ; the west and south will have been advancing too ; means of communication and transportation will have been facilitated , and new methods of // competition devised , so that the struggle must soon be coinmenced anew . There is , therefore , no rest in prospect for the unfortunate agriculturist ; he must arouse from his slumbers or lose his rank among the enterprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused , we point out no future resting or halting place ; we are pitiless , and condemn him to a state of constant mental activity . His sturdy arm has won its utmost from these hills and valleys ; has transformed the wild and rocky desert , and the thick-tangled forest , into fields and villages of smiling and peculiar beauty , such as no other region on this earth can boast ; and now must come , in aid of nobler triumphs , the powers of his mind . It has been already shown that these exercises of the mind lead to highly practicable and profitable results ; but they do far more than that , they tend also to elevate and purify . When the farmer comes to comprehend the wonderful harmony and beauty of the laws which regulate vegetable and animal life ; when he sees how each adaptation has special reference to some great special object , his interest in his own pursuit must become intense . The earth , water , air , and the far-distant sun , must all combine before the germ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue and vary their action constantly till it arrives at maturity ; it then , too , has its part to play ; perhaps it has been destined to form the food of some insect , it may be one so small as almost to escape the naked eye , but yet this plant will never fail to contain all that is required for the nourishment and completion of that tiny frame ; both will be perfect in every part . If we pursue the investigation still farther , we shall find this little insect-creature , when placed under the microscope , glowing perhaps with gorgeous coloring , or clothed in a polished coat of mail , or exhibiting a wonderful apparatus of offense or defense ; in some way it will become evident that it also has been created for , and adapted to , some special purpose . Thus , the observer goes on , until he finds himself as it were touching the chords of a vast harmonious whole . A constant and measured succession of changes is going on about him in which he begins to perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the falling dew , the gentle shower , the raging tempest , the summer 's sun and warmth , the winter 's frost and snow , the fires of volcanic action , the ever-moving air , the fleecy cloud , each , all have their work to do in close connection with animate and inanimate life , from the most minute to the most gigantic form ; they unitedly continue one great circle of changes and transformations , of which this earth is the theater // 504 JYdson ' 8 Ohurch Identified . and support . From things without form , and from the viewless air , are built up all shapes of life and beauty , and these in their death and decay only furnish the materials for new creations ; nothing is lost , but all is changed . And we , too , participate in this great circle of movement and transformation ; our bodies are changed , day by day , and though the same outwardly in appearance , our actual substance is not what it was , even a few years ago . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and privileged in common with the great Creator to watch their course . Who can say what the farmers of New England shall become when such subjects as these are fairly before their minds , when they see themselves , under an overruling Providence which determines the succession and character of the seasons , gaining daily more and more power over their fields , and flocks , and herds , over nature herself , becoming able to see where all before was darkness , to guide and direct where all before was chance . Already so practical and sagacious in many things , can they not see where their true interest lies ; already an intelligent , and as a whole , a religious class , can they not perceive the exalting and ennobling influence of such a study ? Is it not then the duty of every true son of the Pilgrim Fathers , of all who love that Bible which they brought over , and whose impress they stamped so deeply on this western world , of all who would see New England homes filled with prosperous and contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge which , while it leads to the increase of every temporal good , points as plainly upward as do the thousand spires of our native hills ?
