txt ART . I.-ALTON LOCKE . Alton Locke : Tailor and Poet. - An Autobiography . Tins is the title of a work , which has already been for several years before the public on both sides of the water , and has had an immensely wide circulation . It has been eagerly devoured by a multitude of delighted admirers , whose style of thought and principles of taste it accurately and brilliantly reflects , and who feel for it and its author that affectionate enthusiasm , which is always excited in us towards one who succeeds in giving eloquent expressions to our own opinions and emotions . The fact that the work has found so many admirers , both in England and with us , does not prove that it has made converts to the opinions of its author on certain social and religions questions , but only that multitudes were converted already , and only needed to find some fervid and striking utterance of notions , they were already vaguely and indistinctly entertaining . In one respect , indeed , it is a favorable indication in regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view we may take of the author 's opinions . It shows that public atten // tion is awake to those great social evils , which still exist , to mock at our boasted social progress , and to disgrace both the religion and the freedom of the nineteenth century . Morbid sensibility even to these evils is a better indication for the fLiture , than that dead apathy which has too long been exhibited by the most enlightened classes in all civilized countries . There is some reason to suspect , that there is another large class of readers of the book , who sympathize with whatever of the spirit of philanthropy it exhibits , and who deeply and feelingly deplore the social evils which it depicts ; but they still feel that its views are unsound and unsafe , and that its influence on the young , who are its most interested and admiring readers , is to be distrusted and deplored . And yet it may be doubted whether they are themselves sufficiently masters of the questions of trade and political economy which pervade the book , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their distrust and aversion . We are mistaken if the views taken of this class of subjects , even by many of the most cultivated minds among us , are not vague and unsatisfactory . Their feelings are on the one hand humane and philanthropic , and on the other sober , and in the true sense of the word , conservative . But these questions they have not thought out , and settled on a rational and satisfactory basis . They hold to old opinions from conservative taste , and are all the while taunted by the uncomfortable suspicion , that their opinions and their philanthropy are in conflict with each other . They are consciously unable to defend their opinions against themselves , much more against the assaults of an excited and revolutionary radicalism . They need a clearer and more comprehensive view of the subject . Alton Locke belongs to a class of fictitious writings , very numerous of late , in which thtm*h the authors are not negligent of the attractions of thrilling and tragic incident , they have made it still subordinate to the inculcations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religion . We have said their opinions , and yet it is not mere opinions , which this class of authors would promulgate through their fictitious narrative , but the intensity of their love , the bitterness of their hatred , the enthusiasm of their hopes , the fervor of their emotions . The appeal is not to the cold intellect of the reader , but to the emotions of his heart , and the convictions of his moral nature . Viewed in this light this class of fictions belong not to the mere didactic , but to the poetic , the dramatic , and often even to the tragic . Though the Coelebs in search of a wife of Hannah More , and Uncle Tom 's Cabin are both works of didactic // fiction , no two compositions could well be more unlike in their real nature and spirit . The one is a series of instructions , slightly enlivened by being woven into a warp of incident . The other is an epic , wanting only poetic numbers . And yet under another aspect it is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please , not to instruct . It belongs wholly to the fine arts . Uncle Tom 's Cabin , Alton Locke , and all the class of compositions to which they belong , are designed to convince and to persuade . Considered in respect to the design of their authors , they belong rather to the department of oratory , than poetry . They are orations , sermons , dramatized . The more we reflect upon these and similar productions , the more are we convinced that our age has certainly given birth to a new species of literature . There is perhaps some approach to the same thing in the great work of Cervantes , but it is only a very remote approximation . The species is new and it is the product in a great degree of our own age . Nor is it difficult to see how it results from the genei'al spirit and tendency of the age . It is but the utilitarian spirit seizin* on the drama and the epic and forcing them into the service of practical utility . It is only one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this age , to reach and mould the million . It is a recognition of the reign of democracy . These authors have seen and felt the truth , that the destinies of humanity are hereafter not with kings and nobles , but with the people . Whether this new-born species is likely to prove a blessing or a curse to mankind , may perhaps yet be a question . If we admit , as we surely must , that it is a department of literature in which genius , in alliance with freedom and religion , may confer great blessings on mankind , we can not on the other hand deny , that it is also one in which genius in alliance with despotism , impiety , and anarchy , may perpetrate incalculable mischief . And yet in an open field of conflict , where truth and falsehood are equally free to choose their own weapons and their own tactics , the wise man , and the enlightened Christian , will never be distrustful of the result . We hold it to be demonstrable , that under the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself on the side of truth and righteousness . But we must hasten to a more direct examination of the work . The design of this book seems to us to be briefly comprehended in the following statements , viz : // 2 . To exhibit the principle of associated labor , united with the religion of the imagination , under the forms of the Church of England , as the great remedy for existing social evils . These points will be considered in the order in which they have been stated . Our first question then is purely an economical one . Not that we are dealing with a treatise on political economy . The author does not dogmatize . Dogmatism is not his weapon . lie ought not , however , to be surprised , that to an unbeliever , his mode of presenting his views seem more arrogant and offensive , than the most confident dogmatism . He does not draw out his economical creed in the form of propositions-he does not argue for it . That would be to admit that there is some room for plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l ) eyond the necessity of argument , and makes it the ground-work of the whole plot . If the principle of competition be not essentially unjust and tyrannical in its application to the wages of labor , if the poverty , the sordid 111th , the degraded ignorance , the besotted vice , the starvation of the millions , who depend for subsistence on being employed , be not the product of the grinding avarice and the heartless oppression of those who employ them , then is Alton Locke a meaningless book . its moral portraits , though vivid in coloring still , have lost all their power to affect us according to the intention of their author . They are utterly untrue to nature . They may , indeed , be kept hanging in the picture gallery of our imagination , but they will he allowed no place in our philosophy. , We must be excused for thinking , that the fit time for such an assault on the fundamental principles of the Science of Political Economy is not yet ; and that for this reason sober minded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without a considerable measure of indignation . In the present state of the question , the doctrines which underlie the narrative stand in need of clear statements , arid convincing arguments , rather than vivid and tragic pictures . They are fitter themes for philosophy than for poetry , for logic than for rhetoric . Albeit we are well aware that the school to which our author belongs holds logic in very low estimation . We are expected to receive their economies , their intentional theolo*y without any attempts to dissect them into propositions , anX ' grind them in our " logic mills , " or be without further probation written down bigots and fools . Nevertheless , we are so constituted , ( humiliating as the confession may seem , ) that we can not know that we understand a thing till we have stated it ; nor can we prove a thing either // true or fabe , till we understand it . We are compelled , therefore , to interrogate our author for his economical creed , and to state it in a form somewhat definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger of mistake or injustice , in ascribing to kim the following opinions , viz : That the doctrine that the market p rice of any article is the true test of its value , is , when applied to labor , false , tyrannical and oppressive ; that instead of placing the capitalist and the laborer on an equal footing , because each is equally necessary to time other , it places the laborer wholly in the power of the capitalist , to exact his toil for any compensation he chooses to pay ; and this enables the few to fatten on the poverty and misery of the many ; and that every new arrangement of the capitalist , whereby he enlarges the area of competition among laborers , is only a new invention of avarice , to grind the faces of the suffering poor . For example , when the various operations of the tailor 's trade are carried on only in shops kept for that express purpose , in public places convenient for public resort , it is plain that there can be no other competition in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes , and resort to such public places for employment . And as in such shops no laborers are employed except those possessing and those acquiring the full skill of the trade , persons not possessing that skill , and who are prevented by their circumstances from acquiring it , are not permitted to enter into the competition , even for those parts of the work for which skill is not requisite . It is plain then that while the labors of the trade are confined within these conditions , competition must be very limited , and the price paid for labor very high . Let us now suppose that the system is changed , that work is let out to any individual to do at his own home , provided he possesses the skill , and that those parts of the work requiring no unusual skill , are entrusted to any good seamstress , to do it where she pleases and return it to her employer . It is evident that such an arrangemueiit must greatly multiply the competitors for tailor 's work , and ere long reduce its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducements to enterprising men possessing capital , to make such arrangements . By this increased competition among laborers , they can so diminish the cost of producing an article of clothing , that they can offer it to the consumer much cheaper than before , and yet secure to themselves a liberal profit by the operation . Such arrangements have been extensively made in England , and in this country , in the manufacture of clothing , shoes , and perhaps other articles . It is upon such arrangements under // the homely name of " sweating , " that our author 's heaviest indignation falls . It must surely be admitted that if his doctrines on these points are sound and good , if they indicate the true philosophy of industry , then is society in this modern age going on badly enough . There is occasion for all the jeremiads of Carlyle and and his followers . But is it so ? It is easy to paint a man killing a lion . But after all , whether the man killed the lion , or the lion the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination and the line arts . And it is just so in the case before us . It is true , certainly , that such an enlargement of the area of competition , as we have supposed , will greatly reduce the price of clothing to the consumer . So far the effect is very good . It is evident enough that the introduction of manufactured clothing has considerably diminished the cost of living . Still if it can be shown that this advantage has been gained at the expense of pauperism and starvation to a class of our fellowmen , we will abandon it at once , and order all our clothing of the regular tailor , whatever his price may be . But we can not give up so important an advantage without seeing the proof of its unjust and oppressive working . We admit , that throwing the labors of the trade open to a far greater number of operatives , does tend to the reduction of wages . But this is no injustice and no evil . The steam engine has reduced the price of the transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manufacturing cotton goods . Nobody complains of this ; and nobody should complain , because a better economy of labor has reduced the cost of making clothes , and diminished the demand for work to be done on the tailor 's bench . The result will be that fewer men will learn the trade , and more will be occupied in the more active and healthful employments . Besides the cheapening of manufactured clothing will create a greatly increased demand for it . Thousands will buy it , who at former prices would have manufactured their own ; and this again tends to increase demand , furnish employment for an additional number , and even to raise wages . All these things will clearly regulate themselves . But , says an objector , there are scenes of appalling misery here , which you have not yet accounted for , and which are aphically and but too truthfully painted by our author . *iiis is in deed so ; and we have no intention of drawing any veil over these dark and portentous shades in the picture . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overdraw the picture of that wretchedness , which may be // 1855 . Alto , t Locke . found in the cities of Europe , and to some sad extent in our own . The truthful tale of many a starving needle-woman , even on . this side of the Atlantic , would call for all our compassion . But we must not allow even so amiable a sentiment as pity to make us forget our question . Are these sufferings of the poor , which we can never contemplate without the deepest sorrow , and the gloomiest apprehensions , are they caused by competition . in trade , or by any extension of competition ? Let us go back to the department of manufacturing , which has furnished our author his illustrations  --  the tailors . It is true , that under such an extension of competition as we have described , and such as has actually taken place , there will be found in such a city as London , a large number of persons dependent for subsistence on their needles , reduced to the most extreme and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the point of starvation . It is natural enough that they should lay the blame of their wretchedness upon competition , or upon this new extension of competition . But what would have been the con.dition of the same operatives , had no such extension of competition ever taken place ? A few , we admit , would have found ample employment under the old system at very remunerating wages , but scarcely more than find lucrative situations under the new system , as employers , foremen and head-workmen . The great mass of these suffering operatives under the wider competition , are those , who under the old system , had no employment , and were ready to starve for the want of it , and they have simply resorted to this , low as the wages are , for the want of any other . The extension of competition has taken no employment front their hands , or bread from their mouths . It has given them all they have of both . If there were any other employment for them than this , they are just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are then entirely the gainers by an extended competition . The manufacture of clothing employs vastly more unemployed hands , and feeds more hungry mouths , than it could do when confined to the shop of the regular tailor . Where then is the valid objection against carrying competition to its utmost limit ? But , says an objector , " true , open the business to all , but fix the wages on some other principle than competition . Let the employer give the laborer the just and fair value of his labor , without reference to the price it bears in the market . It is no reason why I should enjoy the benefit of another man 's labor for less than its value , because others are not willing to give him what it really is worth . I ought to scorn to take the poor man 's labor for noughL Away then with your principle of // competition , and give the laborer the real value of his services. ** This looks very fair and plausible , and should certainly be examined with care and candor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of labor ? This is a question from which we can not escape . We can not do justice till we know what it is . And discarding competition as inapplicable , how are we to ascertain the true value of a day 's work ? let us suppose a very clear case . The distresses of the needlewomen in some great city have reached the ears of their employers , and afflicted their hearts , and they are enough to move hearts of stone . A meeting of employers has been called to consider what shall be done to relieve all this misery . They are in earnest to do justly , and even mercifully . It is l ) lain the wages of these operatives are not sufficient to sustain them above the point of starvation , and their employers have no heart to murder helpless women for money . They agree at once that , as competition has brought down wages to this ruinous point , they will apply it to the case no more , but pay the women what their work is really worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ask of them . The question then meets them , and must be solved , what is the value of the labor ? I can conceive of but one mode of arriving at a solution . They must ascertain how much time is on an average required to make a given article , say a vest . How much then will it cost the seamstress to live comfortably during that time , and lay by a trifle for future necessities ? Every one says this is right . How then are they to ascertain what her living will cost ? I know of but one way-there is but one . They must ascertain the price of the various articles she must consume ; bread , meat , clothing , rent , fuel . And how shall they ascertain the cost of these ? By the price current of course . And all the world knows that the price current is the product of annpetition . Thus that evil demon with whom we fondly thought we had parted company forever , has us again in his clutch es . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been obliged to doom the agricultural laborer of every grade , the meclanic , and the merchant , to have the value of their labor estimated only in those so much maligned scales of competition . Still it may be said , if the assembled employers go on with what they have undertaken in a spirit of most commendable justice and philanthropy , though they are not likely to escape from the principle of competition altogether , they can protect these poor women from it , and fix them in a comfortable posi // tion , independent alike of the selfishness of employers , and the rivalry of fellow-laborers . Let us see if this is so . The employers proceed with their investigation on the principle already indicated , and come to the conclusion , that a woman ought to receive one dollar for inaking a vest , which they have been accustomed to get made for twenty-five cents . Ah ! exclaim our economical reformers in a chorus , if only employers would deal with such liberality , the " Song of the Shirt " wonid lose its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their wretchedness . Is that quite certain ? Let us see . Of course a vest must now be sold at a higher price , or the employer is ruined . But the dearer the vests are , the fewer will be bought  --  the greater number of families will make their own at home . Consequently our needle-women will have fewer to make than before . We shall soon discover that some of them have no vests to make . They are out of employment , and the terrible work of starvation still goes on . And even this is not the worst of it . What was it that reduced the prices of making a vest to twenty-five cents ? It was the fact that there were enough who would work at that price to make as many vests as the community would buy . Thousands had no thought of making a living by their needle . Their living was secured to them by patrimony at interest , or by the affectionate care of fathers , brothers or husbands . They only employed themselves with their needles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finery , or to enlarge their charities . There are in and around our large cities thousands of women in these very circumstances , who would rather do a little sewing at any price , than be unemployed . These are the women , to a great extent , whose competition reduces the price of making a vest to twenty-five cents . But if the price is raised to one dollar , a great multitude more will be anxious to make vests , who chose to do nothing , rather than make them for twenty-five cents , and our employer will now have ten applicants for work , where his business will justify him in employing but one . What is now to befall our poor needle-woman , who was depending on making vests for a living ? Alas ! if before she was starved by ruinously low wages , she is now no less starved by no wages at all . You have in your kindness protected her from the effect of competition upon her wages , but you have left her all exposed to its still more blighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , competition sustains the same relation to the // science of Political Economy , that gravitation does to mechanics , and the attempt to ascertain the value of any article without appealing to competition , is just like the attempt to ascertain the weight of a body , without appealing to the law of gravitation . And these gifted writers who , like the author of Alton Locke , ex end thefi re of their genius , and the fervor of their emotions , in inflaming popular indignation against the rincile of wages as settled by a free competition between p aboron the one hand , and capital on the other , are just as foolishly , and much more mischievously employed , than they would be in denouncing the science of mechanics , because all machinery is ever subjected to the influence of gravitation and friction . It is no more possible to settle wages without competition , than to make machines to lift the greatest weights without moving power , or to make the heaviest bodies remain at rest when unsupported . We must be permitted then to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the doctrines of political economy is more to the purpose , than all the fine painting of Kingsley , or the new-born political philosophy of this whole school of economical reformers . We are perfectly aware , that in what we have yet said , we have assigned no causes , nor pointed out any remedy for horrible evils which have ever attended on the more advanced stages of civilization , and which our author has graphically painted* We have shown that they are not caused by the principle of competition , and that the y are not to be cured by abandoning or limiting that principle , a and on the principle of competition for the sake of doing justice to the laborer , is like a general destruction of all balances , for the purpose of ascertaining the true weight of the commodities of commerce . What then are the causes of these evils ? And what their cure ? A positive answer to these inquiries would infinitely surpass in value all our negatives . The causes may be chiefly summed up under four heads . Inevitable calamity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One who always knew whereof he affirmed , has said , " The poor ye have always with you . " There is in every community a considerable amount of poverty , which no human foresight or industry could have anticipated or prevented . Disease destroys the power to labor ; death strikes down the husband and father , and leaves the mother and her children helpless and unprovided for . Such poverty we always have in the nmidst of us , and it is the true and proper office of Christian charity to relieve it ; to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction . And in vain do we strive after any such improvement of the social or // industrial system , as will provide against such poverty without the intervention of charity . When our social reformers have done all which they can do , or even conceive of , it will still remain true , that the man whom disease has laid prostrate and powerless , that the mother who is left penniless , with a helpless fhmily on her hands , must suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Extravagant expenditure too , is another fertile source of widespread poverty . It is not our design to enlarge on this topic on the present occasion . No one supposes it strange , if a man wastes his time and his patrimony in field sports , the dram shop , and at the gaming-table , that he becomes poor , and that his wife and children are dwelling in a hovel , starved with hnnger and clothed in rags . And it is no more strange that when nations squander their wealth in intemperance , in the useless decorations of palaces and courts , in armies and navies and warlike enterprises of mad ambition , their people are in poverty and wretchedness . Such has been the history of European expenditure , and such its results . And if such is to be our history we too must in time eat the bitter fruits of wide-spread and hopeless poverty . 13 ut there are two causes of the hopeless poverty of European cities , with which we are in this discussion peculiarly concerned . They are ignorance and vice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , which impress upon that poverty its stamp of hopelessness , and which impart to it an aspect of degradation and brutality , more shocking than all the horrors of mere physical suffering . It is assumed by the political economist , that capital and labor enter into the competition of the market on terms of equality , each equally dependent on the other for the means of gratifying its desires . In theory this is true , and the science of*olitical Economy rightly assumes , that it is true , and builds upon it as a fundamental law . But in that science , as in mechanics , there is sometimes a discrepancy between theory and practice , and in just so far as that discrepancy exists , the results of theory are inapplicable to practice . This presumed equality will not hold in practice , when all the advantages of intelligence , and mental culture are on one side . An ignorant semi-barbarous laborer will always be an easy prey to the educated , shrewd , far-seeing , selfish capitalist . Let us now suppose that a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the children of the great majority , or even of a heavy minority of the people , are left in total ignorance . It is in the first place clear that this uneducated portion are crushed down by the double weight of supe // nor wealth and superior intelligence . They are without the knowledge necessary to avail themselves of the advantages within their reach . Labor in such a case , though hundred handed , is blind , while the capital with which it conies in competition is shrewd , intelligent and sagacious . Such competition must always be unequal to the laborer . Then again this uneducated multitude are excluded from all the more lucrative employments , by the very fact that they are uneducated . They are shut up within that very narrow circle of employments , in which a wholly uneducated man can hope for success , and doomed to be trodden down in the mire of the streets by their mutual rivalries . There can surely be no equality between capital and labor in such circumstances as these . A free government must provide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling Ii orrors of wide-spread poverty must and will overtake a people . We sympathize with all the indignation which pervades Alton Locke , at that heartless and cruel policy of the British government which neglects the education of the laborer . Such neglect is the prolific parent of oppression and self-indulgence in the rich , and of crime and starvation in the poor . We have just as much sympathy for that rich man , who is unwilling to contribute according to his wealth for universal education , as for one who is unwilling to pay his proportion for protecting the cor*munity against thieves , robbers and midnight assassins . Kor can we flatter ourselves that we present any fair view of the subject , unless we exhibit vice as a cause , and a very efficient cause , of the poverty which our author describes . The reader of this book is for the most part led to infer that the selfishness of capitalists produces poverty , and poverty produces vice . The truth is often widely different from all this . In a number of the most revolting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see , that vice was the p rime cause of all . And so it is in real life . It is vice which wastes precious time in selfindulgences . It is vice which squanders every dollar of the laborer 's earnings , so that nothing is laid aside as a provision for future independence . It is vice which brings on debt , and makes the otherwise independent laborer the slave of his cruel and relentless creditor , and swells up the score till emancipation can come only with death . Wherever and whenever the laborer is addicted to self.indulgence , intemperance and sensuality , vice is not so much , not half so much the consequence as the cause of poverty . And while these vices prevail , in vain will reformers denounce the seventies of competition , or the cold-hearted avarice of employers . Let employers be as benev // 173 olent and generous as they may , such laborers will still be slaves , doomed , they and their families , to hopeless poverty . I rejoice in the philanthropy that remembers the suffering poor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If we are rearing up our millions in utter ignorance , and with no settled and abiding principles of virtue and religion , we are maturing a harvest of poverty and wretchedness , which philanthropy will weep over , but can not cure , and from which we can escape by no panacea of political and industrial reform . That this most important point in the whole subject may be made perfectly plain , let us take a hypothetical case . Let us suppose that our modes of physical training were in some way so faulty , that one fourth of our entire population grew up in utter destitution of eyesight , and that by some widely prevalent vice , another quarter of the population were constantly reduced to a like utter blindness by the indulgence of their own guilty passions and lusts . The aggregate result is , that one half of our population enter on mature life blind . They are of course excluded from all those occupations which require eyesight , and confined to such as can be conducted by blind men . Let it now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , applies to all these groping blind millions , the full vigor of the law of competition . What scenes of horror must ensue ! And while the same systems of physical education are adhered to , and the same vices continue to prevail , these same sad scenes must ever be renewed , year after year , and age after age . What think you now of that man , representing himself as a philanthropist by way of eminence , who should employ the lofty powers of genius , " the thoughts that breathe and the words that burn , " to paint these scenes of wretchedness , for the purpose of kindling up the indignation of mankind against the principle of wages , as settled by free competition ? Would you not call his , mistaken philanthropy ' ? No matter how severely or how justly he might rail against the cold-hearted avarice of the rieb , no matter h ow many fine theories he might propose , to enable the blind to protect themselves against the cupidity of their employers . The only true philanthropy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more at fault than the law of gravitation , but to relieve the present sufferers by the liberal gitts of all who have anything to give , and to dry up the fountain of all this misery by putting an end to those horrid systems of education , and protecting the young against the contamination of those destroying vices . And yet the training of vast numbers of the population in ignorance , and the wide prevalence of intemperance and sensu // ality have precisely the same relation to the actual poverty , and all its attendant consequences , which blindness so induced would have in our supposed case . And we must be excused from entertaining any very high respect for that philanthropy , which can do nothing for us but denounce the principle of wages and that great law of nature , competition . It were just as philanthropic to denounce electricity or attraction . No , let the fervid soul and the eloquent tongue be employed to call back the nations to a solemn view of the real cause of all these evils , the utterly neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . awaken the slumbering energies of Christendom to dry the fountains of all these sorrows . We have already so prolonged this discussion that we have little space left to examine the author 's remedies . They are two : Associated labor , and a religion of the imagination , under the forms of the Church of England . In respect to the first of these , associated labor , the author seems to have been aware of the difficulties to be encountered , and has therefore carefully avoided committing himself to any scheme . He has given us no plan of an association , by which laborers might expect to be successful in protecting themselves against the tyranny of capital , and securing their own happi:mess . The thing is rather treated as so obvious , and admitting a solution so easy , that to mention the subject and assure us of its practicability was quite sufficient , without taxing his imagination to paint the system or the process of its development . That indeed is a task which no writer in this school undertakes . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They denounce existing social organizations , and ascribe all the evils that are , and a thousand that are not , except in their own imaginations , to something faulty in our social system , which might be remedied with the greatest facility , if only men would heed their admonitions . But , alas ! for their remedies , we are left to find them out by our own wisdom . They often remind us of a physician , who , on being called to the sick bed , should commence a lecture on the disease , endeavoring to impress on the patient a lively sense of its serious nature and dangerous tendency , and when requested by the agonized sufferer to propose a remedy , he again breaks out in fresh strains of eloquence , exhibiting with new vividness the badness of his case , charging his disease upon the bad habits of his life , his food , his drink , his exercise , his dress , till at last , amid the eagerness of the sufferer and his friends for a remedy , and a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the diseases of the body , who will employ such doctors ? And surely an intelligent // people will not long rely on such for the diseases of ' the soul and the body politic . In the absence therefore of any pretence on the part of our author to have thrown any new light on the vexed question of associated labor , or the possibility of its solution , we forbear to enter on the discussion . The difficulties which are inherent in the problem have hitherto baffled all the ingenuity which has been applied to its solution , and till some more fortunate adventurer in this region , hitherto more disastrous to explorers than the Artic seas , shall have pointed out some more satisfactory solution , the writer who proposes association among laborers , as the remedy for all the evils and oppressions suffered by the laboring poor , must expect that his suggestions , though still accepted it may be by castle-building enthusiasts , will be treated with very little respect by intelligent and sober-minded practical men . There is indeed one modification of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our author , from which sober men seem to expect good . It is supposed by some that laborers may and should learn to protect themselves from the oppressions of capital , by combinations among themselves for fixing and regulating their own wages , or in other words , by the principle of trade unions . It is stated , and we believe with truth , that there are some trades , employing only a small number of men , in which the rate of wages is regulated by such combination over the whole extent of our country . This principle , it is supposed , might be extended to all kinds of labor , and protect effectually the rights of the working mali . It may not be amiss briefly to notice this suggestion before we dismiss this part of our subject . Such combinations are the very worst possible modes of association . The phalanx of Fourier is not more impracticable and disastrous in its consequences . For , in the first place , such combinations are entirely impracticable , except in the case of trades of very limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborers of a nation combine to fix their own wages ? And such a combination must be national or wholly inoperative . Indeed in this country it must be more than national , it must embrace all those nations from which we receive laborers , else the vacancy occasioned by a strike of our laborers will be speedily filled by the coming in of Irish , . English , Germans and Norwegians . Nor is it possible to enforce such an arbitrary tariff of wages over a numerous body of laborers , even in a limited district . Wages which one man will feel to be ruinous another will regard as quite remuner // ating , and he will prefer to accept them rather than be unemployed . Men will , in the long run , find it quite as oppressive to be forbidden to work for low wages as to be forbidden to receive high wages . Either is unmitigated despotism ; neither can be enforced or will be endured by any but slaves . Nor are such combinations less undesirable , than they are impracticable . They are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as much reason in requiring that the commodities of commerce shall be estimated by their bulk instead of their weight , or that wheat shall be sold at all times at the same price , as that work shall be done at all times and by all laborers for the same wages . Let us suppose it were possible for the agricultural laborers of a given community arbitrarily to settle the rate of their compensation by a combination . It is plain that such a power would be equivalent to a power to take possession of the entire landed property of the community wheiiever they pleased . For it would be a power to appropriate to themselves any desired portions or the whole profit of agricultural production at their option . If such a power existed in the laborer , the capitalist would soon be a *eggat , glad to run from his farm to avoid being compelled to take care of it for nothing . It is surely well for society that such combination is impossible . Nor would it be difficult to demonstrate that in those minor trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of all parties suffer by it . The laborers themselves suffer . To allow price to sink to that level to which a free competition would depress it , would increase the business done , and the demand for their work in a rapid ratio , and their employment would be more steady and reliable . If there were any of the trade who could obtain better wages in other employments , they would leave the trade in question and relieve it from their competition . Nor is it more practicable or desirable for capital to protect itself from competition by combination . Each capitalist must and will judge for himself at what rate he would choose to employ his capital rather than that it remain idle , and lie may a thousand times bind himself by a combination , but if he does lie will a thousand times break the bond . Both capital and ' * labor must be free , and dependent for their compensation on competition , and on nothing els* , or injustice and oppression will fall on all alike . We invite all persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regulated by a free competition , to lay aside all excited emotion , and calmly trace through to their ultimate and inevitable results , all those modes of combination and association which have been proposed for // the protection of inj ured classes . We are greatly mistaken or such an inquiry calmly and patiently carried through , will lead any man of ordinary common sense to see that they are all as fallacious as the various inventions of perpetual motions in mechanics , and fallacious for the very same reason . They are one and all attempts to escape from a condition , to which nature 's God hath subjected all things . The religious remedy proposed by our author is worthy of more consideration , because it has much more of the character of a definite prescription than we are accustomed to find in writers of this school . In the first chapter of the book our hero is made to say that " conversion " in his mother 's sense of the word never happened to him . And yet he wa* converted after our author 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conversion and the results of it , he has been betrayed into what seems very much like writing out his religious creed . It may be thought by some , indeed , that it would have been much better if he had confined himself to an exhibition of his own religious views . But he has not done so . He has presented us a picture of Calvinistic theology , which is certainly in its way not a little remarkable . It would be an injustice to the author and to the reader not to give a specimen of it . it should be observed that our hero 's mother was trained an Independent , but had joined the Baptists , because she thought them the more rigid and consistent Calvinists . " My mother moved by rule and method , by God 's law , as she considered it , and that only . She seldom smiled . Her word was absolute . She never commanded twice without punishing . And yet there were abysses of unspoken tenderness in her , as well as clear , sound womanly sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep down all tenderness as if she had been some ascetic of the middle ages-so do extremes meet ! It was carnal , ' she considered . She had as yet no right to have any spiritual affection ' for us , ( her children . ) We were still children of wrath and of the devil - not yet convinced of sin , converted , born again . ' She had no more spiritual bond with us , she thought , than she had with a heathen or a Papist . She dared not even pray for our conversion , earnestly as she prayed on every other subject . For though the majority of her sect would have done so , her clear logical sense would yield to no such tender inconsistency . Had it not been decided from all eternity ? We were elect or we were reprobate . Could her prayers alter that ? If He had chosen us He would call us in his own good time : and if not // Only again and again , as I afterwards discovered from a journal of hers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her mind at rest , by revealing to her His will toward us . For that comfort she could at least rationally pray . But she received no answer . " And yet , with all this , she kept the strictest watch over our morality . Fear , of course , was the only motive she employed ; for how could our still carnal understandings be affected with love to God ? And love to herself was too paltry and temporary , to be urged by one who knew that her life was uncertain , and who was always trying to go down to the deepest eternal ground and reason of every thing , and take her stand on that . So our God , or Gods rather till we were twelve years old , were hell , the rod , the ten commandments , and public opinion. ** Carlyle has somewhere a rather edifying passage about people being more afraid of the dead Satans of the olden time , than of the living Satans of their own . Surely our author is one of that sort of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , and is showing it as a veritable monster of our own age . If he does not intend this as a picture of the Calvinistic theology of the nineteenth century , he has expressed himself in a most unguarded and unfortunate manner . The reader can hardly help so understanding him . If he does so intend , then are we sorely at a loss , whether to ascribe it to unpardonable ignorance , or to a malice still more inexcusable . A man of our author 's genius , and a Clergyman of the English establishment , should not resort to that stale and vulgar artifice of infidelity , to caricature and utterly misrepresent the religious system he wishes to assail . Such a trick would excite the suspicion , that the author belongs in bad company . We have quoted but a specimen-it is by no means a solitary specimen  --  to the same purpose . Others in the same spirit might be indefinitely multiplied . We can not forbear remarking on his caricature of modern missions to the heathen . A misrepresentation more flagrant can scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sustains no relation to the plot of the work , and we can really assign no other motive for its introduction than " malice aforethought . " The whole passage referred to , which want of space forbids our quoting , is intensely unchristian-if the clergy of the English establishment make any pretentious to Christianity , it is unclerical . We submit to every candid reader , if it is not an act of unparalleled baseness , for one professing himself to be a minister of the gospel , to employ a popular work of fiction as an instrument of casting discredit and contempt upon the // Careys , the Morrisons , the Judsons , and a host of others of whom the world was not worthy , who have devoted their lives to the propagation of the gospel in pagan lands . If it be said that such was not the intention of the author , we reply , such a vindication can not be sustained . It is the design of the passage referred to , to cast contempt upon English Baptist Missions and missionaries to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of William Carey is the fittest possible representative of those very missions ? William Carey , a man who achieved niore for learning and more for human wellbeing on his actual shoe-maker 's bench , than the fictitious hero , Alton Locke , ever achieved on the tailor 's bench , even in the imagination of our author . And yet such actual triumphs of a working man , are to be held up to derision wherever the English language is spoken , by this clerical advocate of the working men But it is time to examine the author 's own creed . And as he has preferred for the most part the concrete form of expression , we will follow the same method . He seems to have very little faith even in his gospel , when addressed to the youth , amid the unmitigated fervor of his passion , and in the full career of his ambition . Nothing more can be done ? br such an one , than to apply any little checks which may be necessary to prevent instant destruction . The passions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , which must run their course , and the only hope of the patient is in applying restoratives at the crisis . Accordingly the process of converting our hero is deferred till his plans have ended in prison , and in utter disappointment , resulting in a most violent attack of fever . As soon as the wild fantasies of a fevered brain have passed away , ( which indeed are made to perform an important part in preparing his mind for what was to follow , ) and while he is yet exceedingly weak and prostrate upon his bed , a high-born lady , who had been the guardian angel of his life without his knowing it , and who had become the true and accepted priestess of a religion , which turns out to be a strange compound of popery and transcendental mysticism , begins the work of preaching this new gospel to him . Among her first and most effective lessons are pictures , arranged around his bed , where his eye must fall on them first when he wakes , and last before he sleeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures are the books of the unlearned , and of the mislearned too . Glorious IRaffaelle ! Shakspeare of the south ! Mighty preacher , to whose blessed intuition it was given to know all human hearts , to embody in form and color all spiritual truths , common alike to Protestant and Papist , to workman and to sage . 0 that I may meet thee // before the throne of God , if it be but to thank thee for that one picture , in which thou didst reveal to me in a single glance , every step of my own spiritual history . " What a pity that all wicked people could not have IRaffaclle 's pictures hanging about their beds ! The world might soon be converted ! 0 that our Missionary , Tract , and Sunday School societies would be instructed by these new prophets , to employ artists , to multiply indefinitely the copies of lRaffaelle 's pictures , and hang them up in every back-woodsman 's cabin . How much more hopeful such a mode of procedure , than the vulgar custom of distributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has come down to us from the dark ages of the past ! When will men learn wisdom from these new oracles ! All this suggests again that lesson which Carlyle has been so long teaching , and which we have been so slow to learn , that Shakspeare is not only the greatest of poets and dramatists , but the most religious of writers . Our author is indeed a little in advance of his master . Carlyle only talks of Shakspeare 's religion ; our author proceeds to apply the doctrine to practice by directly employing Shakspeare and other poets in converting sinners . This is just what should be expected-the age is progressive . Accordingly in the case of our hero , the gospel of pictures was not relied on alone to work the desired change . " She * * * used to sit and read to me from the Bible , from poets , from every book which could suggest soothing , graceful , or hopeful images . " At one time selections were made from Thomas a Ikempis , now from the Psalmist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now from the evangelic narrative . Tennyson , too , proved a gospel preacher of great power and efficacy . Having pursued this poetic treatment for a considerable time , our priestess commences in good earnest the work of preaching . She spoke of Christ as near , as the great IReformer , yet as the true conservative , as the inspirer of all new truthsas the true demagogue  --  the true friend of the poor-as the true King , as the Creator , the Word , the inspirer , the only perfect Artist , the Fountain of all genius , especially as the model of all men of genius . Some of the terms here employed might lead to the supposition that our author intended to present something like an orthodox view of Christ . But the connection in which we find such words Creator , Word , Kino ' we liberty to as are miot at understand them in the scriptural and evangelical sense , but in the poetic ; or , if we may so speak , the Carlylean sense . In // this *respect our author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearty good will . An incautious reader may sometimes peruse pages from either of these authors , without ever suspecting that he is not reading stray leaves from some Calvanistic sermon . The words are the same , but the thinking reader perceives , that there is no community whatever of meaning and spirit . A poetical , mystical , transcendental sense , has been infused into the language , both of the Scriptures and of the old Calvinistic divines . In this sense we are forced to understand the language above . But to proceed with our author 's creed . Christ dying for us is several times alluded to , but his dying for sins , never . Of the moral government of God and of the forgiveness of sins there is not one word , nor any intimation that any is needed . The poor patient discovers in the course of one of these conversations , that this noble hearted woman , ( for such she truly is , ) has been the guardian angel of his life . He reproaches himself most severely for his ignorance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiot and an ingrate for his treatment of her . But for all his past ignorance and contempt of Christ , there are no confessions , no self-reproaches , and no petitions for forgiveness . That was all the fault of the ministers , that they did not preach better . If they had exhibited to him Christ as this woman had now done , he would long ago have been a Christian . Why then should he blame himself for what was so obviously the fault of the ministers ? Yes , here is a conversion by the method of the imagination  --  a conversion without one confession of sin towards God or petition for forgiveness from God . And this is the doctrine preached by a distingushed clergyman of the English establishment-one who we are told , is shortly to visit this country , for the purpose of officiating at the consecrating of a Protestant church . This is the gospel of the imagination . It ought to be entitled " religion reduced to a fine art , or salvation without repentance or forgiveness . " In the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls upon that ancient stumbling block of the sceptic , miracles . The difficulty which he meets is one which is often met among ourselves , especially in dealing with those who are in any degree imbued with the doctrines of the transcemidental school . A umiracle is not unfrequently , and perhaps not very inaccurately , defined to be a suspension of the established laws of nature by an immediate exertion of divine power . Against miracles as thus defined , the objector declares that he is shocked at the thought , that God should suspend and violate // his own laws . Our author answers in substance that this is a false definition , that in events which seem to us miraculous , God does not suspend or violate the laws of nature , but only works by higher laws , with which we are not acquainted . Now we submit that this is not the answer which the case calls for . The whole plausibility of this objection lies in a failure to notice an ambiguity in the word law . The primary and most proper meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sense of tI* e word we are shocked at the idea that God should suspend or violate his own laws-that he should give laws to his subjects which he himself disregards . But this is not all the meaning of the word , when we speak of the laws of nature . By this phrase we mean to describe the uniform methods in which the powers of nature act , or rather in which God acts through them . It is a figurative use of the word law . We mean to say , that natural phenomena follow a uniform course with as much regularity as though they were invested with free will , and obeyed a law which God had prescribed for them . In the phrase " laws of nature " there is therefore no implication of a rule of duty either to God or man . It is dead matter to which those laws are addressed , or rather on which they are impressed . The phrase expresses the customary methods by which God governs the material universe . Is there then anything shocking , revolting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferring the highest benefits on mankind , sometimes deviates from his custom and makes universal manifestations of his power and presence ? Our consciousness answers , no ! We do not believe that any candid man can profess to be morally shocked at this view of a miracle . And yet this and this only , is the view of miracles exhibited in the Scriptures and received by the great mass of sober-minded Christians in every age . And miracles as thus defined can not be successfully assailed by any weapons which can be drawn from the storehouse of metaphysics . They must stand or fall with the evidence exhibited in support of them . We have no fear for the result . There are other points in this creed which are invested with grave importance , and are well worthy of examination . But we have transcended our limits and exhausted the patience of the reader . We will only say in conclusion , that while we are cheerful to concede to this book power of conception , vivid coloring , graphic painting , we can go no farther in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pride and bitterness , his views of political economy are shallow and false , and will lead any man who adopts them into impracticable schemes and pitiable delusions . His religious views are // pr&amp;minently superficial , unsound and unpractical . He hates the doctrines of the Reformation with a cordial hatred , but proves himself too ill-informed what they are to state them with any semblance of correctness . lie writes a book to advocate the cause of the workingmen , and in it holds up to derision the life-labor of such a man as William Carey , one of the noblest work*ngrnen England ever produced . He speaks in exalted terms of Jesus Christ , but utterly discards whatever is most characteristic in His life and teachings . That such a book should be devoured with the avidity it is , without producing much evil , is surely what we are not prepared to believe . And yet we will not , can not wholly condemn the book . The Roman Senate returned public thanks to the general who had fought and lost the disastrous battle of Cannte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we confess a similarly kindly feeling towards any man , however mistaken , who calls earnest attention to the sufferings of the neglected and famishmo ' laborer . And so far as this author has contributed anything to accomplish this result , he deserves the thanks of his generation . To impart the blessings of Christian civilization to the laborer is the great problem of this age , and must be solved , or all our hopes are doomed to a bitter disappointment .
