txt WILLIAM PITT . BY LORD MACAULAY . WILLIAM PITT , the second son of William Pitt , Earl of Chatham , and of Lady Hester Grenville , daughter of Hester , Countess Temple , was born on the 28th of May , 1759 . The child inherited a name which , at the time of his birth , was the most illustrious in the civilized world , and was pronounced by every Englishman with pride , and by every enemy of England with mingled admiration and terror . During the first year of his life every month had its illuminations and bonfires , and every wind brought some messenger charged with joyful tidings and hostile standards . In Westphalia the English infantry won a great battle which arrested the armies of Louis the Fifteenth in the midst of a career of conquest : Boscawen defeated one French fleet on the coast of Portugal : Hawke put to flight another in the Bay of Biscay : Johnson took Niagara : Amherst took Ticonderoga : Wolfe died by the most enviable of deaths under the walls of Quebec : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established the English supremacy in Bengal : Coote routed Lally at Wandewash , and established the English supremacy in the Carnatic . The nation , while loudly applauding the successful warriors , considered them all , on sea and on land , in Europe , in America , and in Asia , merely as instruments which received their direction // from one superior mind . It was the great William Pitt , the great commoner , who had vanquished French marshals in Germany , andFrench admirals on the Atlantic ; who had conquered for his country one great empire on the frozen shores of Ontario , and another under the tropical sun near the mouths of the Ganges . It was not in the nature of things that popularity such as he at this time enjoyed should be permanent . That popularity had lost its gloss before his children were old enough to understand that their father was a great man . He was at length placed in situations in which neither his talents for administration nor his talents for debate appeared to the best advantage . The energy and decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not needed in time of peace . The lofty and spirit-stirring eloquence , which had made him supreme in the House of Commons , often fell dead on the House of Lords . A cruel malady racked his joints , and left his joints only to fall on his nerves and on his brain . During the closing years of his life , he was odious to the court , and yet was not on cordial terms with the great body of the opposition . Chatham was only the ruin of Pitt , but an awful and majestic ruin , not to be contemplated by any man of sense and feeling without emotions resembling those which are excited by the remains of the Parthenon and of the Coliseum . In one respect the old statesman was eminently happy . Whatever might be the vicissitudes of his public life , he never failed to find peace and love by his own hearth . He loved all his children , and was loved by them ; and , of all his children , the one of whom he was fondest and proudest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition displayed themselves with a rare and almost unnatural precocity . At seven , the interest which he took in grave subjects , the ardor with which he pursued his studies , and the sense and vivacity of his remarks on books and on events , amazed his parents and instructors . One of his sayings of this date was reported *o his mother by his tutor . In August , 1776 , when the world was agitated by the news that Mr. Pitt bad become Earl of Chatham , little William exclaimed , " I am glad that I am not the eldest son . I want to speak in the House of Commons like papa . " A letter is extant in which Lady Chatham , a woman of considerable abilities , remarked to her lord , that their younger son at twelve had left far behind him his elder brother , who was fifteen . " The fineness , " she wrote , " of William 's mind makes him enjoy with the greatest pleasure what would be above the reach of any other creature of his small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man . Hayley , who met him at Lyme in the summer of 1773 , was astonished , delighted , and somewhat overawed , by hearing wit and wisdom from so young a mouth . The poet , indeed , was afterward sorry that his shyness had prevented him from submitting the plan of an extensive literary work , which he was then meditating , to the judgment of this extraordinary boy . The boy , indeed , had already written a tragedy , bad of course , but not worse than the tragedies of his friend . This piece is still preserved at Chevening , and is in some respects highly curious . There is no love . The whole plot is political ; and it is remarkable that the interest , such as it is , turns on a contest about a regency . On one side is a faithful servant of the Crown , on the other an ambitious and unprincipled conspirator . At length the King , who had been missing , reappears , resumes his power , and rewards the faithful defender of his rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have no hesitation in pronouncing that the play was written by some Pittite poetaster at the time of the rejoicings for the recovery of George the Third in 1789 . The pleasure with which William 's parents observed the rapid development of his intellectual powers was alloyed by apprehensions about his health . lie shot up alarmingly fast ; he was often ill , and always weak ; and it was feared that it would be impossible to rear a stripling so tall , so slender , and so feeble . Port wine was prescribed by his medical advisers ; and it is said that he was at fourteen accustomed to take this agreeable physic in quantities which would , in our abstemious age , be thought much more than sufficient for any full-grown man . This regimen , though it would probably have killed ninety-nine boys out of a hundred , seems to have been well suited to the peculiarities of William 's constitution ; for at fifteen he ceased to be molested by disease , and , though never a strong man , continued , during many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate and of summers passed in London , to be a tolerably healthy one . It was probably on account of the delicacy of his frame that he was not educated like other boys of the same rank . Almost all the eminent English statesmen and orators to whom he was afterward opposed or allied-North , Fox , Shelburne , Windham , Grey , Wellesley , Grenville , Sheridan , Canning-went through the training of great public schools . Lord Chatham had himself been a distinguished Etonian ; and it is seldom that a distinguished Etonian forgets his obligations to Etpn . But William 's infirmities required a vigilance and tenderness such as could be found only at home . He was therefore bred under the . paterual roof . His studies were superintended by a clergyman named Wilson ; and those studies , though often interrupted by illness , were prosecuted with extraordinary success . Before the lad had coimpleted his fifteenth year his knowledge both of the ancient languages and of mathematics was such as very few men of eighteen then carried up to college . He was therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pembroke Hall , in the University of Cambridge . So young a student required much more than the ordinary care which a college tutor bestows on undergraduates . The governor , to whom the direction of William 's academical life was confided , was a bachelor of arts named Pretyman , who had been // senior wrangler in the preceding year , and who , though not a man of prepossessing appearance or brilliant parts , was eminently acute and laborious , a sound scholar , and an excellent geometrician . At Cambridge , Pretyman was , during more than two years , the inseparable companion , and indeed almost the only companion , of his pupil . A close and lasting friendship sprang up between the pair . The disciple was able , before he completed his twenty-eighth year , to make his preceptor Bishop of Lincoln and Dean of St. Paul 's ; and the preceptor showed his gratitude by writing a Life of the disciple , which enjoys the distinction of being the worst biographical work of its size in the world . Pitt , till he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and evening , dined every day in ball , and never went to a single evening party . At seventeen he was admitted , after the bad fashion of those times , by right of birth , without any examination , to the degree of Master of Arts . But he continued during some years to reside at college , and to apply himself vigorously , under Pretyman 's direction , to the studies of the place , while mixing freely in the best academic society . The stock of learning which Pitt laid in during this part of his life was certainly very extraordinary . In fact , it was all that he ever possessed ; for he very early became too busy to have any spare time for books . The work in which he took the greatest delight was Newton 's Principia . His liking for mathematics , indeed , amounted to a passion , which , in the opinion of his instructors , themselves distinguished mathematicians , required to be checked rather than encouraged . The acuteness and readiness with which he solved problems was pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days presided over the disputations in the schools and conducted the examinations of the Senate House , to be unrivaled in the University . Nor was the youth 's proficiency in classical learning less remarkable . In one respect , indeed , he appeared to disadvantage when compared with even second-rate and third-rate men from public schools . He had never , while under Wilson 's care , been in the habit of composing in the ancient languages ; and he therefore never acquired that knack of.versification which is sometimes possessed by clever boys whose knowledge of the language and literature of Greece and Rome is very superficial . It would have been utterly out of his power to produce such charming elegiac lines as those in which Wellesley bade farewell to Eton , or such Virgilian hexameters as those in which Canning described the pilgrimage to Mecca . But it may be doubted whether any scholar has ever , at twenty , had a more solid and profound knowledge of the two great tongues of the old civilized world . The facility with which he penetrated the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran critics . He had set his heart on being intimately acquainted with all the extant po etry of Greece , and was not satisfied till he had mastered Lycophron 's Cassandra , the most obscure work in the whole range of ancient literature . This strange rhapsody , the difficulties of which have perplexed and repelled many excellent scholars , " he read , " says his preceptor , " with an ease at first , which , if I had not witnessed , I should have thought beyond the compass of human intellect . " To modern literature Pitt paid comparatively little attention . He knew no living language except French , and French he knew very imperfectly . With a few of the best English writers he was intimate , particularly with Sbakspcare and Milton . The debate in Pandemonium was , as it well deserved to be , one of his favorite passages ; and his early friends used to talk , long after his death , of the just emphasis and the melodious cadence with which they had heard him recite the incomparable speech of Belial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art of managing his voice  --  a voice naturally clear and deep-toned . His father , whose oratory owed no small part of its effect to that art , had been a most skillful and judicious instrnctor . At a later period the wits of Brookes 's , irritated by observing , night after night , how powerfully Pitt 's sonorous elocution fascinated the rows of country gentlemen , reproached him with having been " taught by his dad on a stool . " His education , indeed , was well adapted to form a great parliamentary speaker . One argument often urged against those classical studies which occupy so large a part of the early life of every gentleman bred in the south of our island is that they prevent him from acquiring a command of his mother tongue , and that it is not unusual to meet with a youth of excellent parts who writes Ciceronian Latin prose and Horatian Latin Alcaics , hut who would find it impossible to express his thoughts in pure , perspicuous , and forcible English . There may , perhaps , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pitt were carried on in a peculiar manner , and had the effect of enriching his English vocabulary , and of making him wonderfully expert in the art of constructing correct English sentences . His practice was to look over a page or two of a Greek or Latin author , to make himself master of the meaning , and then to read the passage straight forward into his own language . This practice , begun under his first teacher , Wilson , was continued under Pretyman . It is not strange that a young man of great abilities , who had been exercised daily in this way during ten years , should have acquired an almost unrivaled power of putting his thoughts , without premeditation , into words wellselected and well-arranged . Of all the remains of antiquity , the orations were those on which he bestowed the most minute examination . His favorite employment was to compare harangues on opposite sides of the same question , to analyze them , and to observe which of the arguments of the first speaker // were refuted by the second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor was it only in books that he at this time studied the art of parliamentary fencing . When he was at home he bad frequent opportunities of hearing important debates at Westminster ; and he heard them , not only with interest and enjoyment , but with a close , scientific attention resembling that with which a diligent pupil at Guy 's Hospital watches every turn of the hand of a great surgeon through a difficult operation . On one of these occasions Pitt , a youth whose abilities were as yet known only to his own family , and to a small knot of college friends , was introduced on the steps of the throne in the House of Lords to Fox , who was his senior by eleven years , and who was already the greatest debater , and one of the greatest orators , that had appeared in England . Fox used afterward to relate that , as the discussion proceeded , Pitt repeatedly turned to him and said , " But surely , Mr. Fox , that might be met thus ; " or , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What the particular criticisms were , Fox had forgotten ; but he said that he was much struck at the time by the precocity of a lad who , through the whole sitting , seemed to be thinking only how all the speeches on both sides could be answered . One of the young man 's visits to the House of Lords was a sad and memorable era in his life . He had not quite completed his nineteenth year , when , on the 7th of April , 1778 , he attended his father to Westminster . A great debate was expected . It was known that France had recognized the independence of the United States . The Duke of Richmond was about to declare his opinion that all thought of subjugating those states ought to be relinquished . Chatham had always maintained that the resistance of the colonies to the mother country was justifiable . But he conceived , very erroneously , that on the day on which their independence should be acknowledged the greatness of England would be at an end . Though sinking under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the entreaties of his family , to be in his place . His son supported him to a seat . The excitement and exertion were too much for the old man . In the very act of addressing the peers , he fell back in convulsions . A few weeks later his corpse was borne , with gloomy pomp , *from the Painted Chamber to the Abbey . The favorite child and namesake of the deceased statesman followed the coffin as chief mourner , and saw it deposited in the transept where his own was destined to lie . His elder brother , now Earl of . Chatham , had means sufficient , and barely sufficient , to support the dignity of the peerage . The other members of the family were poorly provided for . William had little more than three hundred a year . It was necessary for him to follow a profession . He had already begun to eat his terms . In the spring of 1780 he came of age . He then quitted Cambridge , was called to the bar , took chambers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the autumn of that year a general election took place ; and he offered himself as a candidate for the university ; but be was at the bottom of the poll . It is said that the grave doctors who then sat , robed in scarlet , on the benches of Golgotha , thought it great presumption in so young a man to solicit so high a distinction . He was , however , at the request of a hereditary friend , the Duke of Rutland , brought into Parliament by Sir James Lowther for the borough of Appleby . The dangers of the country were at that time such as might well have disturbed even a constant mind . Army after army had been sent in vain against the rebellions colonists of North America . On pitched fields of battle the advantage had been with the disciplined troops of the mother country . But it was not on pitched fields of battle that the event of such a contest could be decided . An armed nation , with hunger and the Atlantic for auxiliaries , was not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dust a few years before by the genius and vigor of Chatham , had seized the opportunity of revenge . France and Spain were united against us , and had recently been joined by Holland . The command of the Mediterranean had been for a time lost . The British flag had been scarcely able to maintain itself in the British Channel . The northern powers professed neutrality ; but their neutrality had a menacing aspect . In the East , Hyder had descended on the Carnatic , had destroyed the little army of Baillie , and had spread terror even to the ramparts of Fort government had sunk to the lowest point . The King and the House of Commons were alike unpopular . The cry for parliamentary reform was scarcely less loud and vehement than in the autumn of 1830 . Formidable associations , headed , not by ordinary demagogues , but by men of high rank , stainless character , and distinguished ability , demanded a revision of the representative system . The populace , emboldened by the impotence and irresolution of the government , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Legislature , hustled peers , hunted bishops , attacked the residences of embassadors , opened prisons. , burned and pulled down houses . London had presented during some days the aspect of a city taken by storm ; and it had been necessary to form a camp among the trees of St. James 's Park . In spite of dangers and difficulties , abroad and at home , *Ileorge the Third , with a firmness which had little affinity with virtue or with wisdom , persisted in his determination to put down the American rebels by force of arms ; and his ministers submitted their judgment to his . Some of them were probably actuated merely by selfish cupidity ; but their chief , Lord North , a man of high honor , amiable temper , winning manners , lively wit , and excellent talents 1 ) 0th for business and for debate , must be acquitted of all sordid // motives . He remained at a post from which he had long wished and had repeatedly tried to escape , only because he had not sufficient fortitude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silenced all arguments by passionately asking whether any gentleman , any man of spirit , could have the heart to desert a kind master in the hour of extremity . The opposition consisted of two parties which had once been hostile to each other , and which had been very slowly , and , as it soon appeared , very imperfectly reconciled , but which at this conjuncture seemed to act together with cordiality . The larger of these parties consisted of the great body of the Whig aristocracy . Its head was Charles , Marquis of Rockiugham , a man of sense and virtue , and in wealth and parliamentary interest equaled by very few of the English nobles , but afflicted with a nervous timidity which prevented him from taking a prominent part in debate . In the House of Commons the adherents of Rockingham were led by Fox , whose dissipated habits and ruined fortunes were the talk of the whole town , but whose commanding genius , and whose sweet , generous , and affectionate disposition extorted the admiration and love of those who most lamented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox in largeness of comprehension , in extent of knowledge , and in splendor of imagination , but less skilled in that kind of logic and in that kind of rhetoric which convince and persuade great assemblies , was willing to be the lieutenant of a young chief who might have been his son . A smaller section of the opposition was composed of the old followers of Chatham . At their head was William , Earl of Shelburne , distinguished both as a statesman and as a lover of science and letters . With him were leagued Lord Camden , who had formerly held the great seal , and whose integrity , ability , and constitutional knowledge commanded the public respect ; Barr&amp;* , an eloquent and acrimonious declaimer ; and Dunning , who had long held the first place at the English bar . It was to this party that Pitt was naturally attracted . On the 26th of February , 1781 , he made his first speech in favor of Burke 's plan of economical reform . Fox stood up at the same moment , but instantly gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member , his perfect self-possession , the readiness with which he replied to the orators who had preceded him , the silver tones of his voice , the perfect structure of his unpremeditated sentences , astonished and delighted his hearers . Burke , moved even to tears , exclaimed , " It is not a chip of the old block ; it is the old block itself . " " Pitt will be one of the first men in Parliament , " said a member of the opposition to Fox . " He is so already , ' * answered Fox , in whose nature envy had no place . It is a curious fact , well remembered by some who were very recently living , that soon after this debate Pitt 's name was put up by Fox at Brookes 's . On two subsequent occasions during tha , t ses sion Pitt addressed the House , and on both fully sustained the reputation which he had acquired en his first appearance . In the summer , after the prorogation , he again went the western circuit , held several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was highly complimented by Buller from the bench , and by Dunning at the bar . On the 27th of November the Parliament reassembled . Only forty-eight hours before had arrived tidings of the surrender of Coruwallis and his army ; and it consequently became necessary to rewrite the royal speech . Every man in the kingdom , except the King , was now convinced that it was mere madness to think of conquering the United States . In the debate on the report of the address , Pitt spoke with even more energy and brilliancy than on any former occasion . He was warmly applauded by his allies ; but it was remarked that no person on his own side of the house was so loud in eulogy as Henry IJundas , the Lord Advocate of Scotland , who spoke from the ministerial ranks . That able and versatile politician distinctly foresaw the approaching downfall of the government with which he . was connected , and was preparing to make his own escape from the ruin . From that night dates his connection with Pitt , a connection which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was dissolved by death . About a fortnight later , Pitt spoke in the committee of supply on the army estimates . Symptoms of dissension had begun to appear on the treasury bench . Lord George Germaine , the Secretary of State , who was especially charged with the direction of the war in America , had held language not easily to be reconciled with declarations made by the first lord of the treasury . Pitt noticed the discrepancy with much force and keenness . Lord George and Lord North began to whisper together ; and Welbore Ellis , an ancient placeman , who had been drawing salary almost every quarter since the days of Henry Pelbam , bent down between them to put in a word . Such interruptions sometimes discompose veteran speakers . Pitt stopped , and , looking at the group , said , with admirable readiness , * " I shall wait till N*estor has composed the dispute between Agamemnon and Achilles . " After several defeats , or victories hardly to be distinguished from defeats , the ministry resigued . The King , reluctantly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fox and Shelburne became secretaries of state . Lord John Cavendish , one of the most upright and honorable of men , was made chancellor of the exchequer . Thurlow , whose abilities and force of character had made him the dictator of the House of Lords , continued to hold the great seal . To Pitt was offered , through Shelburne , the vice-treasurership of Ireland , one of the easiest and most highly paid places in the gift of the Crown ; but the offer was , without hesitation , declined . The young statesman had resolved to accept no post which did not entitle him to a // seat in the cabinet ; and , a few days later , he announced that resolution in the House of Commons . It must be remembered that the cabinet was then a much smaller and more select body than at present . We have seen cabinets of sixteen . In the time of our grandfathers a cabinet often or eleven was thought inconveniently large . Seven was a usual number . Even Burke , who had taken the lucrative office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore thought Pitt 's declaration indecent . He himself was sorry that he had made it . The words , he said in private , had escaped him in the heat of speaking ; and he had no sooner nttered them than he would have given the world to recall them . They , however , did him no harm with the public . The second William Pitt , it was said , had shown that he had inherited the spirit as well as the genius of the first . In the son , as in the father , there might perhaps be too much pride ; but there was nothing low or sordid . It might be called arrogance in a young barrister , living in chambers on three hundred a year , to refuse a salary of five thousand a year , merely because he did not choose to bind himself to speak or vote for plans which he had no share in framing ; but surely such arrogance was not very far removed from virtue . Pitt gave a general support to the administration of Rockiugham , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courting that nltra-Whig party which the persecution of Wilkes and the Middlesex election had called into existence , and which the disastrous events of war , and the trinmph of republican principles in America , had made formidable both in numbers and in temper . He supported a motion for shortening the duration of Parliaments . He made a motion for a committee to examine into the state of the representation , and , in the speech by which that motion was introduced , avowed himself the enemy of the close boroughs , the strongholds of that corruption to which he attributed all the calamities of the nation , and which , as he phrased it in one of those exact and sonorous sentences of which he had a boundless command , had grown with the growth of England and strengthened with her strength , but had not diminished with her diminution , or decayed with her decay . On this occasion he was supported by Fox . The motion was lost by only twenty votes in a house of more than three hundred members . The reformers never again had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new administration was strong in abilities , and was more popular than any administra .. tion which had held office since the first year of George the Third , but was hated by the King , hesitatingly supported by the Parliament , and torn by internal dissensions . The chancellor was disliked and distrusted by almost all his colleagues . The two secretaries of state regarded each other with no friendly feeling . The line between their departments had not been traced with precision ; and there were consequently jealousies , encroachments , and complaints . It VOL . XIX. - No. 109. -F was all that Rockingham could do to keep the peace in his cabinet ; and before the cabinet had existed three months Rockiagham died . In an instant all was confusion . The adherents of the deceased statesman looked on the Duke of Portland as their chief . The King placed Shelburne at the head of the treasury . Fox , Lord John Cavendish , and Burke , immediately resigned their offices ; and the new prime minister was left to constitute a government out of very defective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not be in the place where parliamentary talents were most needed . It was necessary to find some member of the House of Commons who could confront the great orators of the opposition ; and Pitt alone had the eloquence and the courage which were required . He was offered the great place of chancellor of the exchequer , and he accepted it . He had scarcely completed his twenty-third year . The parliament was speedily prorogued . During the recess a negotiation for peace , which had been commenced under Rockingham , was brought to a successful termination . England acknowledged the independence of her revolted colonies ; and she ceded to her European enemies some places in the Mediterraaean , and in the Gulf of Mexico . But the terms which she obtained were quite as advantageous and honorable as the events of the war entitled her to expect , or as she was likely to obtain by persevering in a contest against immense odds . All her vital parts , all the real sources of her power remained uninjured . She preserved even her dignity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what she had won from that house in previous wars . She retained her Indian empire undiminished ; and , in spite of the mightiest efforts of two great monarchies , her flag still waved on the rock of Gibraltar . There is not the slightest reason to believe that Fox , if he had remained in office , would have hesitated one moment about concluding a treaty on such conditions . Unhappily that great and most amiable man was , at this crisis , hurried by his passions into an error which made his genius and his virtues , during a long course of years , almost useless to his country . He saw that the great body of the House of Commons was divided into three parties , his own , that of North , and that of Shelburne ; that none of those three parties was large enough to stand alone ; that , therefore , unless two of them united , there must be a miserably feeble administration , or , more probably , a rapid succession of miserably feeble administrations , and this at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respectability of , the nation . It was then necessary and right that there should be a coalition . To every possible coalition three were objections . But of all possible coalitions that to which there were the fewest objections was undoubtedly a coalition between Shelburne and Fox . It would have been generally applauded by the followers of both . It might have been made without any sacrifice of public principle on // the part of either . Unhappily , recent bickerings had left in the mind of Fox a profound dislike and distrust of Shelburne . Pitt attempted to mediate , and was authorized to invite Fox to return to the service of the Crown . " Is Lord Shelburne , " said Fox , " to remain prime minister ? " Pitt answered in the affirmative . " It is impossible that I can act under him , " said Fox . " Then negotiation is at an end , " said Pitt ; " for I can not betray him . " Thus the two statesmen parted . They were never again in a private room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Shelburne , nothing remained to them but to treat with North . That fatal coalition , which is emphatically called " The Coalition , " was formed . Not three quarters of a year had elapsed since Fox and Burke had threatened North with impeachment , and had described him , night after night , as the most arbitrary , the mo*t &amp;rrupt , the most incapable of ministers . They now allied themselves with him *r the pirrpos* of driving from office a statesman with whom they can not be said to have differed as to any important question . Nor had they even the prudence and the patience to wait for some occasion on which they might , without inconsistency , have combined with their old enemies in oppesition to the government . That nothing might be wanting to the scandal , the great orators who had , during seven years , thundered against the war , determined to join with the authors of that war in passing a vote of censure on the peace . The Parliament met before Christmas , 1782 . But it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed . On the 17th of February they were taken into consideration by the House of Commons . There had been , during some days , floating rumors that Fox and North had coalesced ; and the debate indicated but too cleariy that those rumors were not unfounded Pitt was suffering from indisposition : he did not rise till his own strength and that of his hearers were exhausted ; and he was consequently less successful than on any former occasion . His admirers owned that his speech was feeble and petulant . He so far forgot himself as to advise Sheridan to confine himself to amusing theatrical audiences . This ignoble sarcasm gave Sheridan an opportunity of retorting with great felicity . " After what I have seen and heard to-night , " he said , " I really feel strongly tempted to venture on a competition with so great an artist as Ben Jonson , and to bring on the stage a second Angry Boy . " On a division , the address proposed by the supporters of the government was rejected by a majority of sixteen . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single failure , or to be put down by the most lively repartee . When , a few days later , the opposition proposed a resolution directly censuring the treaties , he spoke with an eloquence , energy , and dignity which raised his fame and popularity higher than ever . To the coalition of Fox and North he alluded in laugnage which drew forth tumultuous applause from his followers . " If , " he said , " this ill-omened and unnatural marriage be not yet consummated , I know of a just and lawful impediment ; and , in the name of the public weal , I forbid the bans . " The ministers were again left in a minority , and Shelburne consequently tendered his resignation . It was accepted ; but the King struggled long and hard before he submitted to the terms dictated by Fox , whose faults he detested , and whose high spirit and powerful intellect he detested still more . The first place at the board of treasury was repeatedly offered to Pitt ; but the offer , though tempting , was steadfastly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precocious as his eloquence , saw that his time was coming , but was not come , and was deaf to royal importunities and reproaches . His Majesty , bitterly complaining of Pitt 's faint-heartedness , tried to break the coalition . Every art of seduction was practiced on North , but in vain . During several weeks the country remained without a government . It was not till all devices had- failed , and till the aspect of the House of Commons became threatening , that the King gave way . The Duke of Portland was declared first lord of the treasury . Thurlow was dismissed . Fox and North became secretaries of state , with power ostensibly equal . But Fox was the real prime minister . The year was far advanced before the new arrangements were completed ; and nothing very important was done during the remainder of the session . Pitt , now seated on the opposition bench , brought the question of parliamentary reform a second time under the consideration of the Commons . He proposed to add to the House at once a hundred county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enact that every borough of which an election committee should report that the majority of voters appeared to be corrupt should lose the franchise . The motion was rejected by 293 votes to 149 . After the prorogation , Pitt visited the Continent for the first and last time . His traveling companion was one of his most intimate friends , a young man of his own age , who had already distingnished himself in Parliament by an engaging natural eloquence , set off by the sweetest and most exquisitely modulated of human voices , and whose affectionate heart , caressing manners , and brilliant wit , made him the most delightful of companions , William Wilberforce . That was the time of Anglo-mania in France ; and at Paris the son of the great Chatham was absolutely hunted by men of letters and women of fashion , and forced , much against his will , into political disputation . One remarkable saying which dropped from him during this tour has been preserved . A French gentleman expressed some surprise at the immense influence which Fox , a man of pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the English nation . " You have not , " said Pitt , " been under the wand of the magician . " In November , 1783 , the Parliament met again . // The government had irresistible strength in the House of Commons , and seemed to be scarcely less strong in the House of Lords , but was , in truth , surrounded on every side by dangers . The King was impatiently waiting for the moment at which he could emancipate himself from a yoke which galled him so severely that he had more than once seriously thought of retiring to Hanover ; and the King was scarcely more eager for a change than the nation . Fox and North had committed a fatal error . They ought to have known that coalitions between parties which have long been hostile can succeed only when the wish for coalition pervades the lower ranks of both . If the leaders unite before there is any disposition to union among the followers , the probability is that there will be a mutiny in both camps , and that the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to be revenged on those by whom they think that they have been betrayed . Thus it was in 1783 . At the beginning of that e*entfu1 year North had been the recognized head of the old Tory party , which , though for a moment prostrated by the disastrous issue of the American war , was still a great power in the state . To him the clergy , the universities , and that large body of country gentlemen whose rallying cry was " Church and King , " had long looked up with respect and confidence . Fox had , on the other hand , been the idol of the Whigs , and of the whole body of Protestant dissenters . The coalition at once alienated the most zealous Tories from North , and the most zealous Whigs from Fox . The university of Oxford , which bad marked its approbation of North 's orthodoxy by electing him chancellor , the city of London , which had been , during two and twenty years , at war with the Court , were equally disgusted . Squires and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the preceding century , could not forgive their old leader for combining with disloyal subjects in order to put a force on the sovereign . The members of the Bill of Rights Society and of the Reform Associations were enraged by learning that their favorite orator now called the great champion of tyranny and corruption his noble friend . Two great multitudes were at once left without any head , and both at once turned their eyes on Pitt . One party saw in him the only man who could rescue the King ; the other saw in him the only man who could purify the Parliament . He was supported on one side by Archbishop Markham , the preacher of divine right , and by Jenkinson , the captain of the Pretorian band of the King 's friends ; on the other side by Jebb and Priestley , Sawbridge and Cartwright , Jack Wilkes and Horne Tooke . On the benches of the House of Commons , however , the ranks of the ministerial majority were unbroken ; and that any statesman would venture to brave such a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever , under any provocation , ventured to appeal from the representative body to the constituent body . The ministers , therefore , notwithstanding the sullen looks and muttered words of displeasure with which their suggestions were received in the closet , notwithstanding the roar of obloquy which was rising louder and louder every day from every corner of the island , thought themselves secure . Suchwastheir confidence in their strength that , as soon as the Parliament had met , they brought forward a singularly bold and original plan for the government of the British territories in India . What was proposed was that the whole authority , which till that time had been exercised over those territories by the East India Company , should be transferred to seven commissioners , who were to be named by Parliament , and were not to be removable at the pleasure of the Crown . Earl Fitzwilliam , the most intimate personal friend of Fox , was to be chairman of this board , and the eldest son of North was to be one of the members . As soon as the outlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coalition had excited burst forth with an astounding explosion . The question which ought undoubtedly to have been considered as paramount to every other was , whether the proposed change was likely to be beneficial or injurious to the thirty millions of people who were subject to the Company ? But that question can not be said to have been even seriously discussed . Burke , who , whether right or wrong in the conclusions to which he came , had at least the merit of looking at the subject in the right point of view , vainly reminded his hearers of that mighty population whose daily rice might depend on a vote of the British Parliament . He spoke , with even more than his wonted power of thought and language , about the desolation of Rohilcund , about the spoliation of Benares , about the evil policy which had suffered the tanks of the Carnatic to go to ruin ; but he could scarcely obtain a hearing . The contending parties , to their shame it must be said , would listen to none but English topics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal . Town and country were united . Corporations exclaimed against the violation of the charter of the greatest corporation in the realm . Tories and Democrats joined in pronouncing the proposed board an unconstitutional body . It was to consist of Fox 's nominees . The effect of his bill was to give , not to the Crown , but to him personally , whether in office or in opposition , an enormous power , a patronage sufficient to counterbalance the patronage of the Treasury and of the Admiralty , and to decide the elections for fifty boroughs . He knew , it was said , that he was hateful alike to King and people ; and he had dovised a plan which would make him independent of both . Some nicknamed him Cromwell , and some Carlo Khan . Wilberforce , with his usual felicity of expression , and with very unusual bitterness of feeling , described the scheme as the genuine offspring of the coalition , as marked with the features of both its parents , the corruption of one and the violence of the other . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supported in every stage by great majorities , was rapidly passed , and was sent up to the Lords . To the general astonishment , when the second reading was moved in the Upper House , the opposition proposed an adjournment , and carried it by eighty-seven votes to seventy-nine . The cause of this strange turn of fortune was soon known . Pitt 's cousin , Earl Temple , had been in the royal closet , and had there been authorized to let it be known that his Majesty would consider all who voted for the bill as his cuemnies . The ignominious commission was performed , and instantly a troop of lords of the bedchamber , of bishops who wished to be translated , and of Scotch peers who wished to be reelected , made haste to change sides . On a later day the Lords rejected the bill . Fox and North were immediately directed to send their seals to the palace by their under secretaries ; and Pitt was appointed first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer . The general opinion was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to give the public feeling time to gather strength . On this point he differed from his kinsman Temple . The consequence was , that Temple , who had been appointed one of the secretaries of state , resigned his office forty-eight hours after he had accepted it , and thus relieved the new government from a great load of unpopularity ; for all men of sense and honor , however strong might be their dislike of the India Bill , disapproved of the manner in which that bill had been thrown out . Temple carried away with him the scandal which the best friends of the new government could not but lament . The fame of the young Prime Minister preserved its whiteness . He could declare with perfect truth that , if unconstitutional machinations had been employed , he had been no party to them . He was , however , surrounded by difficulties and dangers . In the House of Lords , indeed , he had a majority ; nor could any orator of the opposition in that assembly be considered as a match for Thurlow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cordially supported the son of his old friend Chatham . But in the other House there was not a single eminent speaker among the official men who sat round Pitt . His most useful assistant was Dundas , who , though he had not eloquence , had sense , knowledge , readiness , and boldness . On the opposite benches was a powerful majority , led by Fox , who was supported by Burke , North , and Sheridan . The heart of the young minister , stout as it was , almost died within him . He could not once close his eyes on the night which followed Temple 's resignation . But , whatever his internal emotions might be , his language and deportment indicated nothing but unconquerable firmness and haughty confidence in his own powers . His contest against the House of Commons lasted from the 17th of December , 1783 , to the 8th of March , 1784 . In sixteen divisions the opposition triumphed . Again and again the King was requested to dismiss his ministers . But he was determined to go to Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cry of the nation in his favor became vehement and almost furious . Addresses assuring him of public support caine up daily from every part of the kingdom . The freedom of the city of London was presented to him in a gold box . He went in state to receive this mark of distinction . He was sumptuously feasted in Grocers ' Hall ; and the shopkeepers of the Strand and Fleet Street illuminated their houses in his hon or . These things could not but produce an effect within the walls of Parliament . The ranks of the majority began to waver ; a few passed over to the enemy ; some skulked away ; many were for capitulating while it was still possible to capitulate with the honors of war . Negotiations were opened with the view of forming an administration on a wide basis , but they had scarcely been opened when they were closed . The opposition demanded , as a preliminary article of the treaty , that Pitt should resign the treasury ; and with this demand Pitt steadfastly refused to comply . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sinecure place for life , worth three thousand a year , and tenable with a seat in the House of Commons , became vacant . The appointment was with the chancellor of the exchequer ; nobody doubted that he would appoint himself ; and nobody could have blamed him if he had done so ; for such sinecure offices had always been defended on the ground that they enabled a few men of eminent abilities and small incomes to live without any profession , and to devote themselves to the service of the state . Pitt , in spite of the remonstrances of his friends , gave the pells to his father 's old adherent , Colonel Barni , a man distinguished by talent and eloquence , but poor and afflicted with blindness . By this arrangement a pension which the Rockiagham administration had granted to BarnS was saved to the public . Never was there a happier stroke of policy . About treaties , wars , expeditions , tariffs , budgets , there will always be room for dispute . The policy which is applauded by half the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinterestedness every body comprehends . It is a great thing for a man who has only three hundred a year to be able to show that he considers three thousand a year as mere dirt beneath his feet , when compared with the public interest and the public esteem . Pitt had his reward . No minister was ever more rancorously libeled ; but even when he was known to be overwhelmed with debt , when millions were passing through his hands , when the wealthiest magnates of the realm were soliciting him for marquisates and garters , his bitterest enemies did not dare to accuse him of touching unlawful gain . At length the hard fought fight ended . A final remonstrance , drawn up by Burke with admirable skill , was carried on the 8th of March by a single vote in a full House . Had the experiment been repeated the supporters of the co // alition would probably have been in a minority . But the supplies had been voted ; the Mutiny Bill had been passed ; and the Parliament was dissolved . The popular constituent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the new government . A hundred and sixty of the supporters of the coalition lost their seats . The first lord of the treasury himself came in at the head of the poll for the University of Cambridge . His young friend , Wilberforce , was elected knight of the great shire of York , in opposition to the whole influence of the Fitzwilliams , Cavendishes , Dundases , and Saviles . In the midst of such triumphs Pitt completed his twenty-fifth year . He was now the greatest subject that England had seen during many generations . He domineered absolutely over the cabinet , and was the favorite at once of the sovereign , of the Parliament , and of the nation . His father had never been so powerful , nor Walpole , nor Marlborough . This narrative has now reached a point , beyond which a full history of the life of Pitt would be a history of England , or rather of the whole civilized world ; and for such a history this is not the proper place . Here a very slight sketch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to such points as may enable a reader who is already acquainted with the general course of events to form a just notion of the character of the man on whom so much depended . If we wish to arrive at a correct judgment of Pitt 's merits and defects , we must never forget that he belonged to a peculiar class of statesmen , and that he must be tried by a peculiar standard . It is not easy to compare him fairly with such men as Ximenes and Sully , Richelien and Oxenstiern , John De Witt and Warren Hastings . The means by which those politicians governed great communities were of quite a different kind from those which Pitt was under the necessity of employing . Some talents , which they never had any opportunity of showing that they possessed , were developed in him to an extraordinary degree . In some qualities , on the other hand , to which they owe a large part of their fame , he was decidedly their inferior . They transacted business in their closets , or at boards where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be born in an age and in a country in which parliamentary government was completely established ; his whole training from infancy was such as fitted him to bear a part in parliamentary government ; and from the prime of his manhood to his death all the powers of his vigorous mind were almost constantly exerted in the work of parliamentary government . He accordingly became the greatest master of the whole art of parliamentary government that has ever existed , a greater than Montague or Walpole , a greater than his father Chatharn or his rival Fox , a greater than either of his illustrious successors , Canning and Peel . Parliamentary government , like every other contrivance of man , has its advantages and its disadvantages . On the advantages there is no need to dilate . The history of England during the hundred and seventy years which have elapsed since the House of Commons became the most powerful body in the state , her im* mense and still growing prosperity , her freedom , her tranquillity , her greatness in arts , in sciences , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public credit , her American , her African , her Australian , her Asiatic empires sufficiently prove the excellence of her institutions . But those institutions , though excellent , are assuredly not perfect . Parliamentary government is government by speaking . In such a government the power of speaking is the most highly prized of all the qualities which a politician can possess ; and that power may exist , in the highest degree , without judgment , without fortitude , without skill in reading the characters of men or the signs of the times , without any knowledge of the principles of legislation or of political economy , and without any skill in diplomacy or in the administration of war . Nay , it may well happen that those very intellectual qualities which give a peculiar charm to the speeches of a public man may be incompatible with the qualities which would fit him to meet a pressing emergency with promptitude and firmness . It was thus with Charles Townshend . It was thus with Windham . It was a privilege to listen to those accomplished and ingenious orators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found far inferior in all the qualities of rulers to such a man as Oliver Cromwell , who talked nonsense , or as William the Silent , who did not talk at all . When parliamentary government is established , a Charles Townshend or a Windham will almost always exercise much greater influence than such men as the great Protector of England , or as the founder of the Batavian commonwealth . In such a government parliamentary talent , though quite distinct from the talents of a good executive or judicial officer , will be a chief qualification for executive and judicial office . From the Book of Dignities a curious list might be made out of chancellors ignorant of the principles of equity , and first lords of the admiralty ignorant of the principles of navigation , of colonial ministers who could not repeat the names of the colonies , of lords of the treasury who did not know the difference between funded and unfunded debt , and of secretaries of the India board who did not know whether the Mahrattas were Mohammedans or Hindoos . On these grounds some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question , have pronounced parliamentary government a positive evil , and have maintained that the administration would be greatly improved if the power , now exercised by a large assembly , were transferred to a single person . Men of sense will probably think the remedy very much worse than the disease , and will be of opinion that there would be small gain in exchanging Charles Townshend and Wiadhani for // the Prince of the Peace , or the poor slave and dog Steenie . Pitt was emphatically the man of parliamentary government , the type of his class , the minion , the child , the spoiled child , of the House of Commons . For the House of Commons he had a hereditary , an infantine love . Through his whole boyhood the House of Commons was never out of his thoughts , or out of the thoughts of his instructors . Reciting at his father 's knee , reading Thucydides and Cicero into English , analyzing the great Attic speeches on the Embassy and on the Crown , he was constantly in training for the conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the House of Commons at twenty-one . The ability which he had displayed in the House of Commons made him the most powerful subject in Europe before he was twenty-five . It would have been happy for himself and for his country if his elevation had been deferred . Eight or ten years , during which he would have had leisure and opportunity for reading and reflection , for foreign travel , for social intercourse and free exchange of thought on equal terms with a great variety of companions , would have supplied what , without any fault on his part , was wanting to his powerful intellect . He had all the knowledge tl*it he could be expected to have ; that is to say , all the knowledge that a man can acquire while he is a student at Cambridge , and all the knowledge that a man can acquire when he is first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer . But the stock of general information which he brought from college , extraordinary for a boy , was far inferior to what Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splendid , the various treasures laid up in the large mind of Burke . After Pitt became minister he had no leisure to learn more than was necessary for the purposes of the day which was passing over him . What was necessary for those purposes such a man could learn with little difficulty . He was surrounded by experienced and able public servants . He could at any moment command their best assistance . From the stores which they produced his vigorous mind rapidly collected the materials for a good parliamentary case : and that was enough . Legislation and administration were with him secondary matters . To the work of framing statutes , of negotiating treaties , of organizing fleets and rmies , of sending forth expeditions , he gave only the leavings of his time and the dregs of his fine intellect . The strength and sap of his mind were all drawn in a different direction . It was when the House of Commons was to be convinced and persuaded that he put forth all his powers . Of those powers we must form our estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last age Pitt has suffered most from the reporters . Even while he was still living critics remarked that his eloquence could not be preserved , that he must be heard to be appreciated . They more than once applied to him the sentence in which Tacitus describes the fate of a senator whose rhetoric was admired in the Augustan age : " Haterii canorum illud et profluens cum ipso simul exstinctum est . " There is , however , abundant evidence that nature had bestowed on Pitt the talents of a great orator ; and those talents had been developed in a very peculiar manner ; first by his education , and secondly by the high official position to which he rose early , and in which he passed the greater part of his public life . At his first appearance in Parliament he showed himself superior to all his contemporaries in command of language . He could pour forth a long succession of round and stately periods , without premeditation , without . ever pausing for a word , without ever repeating a word , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulate that not a letter was slurred over . He had less amplitude of mind and less richness of imagination than Burke , less ingenuity than Windham , less wit than Sheridan , less perfect mastery of dialectical fence , and less of that highest sort of eloquence which consists of reason and passion fused together , than Fox . Yet the almost unanimous judgment of those who were in the habit of listening to that remarkable race of men placedPitt , as a speaker , above Burke , above Windham , above Sheridan , and not below Fox . His declamation was copious , polished , and splendid . In power of sarcasm he was probably not surpassed by any speaker , ancient or modern ; and of this formidable weapon he made merciless use . In two parts of the oratorical art which are of the highest value to a minister of state he was singularly expert . No man knew better how to be luminous or how to be obscure . When he wished to be understood he never failed to make himself understood . He could with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or profound , but a clear , popular , and plausible view of the most extensive and complicated subject . Nothing was Out of place ; nothing was forgotten ; minute details , dates , sums of money , were all faithfully preserved in his memory . Even intricate questions of finance , when explained by him , seemed clear to the plainest man among his hearers . On the other hand , when he did not wish to be explicit-and no man who is at the head of affairs always wishes to be explicit-he had a marvelous power of saying nothing in language which left on his audience the impression that he had said a great deal . He was at once the only man who could open a budget without notes , and the only man who , as Windham said , could speak that most elaborately evasive and unmeaning of human compositions , a King 's speech , without premeditation . The effect of oratory will always , to a great extent , depend on the character of the orator . There perhaps never were two speakers whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more of the flavor imparted by moral qualities , than Fox and Pitt . The speeches of Fox owe a great part of their charm to that warmth and softness of heart , that sympathy with human suf // fering , that admiration for every thing great and beautiful , and that hatred of cruelty and injustice , which interest and delight us even in the most defective reports . No person , on the other hand , could hear Pitt without perceiving him to be a man of high , intrepid , and commanding spirit , proudly conscious of his own rectitude and of his own intellectual superiority , incapable of the low vices of fear and envy , but too prone to feel and to show disdain . Pride , indeed , pervaded the whole man , was written in the harsh , rigid lines of his face , was marked by the way in which he walked , in which he sat , in which he stood , and , above all , in which he bowed . Such pride , of course , inflicted many wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found , in all the ten thousand invectives written against Fox , a word indicating that his demeanor had ever made a single personal enemy . On the other hand , several men of note who had been partial to Pitt , and who to the last continued to approve his public conduct and to support his administration , Cumberland , for example , Buswell , and Matthias , were so much irritated by the contempt with which he treated them , that they complained in prh*t of their wrongs . But his pride , though it made him bitterly disliked by individuals , inspired the great body of his fob. lowers in Parliament and throughout the country with respect and confidence . They took him at his own valuation . They saw that his selfesteem was not that of an upstart , who was drunk with good luck and with applause , and who , if fortune turned , would sink from arrogance into abject humility . It was that of the magnanimous man so finely described by Aristotle ; * the Ethics , of the man who thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It sprang from a consciousness of great powers arid great virtues , and was never so conspicuously displayed as in the midst of difficulties and dangers which would have unnerved and bowed down any ordinary mind . It was closely connected , too , with an ambition which had no mixture of low cupidity . There was something noble in the cynical disdain with which the mighty minister scattered riches and titles to right and left among those who valued them , while he spurned them out of his own way . Poor himself , he was surrounded by friends on whom he had bestowed three thousand , six thousand , ten thousand a year . Plain Mister himself , he had made more lords than any three ministers that had preceded him . The garter , for which the first dukes in the kingdom were contending , was repeatedly offered to him , and offered in vain . The correctness of his private life added much to the dignity of his public character . In the relations of son , brother , uncle , master , friend , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate associations he was amiable , affectionate , even playful . They loved him sincerely ; they regretted him long ; and they would hardly admit that he who was so kind and gentle with them , could be stern and haughty with others . He indulged , indeed , somewhat too freely in wine , which he had early been directed to take as a medicine , and which . use had made a necessary of life to him . But it was very seldom that any indication of undue excess could be detected in his tones or gestures ; and , in truth , two bottles of port were little more to him than two dishes of tea . He had , when he was first introduced into the clubs of Saint James 's Street , shown a strong taste for play ; but he had the prudence and the resolution to stop before this taste had acquired the strength of habit . From the passion which generally exercises the most tyrannical dominion over the young he possessed an immunity , which is probably to be ascribed partly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution was feeble : he was very shy ; and he was very busy . The strictness of his morals furnished such buffoons as Peter Pindar and Captain Morris with an inexhaustible theme for merriment of no very delicate kind . But the great body of the middle class of Englishmen could not see the joke . They warmly praised the young statesman for commanding his passions , and for covering his frailties , if he had frailties , with decorous obscurity , and would have been very far indeed from thinking better of him if he had vindicated himself from the taunts of his enemies by taking under his protection a Nancy Parsons or a Marianne Clark . No part of the immense popularity which Pitt long enjoyed is to be attributed to the eulogies of wits and poets . It might have been naturally expected that a man of genius , of learning , of taste , an orator whose diction was often compared to that of Tully , the representative , too , of a great university , would have taken a peculiar pleasure in befriending eminent writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The love of literature had induced Augustus to heap benefits on Pompeians , Somers to be the protector of nonjurors , Harley to make the fortunes of Whigs . But it could not move Pitt to show any favor even to Pittites . He was doubtless right in thinking that , in general , poetry , history , and philosophy ought to be suffered , like calico and cutlery , to find their proper price in the market , and that to teach men of letters to look habitually to the state for their recompense is bad for the state and bad for letters . Assuredly nothing can be more absurd or mischievous than to waste the public money in bounties , for the purpose of inducing people who ought to be weighing out grocery or measuring out drapery , to write bad or middling books . But , though the sound rule is that authors should be left to be remunerated by their readers , there will , in every generation , be a few exceptions to this rule . To distinguish these special cases from the masses is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished ruler ; and Pitt would assuredly have had little difficulty in finding such cases . While he was in power , the greatest philologist of the age , his own contemporary at Cambridge , was reduced to earn a livelihood by the lowest literary drudg // ery , and to spend in writing squibs for the Morning Chronicle years to which we might have owed an all but perfect text of the whole tragic and comic drama of Athens . The greatest historian of the age , forced by poverty to leave his country , completed his immortal work on the shores of Lake Leman . The political heterodoxy of Porson , and the religious heterodoxy of Gibbon , may perhaps be pleaded in defense of the minister by whom those eminent men were neglected . But there were other cases in which no such excuse could be set up . Scarcely had Pitt obtained possession of unbounded power , when an aged writer of the highest eminence , who had made very little by his writings , and who was sinking into the grave under a load of infirmities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable him , during the winter or two which might still remain to him , to draw his breath more easily in the soft climate of Italy . Not a farthing was to be obtained ; and before Christmas the author of the English Dictionary and of the Lives of the Poets had gasped his last in the river fog and coal smoke of Fleet Street . A few months after the death of Johnson appeared the Task , incomparably the best poem that any Englishman then living had produced  --  a poem , too , which could hardly fail to excite , in a well-constituted mind , a feeling of esteem and compassion for the poet , a man of genius and virtue , whose means were scanty , and whom the most cruel of all the calamities incident to humanity had made incapable of supporting himself byvigorous and sustained exertion . Nowherehad Chathambeen **25;462;TOOLONG , or inverse more worthy of the subject , than in the Task . The son of Chatham , however , contented himself with reading and admiring the book , and left the author to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Cowper to close his melancholy life , unmolested by duns and bailiffs , was obtained for him by the strenuous kindness of Lord Spencer . What a contrast between the way in which Pitt acted toward Johnson , and the way in which Lord Grey acted toward his political enemy Scott , when Scott , worn *out by misfortune and disease , was ad vised to try the effect of . the Italian air ! What a contrast between the way in which Pitt acted toward Cowper , and the way in which Burke , a poor man and out of place , acted toward Crabbe ! Even Dundas , who made no pretensions to literary taste , and was content to be considered as a hard-headed and somewhat coarse man of business , was , when compared with his eloquent and classically educated friend , a Msecenas or a Leo . Dundas made Burns an cxciseman , with seventy pounds a year ; and this was more than Pitt , during his long tenure of power , did for the encouragement of letters . Even those who may think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of a government to reward literary merit , will hardly deny that a government which has much lucrative church prefermeat in its gift , is bound , in distributing that preferment , not to overlook divines whose writlags have rendered great service to the cause of religion . But it seems never to have occurred to Pitt that he lay under any such obligation . All the theological works of the numerous bishops whom he made and translated are not , when put together , worth fifty pages of the Horn Pau1mm , of the Natural Theology , or of the Views of the Evidences of Christianity . But on Paley the all-powerful minister never bestowed the smallest benefice . Artists Pitt treated as contemptuously as writers . For painting he did simply nothing . Sculptors , who had been selected to execute monuments voted by Parliament , had to haunt the ante-chambers of the treasury during many years before they could olAain a farthing from him . One of them , after vainly soliciting the minister for payment during fourteen years , had the courage to present a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ungracious justice . Architects , it was absolutely necessary to employ ; and the worst that could be found seemed to have been employed . Not a single fine public building of any kind or in any style was erected during his long administration . It may be confidently affirmed that no ruler whose abilities and attainments would bear any comparison with his has ever shown such cold disdain for what is excellent in arts and letters . His first administration lasted seventeen years . That long period is divided by a strongly marked line into two almost exactly equal parts . The first part ended and the second began in the autumn of 1792 . Throughout both parts Pitt displayed in the highest degree the talents of a parliamentary leader . During the first part he was a fortunate , and , in many respects , a skillful administrator . With the difficulties which he had to encounter during the second part he was altogether incapable of contending ; but his eloquence and his perfect mastery of the tactics of the House of Commons concealed his incapacity from the multitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1784 were as tranquil and prosperous as any eight years in the whole history of England . Neighboring nations which had lately been in arms against her , and which had flattered themselves that , in losing her American colonies , she had lost a chief source of her wealth and of her power , saw , with wonder and vexation , that she was more wealthy and more powerful than ever . Her trade increased . Her manufactures flourished . Her exchequer was full to overflowing . Very idle apprehensions were generally entertained that the public debt , though much less than a third of the debt which we now bear with ease , would be found too heavy for the strength of the nation . Those apprehensions might not , perhaps , have been easily quieted by reason . But Pitt quieted them by a juggle . He succeeded in persuading first himself , and then the whole nation , his opponents included , that a new sinking fund , which , so far as it differed from former sinking funds , differed for the worst , would , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , // put into the pocket of the public creditor great sums not taken out of the pocket of the tax-payer . The country , terrified by a danger which was no danger , hailed with delight and boundless confidence a remedy which was no remedy . The minister was almost universally extolled as the greatest of financiers . Meanwhile both the branches of the House of Bourbon found that England was as formidable an antagonist as she had ever been . France had formed a plan for reducing Holland to vassalage . But England interposed , and France receded . Spain interrupted by violence the trade of our merchants with the regions near the Oregon . But England armed , and Spain receded . Within the island there was profound tranquillity . The King was , for the first time , popular . During the twenty-three years which had followed his accession he had not been loved by his subjects . His domestic virtues were acknowledged . But it was generally thought that the good qualities by which he was distinguished in private life were wanting to his political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforgiving , stubboru , cunning . Under his rule the country had sustained cruel disgruces and disasters ; and every one of those disgraces and disasters was imputed to his strong antipathies , and to his perverse obstinacy in the wrong . One statesman after another complained that he had been induced by royal caresses , entreaties , and promises to undertake the direction of affairs at a difficult conjuncture , and that as soon as he had , not without sullying his fame and alienating his best friends , served the turn for which he was wanted , his ungrateful master began to intrigue against him , and to canvass against him . Grenvile , Rockingham , Chatham , men of widely different characters , but all three upright and highspirited , agreed in thinking that the prince under whom they had successively held the highest place in the government was one of the most insincere of mankind . His confidence was reposed , they said , not in those known and responsible counselors to whom he had delivered the seals of office , but in secret advisers who stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ministers , while defending themselves against the attacks of the opposition in front , were perpetually , at his instigation , assailed on the flank or in the rear by a vile band of mercenaries who ealled themselves his friends . These men constantly , while in possession of lucrative places in his service , spoke and voted against bills which he had authorized the first lord of the treasury or the secretary of state to bring in . But from the day in which Pitt was placed at the head of affairs there was an end of secret influence . His haughty and aspiring spirit was not to be satisfied with the mere show of power . Any attempt to undermine him at court , any mutinous movement among his followers in the House of Commons , was certain to be at once put down . He had only to tender his resignation ; and he could dictate his own terms . For he , and he alone , stood between the King and the coalition . He was therefore little less than mayor of the palace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repose entire confidence in so excellent a minister . His Majesty 's private virtues now began to produce their full effect . He was generally regarded as the model of a respectable country gentleman , honest , good-natured , sober , religious . He rose early : he dined temperately : he was strictly faithful to his wife : he never missed church : and at church lie never missed a response . His people heartily prayed that he might long reign over them ; and they prayed the more heartily because his virtues were set off to the best advantage by the vices and follies of the Prince of Wales , who lived in close intimacy with the chiefs of the opposition . How strong this feeling was in the public mind appeared signally on one great occasion . In the autumn of 1788 the King became insane . The opposition , eager for office , committed the great indiscretion of asserting that the heir-apparent had , by the fundamental laws of England , a right to be Regent with the full powers of royalty . Pitt , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , when a sovereign is , by reason of infancy , disease , or absence , incapable of exercising the regal functions , it belongs to the estates of the realm to determine who shall be the vicegerent , and with what portion of the executive authority such vicegerent shall be intrusted . A long and violent contest followed , in which Pitt was supported by the great body of the people with as much enthusiasm as during the first months of his administration . Tories with one voice applauded him for defending the sick-bed of a virtuous and unhappy sovereign against a disloyal faction and an undutiful son . Not a few Whigs applauded him for asserting the authority of Parliaments and the principles of the revolution , in opposition to a doctrine which seemed to have too much affinity with the servile theory of indefeasible hereditary right . The middle class , always zealous on the side of decency and the domestic virtues , looked forward with dismay to a reign resembling that of Charles II . The palace , which had now been during thirty years the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuisance , a school of profligacy . To the good King 's repast of mutton and lemonade , dispatched at three o'clock , would succeed midnight banquets , from which the guests would be carried home speechless . To the backgammon-board at which the good King played for a little silver with his equerries , would succeed faro tables , from which young patricians who had sat down rich would rise up beggars . The drawing-room , from which the frown of the Queen had repelled a whole generation of frail beauties , would now be again what it had been in the days of Barbara Palmer and Louisa de Querounile . Nay , severely as the public reprobated the Prince 's many illicit attachments , his one virtuous attachment was reprobated more severely still . Even in grave and pious circles his Protestant mistresses gave less // scandal than his Popish wife . That he must be Regent nobody ventured to deny . But he and his friends were so unpopular that Pitt could , with general approbation , propose to limit the powers of the Regent by restrictions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trusted by the country . Some interested men , fully expecting a change of administration , went over to the opposition . But the majority , purified by these desertions , closed its ranks , and presented a more firm array than ever to the enemy . In every division Pitt was victorious . When , at length , after a stormy interregnum of three weeks , it was announced , on the very eve of the inauguration of the Regent , that the King was himself again , the nation was wild with delight . On the evening of the day on which his Majesty resumed his functions a spontaneous illumination , the most general that had ever been seen in England , brightened the whole vast space from Highgate to Tooting , and from Ilammersmith to Greenwich . On the day on which he returned thanks in the cathedral of his capital all the horses and carriages within a hundred miles of London were too few for the multitudes which flocked to see him pass through the streets . A second illumination followed , which was even superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tumultuous kindness of an innumerable multitude which insisted on drawing his coach from St. Paul 's Church-yard to Downing Street . This was the moment at which his fame and fortune may be said to have reached the zenith . His influence in the closet was as great as that of Carr or Villiers had been . His dominion over the Parliament was more absolute than that of Walpole or Pelham had been . He was , at the same time , as high in the favor of the populace as ever Wilkes or Sacheverell had been . Nothing did more to raise his character than his noble poverty . It was well known that , if he had been dismissed from office , after more than five years of boundless power , he would hardly have carried out with him a sum sufficient to furnish the set of chambers in which , he cheerfully declared , he meant to resume the practice of the law . His admirers , however , were by no means disposed to suffer him to depend on daily toil for his daily bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of London alone would have sufficed to make him a rich man . But it may be doubted whether his haughty spirit would have stooped to accept a provision so honorably earned and so honorably bestowed . To such a height of power and glory had this extraordinary man risen at twenty-nine years of age . And now the tide was on the turn . Only ten days after the triumphant procession to St. Paul 's , the States-General of France , after an interval of a hundred and seventy-four years , met at Versailles . The nature of the great Revolution which followed was long very imperfectly understood in this country . Burke saw much further than any of his contemporaries ; but whatever his sagacity descried was refracted and discolored by his passions and his imagination . More than three years elapsed before the principles of the English administration underwent any material change . Nothing could as yet be milder or more strictly constitutional than the minister 's domestic policy . Not a single act indicating an arbitrary temper or a jealousy of the people could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any extraordinary powers . He had never used with harshness the ordinary powers intrusted by the constitution to the executive government . Not a single state prosecution which would even now be called oppressive had been instituted by him . Indeed , the only oppressive state prosecution instituted during the first eight years of his administration was that of Stockdale , which is to be attributed , not to the government , but to the chiefs of the opposition . In office , Pitt had redecmed the pledges which he had , at his entrance into public life , given to the supporters of parliamentary reform . He had , in 1785 , brought forward a judicious plan for the improvement of the representative system , and had prevailed on the King , not only to refrain from talking against that plan , but to recommend it to the Houses in a speech from the throne . * This attempt falled ; but there can be little doubt that , if the French Revolution had not produced a violent reaction of public feeling , Pitt would have performed , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a later period , Lord Grey could accomplish only by means which , for a time , loosened the very foundations of the commonwealth . When the atrocities of the slave-trade were first brought under the consideration of Parliament , no abolitionist was more zealous than Pitt . When sickness provented Wilberforce from appearing in public , his place was most efficiently supplied by his friend the minister . A humane bill , which mitigated the horrors of the middle passage , was , in 1788 , carried by the eloquence and determined spirit of Pitt , in spite of the opposition of some of his own colleagues ; and it ought always to be remembered to his honor that , in order to carry that bill , he kept the Houses sitting , in spite of many murmurs , long after the business of the government had been done , and the appropriation act passed . In 1791 he cordially concurred with Fox in maintaining the sound constitutional doctrine , that an impeachment is not terminated by a dissolution . In the course of the same year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important cause . They are fairly entitled to divide the high honor of having added to our statute-book the inestimable law which places the liberty of the press under the protection ofjuries . On one occasion , and one alone , * The speech with which the King opened the session of 1785 concluded with an assurance that His Majesty would heartily concur in every sneaeure which could tettd to secure the true principles of the constitution . These words were at the ttsne understood to refer to Pitt 's Itsform Bill . // Pitt , during the first half of his long administration , acted in a manner nnworthy of an enlightened Whig . In the debate on the test act , he stooped to gratify the master whom he served , the university which he represented , and the great body of clergymen and country gentlemen on whose support he rested , by talking , with little heartiness , indeed , and with no asperity , the language of a Tory . With this single exception , his conduct from the end of 1783 to the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious liberty . Nor did any thing , during that period , indicate that he loved war , or harbored any malevolent feeling against any neighboring nation . Those French writers who have represented him as a Hannibal , sworn in childhood by his father to bear eternal hatred to France , as having , by mysterious intrigues and lavish bribes , instigated the leading Jacobins to commit those excesses which dishonored the Revolution , as having been the real author of the first coalition , know nothing of his character or of his history . So far was he from being a deadly enemy to France , that his laudable attempts to bring about a closer connection with that country by means of a wise and liberal treaty of commerce , brought on him the severe censure of the opposition . He was told in the House of Commons that he was a degenerate son , and that his partiality for the hereditary foes of our island was enough to make his great father 's bones stir under the pavement of the Abbey . And this man , whose name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1792 , would now have been associated with peace , with freedom , with philanthropy , with temperate reform , wIth mild and constitutional administration , lived to associate his name with arbitrary government , with harsh laws harshly executed , with alien bills , with gagging bills , with suspensions of the habeas corpus act , with cruel punishments inflicted on some political agitators , with unjustifiable prosecutions instituted against others , and with the most costly and most sanguinary wars of modern times . He lived to be held up to obloquy as the stern oppressor of England , and the indefatigable disturber of Europe . Poets , contrasting his earlier with his later years , likened him sometimes to the apostle who kissed in order to betray , and sometimes to the evil angels who kept not their first estate . A satirist of great genius introduced the fiends of Famine , Slaughter , and Fire , proclaiming that they had received their commission from One whose name was formed of four letters , and promising to give their employer ample proofs of gratitude . Famine would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in madness . The demon of Slaughterwould impel them to tear him from limb to limb . But Fire boasted that she alone could reward him as he deserved , and that she would cling round him to all eternity . By the French press and the French tribune every crime that disgraced and every calamity that afflicted France was ascribed to the monster Pitt and his guineas . While the Jacobins were dom inant , it was he who had corrupted the Gironde , who had raised Lyons and Bordeaux against the convention , who had suborned Paris to assassinate Lepelletier , and Cecilia Regnault to assassinate Robespierre . When the Thermidorian reaction came , all the atrocities of the Reign of Terror were imputed to him . Collot iD'Herbois and Fouquier Thinville had been his pensioners . It was he who had hired the murderers of September , who had dictated the pamphlets of Marat and the Carmagnoles of Barrere , who had paid Lebon to deluge Arms with blood , and Carrier to choke the Loire with corpses . The truth is , that he liked neither war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freedom , driven , by a stress against which it was hardly possible for any will or any intellect to struggle , out of the course to which his inclinations pointed , and for which his abilities and acquirements fitted him , and forced into a policy repugnant to his feelings and unsuited to his talents . The charge of apostasy is grossly unjust . A man ought no more to be called an apostate because his opinions alter with the opinions of the great body of his contemporaries than he ought to be called an Oriental traveler because he is always going round from west to east with the globe and every thing that is upon it . Between the spring of 1789 and the closeof 1792 the public mind of England underwent a great change . If the change of Pitt 's sentiments attracted peculiar notice it was not because he changed more than his neighbors ; for in fact he changed less than most of them ; but because his position was far more conspicuous than theirs-because he was , till Bonaparte appeared , the individual who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the civilized world . During a short time the nation , and Pitt , as one of the nation , looked with interest and approbation on the French Revolution . But soon vast confiscations , the violent sweeping away of ancient institutions , the domination of clubs , the barbarities of mobs maddened by famine and hatred , produced a reaction here . The Court , the nobility , the gentry , the clergy , the manufacturers , the merchants ; in short , nineteen-twentieths of those who had good roofs over their heads and good coats on their backs , became eager and intolerant Antijacobins . This feeling was at least as strong among the minister 's adversaries as among his supporters . Fox in vain attempted to restrain his followers . All his genius , all his vast personal influence , could not prevent them from rising up against him in general mutiny . Burke set the example of revolt ; and Burke was in no long time joined by Portland , Spencer , Fitzwilliam , Loughborough , Carlisle , Malmesbury , Wiudham , Elliot . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and orator diminished from about a hundred and sixty to fifty . In the House of Lords he had but ten or twelve adherents left . There can be no doubt that there would have been a similar mutiny on the ministerial benches if Pitt had obsti // qwq // most emphatically , of humiliation , was interrupted , twice in the short space of eleven months , by days of thanksgiviag for great victories . It may seem paradoxical to say that the incapacity which Pitt showed in all that related to the conduct of the war is , in some sense , the most decisive proof that he was a man of very extraordinary abilities . Yet this is the simple truth . For assuredly one-tenth part of his errors and disasters would have been fatal to the power and influence of any minister who had not possessed , in the highest degree , the *talents of a parliamentary leader . While his schemes were confounded , while his predictions were falsified , while the coalitions which he had labored to form were falling to pieces , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending in rout and disgrace , while the enemy against whom he was feebly coatending was subjugating Flanders and Brabant , the electorate of Mentz and the electorate of Treves , Holland , Piedmont , Liguria , Lombardy , his authority over the House of Commons was constantly becoming more and more absolute . There was his empire . There were his victories , his Lodi and his Arcola , his Rivoli and his Marengo . If some great misfortune , a pitched battle lost by the allies , the annexation of a new department to the French republic , a sanguinary insurrection in Ireland , a mutiny in the fleet , a panic in the city , a run on the bank , had spread dismay through the ranks of his majority , that dismay lasted only till he rose from the treasury bench , drew up his haughty head , stretched his arm with commanding gesture , and poured forth , in deep and sonorous tones , the lofty language of inextinguishable hope and inflexible resolution . Thus , through a long and calamitous period , every disaster that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a triumph within them . At length he had no longer an opposition to cacounter . Of the great party which had contended against him during the first eight years of his administration , more than one half now marched under his standard , with his old competitor the Duke of Portland at their head ; and the rest had , after many vain struggles , quitted the field in despair . Fox had retired to the shades of St. Anne 's Hill , and had there found , in the society of friends whom no vicissitude could estrange from him , of a woman whom he tenderly loved , and of the illustrious dead of Athens , of Rome , and of Florence , ample compensation for all the misfortunes of his public life . Session followed session with scarcely a single division . In the eventful year 1799 , the largest minority that could be mustered against the government was twenty-five . In Pitt 's domestic policy there was at this time assuredly no want of vigor . While he offered to French Jacobinism a resistance so feeble that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he put down English Jacobinism with a strong hand . The habeas corpus act was repeatedly suspended . Public meetings were placed under severe restraints . The government *obtained from Parliament power to send out of the country aliens who were suspected of evil designs ; and that power was not suffered to be idle . Writers who propounded doctrines adverse to monarchy and aristocracy were proscribed and punished without mercy . It was hardly safe for a republican to avow his political creed over his beef-steak and his bottle of port at a chop-house . The old laws of Scotland against sedition , laws which were considered by Englishmen as barbarous , and which a succession of governments had suffered to rust , were now furbished up and sharpened anew . Men of cultivated minds and polished manners were , for offenses which at Westminster would have been treated as mere misdemeanors , sent to herd with felons at Botany Bay . Some reformers , whose opinions were extravagant , and whose language was intemperate , but who had never dreamed of subverting the government by physical force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallows only by the righteous verdicts of juries . This severity was at the time loudly applauded by alarmists whom fear had made cruel , but will be seen in a very different light by posterity . The truth is , that the Englishmen who wished for a revolution were , even in number , not formidable , and , in every thing but number , a faction utterly contemptible , without arms , or funds , or plans , or organization , or leader . There can be no doubt that Pitt , strong as he was in the support of the great body of the nation , might easily have repressed the turbulence of the discontented minority by firmly yet temperately enforcing the ordinary law . Whatever vigor he showed during this unfortunate part of his life , was vigor out of place and season . He was all feebleness and languor in his conflict with the foreign enemy who was really to be dreaded , and reserved all his energy and resolution for the domestic enemy , who might safely have been despised . One part only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eighteenth century deserves high praise . He was the first English minister who formed great desigus for the benefit of Ireland . The manner in which the Roman Catholic population of that unfortunate country had been kept down during many generations seemed to him unjust and cruel ; and it was scarcely possible for a man of his abilities not to perceive that , in a contest aguiast the Jacobins , the Roman Catholics were his natural allies . Had he been able to do all that he wished , it is probable that a wise and liberal policy would have averted the rebellion of 1798 . But the difficulties which he encountered were great , perhaps insurmountable ; and the Roman Catholics were , rather by his misfortune than by his fault , thrown into the hands of the Jacobins . There was a third great rising of the Irishry against the Englishry , a rising not less formidable than the risings of 1641 and 1689 . The Englishry remained victorious ; and it was necessary for Pitt , as it had been necessary for Oliver Cromwell and William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be used . It is only just to his memory
