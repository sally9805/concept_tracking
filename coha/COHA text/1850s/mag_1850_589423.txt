txt DEMOCRATIC REVIEW . VOL . XXVII . SEPTEMBBR* 1850 . NO . CXLVIL* JEFFERSON AND FOX . To EXAMINE , define , and illustrate the Law of Human Progress , is one of the most interesting studies to the philosophical mind , and one of the most instructive to the practical man . We do not now intend to enter this inviting field of inquiry . That we live in an era of progress , is an universally admitted truth . That our age is , in this respect , distinguished from the times which preceded it , except in the celerity and vigor of the movement , will hardly be asserted by the student of history . Though the last three-quarters of a century has been remarkable for social and political progress in every part of the world , yet nowhere has the advance been more steady and rapid , or more astonishing and beneficial in its consequences , than in the United States and Great Britain . An illustrious ex*president* has but recently departed from among us , who saw a few depressed colonies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expand into a republic of thirty sovereign states , stretching its territory fl-cm the capes of the Delaware to the mouth of the Oregon , and from the Bay of Fundy to the valley of the Rio Grande , swelling its population from three millions of subjects to twenty-five millions of fi-cemen , becoming richer in all the attributes of true greatness than any contemporary power , and attaining a rank among nations which made its influence potent in every cabinet of Europe , and on this continent supi-eme . A distinguished ex-ministerf of Great Britain , whose death has just been chronicled , saw the long-waged contest between the throne and the people , between the privileges of the aristocracy and the rights of the cornmonalty of that country , result in gradual concessions to the demands of the latter , as worthy , on account of their number and importance , to be called a " Revolution , " as the events that dethroned the house of Stuart and crowned the Prince of Orange . * Gen. Jackson . VOL . XXVII. - NO . HI . Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both these countries , during the period we have specified , was caused mainly by combinations of men in each , organized on similar principles , though bearing different names . In America , this combination was originally called the Republican , and is now known *s the Democratic party ; in England it was once denominated the Whig , and is now known as the Liberal party . Both these parties were organized at about the same time-we allude to their modern characteristicsand each rallied under a leader of eminent attainments , who held unbounded sway over his followers , and had few equals and no superiors among his contemporaries , whether we regard the solidity of his talents or the lustre of his services . We need hardly add , that we allude to THOMAS JEFFERSON , and CHARLES JAMES Fox . There were striking points* of resemblance , as well as some marked dissimilarities , in the minds , characters , and histories of these great statesmen . The salient point of identity in their characters and histories is , that they embodied in their principles and reflected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their contemporaries , the progressive tendencies of their times , or , in popular phrase , " The Spirit of the Age . " To explain our meaning , we will briefly state what seems to us to be the modas operandi of Human Progress , not as it exists in our times merely , but as it has existed in all ages . At no period of the world have human institutions ( and we use the term in its broadest sense ) been so perfect that they would not adrait of improvement ; and never so imperfect that the evils they engendered were not surpassed by the blessings they conferred . On examining any era in the annals of the race , we find two classes of men viewing the institutions of their times from widely differing positions , and , as a consequence , placing very opposite estimates upon their value . The ardent , the ultra , the reckless , fix their eyes on prevalent evils , and attribute them to the inherent structure of existing ii*stitutions . Regarding the latter as too bad for amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . On the other hand , the placid , the inert , the timid , look exclusively at the blessings which surround them , and regard them as the legitimate and sole fruits of existing institutions . So believing , they esteem the latter as too perfect for improvement , and therefore would fain preserve them not only from destruction but from alteration . Occupying a middle ground between these extreme parties-neither of whom is wholly right nor wholly wrong-we discover a third class , who differ in many material points with both the others , and hold many opinions in common with each . This party admit the existence of the evils which the one extreme anathematizes , as well as the blessings which the other idolizes and would fain exterminate the former while preserving the latter . They are the true eclectics ; and searching for the happy medium between complete destruction and unimpaired preservation , they are ready to tear down when demolition will reform , and alert to build up when new creations will improve . Acting as the umpire between these extreme parties , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reasonable portions of the antagonists , who unite with them to destroy what is evil and conserve what is good in existing institutions , and to make such additions as will impart to them harmony and beauty . This combined party may be denominated CONSERVATIVE REFORMERS . // conjunctions of these three forces , have invariably been regulated by fixed laws , nor that their operations have always been obvious to the superficial eye . But , that three graind divisions of society , substantially such as we have indicated , have , from the earliest periods , been at work in carrying forward the cause of Human Progress , will scarcely be denied by those who have studied the nature of man and the history of the race . To this great middle party of Conservative Reformers , belonged Jefferson and Fox . And it is this party which has borne America and England onward in the path of improvement so rapidly during the past fifty or sixty years . We will hriefly note some of the steps in the social and political advancemeat of our own and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a complex and exquisitely balanced polity , created by ourselves without aid from foreign precedents , so administered as to guard the sovereignty of the several states while maintaining the supremacy of the federal head ; and laws so framed as to bestow the largest measure of individual liberty consistent with social order  --  the electoral suffrage extended to the entire body of the people ; and the powers of legislation and administration , to an unprecedented extent , taken from select bodies of officials , and restored to the masses of the constituency , making them in fact what they were in theory , " sovereigns "  --  the common and statute law systematized and simplified , the courts made accessible to the needy , and judges rendered amenable to the people by means of frequent elections  --  the sanguinary features of the penal code removed , imprisonment for debt abolished , penitentiaries converted into housed of reformation , poor-houses into homes for the friendless , and asylums erected to soothe , educate and restore , the deag dumb , blind and insane  --  the monopolies of banking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the learned professions , either wholly abolished , or compelled to run an equal race with individual competition  --  the utmost freedom of speech , the press , and of religion , guarantied and enjoyed-rudimental education universally and freely diffused , and newspapers and libraries established in every considerable village - labor , fairly paid and made honorable , uniting with enterprise , skill and capital , to clear forests larger tha.n all England , to construct roads , canals , and railways across states by whose side European principalities dwindle to rural parishes , to invent machinery and establish manufactures suited to our peculiar wants , and to cloud the most distant ports with the sails of our commerce  --  the national honor maintained on the land and on the sea. , while exhibiting the national hospitality by receiving to our shores and admitting to the rights of citizenship millions of the subjects of foreign states-and , in a word , we have seen the capacity of man for self-government vindicated and illustrated under institutions which maintain the supremacy of law without stifling the aspirations of liberty . This brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide even from the eye of envious ciiticism those few social evils yet existing among us , which time alone can remedy . During the period over which we have glanced , we have seen the middling and lower classes of England , acting under heroic leaders , explode the dangerous doctrines of constructive treason , modify the law of libel , sedition and conspiracy , and place the freedom of speech , of the press , and of assembling , under the protection of juries-humanize the entire penal code , greatly circumscribe the death-penalty , and secure the full benefits of counsel to prisoners on trial for their lives-remove many // abuses in the administration of the civil courts , make them more accessible to the poor , and simplify the whole body of the laws-render the law of debtor and creditor more tolerant of the misfortunes of the former , and infuse a little of the leaven of charity into the poor laws-make it possible for a landless sportsman to " wing " a pheasant without being himself maimed by a spring-gun , arid for a peasant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his offence on the gallows ; extend more widely the blessings of rudimental schools , cripple the educational monopoly of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge , and give an upward bound to the national intellect , by means of cheap publications , mechanics ' institutes , and periodicals conducted on liberal principles ; curb the power of the established church , and relieve dissenters from political disabilities and ecclesiastical persecution , by repealing the test acts and emancipating the Catholics ; greatly increase the influence of the commonalty , by destroying the rotten borough-system of representation , and extending the suffrage to half a million of artisans , yeomen and shopkeepers ; give increased freedom to commerce , by abolishing the East India monopoly , the corn laws , and the navigation laws ; improve the administration of justice in the penal colonies , restore nominal freedom to large masses of colonial subjects , and compel ministers to listen to the complaints of colonial legislatures ; and , in brief render the cabinet , the parliament , and the judiciary , more obedient to the dictates of public opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c . These achievements , so salutary in their immediate consequeJices , and inspiring so much hope for the future , tend to mitigate the abhorrence with which Christendom views the continued oppression of millions of British subjects , at home and abroad . Now , we do not assert , that the events we have noted have been produced solely through the agency of the democratic and liberal parties of America and En land ; but we do say , that , so far as they can be called political events , they are the legitimate fruits of those principles which are embodied in the creed , and have been reflected in the measures of those parties , and which are not thus embodied and reflected by the federal or whig party of this country , and the tory or conservative party of England . Though the position of Messrs . Jefferson and Fox , at the head of the democratic and liberal parties of their respective countries , is the salient point of resemblance in their public lives and characters , the likeness between them does not terminate here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated or combated , and the events in which they participated or sympathized , were the same , or exhibited striking points of similarity . Jefferson and Fox entered public life the same year-one , as a representative in the colonial legislature of Virginia  --  and the other , as a inember of the British house of Commons-both being subjects of George III . Both continued in public life nearly forty years , distinguished for extraordinary convulsions , and both bore parts in the great drama of tmfluiirs so conspicuous as to make their names familiar in all parts of the world . Though one lived and died a liege subject of his king , while the other early threw off his allegiance to the crown , and took a leading share in a successful attempt to despoil it of its brightest jewel ; yet the Io*ralist was quite as cordially hated by his sovereign as the rebel . // There was abundant cause for this . Few men in the American Congress were more vehement in their denunciations of the ministry for their treatment of this country during the revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sided with Burke , Barr6 and Dunning , in espousing the cause of the colonies , and nightly rained down upon king and minister a pitiless storm of logic , wit , sarcasm and anathcma . If to report the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia , and stake life , fortune , and sacred honor upon the issue , requircd heroic courage in the favorite son of the Old Dominion , then , to defend that Declaration in Westminster , exhibited courage not less heroic in the classic scion of Holland House . Much as our great citizen rejoiced over the peace of 1783 , his joy could scarcely surpass that of the great Commoner . Arid a king , whose attachment to his colonies amounted to fanaticism , might he pardoned for hating the subject Fox as heartily as the rebel Jefferson . Jefferson and Fox were the early friends of the French Revolution , deplored the excesses into which it was driven by fanaticism , but vindicated its neeessity , gloried in its general principles , and maintained that the sublime doctrines mixed with its fire and blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew upon them great obloquy at home , while they endeared their names to the republicans of France . Mr. Jefferson , when the Revolution commenced , was our minister at that Court . His society was sought , not only by Condorcet , DAlembert , and other men of letters and science , hut he was often consulted by Mirabeau , La Fayette , and other leading revolutionists . The Declaration of the Rights of Man was drafted at his house , the pen of the author of the Americair Declaration hearing a part in its composition . He also assisted in perfecting the first Constitution , which was modeled by a committee sitting at his house . During the same period , Mr. Fox declared the taking of the Bastile as " the greatest and best event that had happened in the century , " and he pronounced a splendid eulogium , on the floor of Parliament , upon the Declaration , and vindicated the acts of the National Assembly . After Mr. Jefferson 's return to this country , and while at the head of Gen. Washington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which blanched the cheek of Christendom . Notwithstanding the attack on the Tuilleries , the seizure of the king , and the massacre in the prisons , Mr. Jefferson still clung to the cause of France ; combating the sentiments of his colleague , Hamilton ; avowing his hostility to the polic.y of Pitt ; and encouraging the hopes of Washington . Here , his sentiments and position were similar to those of T ? ox in England . The events to which we have alluded filled Britain with alarm . Societies for " Constitutional Reform " had been organized in London . Their avowed object was a reform in Parliament . The character of many of their members , the Duke of Richmond , Fox , Grey , Whitbread , Sheridan and Tierney being of the number , forbid the idea that treasonable designs could have been cloaked under their ostensible objects . The king suddenly convened Parliament , and in the address from the throne declared , that under the plausible pretext of discussing a reform in Parliament , conspiracies existed for overthrowing the government , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate which followed , Fox met his royal master with the declaration , that " there was not one fact stated in His Majesty 's speech which was not false-not one assertion // or insinuation that was not unfounded . Its prominent feature was , that it was an intolerable calumny on the people of Great Britain : an insinuation of so gross and black a nature as to demand the most rigorous inquiry and the most severe punishment . " These words of thunder , aided by the shower of ridicule , glittering with wit and epigram , which Sheridan poured down upon the royal panic-maker , did much to restore the nation to its senses . Two years later , Pitt having resolved to crush the Societies , at all hazards , paved the way for indictments for high treason , by introducing bills to suspend the habeas corpus , and to clothe the government with extraordinary powers in arresting suspicious persons . On this occasion , Fox made a stand for the ancient liberties of the people , raising his voice to more piercing tones as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constitutional freedom , who *athercd around him , to hope for the rising of a better day for the good cause . The bills passed . Then came the trials of Tooke and hardy , the splendid exertions of Erskine in their defence , the triumphant acquittal of the prisoners , and the final explosion of the doctrines of constructive treason . We can barely allude to the subsequent struggles of Fox and Erskine to modify the law of sedition and conspiracy , resulting in the carrying through Parliament of a declaratory act , making the jury in such cases " the judges of the law and the fact . " During these perilous times in England , the same antagonist principles were in conflict on this side of the Atlantic . The war was not as fiercely waged ; for the friends of " a strong central government , " which should have power to arrest " suspicious persons , " regardcd themselves as farther removed from the contagion of " French principles , " than did the same school of politicians in Eugland . The alien and sedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adanis , were shoots of the same soil which produced the suspension of the habeas corpus , and the indictment of Tooke for treason , and of the Dean of St. Asaph for sedition . Jefferson , with more calmness , as befitted his more placid temperament , but with not the less vigor , waged the same battle here which Fox fought in England , acting on the principle afterwards announced in his first inaugural message , that " error of opinion may be safely tolerated , where reason is left free to combat it . " We have spoken of the high esteem in which Mr. Jefferson was held by the friends of liberty in France . The war between England and that country , during the greater part of the revolutionary period , prevented Mr. Fox crossing the channel . After the peace ot Amiens he repaired to Paris , where he was warmly welcomed by the republicans , much courted by the literary savans of the metropolis , and received with ' marked distinction by the First Consul , with whom he had several interviews . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the remarkable men of whom we are speaking , would have admnirably fitted them to excite enthusiasm in the saloons of Paris , even though their liberal opinions and early sympathy with the French cause had not inspired the confidence and won the admiration of that susceptible and brilliant people . The estrangement , growing out of their different views of the French revolution , which took place between Fox and Burke , who had gone " shoulder to shoulder " through the American contest , was not unlike that which occurred between Jefferson and hamilton . Both the latter had // acted conspicuous parts in the revolution . One had written its Declaration of Independence ; the other had contributed to frame its Constitution . Both had the confidence of Washington , and were called to the highest seats in his cabinet . But they widely difhred in their opinions of the antagonist policies of France and England , and of the necessity for a strong central government for America , which should curb the expression of individual sentiments , and merge the sovereignty of the states in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conservative portion of his countrymen , while the other was the recognized lcadcr of the party of progress , whose principles and measures have carried the nation steadily forwa*d in the path of improvement and renown . Yet it is believed that they entertained mutual respect for each other 's motives and characters . For twenty-five years , Fox and Burke rarely differed in their opinions of public measures , and they cherished for each other unbounded esteem and admiration . After their separation . the former gratefully said of the latter , that " he had learned more from him alone , than from all other men and authors ; " and Burke generously declared , that " he knew Fox when he was nineteen , since which he had risen by steady advances to be the most brilliant and accomplished debater the world had ever seen . " The writings of Burke , in'spired by the terrors of the French revolution-gorgeous in style , impregnated with philosophy , but displaying a gloomy distrust of the capacity of man for self-governmentare still quoted as authority by the alarmists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the talisman of the party whose future triumphs in the liberal cause will pale the brilliant victories already won under the banner which he unfurled in the night of European freedom . Both Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Fox were in favor of conferring upon the whole people the largest measure of political rights . The early advocacy of this doctrine by the former is well known . He is the oracle or the party that inscribes among the cardinal articles of its creed , equality of representation and universal suffrage , and which has incorporated those principles into so many state constitutions . Nearly sixty years ago , Mr. Fox , as chainrman of a committee of an association , called " Friends of the People , " made an elaborate report in fayor of a reform in Parliament , which should include universal suffrage , votiag by ballot , annual sessions , equal representative districts , no property qualification for representatives , and payment of members for services-thc very " six points " since advocated by the Chartists . Both these broad-minded men were also the friends of unrestricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were never able to believe , that the best way to convert a heretic was to roast him ; nor , that making the profession of a particular creed the necessary passport to political advancement , promoted the purity of the Church ; nor , that ecclesiastical anathemas and sectarian acrimony encouraged the growth of that charity which suffereth long and is kind , which beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , and endureth all things . In his youth , Jefferson caused religious liberty to be made a fundamental article in the " Bill of Rights of Virginia ; " and the epitaph , of few words hut voluminous meaning . which he dictated for his tomb , in his old age , proclaimed hun as the " author of the Declaration of Independence , of the statute of Virginia for religious freedom , and the father of the University of Virginia . " Two of the earliest and ablest speeches of Fox were against compelling subscription to the thirty-. // nine articles as a qualification for admission to the Universities , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which measures , as well as of Catholic emancipation , he was the steady friend and advocate . It would compel us to go too much into detail to specify other particular measures , substantially identical , which received the support of these men . Suffice it to say , that in all the contests that occurred during their long and eventful career , they took the side of the people against power , advocating the mental , personal , religious and political freedom of man , irrespective of dune , color , creed or condition . Fox and Jefferson possessed minds of uncommon native acuteness and vigor , which they amply stored with the treasures of learning and knowledge . Each was the favorite son of a fond father . Fox was nobly descended . His father , the first lord Holland , was an eminent statesman and orator , and his mother was the daughter of the Duke of Richmond . Early discovering marks of extraordinary genius in his son , his father bestowed great pains in affording him a complete education . Jefferson , though his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father 's early education was totally neglected , but a naturally strong mind and much subsequent reading , supplied in some measure the deficiencies of his youth and raised him to positions of considerable influence . lIe died when Thomas was fourteen , having previously given him every means of education in his power . As a student , Fox realized the highest hopes of his father by taking rank among the first scholars at Eton and Oxford , where he distinguished himself for the keenness and vigor of his reasoning faculties , and acquired a taste for classical literature , which he cultivated with pleasure and assiduity through life . Jefferson was but two years at college . His favorite instructor , Dr. Sniall , an enthusiast in physical science , inspired his pupil with that fondness for philosophical pursuits for which he became so distinguished . lie studied law under George Wythe , who possessed one of the most profound , acute and liberal minds that Virginia ever produced , and who was an ardent friend of civil and religious freedom . The instructions of this celebrated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in training his intellect , but in opening to him the rcad to preferment and distinction . Of him , Jefferson has gratefully said , " He was my faithful and beloved mentor in youth , and my most affectionate friend through life . " Fox , after leaving the University , made the tour of Europe ; and having reached his majority , he entered the House of Commons , then resplendent with the rising genius of Burke , and the retiring glory of Chatham . In this great school he matured those rare powers of forensic eloquence which ultimately gave him the mastery in an arena where North , Pitt , Burke , Windham , Sheridan , Grattan , Erskine , Canning , Castlereagh and Grey , struggled for supremacy . Jefferson came to the bar under the patronage of Wythe , and was soon after elected to the provincial legislature , in whose proceedings he bore a leading part . During the preliminary conflicts with the mother country , Wythe and Jefferson were among the chiefs of the opposition in Virginia , and when the crisis had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of In dependence , both master and pupil signing the immortal Declaration which the latter had penned . Unfortunately for Fox , extreme indulgence was mingled with parental fondness , and his continental tour , during which he spent some time at Paris and Spa , afforded him opportunity to imbibe those habits of gaming which were the bane of his existence . // 201 The grave duties which occupied the youth of Jefferson , and his remoteness from those " sores on the body politic , " ( as he has denominated large cities , ) combined , with his naturally calm temperament , to save him from those excesses which made Fox their sport . His social habits were as serene and pure as the unruffled sky that arched the summit of his own Monticello . It is a mistake , however , to suppose that the gaming-table engrossed much of the mind , though it dissipated a good deal of the time and money , of Fox . An anecdote illustrates this : One night he had played deep and lost enormously . He seemed much depressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his air solemn and abstract . His friends were alarmed , and followed him through the streets , at a sufficient distance to elude his observation , while he made his way borne . Reaching his dwelling , they rushed in in time to prevent the rash deed of suicide ; and bursting into the library found him stretched on the floor , divested of his coat and cravat , his hand grasping , not a razor , but a volume of Herodotus , which he was perusing with the utmost avidity ! Mr. Fox was inferior to few professed scholars in his knowledge of the literature of Greece and Rome . He was well versed in the languages and literature of modern nations , and few of his contemporaries were so deeply read in the general , constitutional and political history of his own country , or so well acquainted with the condition of the nations with which it had diplomatic and commercial intercourse . But , his knowledge of the exact sciences , of metaphysical philosophy , and even of political economy , was confined to the baldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classics . He would rush from the Commons at midnight , where he had been grappling with Pitt and his legions for hours , covered with the dust and foam of the fight , and plunge into Homer as into a refreshing bath . During the four years that he almost wholly absented himself from Parliament , through despair and disgust at the turn of affairs , he dwelt in the country , employing his time in gardening , farming , and studying the Greek poets and historians . Here , too , he began gatherin* the materials for the history which he did not live to finish . The acquirements of Mr. Jefferson were quite as varied as those of Mr. Fox , though not of precisely the same kind . He delighted more in physical science than in classical literature , though he was by no means as negligent of the latter as Mr. Fox was of the former . He was a reader of the best Greek and Roman authors , and was skilled in some of the modern languages . And if Mr. Fox excelled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he counterbalanced this by his greater familiarity with the principles of law , mathematical science , and mental and moral philosophy . Mr. Jefferson was wont to escape from the drudgery and irritation of official cares , and relax his mind in the midst of his books and apparatus , and he was peculiarly fond of the society and conversation of learned men . Like Fox , he withdrew some four years from public life , disgusted with the tendencies of the times , and like him he cultivated the earth and enriched his mind , while watching the progress of events , counseling his political friends , and preparing to lead them to victory . Fox 's stormy life was arrested in mid-career and in the zenith of his fame . Jefferson spent the long evening of his lustrous day , in the prosecution of his favorite studies , in corresponding with a vast circle of emiiient scholars , statesmen and philanthropists in both hemispheres , and in entertaining throngs of admirers from all countries , The libraries , cabinets , gall cries and gardens of Monticello , // richly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosities gathered from all climes , were the favorite resort of strangers and pilgrims from every part of the world , drawn thither by curiosity , or to testify their homage to the liberal patron of science and the illustrious apostle of liberty . Each of these devoted students became an author . Mr. Fox wrote some highly-co**inended Latin and Greek poetry , while at school ; prepared a few numbers of a paper called " The Englishman , " after he became a politician ; and in the heighth of his pQwer published a letter to the Electors of Westminster . After his death , his nephew gave to the world , his " History of the Early Part of the Reign of James II. , " a mere fragment of his plan of a History of the Revolution of 1688 . Though displaying grc* t research and ability , its Thucydidean style cxhibits little of that fire which used to electrify the House of Commons . His other writings were confined to official papers . As an author , he is outranked by Mr. Jefferson . The style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency and grace . His pamphlet of 1774 , entitled " A Summary View of the Rights of British America , " and addressed to the king , was republished in England under the auspices of Burke , and rapidly rua through several editions . His " Notes on Virginia were republished in England and France , and his numerous Essays on political and philosophical subjects , were extensively read at home and abroad , giving him celebrity as a civilian and devotee of letters and science . his Manual of Parliamentary Practice , prepared when he was Vice-President , is a standard authority in all the legislatures of the country . The four volumes of his posthumous works are replete with instruction and interest to varied classes of readers . His state papers will be cherished by his countrymen while their free institutions endure . Fox was the greatest debater of modern times . Jefferson never reached even a second or third place as an orator . Tie never aspired to be an eloquent debater , and is not recognized as a public speaker of any grade . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error in his early training . No person , with such a penetrating mind , such stores of knowledge , such self-possession , and such powers of conversation , as belonged to him , need fail of reaching a high , if not the first rank among orators , if he will . Eloquence is not a gift , but an attainment ; not an inspiration , but an acquisition . Perfection , or even respectability in the art , can be reached only by the study of the best models , united with unwearied practice . Jefferson was an admirer and student of the rarest models of ancient and modern eloquence . The rest was within himself . He omitted to practice an art whose theory he must have well understood . True , he had a hesitating delivery and a feeble voice . But Fox overcame the former by participating in every debate which occurred in the Commons , and Deinosthenes remedied the latter by declaiming against the raging waves on the seashore . Fox was not what , in comm on phrase , is called " a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply great deficiencies . The means by which he did these he has disclosed . After he had reached the acme of his fame , he said , that on becoming a member of Parliament he resolved to let no question pass , under discussion , without speaking upon it , and to address the House every night . And he added , that he never failed to do so but a few times , and regretted these omissions . Such a resolution would appear absurd in a less robust and // cultivated mind , and its execution by a less vigorous and skillful hand would probably result in making the experimenter , not the first debater , but the greatest bore , of his age . Fox 's eminently Demosthenean discipline was only an extreme application of the old rule , that " practice makes perfect . " His ambition was to become an orator . He loved the power , hut despised the drudgery of office . His road to high station was early obstructed . He took sides with the people against the , throne , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nation , early gave place to his passion for leading a band of followers , of which the country was not worthy . his youthful aspirations to control the policy of a kingdom , were ultiraately abandoned for the determination to confound the counsels and conquer the intellects of its rulers . lie aimed to become an orator , not in the common-place , nor even in the Ciceronian sense of the term , but an orator that should inform the reason rather than amuse the fancy ; that should trace effects down to causes , and causes up to effects ; that should convince the judgments and bend the wills , while swaying the feelings and firing the passions , of his auditors . His position as the leader of an Opposition , not less than the texture and temper of his mind , made him rather a debater than an orator . Consequently , his greatest displays were in the reply ; his feehlest in the opening . His long service in a minority , and his brief experience as a Minister , rendered him more powerful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . But this defect vanished when advocating the cause of civil and religious freedom . Then his warm soul inspired his capacious intellect , and his mind moved in the sublimity of power when his heart generated the momentum . The distinguishing characteristics of his oratory were penetrating reason , glowing vehemence , and lucid simplicity . These elements constituted that rare union of strength and splendor , which gave him pre-eminence in an age prolific in eloquence . The peerless men whose characters we are observing , were alike remarkable for gentleness of disposition , simplicity of manners , and comprehensive humanity . MacIntosh says of Fox , that " he united in a most remarkable degree , the seemingly repugnant characters of the mildest of men and the most vehement of orators . " With all his vast acquirements , and when swaying the counsels or shaking the senates of a kingdom , he was as free from vanity , ostentation and arrogance , as a child . He has given a definition of humanity , which he illustrated in his acts . Says he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in listening to the story of human suffering , and endeavoring to relieve it . " The kindliness , the modesty , the courtesy of Jefferson , were proverbial . The unvarying placability of his temper , disarmed opponents and won very friends . The philosophic placidity which shone so serenely in his social intercourse , made him the delightful companion of the grave and the thoughtful ; and his urbanity , lively conversation , and unaffected interest in their prosperity , won the confidence and inspired the admiration of youth . His services iii behalf of the middling and lower classes of society , are the enduring memorials of his benevolence and philanthropy . What more humiliating evidence of the blind malignity of party spirit do our times afford , than the fact that both these men were the objects of the unsparing malevolence of their political opponents , whose bitterness , even the grave of the one and the seclusion of the other , were for a long time insufficient to abate. // It is not as the great orator and great writer , that posterity will remember Fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Their deeds carried their fame over the world like sunshine ; and these will iiever die . As the mists of prejudice and party clear away , they will disclose few points in the public career of these illustrious statesmen , which their disciples will choose to obliterate or obscure .
