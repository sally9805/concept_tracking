UNITED STATES 1EYJEW . JUNE , 1855 . AUTO.BIOGRAPIIY OF THE HONORABLE ICHABOD RAGAMUFFIN . SEEING that no one else seems inclined to do me that favor , and being now in the enjoyment of oats and dignity-as my schoolmaster used to say-I have come to the resolution of doing justice to myself , by relating the most remarkable events of my life . To this I am not in the slightest degree impelled by an ambition to emulate the renown of the immortal Barnum , the illustrious Chevalier Wikoff , the heroes of the Newgate Calendar , or those fortunate victims of the law whose last dying speeches carry their memories with due honor to the latest posterity . If I know myself , I have no other motive than an earnest desire to benefit the rising generation of my young countrymen , by showing how men may rise to the highest dignities and the most splendid fortunes , by the exercise of those talents graciously bestowed by Providence without distinction of birth , or any of those advantages which so often supply the absence of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place called Misery Hollow , which might be called a Land of Promise , seeing it promised nothing and strictly kept its word , and being a sort of House of Refuge for those persecuted victims who are , as it were , exiled from 29 // society because they are too independent to submit to those vexatious restraints imposed on them by the tyranny of the law and the meddling interference of their neighbors , who might better attend to their own business instead of interfering with that of other people . I can not tell the precise day , month , or year of my birth , seeing I was at that time too young to remember such matters ; and my parents having a house full of children , as well as a great many other matters to attend to , could never tell when they were born , or the order in which they came into the world . It is a long while since I left Misery Hollow ; but I remember it was a very romantic spot in the recesses of the mountains , distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a winding path rendered almost impassable by rocky preciDices . It was not very fruitful , being almost entirely covered with loose stones that had fallen from the surrounding mountains ; but this was of no consequence , as none of the inhabitants did any work , except in the dark nights , and sometimes by the light of the moon , all being disciples of the Higher Law , which ordains that every man has a right to live if not at his own expense at that of his fellow-creatures . In truth , they had one and all retired from " the busy haunts of men , " from a natural disinclination to all kinds of employment but that which , by way of distinguishing it from other vulgar labor , is emphatically called " Head-Work . " For the benefit of my young readers , for whose edification this article is especially intended , I shall here digress a moment to apprise them what is meant by " head-work , " a practical knowledge of which is of the last importance , inasmuch as it does away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , instead of fagging morning , noon , and night at some one of those occupations of which it is sufficient to say , in order to consign them to utter contempt , that they are useful , you retire as it were into yourself , for the purpose of studying other people , and castin* about how you may best take advantage of their folly , their credulity , their inexperience , or their money . Your conscience need not trouble you on this score , since it is a law of nature that the strong animal always preys on the weak , and it stands to reason that there would be no use in one man having more sense than another , if he did not employ it for his own special benefit . Having sin*led out your game , you proceed to run it down . If you are so fortunate as to scent a fool with plenty of money in his pocket , your fortune is made ; for you can not fail of leading him into some // grand speculation in railroad stocks , steam-boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which , if you are good at head work , and have wit enough to live by your wits , you may safely calculate on making a speedy transfer of the money of your particular friend into your own pocket . Tf you chance to encounter a knowing one , it is diamond cut diamond ; but this only requires a little more management , since in all my experience , which has been pretty extensive , I have found that the easiest man in the world to get to windward of is a knowing one , who is generally so entirely occupied in getting to windward of others , that he forgets to look to himself just as the fowler in the fable , who was so taken up with watching his game that he trod on a snake and was bitten to death . Thus , between the fool and the knowing one , if you understand headwork thoroughly , you ca n't fail of feathering your nest handsomely , and retiring betimes to the enjoyment of oats and dignity , without wasting your life in vulgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy them . But I shall content myself here with laying down general principles for the direction of my young readers , leaving them to be practically exemplified in the sequel of this my auto-biography . I pass over the early years of my life as affording little amusement , and less instruction ; suffice it to say , my education was liberal , for it was at the public expense , and that the schoolmaster , who was an excellent judge of horse-flesh , often predicted I should one day become a distinguished man in some way or other , for I always got thnbetter of my schoolmates in a bargain , and never failed in substituting the back of another in place of my own . " Take my word , " said the worthy man , " if he ever gets a chance , he 'll make the feathers fly out of them " I however left school before finishing my education , just after learning the multiplication-table , and may justly boast of being a self-made man . This lucky termination of my studies-for so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with too much learning-was owing to my father having been sacrificed  --  to speak metaphorically-at the shrine of that great idol , the rights of property , which one would think was the only deity in this world worth worshipping . In short , not to be too particular , he became a victim to the tyranny of the law , and lost his liberty merely because he had taken the liberty of entering a house without knocking , and helping himself to some of its contents , forgetting to ask permission of the owner . On the whole , as previously intimated , this was a fortu // nate circumstance for me . I was thrown on my own resources at the age of thirteen , as my mother , finding I had a natural and insuperable antipathy to all working , except head-work , for which there was no sphere in Hungry Hollow , gave me a walking-ticket , and disinherited me without further ceremony . But I did not mind this , as my father 's estate , divided among thirteen children , did not amount to much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untoward event of my life , as will appear in the sequel , turned out in the end a most fortunate circumstance . I may say , with great truth , I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth -- though heaven only knows where it came from , for there was not a single one in all Hungry Hollow-and , in turnino* a s never failed to light on my feet . * ummerset* Whether by the advice of others , or from sheer instincts I ca n't now recollect , I determined at once to make tracks towards the great emporium , where the wicked never cease from troubling and the weary are never at rest , and where there is never any difficulty in living , because society preys on itself just as the bear thrives by sucking his own paws . How I paid my way on the road is no body 's business , and how I obtained a capital for entering into the fraternity of news-boys , I shall consider it a piece of impertinent curiosity in the reader to inquire . Suffice to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuits of literature , and , in process of time , grew to be acquainted with those occult mysteries by means of which the most ignorant bloekheads , who never saw a painting except on a sign-post , become great connoisseurs in the art ; the most illiterate boobies formidable critics ; and fellows hardly qualified for bear-leaders aspire to direct public opinion on questions , whose solution has hitherto baffled the wisdom of ages . But I scorn to betray my fellow-laborers in the field of litera*ture , and shall abstain from proceeding to particulars . The world knows too much already , and has become almost too wise to be honest . I do n't wish to follow in the track of some recent candidates for immortality , who have made their auto-biographies a vade mecurn-as my lawyer has it-for all students in the science of humbuggery , swindling , and head-work . In the course of my literary career , I sometimes carried an adventure of newspapers of all kinds -- for I was perfectly neutral in my politics , that is to say , I belonged to all parties-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steamboat , and in winter on the railroad , to the city of Albany , where I made // myself favorably known to some of the most respectable newsmongers by bawling out louder than any of my competitors , " Great news from Sebastopol , " or some other famous place . On one of these occasions  --  the Legislature being in sessionmy good genius , to whom I can not express my obligations for various kind offices , inspired me to pay a visit to that hallowed spot where all the collected wisdom , not to say virtue , of the State is congregated . I do n't remember in what way exactly , but some how or other , I insinuated myself into the lobby of the House , where , seeing a man staring at me rather equivocally , I presented him with a copy of each of my assortment of papers , and declined taking payment . This proved a lucky hit , for the gentleman was a member of the House , and did me several good offices afterwards , as will appear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , for the special benefit of my young readers , who have doubtless been stultified by ignorant parents , and still more ignorant pedagogues , with various panegyrics on modesty and all that sort of nonsense . Now , if I had not intruded , as these thickskulled moralists call it , into the sacred precincts consecrated to the wisdom and virtue of the State , I might , in all probability , have remained a crier of newspapers all my life , and never furnished materials for an auto-biography . I maintain , and appeal to my own experience , that there is not in this world so great an obstacle in the way of rising in life , especially if a man means to do it by head work , as that sneaking quality which has some how or other got the reputation of a virtue . Modesty is only another name for cowardice ; and to be ashamed is to be afraid of doing a thing . How often do we lose a benefit by being too modest to ask for it , or from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that pitiful fellow called Modest Merit entirely overlooked in the distribution of the loaves and fishes , because forsooth he is pleased to think he is not qualified to do the duties of some office , which , if only let alone , will discharge themselves ? And how is the world to know a man 's merits or qualifications , utiless he proclaims them from the house-tops or subsidizes a trumpeter to do it for him ? Did my young readers ever happen to see a modest man become distinguished in any profession , especially that of a trading politician ? Did they ever meet with a lawyer who was perpetually exhibiting his consciousness of deficiency by blushing , or one ever suspected of modesty that had reached the lowest steps in the ladder of exaltation , or established an incontestable right not only to brow-beat witnesses , // but to insult the bench and the jury ? I could easily cite the other liberal professions as examples of the pernicious influence of modesty in obstructing the fortunes both of men and women , were it not for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with appealing to my own experience : I never , to the best of my recollection , lost any thing by neglecting to ask for it , except on two occasions , for which I have not forgiven myself to this day , not because I have not done much better , but because , for these times only , I became the dupe of that great enemy of man called modesty . One of these was declining to become a candidate for a professorship of languages in a college that had just received a donation of two hundred thousand acres of land , merely because I understood only English ; the other , refusing the appointment of judge , because I knew nothing of law at that time , though I flatter myself at this present writing there is no man living who can go nearer the net of the law without being caugl*t in its meshes than myself . But , not to dwell too long on this topic , I shall conclude by solemnly warning my young readers against modesty , that great and insurmountable obstacle to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the infallible sign of a guilty conscience , and stick fast to the maxim that men should never be ashamed of any thing they have not been ashamed to do . I now return to my narrative , from which I have been diverted by perhaps an over-zealous desire to benefit my young readers . It may have been from having discovered , through that instinct or freemasonry which is said to draw certain classes of people together , that I had got among kindred spirits , or from my having , as before stated , been born with a silver spoon in my mouth ; but so it was , I at once found myself quite at home . I was impelled , as it were by an irresistible impulse , to hover perpetually about the hallowed precincts of legislation , ahd having , through favor of my friend the member I had conciliated as aforesaid , obtained the entr6e of . the lobby , I spent most of my . time there to good purpose . Being naturally observant of what was going forward , and apt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and mystery of legislation according to the latest modern improvements . In this I was greatly aided by a man I met every day in the lobby , whisking about , tizzy-whizzying , taking the members by the button as they passed to and fro to the bar outside-it was before the triumph of the liquor law-whispering in their ear , winking , blinking , squinting , and making all sorts of strange faces . To say the truth , he looked as much like a rogue as any // you might see going in and out of the legislative hail ; but I found him an honest man who lived altogether by head-work , which he practised principally on the honorable members of the Legislature . I shall not mention his name , not having his permission to do so , ( occasional fits of modesty being his only weakness , ) but designate him as the Lobby Member . As I always allowed him to look over my budget of papers free of cost , he took a great liking to me , and we often had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not confidential . " Ichabod , my lad , " at length he said to me one day , " this hawking about newspapers is but a poor business for a boy of your talents ; for I see you are very clever , and are qualified for head-work . Now , you must know I am a Lobby Member , as the phrase is-that is to say , an outside member of the Legislature , whose special business is to enlighten those within . " **46;540;TOOLONG , I did not exactly comprehend what a Lobby Member meant . Whereupon he took me aside into the recess of a window , and addressed me in a confidential tone as follows : I devoured every word with both ears , for I soon found I had fallen into the hands of a consummate teacher . " You must know , Ichabod-you will allow me to call you by your Christian name , for , to say the truth , your other is rather unseemly-you must know , Ichabod , that there have of late years been great improvements in the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was supposed that the great business of legislators was the enactment of general laws for the security of person and property , which should operate as far as possible equally on all , and give no individual , or class of individuals , advantages over any and all others . But the enlightened spirit of the age has discovered that this system of legislation does not keep pace with the march of mind and the progress of improvement . The new , and no doubt correct theory is , that the government occupies towards the people a position precisely similar to that of the head of a family in relation to his children . In fact , it is now settled that every government , especially every free government , is patriarchal . Do yovi understand what a patriarchal government is , Ichabod ? " To this I replied , that I had a sort of confused recollection of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , Hagar in the wilderness , and Tobit // and his Dog ; but I should be glad he would be a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patriarchal republican government is , one that exercises all the functions of the head of a family ; meddles with the business , controls the amusemerits , directs the actions , and metes out the indulgences of every member just as he pleases , and without any regard to the pretended right of all his children to be dealt with equally . A patriarchal government , such as we have recently had the happiness to live under , in like manner assumes a complete discretion in dealing with the different members of the great family placed under its protection . It is a sort of universal almoner , not only to and withholding from whom it pleases , privileges , immunities , and benefactions , but actually benefiting one at the expense of another . It keeps a wary eye on all innocent amusements and indulgences ; and , if one in a hundred carries them to excess , the other ninety-nine are very reasonably prohibited from enjoying them in moderation . Like the patriarch Jacob , it has its favorite Joscphs , on whom it bestows the splendid coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as banks , railroads , maunfactures , or some other species of corporate body , which for the time being is the recipient of all its bounties . It is to be observed that most of these pets are selected from one class , or I should say , two classes  --  to wit , the moneyed men and the men of political influence , which is both natural and proper , since it req*1ires money , or at least credit , to set up a bank , build a railroad , or establish a manufacturing corporation , and political influence to gain a seat in the Legislature . But I will dilate no more at present on this branch of the subject . If you accept the offer I shall presently make , you will have ample opportunity of acquiring an experience that will infallibly lead you to the acquisition of a fortune . " Here I pricked up my ears , and earnestly begged him to proceed . " The great difficulty , " continued the Lobby Member , " the great difficulty in carrying out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called , is in the proper selection of objects for the receipt of the national , or I should rather call it , legislative bounty , which , as a general rule , should always be equally advantageous to the giver and receiver . It can not be supposed that the members of a legislative body are always qualified to make a judicious selection of proper objects for public charity , or to weigh the claims of the respective appli // cants ; and out of this difficulty has arisen the necessity of a different order of legislators , called Lobby Members , because they are not admitted on the floor of the House , except the last night of the session-though between ourselves , friend Ichabod , they have quite as much influence there as the privileged gentlemen inside . " The business of a Lobby Member is to enlighten the Legislature , by pointing out proper subjects for legislative patronage ; for , wise as the members undoubtedly are , they ca n't be supposed to know every thing by instinct ; and , as for studying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of legislation , that is quite out of the question with men who have always some special object of their own to accomplish . And here commences the prcper business of a Lobby Member , whose first object is to find out what each individual member comes here for most especially , and of course what he is most desirous of obtaining for his own benefit , and sometimes that of his constituents . If both can be combined , so much the better ; but , if not , the general rule is to take care of number one . " For the proper discharge of this duty , it is of course indispensable that the Lobby Member should cultivate an intimate acquaintance with those whom it is his business to enlighten ; to pry into their private affairs , study their tempers , and worm out of them all their secrets , that he may be the better able to enlighten them . He watches the arrival of every member ; inquires into his character and pecuniary affairs , with a view to judge whether he may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him incessantly from his lodgings to the House , and from the House back again . By these means , if he understands his business , he can not fail of sound*ng the member to the very bottom , and acquiring a perfect insight into the best mode of converting him into an instrument for his particular purpose . " Until lately II have been able to attend to all this business myself ; but the increasing number of the members , and more especially the improvements in the science of legislation , and the multiplication of private objects to which it is applied , and the consequent scramble of conflicting Lobby Members , each one representing some particular interest which is a candidate for legislative patronage-all these have so complicated the duties of a Lobby Member , that I find it impossible to attend to them so as to do justice to all my employers . Now Ichabod , my friend , I have an idea , if you consent , of choosing you for // my assistant in this business . If I do n't mistake  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Member . What say you , does it jump with your humor ? " I assured him it suited me exactly , and requested further instructions , which he gave at different times and at great length , but which I shall not here particularize , as they will be sufficiently exemplified in the sequel of this auto-bio*raphy . Suffice it to say , that I enlisted as a Lobby Member , and , after a short probation , became so expert in my new vocation , that my patron grew somewhat jealous lest I should rivaL him , and treated me so coolly , that I dissolved partnership , and set up for myself . The first thing I did was to make a great improvement in the science of lobbying . Heretofore the members had principally employed themselves in embarrassing their own favorite project by pulling different ways , and throwing obstacles in the way of each other ; but I soon convinced them that this was little better than cutting their own throats , as it were . I showed them the superior advantages of combination over competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most important improvement in legislation accomplished in this age of progress . It is annecessary here to analyze this system , as it has now become ramiliar to all persons , most especially Lo1*by Members and members of the Legislature , the two classes most especially toncerned . The effect of this new principle of combination , in log-rolling , has since been so completely illustrated , that there is scarcely a single measure of special legislation , however partial , unjust , or unconstitutional , that has not been triumphantly rolled through the Legislature by the combined action of the Lobby Members . By this great discovery , or rather improvement , I acquired such celebrity , that there was scarcely a log-rolling process going on in the Legislature , but I was employed in giving it a lift . But there was one great obstacle in my way . I was not admitted on the floor of the House ; my communication with the members was therefore restricted , and I could only operate on them by an outside pressure . To remedy this serious inconvenience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on various occasions , united together , and rolled me into the office of the Sergeant-at-Arms , where I had a clear field before me , and , long before the session was over , became so confidential with that class of members usually called the floating capital of the House , that , instead of winks , shrugs , nods , shakings of the heads , insinuations , and inuendos , I did // not mind speaking out to them as plainly as to my brothers of the lobby . As merit is sure to rise in this free country , I soon found myself in full employment , and sailing before the wind . Whenever the Legislature wanted enlightening , I was pretty sure to be employed ; and , as money makes the mare go there as everywhere else , I was generally well supplied by publicspirited gentlemen , who very reasonably asked the Legislature for the exclusive privilege of filling their pockets at the ex - pense of the people . I had a suite of rooms at the most frequented and expensive hotel , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were treated sumptuously to suppers of oysters and champagne . If any one of them wanted a discount , I could generally procure it from the banks , some one of which was always in hot water with , or wanting some favor from , the Legislature ; or if another was anxious to get his uncle , brother , or second cousin appointed to some snug office , where there was money passing through his hands , I was the man to get it for him , . for a proper consideration . Ignorant people little suspect the secret springs that give motion to the machinery of legislation , and , in fact , the entire political system ; nor are they aware that the most dirty of all dirty business is that of governing mankind , where both governors and governed are equally corrupt . But I will now- descend to particulars . The usual course in carrying out the great system of log-rolling is this . When any number of patriotic citizens , who live by head-work , are smitten with a desire to benefit the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time come in for a great share of the profits , they apply to the Legislature for an act of incorporation , or some other exclusive privilege , which will secure them a monopoly of the profits , or for some act of special legislation , which will answer the same purpose . If that honorable body is con posed of new- members , who have never been initiated into the mysteries of log-rolling , they of course require to be enlightened , and none can do this so effectively as the Lobby Members , who , in turn , can do nothing without money to keep open house , treat the greenhorns to oysters and champagne , and administer appliances which I forbear to specify lest it might be deemed a breach of privilege . For these purposes a purse is usually made up by the disinterested applicants for legislative bounty , which the Lobby Member may dispose of as he pleases , and for which he is not accountable , providing he is only suecessfiil // in enlightening the Legislature to a proper perception of the public good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulated a good round sum by cheapening a member now and then , or by extraordinary demonstrations of profound respect , which cost me nothing . This was , however , too slow a process to suit my temperament , and I began to be rather impatient , when an opportunity offered for feathering my nest pretty handsomely . An association of gentlemen , zealous for the public good-with an eye to their own , which is very natural-employed me to roll a great corporation monopoly through the Legislature , the name of which , from motives of delicacy , I ' shall omit . To aid in enlightening certain benighted members , who had not heretofore passed through my hands , I was furnished with a large sum , amounting to many thousands of dollars , on the usual conditions of non-accountability. i rolled the log triumphantly through both Houses by virtue of my grand specific , combination , at an expense that equally astonished and delighted me . Owing to a temporary suspension of log-rolling , there were so many of the members in the market , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I nailed one by presenting him with a diamond pin ; enlightened another by procuring him permission to subscribe to a certain number of shares in the great monopoly without paying the advance ; another by settling his tavernbill ; and bought one , out and out , with a supper of oysters and champagne . I must , however , do these gentlemen the justice to say , there was not the slightest approach to bribery in all this , since each one solemnly assured me , when the negotiation was consummated , that they had all along intended to vote for my bill , and were not in any way influenced by the trifling favors I had bestowed on them . There certainly can be no harm in paying a member for doing what he conscientiously believes to be right , and what he had previously determined upon . It is not bribing him to do wrong , but simply rewarding him for doing right . And here I will remark , for the benefit of my young readers , that I always made my first approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Senator counts equal to half a dozen members of the other House ; and , secondly , because I found little more difficulty in enlightcuing one than the other . Being now what is called independent as to money matters , and having in the course of my experience observed that one of the most infallible modes of growing still richer was to de // vote myself exclusively to the public service-seeing that no other master pays his servants so well-I determined to launch out into a wider sphere of action . Accordingly , I bade adieu to the lobby , and returned to the great emporium , where I forthwith commenced operations . I pulled off my hat , and bowed profoundly to every newspaper editor . I attended primary meetings-for I was determined to begin at the rootcultivated the good graces of those mysterious , inscrutable , invisible persons , who give the first impulse to popular feeling , and may be said to make great men almost out of nothing . I pointed out various schemes for the benefit of our ward , such as opening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and various other improvements , which would not only increase the value of every man 's property two-fold at least , but make the fortunes of all those who had a hand in the management of the business , if they knew how to take proper advantage of the opportunity . Finally , I hinted to them that , having been an experienced and highly successful Lobby Member at Albany , I would engage , if I only had a seat in the Corp oration , to carry through all these measures triumphantly . Whereupon I was nominated for Alderman , and having secured the support and cooperation of Bill Poole-peace to his manes and honor to his memory I-together with that of the principal bullies and bruisers , who exercise such overpowering influence at ward meetings and election polls , I need hardly say that my opponent was rQuted horse , foot , and dragoons , and a great triumph of principle achieved . On taking my seat at the Board , I soon discovered that my experience as a Lobby Member was invaluable in the Corporation . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revefiuc of five or six millions annually , it may naturally be supposed there was a glorious opportunity for " speculation " in leasing wharves , buying and selling the public property , contracts for building sewers , cleansing streets , lighting lamps ; and , in short , I will take upon me to aver , that , to a man who thoroughly understands head-work , there is no public station that presents a finer field for feathering one 's nest than the Honorable Common Council of the Great Emporium . I shall not boast of my exploits , but can not resist the temptation of hinting to my readers , that I was at the bottom of the affair of Fort Gansevort , and indeed all those contracts in which the public interests-to use the slang of your would-be-patriots-were sacrificed to those of particular individuals , as they certainly should // be , since it can not be denied that the public prosperity is nothing more than that of the individuals of whom it is composed . We went on swimmingly in this course , and should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the obstacles thrown in our way by a busy pragmatical Comptroller , who took it into his head to set up for an honest man , and was perpetually pimping into our private affairs under pretense of taking care of the public money , of which he seemed to be even more chary than of his own . He was always standing in our way , with some ridiculous law in his hand , or pleading some obsolete provision of the City Charter . In short , he became so troublesome at last , so watchful in detecting , and so fearless in exposing what he was pleased to call violations of the law-as if the makers of laws had not a perfect right to break themthat , finding members of the Common Council were getting to be on a par with presidents of wild-cat banks , mock auctioneers , and such like worthies , and that my seat at the Board , from being stuffed with feathers was becoming a little thorny , I declined a re*ilection , and retired from the fatigues of public life , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Misery Hollow start out of their heads incontinently . Had it not been for that confounded Comptroller , I should have assuredly come out a millionaire ; for I had matured a grand scheme , through which , by invisible channels , a good portion of the revenues of the city would have centered in the pockets of its venerable fathers . The fact is , nothing so embarrasses legislation , both State and municipal , as one of your downright honest men , like this abominable Comptroller , who possesses too much sense to be deceived , and too much integrity to be corrupted . However this may be , I had made up my mind to become a millionaire , and a rrCillionaire I was determined to be . An opportunity soon offered-*or in justice to myself I will say was created by me through the magic of head-work . I laid my plan warily , and looked a great way beyond my nose . I first bought out a certain wild-cat bank , which had stopped payment , in consequence of the presentation of * specie draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had blown over . I do n't know exactly where it was situated ; but think it was somewhere in the pine woods of Indiana , or Illinois , or Ohio , or Wisconsin . However , this is of no consequence . By means which none but the initiated in Wall street and elsewhere could understand , if I told them , I managed , without singeing my whiskers by too near a contact // * ? 0O with the law , to get two or three hundred thousand dollars of my wild-cat notes into circulation . Being thus prepared , I took a contract for a railroad in a Western State , through a wilderness , from one wilderness to another , which had been chartered by the State Legislature , and endowed by Congress with live millions of acres . It was calculated to cost six millions of dollars , and not choosing to risk the money I had honestly earned in the Lobby at Albany and the Corporation of the Great Emporium , I , in conformity with the provisions of the charter , issued a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure was sold at auction considerably below par ; but this was all the better , as it was bought in by my agents , and paid for in wild-cat notes of my own bank , backed by the security of the live millions of acres . I shall not enter into minute particulars of my successive operations , because it is possible I may one day have occasion to repeat them , and do n't think it good policy to forewarn the public . The result of the speculation , however , is this . My bank has broke , my railroad is not commenced , the million and a half of stock is snug in my iron safe , and I have a hold so tight on the five millions of acres , that I defy Congress , State Legislature , or Court , to choke me off . True , there are several suits pending against me , but they will find to their cost that I am everywhere non-committal , and I defy them to make me responsible for any thing . Besides , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , so long as I have money , and lawyers that understand their business , and judges open to conviction , there is little danger of my law-suits ever comino to an end . What with appeals from one court to another , soj udiciously supplied by the codifiers of the new system , for the purpose of rendering the decision of suits more cheap and expeditious ; the facilities for obtaining new trials under various pretexts for which lawyers who understand their business are never at a loss so long as their clients are in funds ; and various other modes of nursing the salutary delays of the law , I think it will go hard if I do n't transmit these claims to posterity . I have now reached the summit of my ambition , am incontestably a millionaire , and retired a few years since from business , except dealing a little in fancy stocks to keep my hand in . I have the happiness to be on the best terms with my conscience , which , when I can not agree with it , always accommodates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , or if I occasionally indulge in a little excess , make ample // amends to society by subscribing to institutions whose business is to correct the excesses of others , being pretty well assured that a bad example is more than atoned for by good precepts , and that the most easy as well as effectual way of obtaining pardon for our own transgressions , is to show no mercy to the transgressions of others . If in the course of my life I have , in the opinion of over-scrupulous moralists , sometimes transgressed the great command to love our neighbor as ourseli I flatter myself I have plenty of people to keep me in countenance ; and , if my youth has not been free from faults , I propose , if I live , to follow the example of those wise men , cited by the *enerab1e Cotton Mather , who , " after giving their flour to the devil , give their bran to the Lord . " One of the great disadvantages of auto-biography is , that the author is precluded from giving an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eulogy . This is a serious objection to this species of writing , inasmuch as the author is estopped from doing himself justice by certifying how he fulfilled all the duties of son , brother , husband , father , neighbor , and citizen ; how he died in the odor of sanctity , was universally lamented by all that knew him , and left behind an example to succeeding generations . I am unfortunately precluded from thus doing justice to my own memory , but have provided for it in my will by leaving twenty-five thousand dollars to build a church , and a like sum for the distribution of Bibles among destitute Pagans who ca n't read . In addition to this precaution , I propose so to conduct myself in future that I shall certainly escape hanging , which would be a sad finale to my auto-biography.
