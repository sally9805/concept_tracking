txt ART . VHL-UNPUBLISHED TRAVELS . WE present our readers with various extracts from a series of lectures prepared by a pastor , who has made the tour of Europe , for the benefit of the people of his charge . They were delivered during the week evenings of the last winter . This mode of publishing the results of travels has much to commend it ; and , as so many of our clergymen go abroad , it may be made extensively useful , and , in some measure , repay the society for the interruption in their pastor 's labors . It has the advantage to the pastor , of compelling him to be accurate and precise in his observations , while the great body of the people will get a kind of information which , as coming from one on whom they rely , will have for them the greatest interest and value . We understand the present lectures were listened to with close attention , and excited a very general interest in the town where they were delivered . In reading them in manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a multitude of things are explained that , in a work addressed to the community at large , would have been omitted . This gives this kind of publi8hed travel8 a peculiar value . Edinburgh , the metropolis of Scotland , is situated in the northern part of the county of Mid Lothian , on high ground that slopes down gradually to the north , to the shore of the Frith of Forth , about two miles distant  --  a sheet of water eight or ten miles broad at this point . The city , which consists of two parts , the old town and the new , is built on two parallel high broad ridges , running east and west , and separated by a wide deep valley . The old town occupies the southern rid e , and the new town the northern , that nearest the Forth . The intervening valley is not built over , but laid out in public gardens , with shrubbery and flowers , and is crossed by two lofty stone bridges , and one causeway of earth , that serve to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge , that on the summit and sides of which the old town stands , is not of uniform height . At its eastern end , which is the site of Holyrood Palace , it is not much above the level of the valley , but it rises rapidly for about a mile , and then termi nates in an abrupt precipitous cliff or bluff , between 300 and // starts from Holyrood Palace , and terminates at the gates of the Castle , called the Canongate , for the first half of the way , and High street , for the remaining portion . This street is the principal thoroughfare of the old town . On it , in the olden time , when Scotland was an iiidependent kingdom , were the mansions of the great and noble . Interspersed were the public buildings , and the principal churches . Even now it bears evidence of its ancient grandeur in the lofty and ornamented fronts of many of the welling houses , in the Parliament house occupied by the courts of law , in the buildings of the iRoyal Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new town , as I have said , is built on the northern of the two ridges mentioned . It spreads over the hill northwards and for some distance down the slope towards the Forth . The streets are regular and broad , the houses large and well built of stone , and wonderfully regular and nniform , whole streets exhibiting not one inferior dwelling ; and to add to the beauty and comfort of the town , a number of squares are left open , and adorned with trees , shrubbery , graveled walks and flowers . Altogether , this part of the city of Edinburgh surpasses any equal portion of any city that I have seen . At the eastern extremity of the new town , and nearly opposite to Holyrood Palace in the old town , there is a small isolated hill , that rises perhaps 150 feet above the general level around it , and is called Calton Hill . On its green and rounded summit stands a monument to Lord Nelson , one to Playfair , the great mathematician , another to Dugald Stewart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prince street , one of the principal streets of the new town , runs along its southern front , is open upon the valley that intervenes between the two parts of the city , and commands an nuobstructed view of the old town . Here are the hotels . I stopped there on my first arrival at Edinburgh , for a day or two , at one situated about in the center , in respect to its length , from east to west . Now I shall attempt to take you along with me in a ramble over the City of Edinburgh , hoping you will be able to accompany me in imagination , without confusion , after the general outline I have given of the city . Issuing from the door of the hotel situated in Prince street , on the day after my arrival , I stood amazed and delighted with the prospect before me . Immediately in front , and from the opposite side of the street , the valley , with its walks , its shrubbery , and beds of flowers , sloped gently down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched a great distance on either hand ; over it the bridges supported by lofty arches , crossed to // the old town , and then above the valley , on the upper slope of the hill opposite , a vast mass of buildings were crowded together , rising some of them to ten and eleven stories , while at the west end , an old castle lifted its gigantic proportions towards the heavens from the rough , huge mass of naked precipitous rock on which it stands , and then soaring still higher the walls , the turrets , the projecting angles , and the battlements ; and above the whole , flaunting in the morning breeze , waved the red-cross national banner of England . Turning eastward , and proceeding along Prince street , I soon came to the monument erected to Sir Walter Scott in 1840-44 . It stands on the south side of Prince street . On the margin of the valley is a noble structure of gothic architecture , that rises 200 feet high , and contains in an open space near the base , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of his favorite dog lying at his feet . Proceeding onward in an easterly direction , I arrived at the foot of Calton hill , the ascent to which , by climbing several flight of stone steps hewn out of the rock , is a fatiguing operation . Before reaching the summit , I perceived , on looking up , several persons who are always to be found there , and who are very prompt to render you their services in pointing out the objects that are visible from the top . I strove to avoid them , and was quietly looking at the prospect , when I was assailed , in broad Scotch accent , with , " This is na a braw morning for enjoying the prospect , your honor . If the mist should lift , ye might see fifty miles . That building down there , to the southeast , is Holyrood Palace , ye ken ; and that hill beyond it is called Salisbury crag , and the peak east of the crag , and peering over it is Arthur 's Seat , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his information , which I did not receive , I fear , with very much graciousness . From Calton hill you have a most commanding view . When you face the south , Holyrood Palace , with its dilapidated chapel , is distictly visible in the southeast , the view being unobstructed by the buildings , which , from Prince street , shut it out . And , as my rather officious friend said , beyond it at no great distance , the brow of Salisbury crag lifts itself , with Arthur 's Seat behind in an easterly direction . Then your eye moves along up the old town towards the Castle , its countless roofs , chimneys , spires and towers , embracing not only the city , but portions of the country beyond . Turning west , you survey , lengthwise , Prince street , alive with moving figures and vehicles . Then , as you continue to turn towards the north , you overlook the new town , and when you come to face directly towards that point of the compass , the beautiful Forth , with // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fifeshire beyond , are spread out before you . Descending from Calton ilill , proceeding east , and passing Burns ' monument , and then descending other steps into the valley , and threading my way through narrow lanes and passages , I came out on the Canongate street , and the open space in front of Holyrood Palace . This ancient residence of Scottish royalty , is a quadrangular structure , enclosing a central space or court , ninety-four feet square . The front is flanked by double castellated towers . In the center of the front is the arched carriage entrance into the interior court . A covered walk extends round this court , formed by the projection over it of the upper stories of the palace , and this projection is supported by ornamental columns . The largest apartment in this palace is the picture gallery , one hundred and fifty feet long by twenty-seven feet broad . Upon the walls of this room are suspended the portraits of one hundred and six Scottish kings . There is no doubt that many of them , much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them possess much merit as works of art . On the south side of the quadrangle are apartments fitted up with considerable splendor for Queen Victoria . The eastern side contains the suite of apartments , occupie*J in 1830-3 by Charles the Tenth and his family , when he fled from the throne of France , and was succeeded by Louis Phillipe . The northern wing is the most interesting to visitors , as having been the portion occupied by that beautiful but unhappy princess , Mary , Queen of Scotts . Mary , you will remember , was daughter of James the Fifth , ofScotland ; her mother was a French woman , of the family of Guise . She was born 1542 , and between the age of five and six , was sent to France to be educated , having already been pledged by her mother ( whose husband , the king , had died previous to the birth of Mary ) to Francis , the heir apparent to the throne of France . At the age of fifteen , she was married to Francis , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of his father , became himself King of France , with the title of Francis II . Francis II survived his father only about two years , and Mary was left a widow . Before she was nineteen , she was summoned to Scotland , to assume the crown of that kingdom . She came , was soon after married to Lord Daruley , and became the mother of James , the Sixth of Scotland , and the First of England . Daruley was weak and jealous , and stirred up by the nobles to a bitter enmity against IRizzio , an Italian , the private secretary of the Queen , joined with Lord IRuthven in a plot for his destruction . That plot was carried into execution in the apartment , // and in the presence of the Queen . Some time after this tragic scene , another was enacted , Daruley himself was assassinated by the Earl of Bothwell , who blew up the house where he lay sick . Whether he acted with the knowledge and consent of Mary is a question that can never be settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she married Bothwell three months after the death of her husband . This step alienated her subjects , and raised such a party against her , that she was placed in confinement on an island in Lochleven . From this place she made her escape , and was joined by her partisans , who fought a battle with her adversaries at Langside , and were defeated . Then she fled into England , remained awhile under restraint in the Castle at Carlisle , of which I have already made mention ; and from this fortress was removed successively to other strong places in England by order of Queen Elizabeth . After an imprisonment of nineteen or twenty years ' duration , at the age of Ibrty-five , she was beheaded in Fotheringhay Castle-her kinswoman , Elizabeth , the cousin of her father , having signed the warrant for her execution . The woman who shows the visitors over the part of Holyrood Palace , occupied by Mary , leads you up a flight of stairs to a spacious entry , from which a door admits you into an anteroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few articles of furniture , among them a cabinet and a mirror brought by Mary from France , and a double chair wrought in embroidery by her hand , and in which she and Daruley sat on the occasion of her marriage . Passing through this room , you enter the bed-room of the Queen , containing the bed , still remaining as it was when occupied by her , except as time has done its work upon it . The crimson satin coverlet , embroidered and ornamented with gold thread , looks dim and tattered . Around the room stand several chairs with embroidered backs and seats , said also to be the work of her hand , as was also the figured tapestry that hangs upon the walls . This room had opening out of it , two smaller rooms ; one of which was her dressing-room . It was hung with tapestry , like the bed-room , and contained her dressing-table , a flower-stand , and a mirror . The other closet or small apartment was that in which she was seated at tea with a gentleman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord IRuthven , and others made their appearance in her bed-room , on their errand of death . They did not come up by the usual stircase , and through the anteroom . Under the tapestry on the wall is a door which was shown us , that opens upon a small dark flight // of stairs , constructed in the wall itself of the palace , and coinmunicating with the chapel below . The conspirators entered the chapel , having left outside a body of men to guard all the avenues of the palace . From the chapel , led on by Darnley , Lord IRuthven , a man of ferocious temper , who got up from a bed of sickness to take part in this deed , and the others groped their way up the private staircase I have described , quietly entered the bed-room , and their appearance at the door of the little room in which the Queen 's party were at tea , was the first intimation they gave of their presence and of their purpose . Their looks indicated that their purpose was deadly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He retreated behind the Queen , and clung to the skirt of her dress , while she entreated Daruley to save him . A scene of confusion followed , the table was overturned , Rizzio received a stab , was seized , dragged out of the closet through the bed-room into the anteroom , and then left near the outer door , weltering in his blood , having been dispatched by the infliction of fifty-six wounds . The guide points to the dark spots on the floor where the body was left , as being stains of the blood . Starting from Holyrood , I will proceed up the Canongate and High street to the Castle , noticing whatever may claim special attention by the way . Our course , you will remember , is west and up hill . The Canongate is a narrow street , with lofty old stone houses , on either side occupied apparently by the poorer part of the population , that not only filled the houses , but seemed to overflow into the street , the side walks of which were crowded by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunning themselves . Just where the Canongate widens into High street , at the corner on the right hand as you go up , is an old house with a v*ry irregular front ; it was once occupied by John Knox , the celebrated Scottish reformer , and from one of the windows of the second story he often , it is said , addressed the crowd that gathered in the street below to hear him . Proceeding from his house up High street , we reach on the left the old cathedral of St. Giles , a truly venerable pile . In front of it , in the centre of the street a cross in the pavement indicates where the old cross of Edinburgh formerly stood . Here the laws enacted by Parliament and the royal edicts were proclaimed in the olden times It is referred to in the following lines from Scott 's " iMlarmion : " Dun Edin 's cross a pillar 'd stone Rose on a turret octagon . But now is razed that monument Whence royal edict rang , And voice of Scotland 's law was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes called by the inhabitants the Heart of IMlidlothian , and which under that name has become so renowned in the novel of Sir Walter Scott , stood in the middle of High street , which is here quite broad , at the northwest corner of St. Giles ' Church . This gloomy looking building , according to the prints of it , was built 1561 . From that time to 1630 , it served the threefold purpose of accommodating Parliament , and the courts of justice , and of furnishing places of confinement for prisoners . After the erection of the new Parliament house , it was employed as a prison only . It was demolished 1819 . Advancing still westward up High street , we come to the esplanade , that spreads out in front of the castle , and which can be approached only on its eastern side , the other sides being very precipitous ; some parts , as has been said , being more than perpendicular . Its elevation is three hundred and eighty-three feet above the level of the sea . It contains accommodations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armory affords space for thirty thousand stands of arms . To enter , you cross a deep and broad moat , by a drawbridge , that is let down for the purpose ; then you pass under an arch in the wall with the sharp teeth of the suspended porteullis visible over your head , and the leaves of huge oaken , iron-studded doors , swung back on either hand . This passed , you ascend a steep paved path , till you enter a covered way that has strong gates at either end . Emerging from this , you reach a platform of the castle , and are at first filled with surprise and delight at the boundless prospect which stretches out before you in every direction . Your attention is soon arrested by a monstrous old cannon , known by the name of IMlons Meg , constructed of huge bars of wronght iron , put together like staves , in a tube , and hooped with corresponding bars of the same material . This is one of the earliest specimens of that species of warlike engine . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the balls , shaped out of rock , nearly two feet in diameter , such as used to be employed when it was fired , lie near at hand . But it is destined to do no more good or mischieS for on discharging it to give a salute on some great occasion , I do not know how long ago , it was so far burst as to unfit it for further use . In a small strong room , in the top of a tower , with a door , but no windows , lighted by a lamp suspended from the arched ceiling , you are shown the regalia of Scotland . The crown which was worn by IRobert Bruce , and used in all subsequent coronations ; the sword of State , and the mace ; with other articles of value , such as a badge and collar of the order of the garter , // presented to James the Vii , by Queen Elizabeth , when he was knighted ; the seal ring of Charles IT , when he was crowned , and other articles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushion of crimson velvet , on a table under a glass case , that is covered by a net work of iron . In another building , within the walls of the castle , we were shown the apartment in which Mary , Queen of Scotts , gave birth to her son , James the Sixth . It was about nine feet square , and we shuddered to look out of the single window , through which the infant prince , we were told , was let down in a basket some two hundred feet , that he might receive Catholic baptism . In an adjoining room we saw a portrait of Mary , taken in France , representing her in all the freshness and bloom of youth and beauty ; and a lovlier face I do not remember to have seen . Looking at it you cease to wonder at the impression she seems to have made upon most of those of the other sex with whom she was brought into contact . In Edinburgh , the means of education are very abundant . Of the University , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame is world-wide ; but there is one class of peculiar institutions , that ought to be noticed . I had pointed out to me in the southern part of the old town , what was called a hospital , a magi*ificent specimen of architectnre ,  --  a large quadrangular edifi *e 134 feet on each side , and enclosing a square 92 feet ; and standing in the middle of ample and ornamented grounds , around which was a high strong wall , with appropriate gates . I had a fine view of it from the esplanade in front of the castle , as I looked down south . The word hospital suggested , of course , a place for the accommodation of the sick , but I soon learned that this was for the accommodation of lads , who are there supported and educated . This splendid charity was established by a man of the name of George Heriot , jeweler to James Vi . He is often referred to in Scott 's novel of The Fortunes of Nigel , under the nickname of Jingling Gordie . The special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance and education of poor and fatherless boys , or boys whose parents are in indigent circumstances , freemen 's sons of the town of Edinburgh . One hundred and eighty are accommodated within its walls . TIme course of instruction consists of English , Latin , Greek , writing , arithmetic , book-keeping , mathematics , and geography . To these branches have been recently added , French , drawing , and the elements of music , and mechanics . Boys are admitted between the ages of seven and ten , and generally leave at fourteen , unless superior scholarship appears to fit them for prosecuting some of the learned profes // sions , in which case their stay is prolonged , with the view of preparing them for the University . All the boys , upon leaving the hospital , receive a Bible , and other useful books , and two suits of clothes , of their own choice . Those going out as apprentices , are allowed ? 10 , or fifty dollars , annually , for five years ; and ? 5 , or twenty five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any learned profession are sent to College for four years , during which period they receive or one hundred and fifty dollars a year . There are several other hospitals founded substantially on the same principles . We pass from Scotland to Holland . iRotterdam is the second city of Holland ; it stands on the right or north bank of the Meuse , is 24 miles from the sea , and has a population of 82,500 . As many canals traverse the town as streets , communication between different parts of the town is kept up by a great number of drawbridges . The canals serve as docks , and it is strange to see in the central part of the town , water , bridges , shipping and trees , all mingled together . IRotterdam carries on an extensive commerce with Batavia in Java , in which it employs about eighty of the finest merchant ships in the world . The trade in provisions that come down the IRhine in vast quantities , is very important . From the upper parts of that stream , vast quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an important branch of industry ; one hundred first class vessels are building at a time . The foundation of the houses , which are usually of brick but not seldom of stone brought from Norway , rest on piles of pine , that also comes from Norway . It is extremely difficult to prevent these foundations from settling a little . The effect of this is visible to the eye . When you stand at a corner and take a range of the fronts , you perceive that some are erect , some slope a little backward , and others lean slightly forward . Some interesting things are met with in Holland , such as wooden shoes , made from a solid piece of wood hollowed out . These are seen hanging at the shop doors for sale , and the clatter of them as the peasantry and poorer classes by whom they are worn pass along the streets , is incessant . Another thing , which we noticed in Belgium , also struck us as rather amusing . From the windows of the houses , there is projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the extremity a looking-glass so arranged that the objects passing along the street will be reflected by it to a lady or anybody else who may be seated within on one side of the window , out of sight . These mirrors are seen not only projecting from the first story , but also frequently from the second . In the latter case , they of course are // turned somewhat downwards . In this manner provision is made by the ladies to gratify their curiosity , without exposing themselves to observation . These are as common in stately , aristocratic mansions , as any other . In one instance where the window was low and the mirror so situated as to enable me to do it easily , I walked up to the mirror and looked directly into it , when I caught the countenance of a lady who was looking into it from within and who seemed to be abashed by so sudden an apparition , as she immediately withdrew and I passed al6ng . A Railroad extends from Rotterdam to Amsterdam ; the distance is 624* miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leyden and harlem . These towns lie along the coast not far from the sea . The general direction of the route is northward . The distance from iRotterdam to the Hague by Railroad is thirteen miles . In the extensive meadows on either side of the road , there were to be seen large herds of cattle and droves of horses . In size and appearance , the cattle did not differ from those which we have , but their color was generally black and white ; some wholly of one of these colors , in other instances both colors were mingled in the same animal . A great many windmills are in sight , and their arms being constantly in motion give a sort of animated appearance to the landscape . Rows of trees planted with regularity border many of the roads and mark the lines of the canals . Hague , or The Hague , as it is more commonly called , is a city of considerable size , resembling in its general features the other cities of Holland , being like them intersected by numerous canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has less commerce than IRotterdam . Indeed the population is not so large , being 61,000 . Put the business and trade is much less proportionally . The city of Hague derives advantages from being the Capital of the Kingdom of Ifolland , and the residence of the King and his Court . We reached this place on Saturday evening and found quarters in the Hotel Pourlez , which stands on a corner and has on one side a large open square traversed by several rows of lofty elms . Holland is a Protestant country , but we could find no church where worship was conducted in English . We entered two churches , and stood for some time , but no one invited us to any seat . We noticed that the gentlemen in many cases had their hats on during service , and while the clergyman was delivering his discourse several individuals were passing through the church bearing in their hands long poles , at the end of which was little bags , wiii ch they extended to each individual who deposited in it his contribution . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the avails devoted to charitable purposes . We visited the church where we were told his majesty iisually worships on the Sabbath , but saw nobody that looked like a king , and learned afterwards that we mistook the direction and went to the wrong church . There is a very pretty square planted with trees , and having a sheet of water on one side , in the center of which is a slight elevation , so slight that we who are accnstomed to hills should not have noticed it . On enquiring the name of the place we were told that it is called the hill of the fish pond . This circumstance indicates the general flatness of the country . In the outskirts of the town there is a beautiful park , with many trees , and traversed by carriage roads , where quite a display of splendid equipages and a vast collection of people were to be seen Sabbath afternoon . The Royal Cabinet of Curiosities contains *many objects of great interest from China and Japan . The Dutch are the only European nation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city of Jeddo , the capitol of Japan , a large collection of Japan ware , as boxes , trays , tea chests , &amp;c. of exquisite workmanship , and beautifully painted , Japanese weapons , dirks , ' swords , of finer temper than those of Binningham or even Damascus , a weapon in the use of which the Japanese are said to be very expert-severing a man 's body in twain by a single blow . There were besides images of the Japanese dressed in the varied costumes in use among that people , and many things illustrating their habits and customs . Ten miles from the Hague on the way towards Amsterdam , is Leyden , situated on that branch of the Rhine which alone bears the name . Here , however , it is but an insignificant stream . The town is about eight miles from the sea , is surrounded by windmills , and contains a population of thirty-seven thousand . Leyden has the honor of being the birth-place of Rembrandt , who was born 1606 , and died 1674 ; also , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less note . The University of Leyden has given celebrity to the town , and produced many distinguished men . At one time it was one of the most distinguished schools of learning in Europe . Arminins , a Hollander born 1560 , and Gomarus , were professors of this University , when there sprung up between them the memorable controversy on the questions in theology , which distinguish Arminianism from Calvinism . Among its professors and scholars were Grotius , the great writer on international law , who // was born at Deift , 1583 , and died 1646 ; and Scaliger , a great linguist and general scholar , professor of belles-lettres , who died 1609 , and wais succeeded by Salmasius , a Frenchman , who was born 1588 , and died 1653 , and who wrote a defense of Charles I , of Eng1and , to which John Milton replied . Descartes , another Freuchnian , a great mathematician and metaphysician , contemporary with Salmasius , resided a time at the University ; and Boerhave , born in the neighborhood , 1668 , and distinguished as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University ; he died 1738 . Goldsmith studied at this University . The number of students at the present time is about three hundred . The University is remarkable not only as one of the distinguished literary institutions of Europe , but also on account of its origin and foundation . In the years 1573-4 , Leyden sustained one of the most terrible sieges of which history furnishes any account , from the Spaniards under Yaldez. liarlem the year before had been besieged , and after suffering the greatcst extremities , had finally capitulated , on the pledge of the Spaniards to spare the population , provided fifty-seven individuals were given up , and the town were surrendered . These individuals volunteered to give themselves up for the general welfare , and the terms were accepted . For three days after the surrender , there were no indication on the part of the Spaniards of a purpose to violate the terms of the capitulation . Then , the fifty-seven voluntary victims having been first sacrificed , four executioners were called in and set to work and kept at work until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergymen , soldiers of the garrison , and ordinary citizens , had been butchered . The people at Leyden , who were now besieged , had nothing to expect from surrender . They could put no confidence in any terms proposed to them by their Spanish foes . The defense of the town was entrusted to John Yanderdoes . Yaldez , the Spanish general , urged him to surrender . lie replied in behalf of the inhabitants , that when provisions failed they would devour their left hands , reserving their right to defend their liberty . For nearly four months , the inhabitants held out xvithont a murmur-every individual , women and children even , taking a share in the defense . For seven weeks bread had not been seen within the walls . The people subsisted on the most loathsome objects ; pestilence followed in the train of famine and swept off six thousand of the inhabitants . The horrors of their situation can not be imagined . At length two carrier pid geons , the electric telegraph of that day , brought news that the Prince of Orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dykes that kept in the waters of the Meuse and the Issel , and laying a large portion of the country under water , and drowning out the Spaniards , whose position was lower than the site of Leyden . A fleet of two hundred boats loaded at IRotterdam , with provision , was prepared to bring relief to the suffering city . But sad to tell , the water though it overflowed most of the country did not rise high enough to admit this flotilla of boats to approach Leyden , though it was visible in the far distance to the tarnishing people , who climbed up to the steeples of their churches . Meanwhile , the Spaniards clung to the dykes , and retained sufficient foot-hold to keep the town in check . At this point the patience and endurance of the people began to fail . They crowded around John Yanderdoes , the cominander , and demanded either bread or a surrender of the town . There is in the town hail now a most striking picture of this scene . There stands John Yanderdoes , around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of famishing , pale , hollow-eyed , thin , stretching their hands towards him , pleading with him ; there too , in sad silence , stand haggard looking men of all ages , whose looks seem to speak , though their lips are silent . But there is something in the eye of John Yanderdoes , which shows that his heart is bleeding for them , but that he can not yield to their demands . He is uttering the memorable words thus addressed to his suffering fellow citizens in that hour of agony : " I have sworn to defend this city , and by God 's help I mean to keep that oath . Bread I have none ; but if my body can afford you relief and enable you to prolong the defense , take and tear it to pieces , and let those most hungry among you share it . " The most clamorous were abashed and all returned in silence . But deliverance was at hand . The wind veered around , and blew violently from the sea , and rolled back the water of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Leyden so suddenly , that more than one thousaiid of the Spaniards were overwhelmed by it . The same flood brought the eight hundred boats with provisions . A sort of amphibious battle was fought with the Spaniards , half on land and half in the water , but the result was , that they were obliged to withdraw and Leyden was safe . Indeed the Spaniards gave up all further attempts to subjugate such a people . The Prince of Orange , for the purpose of rewarding the people of Leyden for their heroic defense of their town , offered them the choice of an exemption from certain taxes , or of having a University established among them . Much to their credit they chose the latter . Such was the origin of the Uni von . xii . 54 // versity of Leyden . Another circumstance yet to be mentioned , invested this city with peculiar interest . At Leyden our puritan ancestors found ref%e , when they fled from England to avoid the persecutions by which James I sought to enforce upon them conformity with the established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their escape to Leyden , 1609 , and remained there eleven years . Then the church determined to come to America . A part were to leave first , and Robinson and the rest were to follow . They made their preparations , and embarked at the port of IDelft Haven , some ten or twelve miles from Leyden . The parting was solemn and affecting . Robinson was there , and kneeling by the seaside in prayer , commended them and their enterprise to Almighty God . His farewell address to them was touching , and breathed a noble spirit . July 22 , 1620 , they set sail , and a prosperous breeze soon wafted them to Southampton , England , and in a fortnight the May Flower and the Speedwell , freighted with the first Colony for Kew England , left Southampton for America . But they had not gone far on the Atlantic , when the smaller vessel , the Speedwell , was found to be leaky , and they enter the port of Dartmouth , on the south coast of England . After losing eight days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had proceeded about one hundred leagues , when the Captain of the Speedwell with his company , dismay ed at the dangers of the voyage , once more pretended that his vessel was not sea-worthy . They put back to Plymouth , England . The timid and the hesitating were all freely allowed to abandon the expedition . The little band thus winnowed of the cowardly and disaffected , embarked in the May Flower , and she set sail alone , Sept. 6 , and all the time - from that date , till Dec. 11th old style , or 22d , according to the new , they were tossed on the Atlantic or exploring the coast of Massachusetts , in quest of a resting place . The old church edifice , in which the pilgrims worshiped when at Leyden and where Robinson preached , still stands , though it has been enlarged in one direction . But the old stone paved floor , tIme oaken pews , the pulpit of the same material , and the sounding board above it , still remain as in those days , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulpit , and thought what results had followed from the labors and enterprise of those who once worshiped God there , and who gave up all to secure to themselves and their posterity the privilege of doing so , according to what they believed to be the teachings of Scripture and the dictates of their own consciences . Leaving Leyden we proceeded by Railroad eighteen miles to Harlem . This town , after which Harlem in the State of // New York , was named , has a population of 24,000 , but is remarkable chiefly on account of its celebrated church organ , long considered the largest and finest in Europe , and , so far as we heard , still maintaining its preeminence . It is in the large old church or cathedral of St. Bayou . It was built by Christian Muller , of Amsterdam , 1738 ; it contains five thousand pipes , some of them fifteen inches in diameter , and thirty-two feet long . The organist 's fee for playing to private parties , and showing the power of the instrument , is thirteen guilders-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five dollars . It was after sundown when we took our seats in the vast church , at some distance from the organ which occupied the principal part of one end of it , to liqten to its music . Our expectations were greatly raised , and the deepening of the twilight , by withdrawing our attention from objects of sight , left us more open to the impression of sounds . The organ has a great many stops , and after a sort of preliminary flourish , the organist proceeded to exhibit what is called the instrumental stop , which imitates the flute , the clarjonet , the violin , and the whole round of musical intraments . The resemblance was perfect , and the music delightful . Thea came a stop in which the peculiar tones of a choir of singers is exhibited . So close was the resemblance to the impression made by a vast choir of singers , that it seemed , if you were a little nearer , you would be able to distinguish the words . Then followed various pieces that brought out the sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there appeared to be two bodies of musicians ; one sounded as if on earth , clear , distinct , and strong ; then , at intervals , there were heard in response , as if coming from a distant world , the most seraphic strains ; it was as if the angels in heaven , listening to earthly music , should take up and improve the strain , and we could hear them in their far off heights . I had never imagined such an effect as aniong the possibilities of music . The next piece , I say the n*xt-1 mean the next that I can recollectwas the representation of a battle . You hear the armies advancing to the contest , the martial music , and the tramp of the soldiers , and the gen*ral confusion of sound produced by the movement of vast bodies of men , horses , &amp;c . Then comes the assault , fierce and terrible , then the battle lulls ; the conflict is renewed , the swaying back and forward , as the combatants win or lose ground , advance or retreat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you perceive that one army is fleeing , and the other closely pursuing . The cries of the conquered mingle with the stern shouts of the victors , and gradually the // confused noise of the battle retires away into the distance , and then a sweet , sad strain , as if deploring the folly and woes of war , concludes that part of the performance . The last thing which the organist attempted was to represent a thunder storm . It was now dark , and the two or three lamps in the distant organ loft was all that there was to break the gloom of the vast church . The rising of the wind was first perceived ; it swelled and whistled along , so that you could almost see the leaves whirling round in the air ; then the low growl of the thunder , coming from the horizon , made you see the black cloud rising there , and sweeping towards you . The force of the wind increases , the thunder approaches , great drops of rain begin to patter , a heavy and prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier , and more prolonged , makes the building shake , and your nerves shake too ; then an interval , the rain pours in torrents ; at length one of those short terrible crashes , that prove that the bolt has fallen close by , makes you almost spring from your seat . You have to think that this is mere representation , in order to quiet your fears-you can hardly persuade yourself that you are not in danger . Then the storm passes away , the sun comes out , the whole world is clothed in freshness and beauty , and the birds strike up their songs . All this the organ represents to yoi* Our expectations were far transcended , and our respect for the great organ and organist at Harlem was most profound , and no organ that we subsequently heard  --  and we heard a great many , and some of them very fine-so delighted and astonished us. * * * * * * * * * * Before proceeding to describe what we saw in Venice , I will refer very briefly to the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fifth century , Attila , at the head of his hordes of warlike linus , traversed the central parts of Europe , from the east to the west , car ying desolation in his path . He crossed the IRhine , and invaded France ; but being defeated , or receiving a severe check in a great battle , he gradually fell back , and in the year 4*2 passed the Alps , and descended into the part of Lombardy , situated around the head of the Adriatic Sea . This region was then occupied by a people called the Yenetii , who had many towns and several cities , among the latter , and the chief of them , was Aquila , to which Attila immediately laid siege . After it had been most resolutely defended for more than three months , he finally captured it . He boasted , that where his horse had trodden , the grass never grew . He was called the scourge of God . He used his victory with // great cruelty . Those who escaped his fury fled to the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adj acent sea . Their separation from the main land made them an asylum from the attacks of his marauding cavalry . Such was the origin of Venice . These refugees first turned their attention to making salt and catching fish ; then to navigation and commerce . As early as the 7th century , they carried on trade with Constantinople , with Alexandria in Egypt , and with most of the seaports in the eastern part of the Mediterranean . Becoming expert navigators , they soon extended their commerce to every part of that Sea , and had mercantile houses established at iRome , and at most of the important maritime cities on its shores . Venice advanced rapidly in wealth , population , power , and in general consideration . It was the chief place where the products of the East were exchanged for those of the West , the focus of the couimerce between Asia , the north of Africa , and Europe . In the language of Macaulay , " The Po wafted down the harvest of Lombardy to the granaries of Venice , and carried back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palaces of Milan . " At a time when England and France were in a comparative state of barbarism , Venice was a magnificent city , with its palaces , its villas , its arsenal , libraries , its museum , and its mart filled with every article of comfort and luxury . At the commencement of the 15th century , it reached the zenith of its prosperity ; it then employed in commerce a capital of $30,000,000 , and its real estate amounted to $20,000,000 , inunense sums when we consider how many times more valuable money then was than it is at the present time . About this time , viz. , at the commencement of the 15th century , a lust of conquest sprung up . This led to long and expensive wars , and to perplexing and troublesome alliances , and began to undermine the prosperity of the republic . That prosperity received a fatal blow at the close of the century , when the discovery made by the Portuguese of the passage round Cape Good hope , opened a new channel to the commerce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it has been said all Europe , torn from its foundations , seemed to be ready to precipitate itself upon Asia , contributed very much to the prosperity of Venice . She transported Christian armies from her ports , where they gathered in vast numbers , to Palestine , with their treasures and arms . She derived pecuniary advantage from those enterprises , that drained the rest of Europe of its population and wealth . // The government of Venice was called a republic . In the year 6*7 , the whole body of the citizens elected the first Doge or duke , and invested him with almost absolute power . lie nominated his own council , he convoked at his pleasure the general assembly , he had the power of making war and peace , and he held his office for life . There was , however , a tribunal of forty citizens , representatives of the chief families , whose influence limited somewhat the authority of the Doge . In 1178 , a new mode of electing the iDoge was adopted : hitherto , he had been chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now devised was , for the whole number of citizens to choose eleven electors , who should make choice of the Doge . And as a substitute for the assembling of the whole people to deliberate on public measures , a great council , consisting of four hundred and eighty members , was appointed . The way in which they were appointed was rather remarkable : the six districts , into which the city was divided , chose each two electors ; these twelve electors choose the four hundred and eighty members of the great council . The senate consisted of sixty of these members of the great council , selected by themselves . This grand council was chosen annually at first , but the same persons were very generally chosen , and then their descendants : in this way a sort of prescriptive right came to be considered as established . The elections came to be dispensed with , and at length a positive enactment was passed , A. ID . 1319 , declaring the grand council to be permanent and hereditary , that whoever could prove his ancestral rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert his claim to be enrolled in the golden book of nobility , and thus be admitted as a member of the great council . At this time , the council had increased in the number of its members , but it seldom , at any period of the republic , exceeded twelve hundred . This fundamental change , by which the great body of the people was excluded from all participation in the government of the republic , met with some opposition at the outset , and occasioned an insurrection that was suppressed by the vigilance of the Doge , or the imprudence of the insurgents . The plot was discovered before it was ripe for execution , and the leaders perished on the scaffold . Six years subsequent to the passing of the act that made the Grand Council permanent and hereditary , fhat is , in II 325 , another most important innovation was introduced , and soon became a permanent feature in the structure of the government . The celebrated Council of Ten was established . The occasion of // this measure was springing up of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overturn the government . This conspiracy was not arrested till the day of its execution had arrived , and then it was suppressed after a sanguinary conflict in the public square , in which the government troops were victorious over the rebels . To guard against the recurrence of such outbreaks , a commission consisting of ten was appointed , and invested with almost absolute power . Their first duty was to extinguish the embers of the late insurrection . At first , they were appointed for only ten days . This terni of office was renewed six times ; then it was extended to a year , soon after to five years , and next to ten ; then the Council of Ten was declared to be permanent . It was invested with full inquisitorial authority , with complete power over every individual in the State , and with freedom from all responsibility and appeals . In their judicial administration , the members of this council enquired , sentenced , and punished according to what they called the reasons of State . If t he removal of a citizen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they fonud means to remove him , whether he had been guilty of any crime or not . The public eye never penetrated the mystery of their proceedings ; the accused was sometimes not heard , never confronted with witnesses ; the condemnation was as secret as the trial , and the punishment undivulged . Nor was this all . This tribunal , though instituted with special reference to State crimes , gradually assumed to itself control over every branch of government in all matters , finance , military affairs , negotiations with foreign powers , and on questions of peace and war . Yet the Council *of Ten exercised this despotic sway during five centuries . In connection with this account of the government of Venice , we subjoin a description of the Palace of the IDoge . This is a vast edifice in the Byzantine style of architecture , enclosing an open court in the centre . The principal entrance is on the west side , from that broad avenue that extends from the Plaza of St. Mark to the sea . You enter an arched passage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the central court alluded to above , yon have directly in front , the giant 's staircase  --  a broad and lofty flight of marble steps with colossal figures , one on each side of the landing at the top . This staircase conducts to an arcade or balcony that runs along that side of the Palace , from which doors open . Entering one of these and ascending another flight of stairs , we were introduced into the hall of the Grand Council , the room in which that body in the days of the republic held their meetings . It is // August , 175 feet long by 84 broad , and 51 feet high from floor to ceiling . The walls on every side , and also the ceiling , which is divided into compartments , are covered with paintings by native artists , and others of great reputation . Titian , Tintoretto and Paul Veronese . These paintings are niostly historical , referring to the events in the histor*y of the Republic of which she was most proud , the battles in which she was victorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the walls , just below the cornice , the portraits of the Doges are arranged in a continuous series-according to the order in which they succeeded each other . One space is vacant of a portrait , and is painted black . The Doge whose portrait would have filled that vacancy , conspired to overthrow the government . His name was Marino Faliero. lie belonged to one of the noblest and most wealthy families in the State . Two of his ancestors had worn the Ducal crown . He had himself won signal honors as a general at the head of the armies of the republic . He was elected iDoge , 1354 . The.next year he conspired against the State ; the conspiracy was detected ; effectual precautions were taken against the conspirators ; the rincdeaders were seized and put to instant death . On Friday , the 16th day of April , judgment was given in the Council of Ten , that my Lord Marino Faliero , the Duke , should have his head cut off ; and that this execution should be done on the landing place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Doges take their oath when they first enter the Palace . On the following day , the doors of the Palace being shut , the Duke had his head cut ofl , about the hour of noon . One of the Ten displaying the bloody sword , exclaimed , " Justice has fallen on the Traitor , " and the gates being then opened , the populace rushed in to see the Dodge who had been executed . His place in the series of the Doge 's portraits was painted black . The tragedy of Lord Byron , entitled IMlarino Faliero , was founded on these historical incidents . The guide who showed us over the palace conducted us up by another flight of stairs to the story above , and led us through the hall in which the Doge , surrounded by his council , used to receive foreign ambassadors  --  the hall in which the Senate held its session , and the apartment in which the Council of Ten transacted its business . Near the latter was a room of torture . These were all magnificent rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others symbolical . For instance , in the room where the terrible Ten transacted their business , so much of which was not only secret and mysterious , but also cruel and relentless , there was a painting representing justice // holding a balance in her hand , as if to mete it ont with exactness . 4nthe rear of the palace , that is , on its eastern side , there is a narrow canal , that separates it from the public prison , and a bridge arched over the canal connects the palace with the prison . Besides the prison across the canal there were dungeons constructed in the lower part of the palace . Here , especially , were state prisoners , those whom the Council of Ten intended to deal with , confined . From these dungeons deep down in the foundation of the building , a dark winding staircase ascended and opened upon the room in which the Ten held their meetings . By this passage their victims could be brought np and subj ected to examination , as they were , not unfrequently by torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any secret of importance . I descended into these dnn geons , not however by the passage from the room of the Ten , but by another route , that by which those arrested were conveyed to them . The passage by which we went down was narrow and dark . Our guide bore a light , and then the same passage along in front of the cells was equally narrow and dark ; there were two stories of these cells , one ranged above the other , or rather , I should say , one below the other . When closed they had but one small opening , for the admission of air . The furniture was a wooden platform on which the prisoner slept . The darkness must have been total . WTe were shown a recess , where those condemned by the Ten to death , had the last rites of religion allowed them , and then were strangled . I went into one of the cells and saw some scrawls on the walls , made in the dark by those who had been confined there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could relate the sorrows and sufferings experienced within them . I had a terrible impres*. sion of the wickedness of which men are capable .
