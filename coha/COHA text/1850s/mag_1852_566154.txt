Washington : Office of Printers to House of Representatives , 1851 . " RESPECT yourself , if you wish to be respected by others , " is a maxim well understood in its application to individuals , and it is no less true when applied to communities . The citizens of a state are the natural guardians of the state 's reputation ; they are as much expected to defend its proper dignity and honor against disparagement and reproach as its material interests against aggressive violence ; and if they neglect the vindication of either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no rights or no character left to vindicate . Especially , if its " foes are those of its own household , " if its own children are found , not merely careless of its reputation , but actually encouraging the assaults upon it , and prompt to take up and echo every voice of calumnyj*or derision , we need not be surprised to find it at last perm*uientry lowered in the world 's estimate , in some proportion as it apparently is in its own . voL.x. 21 // From self-disparagement of this sort , both negative and positive , no state in our Union has suffered so much , and with so lit - tie cause , as the state of Connecticut . With quite as much in her history to be proud of , and certainly as little to be ashamed of , as any other state , her position is very commonly regarded , both within and without her borders* as precisely the reverse of this . Various causes have contributed to the prevalence of this literally preposterous impression . Originating in early misrepresentations , repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found their way into the works of respectable authors , and the unquestioned belief of large classes of readers , it affords an excellent illustration of the saying , that " a lie well adhered to is as good as the truth . " When such a man as Chancellor Kent , the son of a Connecticut man , himself a graduate of Yale College , and all his life on terms of intimacy with leading men of the State , seems to countenance the fable about " the blue laws of Connecticut , " how can the common mind be expected to entertain a doubt that they have had an actual existence ? That so many among ourselves have been disposed , with ready credulity , to accept as true a history by such means falsified and distorted , and thus to find in it grounds of reproach rather than of admiration , is owing mainly , we think , to other causes , which for many years have , in a good degree , happily ceased to exist , though their effects in part remain . We name especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century prior to the adoption of our present constitution , an increasing minority were in the habit of regarding the predominance of what was called " the standing order " in the state . We ought to put ourselves right in this matter . The controversies of a past generation ought no longer to pervert the judgment of the present . It is high time that the people of the state , the whole people , should do justice to themselves by doing justice to their ancestors . We seek not to array mere state pride , unsupported , against well ascertained truths of history . We have no need and we do not mean to invoke the charity or the generosity of the living , to cover the faults and magnify the virtues of the departed . We ask no man to surrender his own convictions in order to unite with us , on the principle of defending " our country , right or wrong . " But we do insist that there is no one of us , whatever hereditary controversies he may hold , religious or political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he will bring to the examination but common fairness , will not find , over and above all matters in dispute , in the recognized facts of its history , from its beginning through all its progress to its matured developments , in its institutions , // civil , social , religious and educational , in its legislative policy , in its dealings with other colonies , with its aboriginal inmates and with the mother country , in its successful cultivation of the arts of peace , in its equally successful encounters with the stern necessities of war , and in the fruits and results of all these , the final test of human institutions , the condition and character of the people under them , enough to satisfy all the demands of a just pride of birth , no matter what other history may be put in comparison with it . We rejoice therefore in the utterance of such a " Speech for Connecticut " as that of Dr. Bushnell at the New Britain Festival . Nothing could be better fitted to stimulate into a healthy activity the somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaken a better appreciation of the beauty and the value of the historic associations surrounding the goodly heritage to which they were born . Nor could it fail , we should suppose , to clear away at once from any mind still subject to them , the remains of such unjust views of facts and unworthy habits of thought and feeling as we have already alluded to . Delivered on an occasion directly suggestive of one of the most honorable and unquestionable distinctions of Connecticut in times past ; in presence of the chosen guardians of her interests and honor , gathered from every town and representing every class and sect , and every shade of opinion , all the circumstances were calculated to aid the impression it was fitted to produce , and to make it thoroughly effective for the end designed . And we have no doubt that the care of the legislature to give the discourse a wide ci*culation will ensure to it a permanent influence , coextensive with the state . it is not our purpose , in this article , to give an account of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical estimate of our standing as a member of the republic . " Few men have ever been successful in the attempt to represent Dr. Bushnell by means of a condensed abstract ; and we contemplate no such presumption in the present instance . The remarks which we have to make upon a few of the topics presented or suggested by the discourse , will be mainly for the purpose of some further expansion and illustration . It is our full conviction that Connecticut in her early history more fitly represented and typified the American Nation that was to be , included more of the germs of its future growth , more of the rudimental tendencies which in their full development constitute and honorably distinguish the American character , than any other of the original states or colonies . Of course , we can not and do not claim for her an active and open // leadership among her co*qua1s , or any observed superiority of influence . But it was her fortune , that of those tendencies which she had in common with all , entering more or less into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest , freest and most perfect manifestation ; while she has been at least as successful as any other in infusing into the whole , characteristics peculiar to herself . This truth might be illustrated in many particulars more fully than we propose to do it at present ; what we have to say upon it will be well enough introduced by the following passage from Dr. Bushnell 's discourse , in which he claims for Connecticut the honor of having led the way in the framing of written republican constitutions : " Virginia began her experiment under martial law . The emigrants in the Mayflower are sometimes spoken of as having adopted a civil constitution before the landing at Plymouth ; but it will be found that the brief document called by that name is only a " covenant to be a body politic , " not a proper constitution . The Massachusetts or Boston colony had the charter of a trading company , under cover of which , transferred to the emigrants , they maintained a civil organization . It was reserved to the infant colony on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model the first properly American constitution  --  a work in which the framers were permitted to give body and shape , for the first time , to the genuine republican idea , that dwelt as an actuating force , or inmost sense , in all the.New England colonies . The trading-company , governor , and assistants of the Massachusetts colony , having emigrated bodily , and brought over the company charter with them , had been constrained to allow some modifications , by which their relation as directors of a stock subscription were transformed into a more properly civil and popular relation . In this manner , the government was gradually becoming a genuine elective republic , according to our sense of the term . The progress made was wholly in the direction taken by the framers of the Connecticut constitution ; though , as yet , they had matured no such result . At the very time when our constitution was framed , they were endeavoring , in Mas*chusetts , to comfort the hereditary gentlemen ' by erecting them into a kind of American House of Lords , called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be chosen from the colony at large , and were not required to be inhabitants of the town by which they were chosen . The freemen were required to be members of the church , and all the officers stood on the theocratic , or church basis , in the same way . They were also debating , at this time , the civil admissibility or propriety of dropping one governor and choosing another ; Cotton and many of the principal men insisting that the office was a virtual freehold , or vested right . Holding these points in view , how evident is the distinctness and the proper originality of the Connecticut constitution ? It organizes a government elective , annually , in all the departments . It ordains that no person shall be chosen governor for two successive years . It requires the deputies to be inhabitants and representatives of the towns where they are chosen . The elective franchise is not limited to members of the church , but conditioned on admission to the rights of an elector by a major vote of the town . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete frame of civil order , in the new world , embodies all the essential features of the constitutions of our states , and of the Republic itself , as they exist at the present day . It is the free , representative plan , which now distinguishes our country in the eyes of the world . " This honorable distinction is not the accidental result of some small advantage in a nearly equal race ; though even in that // point of view , in a matter of such moment , it were not to be despised . It was not merely the originality , but the perfection and the permanence of her institutions , that made Connecticut , during the colonial period , pre-iminently the representative of republicanism in America . Other colonies , as Virginia , Maryland and Massachusetts , already had , in or under their charters , written plans of government embracing republican features . The colonists of Plymouth had anticipated her in assuming powers of government , outside of any existing charter or patent , under an original and voluntary compact for that purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Majesty , in his name and for the extension of his dominions . But in the royal and proprietary governments there was a divisum imperiurn , the people only sharing in , not controlling the administration . In Massachusetts , the democratic tendencies were never unmixed ; a court party was early formed ; and not even its urgent political and ecclesiastical necessities can reconcile with the idea of genuine republicanism the harsh and arbitrary legislation which disfigures its earliest annals . Plymouth , within a few years , sought to fortify itself under a patent from the council in England ; and both Massachusetts and Plymouth , before the close of the century , were obliged to accept a royal governor . Rhode Island , indeed , was from the beginning purely democratic in hei : forms , and in the spirit of her legislation ; but her antagonism to Massachusetts gave her a leaning towards the crown , and her history furnishes few of those frequent incidents which in the case of Connecticut show so strikingly with what jealousy she repelled the intrusion of any foreign element . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent . Not only was the constitution adopted at Hartford , in 1639 , the first proper fundamental law , fully organizing the government in all its parts ; not only was it thoroughly democratic in its provisions , making it a government of and for the people ; but as its crowning distinction , it was true to the theory of republicanism , in respect to the origin of the powers which it assumed to organize . It was professedly an original act or compact of the people themselves , in their sovereign capacity . In the language of Dr. Bushnell , " No mention whatever is made in it , either of King or Parliament , or the least intimation given of allegiance to the mother country . On the contrary , an oath of allegiance is required directly to the State . And it is expressly declared that in the " General Court , " as organized , shall exist " the SUPREME POWER of the Commonwealth . " And we may add , in this connection , that the resolution of the New Haven colonists in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1639 , must be considered to be , by a strong implication , significant of the same thing ; in which , " seeing they were free to cast themselves into that mould and form of commonwealth which appeared best for them , " studiously avoiding all lecognition of the laws or supremacy of the mother country , they declare their purpose to be governed solely by the law of God , as revealed in His written word . Whether in either case the colonists expected the permanent success , which rewarded this masterly movement , is perhaps doubtful ; but there can be no doubt , we think , that they acted upon the deliberate purpose to exclude , if possible , and as long as possible , ' the idea and the fact of any controlling power over them , other than that inherent in the body politic created by their own original compact . Twenty-three years later , through the admirable management of Gov . Winthrop , the privileges of self-government which they had asserted for themselves , were conceded and established to them in the charter obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single colony , Connecticut has remained , even to our own times , except during the brief usurpation of Andros , a practically independent and self-governing state , and almost as much before as since the era of the revolution . And she worked out under it the fruits of real and complete independence . The peculiarities of her position gave a strong development to the qualities necessary to its maintenance . On the one hand , accustomed to self-government , the people grew up into such habits and feelings of independence as would brook no foreign interference* On the other , there were collisions enough with the royal power , and apprehensions of collisions , to make them practically familiar with the idea of resistance . And looking to yet larger considerations , the same statesmanlike sagacity which had grasped and held the privilege of an immunity from royal supervision and control , saw in the maintenance of that immunity the cardinal point of policy , involving in itself every public interest towards which , when threatened . every energy of the colony must be directed . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hartford , and Andros at Saybrook , was not the act only of the resolute Captains Wadsworth and Bull , but of the magistrates , the deputies , and the whole people . Nothing indeed was more marked in all their colonial history , than the keen-sighted jealousy and the unfailing courage , combined with a prudence as character istic and as necessary as either watchfulness or courage , with which encroachments by the crown were anticipated , warded off and repelled . Nowhere was there a stronger or more // pervading sympathy with Massachusetts , in the struggles which preceded the great contest ; and nowhere , not even in Massachusetts itself , when the day of trial came , did it find the people riper for independence ; nowhere did it find a spirit of resistance more universal or determined . But we proceed to adduce another and , if possible , more striking illustration of our general proposition . Dr. Bushnell claims for Connecticut , on just grounds , the honor of having exerted a decisive influence in giving to our present Government its grand distinction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We go farthpr even than this , and claim that she was in a special and distinctive sense fit ( ed by her early history to act this most important part ; in fact , that what she did in the Convention of 1787 was but the re*inactment of the part she had taken in constructing the first American confederacy , that of the United Colonies of New England in 1643 . Her policy , in both cases , was one which was necessarily suggested by her position , relative to other states or colonies , and by the peculiar hazards to which it exposed her . Massachusetts was by far the most powerful of the northern colonies , being central in position , and greatly superior in extent of territory , in population and resources . She very early manifested the instinct of large states , in the form of a not obscure proclivity towards still further aggrandizement at the expense of her neighbors . In less than fifteen years from the settlement of Boston , she had seized on Maine , annexed New Hampshire , laid claim to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistently on the territories of Connecticut . She was the natural representative of the consolidation tendencies in the New England system . Rhode Island , excluded from the first Confederacy , sought and obtained protection from the favor of the King . Connecticut , in opposition to all these tendencies , planting herself on the essential equality of the colonies as di*tinct commonwealths , was , from the beginning , the representative of the State Rights doctrine . Though strongly interested in effecting a confederation of the colonies , she had refused , in 1638 , to consent to the articles prepared , on the ground that they gave plenary power to a majority of the commissioners ; being , as Gov . Winthrop declares , * " shy of coming under our government , " " very jealous , " and dissatisfied " because some preeminence was therein yielded to Massachusetts . " The influence of her standing out is undoubtedly seen in the articles as finally adopted in 1643 , giving to each of the four Colonies // two commissioners , of whom six must concur in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which from time to time threatened her liberties assumed such a form as to alarm powerfully the instinct of nationality , and put her habitually in the attitude of defense at once of her rights of selfgovernment and of her separate existence as a State . The royal governors of New York and Massachusetts looked with longing eyes upon the territories of Connecticut , lying in tempt ing proximity to their respective jurisdictions , and separated from either by no very strongly marked , natural boundaries . For many years she was obliged to maintain an agent in England , to defend herself against their machinations and intrigues , which seemed at times on the point of success . It was obvious that if her charter should be vacated and a royal governor forced upon her , she must sooner or later , either be absorbed into one of the adjoining jurisdictions , or into a new one still more comprehensive . The attempted aggressions of Fletcher had indicated the former result ; the temporary usurpation of Andros as Governor-General of New England , had realized the latter ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malice of Cornbury and Dudley . We can easily see how strongly such an experience must have impressed itself upon the minds of the people , and especially the statesmen of Connecticut . Next to the maintenance of their rights as freemen and the preservation of their republican institutions , and , in fact as a necessary means of the permanent security of both , the maintenance oftheir political equality had been , from the very beginning , in a peculiar and distinctive sense , a cardinal point of policy , and a settled habit of action . It was therefore but the voice of her history , speaking through her delegates in the Federal Convention , when they insisted upon adequate guaranties in the new Constitution for the inviolability of the states as coequal sovereignties ; and the far-seeing sagacity and profound political wisdom which secured that result , by ordaining the unchangeable equality of those sovereignties in the United States Senate , was a sagacity reared under Connecticut influences , and a wisdom that drew its lessons from the school of her experience . Thus , then , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nearly perfect form , ideas which were to be the glory of a. future age , but which out of New England were as yet but half expressed instincts , place herself at the head of the list of American constitutional republics , their model and exemplar , with the likeness of which all others were in gradual succession to fashion themselves , and finally to be // reproduced , on a national scale , at the distance of a century and a half , by the union of them all under the Federal Constitution . Thus did the transactions which inaugurated her history in form and substance foreshadow those which ushered in the independence of the states and their united government . Nor was it a mere foreshadowing ; hut as a prophecy is sometimes said to work out its own fulfillment , so the spirit which presided over those transactions did not depart with the occasion , but dwelling in the state as an active principle had a direct and potent agency in working out those results of independence and united government . If we pass now from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and examine what we may call the every day life of the state , we shall find Connecticut entitled still to the same precedence , as having furnished the best example in colonial times of genuine republicanism in practice . But we wish it distinctly understood that in making these comparisons we arrogate to our own state no monopoly of excellence , political or otherwise . In preferring Connecticut to Massachusetts , as the best representative of republicanism , ( and th4* question in fact lies between those two , ) we do not say there was no republicanism in the latter ; though we do intend to say that that element had less relative strength , and a less perfect manifestation . We have no sympathy with a recent historical writer , a citizen if not a son of Massachusetts , who can see in the government of the puritan colonies only " a sour and arrogant theocracy , " and who is especially and unsparingly censorious upon the founders of his own state . Dr. Bushnell is entirely right when he speaks of " the genuine republican idea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the New England colonies . " And our claim is , that as that idea , indigenous in some sense upon the American soil through its whole extent , found in the New England colonies , owing to the peculiarities of their origin and condition , a more favorable development than elsewhere in America , so it was the good fortune of Connecticut that upon her soil it received its best and most perfect development . The town meeting , the common school , and the self-governing church or congregation , institutions originally peculiar to New England , and found in their highest perfection in Massachusetts and Connecticut , have been the nurseries of republicanism in New England , and by direct or remote influence have impressed upon American republicanism its most distinctive characteristics . Seventy years ago , John Adams , writing to the Abb6 de Mably , pointed to these institutions , in connec* // tion with the militia system , as furnishing the key to the history of the English colonies in America , and of the revolution through which they had just passed . This truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers of the workings of our institutions . That the people are th' rightful source of political power has been seen to be but half the true republican doctrine ; not only their right but their capacity and their duty to govern themselves must be practically recognized . The experience of France has shown that even a universal suffrage which exhausts itself in designating and giving authority to a strongly centralized governmental agency , may be less republican in fact than a somewhat restricted suffrage , provided the sphere of the central government is limited , and the administration of affairs is brought as near as possible to the mass of the people by suitable municipal institutions . Such a system was the town organization in New England ; and the school and parish systems supplied auxiliary forces acting in the same direction and with nearly or quite equal intensity . They were the nurseries of republicanism , not only because the people under them were trained to exercise and did successfully exercise the functions of government , but because there were wrought into the very texture of their minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , as the idea of equality among citizens , of simplicity and economy in the machinery and operations of government , the habit of discussing and directing the management of public affairs , and the feeling of independence and self-reliance consequent upon that habit . We have dwelt upon these facts , both as justifying the precedence which we have assigned to the New England colonies , and as suggesting the leading point on which the comparison we have yet to make must turn . The strong republican tendencies manifested in the Connecticut constitution of 1638 , have been already noted . That its framers held political views essentially different from those which shaped the polity of the older colonies , is clearly evinced in their departure from the Massachusetts precedent in the fundamental article of admitting other than church members to the privilege of voting . That original impulse was never lost , but , favored by all the circumstances of her condition , continued to act , without check or hindrance , through her whole colonial history . With perfect immunity from foreign control or interference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in agricultural pursuits , with few inequalities of condition or distinctions of social rank , with universal education , with thorough anck* successful family training , with // the most simple and economical personal habits , with a government in all its parts closely in contact with the people , at once reflecting their character and demonstrating their capacity , there was but one result possible in the case ; republicanism was a spontane*is , an unmixed , an inevitable growth . In Massachusetts , on the other hand , the indwelling republican idea was worked out through the conflict of opposing tendencies , and under circumstances by no means so favorable to a symmetrical and harmonious development . Setting out with a policy sterner and less tolerant of diversity , enforced the more rigorously from the necessity of maintaining against all question the rather questionable construction of their charter under which the colony had assumed to exercise political power , its effects were the more marked from the larger admixture of incongruous material contained in its population . In a smaller community with a homogeneous population , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive system might operate for a single generation with little perceptible jarring or friction ; but this was not possible in Massachusetts . Her situation on the sea coast exposed her in a much higher degree to the action of foreign and disturbing influences . The tide of immigration , wholly puritanic at first , did not long continue unmixed , but was constantly bearing to her shores religionists and irreligionists of various sorts , impelled by an enthusiastic or an adventurous spirit , but all alike obnoxious to the puritan settlers . And the exclusive policy , being once adopted , must needs be enforced , by making more frequent examples and inflicting greater seventies , in proportion as heresies were the more rife , or the sowers of heretical opinions the more numerous . Hence the harsh and oppressive legislation , if indeed it could be called legislation , when directed as it so often was against particular persons , designed to prevent the propagation , or , in other words , to suppress the utterance of opinions regarded as involving any attack , either upon the established faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , as the stern puritans who guided its affairs Were not the men to shrink from ajiy consequences of their own doctrines , or from the use of means requisite to carry out settled convictions of duty , the cases in which arbitrary measures of coercion were brought to bear , not merely upon individuals , but upon whole classes of citizens , constituting large and respectable minorities . Witness , for instance , the proceedings connected with the antinomian controversy of 1637 , when many of the most prominent citizens of Boston and other towns , men of the same faith , who had shared the sacrifices and the hardships of the first settlement // were put under the ban of the commonwealth , disowned , and declared guilty of a seditious libel , for having presumed to sign a simple remonstrance against the action of the General Court in the case of Rev. Mr. Wheelwright . We have referred to these things , not for the purpose of reproach , but because they seem to us to have had a political influence not often remarked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long after the particular events had passed . We mean to say that a government which does not hesitate to assume such responsibilities , and is able to carry through successfully such a policy as we have described , becomes necessarily a strong , not to say , an arbitrary government . It may be republican , as being based on popular representation , and may in fact exercise only powers actually delegated to it ; but its essential character as a government is that the power of the state is strongly concentrated in the hands of the acting authorities ; that in the ordinary administration it draws more largely on the reserved powers than is fully consistent with the true republican theory . It manifests , as far as it goes , a strong centralizing tendency . Such , it appears to us , was the case in Massachusetts under the puritan government ; and that Massachusetts politics received then a set , which they had not wholly lost down to the time of the revolution , and of the framing of the federal constitution . Certain it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform bias towards a strong government , while those of Connecticut were as remarkable for their jealousy of *extravagant grants of power . Other facts in the same direction , we think , may be noted , in comparing the republican tendencies and manifestations in the two colonies , by careful observers of the past . Thus , the distinction between " gentlemen " and " those of the common sort , " from the first more distinctly marked in Massachusetts , grew wider , if anything , in proportion as the extension and prosperity of commercial pursuits in Boston and other eastern towns increased the inequality in the distribution of wealth ; while it was as clearly diminished in Connecticut . So , likewise , there has been a wider difference between the body of those holding civil stations and the body of the people , in the one than in the other , very much in the same degree as there has been clearly more expensiveness and showiness , more form and ceremonial , about the government of Massachusetts than that of Connecticut . All these disparities of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the traces of the difference may be seen to this day , in the greater . amount of ceremony and parade in which the legislative , executive and ju // dicial dignitaries of our sister state are wont to indulge . In short , the habits of our government and magistrates , like those of our people , have always been remarkable or simplicity , plainness , and inexpensiveness ; which is a merit , not on the ground that the most niggardly and slovenly government would be the best , but as indicating the nearness of its contact with the people ; as showing that while no state has been better governed , no government has been more directly and purely an emanation from the people . And as another illustration of the republican tendency to distribute rather than to concentrate and centralize the exercise of powers , we ought to refer to that important branch of the administration of justice , which is concerned in the settlement of estates . In Massachusetts , as in most of the states , this business , and also the registration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , the registration has been always by towns , and the probate business has been successively transferred from the General Court to the county court , from the latter to district courts of less and less extent , until finally nearly every town constitutes a probate district . We have left for ourselves little space for the comparison between Connecticut and Rhode Island . The glory and preeminence of the latter is her assertion , in advance not only of Connecticut but of the world , of the great doctrine of the entire freedom of conscience . Moreover , it was eminently democratic beyond any colony except Connecticut , in its instincts , its organization under Roger Williams ' charter , and its habits . Yet we should hardly think of putting it in comparison either with Connecticut or Massachusetts , either as an example of a well ordered and well instructed state , or as entitled to be considered the representative or type of New England republicanism . We should miss at once , in the comp'arison , the frequency of the schoolhouse and the church . The truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a specimen of a well instructed community . And in attempting to carry out their great idea of non-interference in matters of conscience , the earlier generations ran into the error of neglecting to impose such restraints as were really salutary and requisite . On the other hand , practical freedom of conscience was always enjoyed in Connecticut . Few if any attempts were ever made to force the conscience of individuals , except so far as some consciences pretended to be shocked by being compelled to the outward observance of such regulations as were in those days almost universally deemed necessary to the maintenance , not so much of a particular faith or form of wcrship , as of decency and good order in society . The right // of " such as soberly dissented " from the established faith to worship in their own manner was fully protected . We stated our conviction that our state in her early history disclosed " more of the rudimental tendencies which in their full development constitute and honorably distinguish the American character , than any other of the original states or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner which does but feeble justice to the subject and to the facts , her early and perfect development of some of the leading elements of political and moral greatness in the nation of to-day . To complete the view which we had proposed to take , we might proceed to point out , in the recognized character and habits of our people , in their energy , enterprise and industry , in their thrift and economy , in their mechanical skill and inventive genius , the chief elements of our present material greatness and prosperity . And we might give some idea of the large part which Connecticut has actually contributed to those best qualities and best achievments of the nation , by sending out her educated and intelligent sons , and foster-children , in much larger relative numbers than any other state , to guide , to teach , to impet and energize , to occupy posts of honor and usefulness in every department of human activity , throughout the length and breadth of the land . But we are compelled to restrict ourselves to one only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been tempted to inquire what connection there could be between Dr. Bushnell 's speech for Connecticut and the Report of the Commissioner of Patents , that they should stand together at the head of this article . We introduce the latter to the attention of our readers , as furnishing very unexpected , and satisfactory proof of the early cultivation and exercise within the state of inventive genius , in the department of mechanical and manufacturing art . In 1849 , a circular letter was addressed by the Commissioner of Patents to the Governors of the several states , asking for information relative to the early progress of the arts , in their respective states , and especially as to the encouragement given to invention by patents , in the colonial period , or prior to the surrender of the power to the Federal Government . Most of the states had nothing to show on the subject . In a few , some patent rights were granted after the Revolution . In Massachusetts , prior to the Revolution , there were on record some six or eight instances of legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the growth of hemp , by bounties or exclusive privileges . In the state of Connecticut alone , " copious and characteristic records " were found and // furnished , showing at once the remarkable activity of her people in this department of effort , and the wise and liberal policy of the government , early commenced and steadily pursued , in aiding and encouraging their efforts . In the statutes of 1672 , the prohibition of monopolies was declared not to extend to " new and profitable inventions ; " and there were general laws to encourage discoveries in mines or minerals , enacted in 1664 , and to encourage the discovery and introduction of new commodities , in 1715 . Exclusive privileges were granted in 1708 , for making pitch ; in 1716 ; for the erection of a slitting mill ; in 1717 , for making molasses from cornstalks ; in 1718 , for making linseed oil ; in 1725 , for making duck and canvass ; in 1728 , for converting iron into steel , said to have been , as it undoubtedly was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the beginning of a very difficult and important manufacture , which received further encouragement in 1740 , and 1744 ; in 1741 , for making potash ; in 1747 , for making glass ; and others , of later date . To various other manufactories , aid was extended at different times by bounties , and in several instances , even by the loan of money . The iron works at Salisbury received early and frequent attention , and in 1767 , a loan of ? 1200 was made to assist in carrying . them on . In 1772 , a loan of ? 500 for three years without interest was made to aid the manufacture of steel in Killingworth ; a like loan of ? 300 , authorized in 1775 , to aid the manufacture of iron wire in Norwich . In 1734 , a general act was passed , giving bounties for the raising of hemp , and for making duck and fine linen ; and a like act in 1735 , to encourage the raising of silk . Among the other inventions and arts brought to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the state , we find that of bell f9unding ( 1736 , ) type founding , polishing crystals , pin making , a drill plough , tide mills , a torpedo for destroying shipping , ( Bushnell 's , 1776 , ) glass , pottery and paper making , flax-dressing , stocking w*aving , and linen and woolen cloth manufacture , and the refining of sugar . But the above will suffice for our present purpose . We had intended to say something , in connection with Dr. Bushnell 's remarks on the same subject , in relation to the military distinctions of Connecticut ; but we have hardly room or time left for more than a brief allusion . A distinguished officer in the Mexican war , not a New England man , once said to the writer , that he had always observed , as a characteristic of Connecticut soldiers , " that their courage was always equal to the demand upon it . " The same idea is strongly expressed by Dr. Bushnell . " There was never a speck of chivalry among // her leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their courage had the christian stamp , it was practical and related to duty ; always exerted for some object of defense and safety . They knew nothing of fighting without an object , and when they had one , they went to the work bravely , simply because it was sound economy to fight well ! " It is for this reason , because the proper military traits had so little prominence in their character , that their actual achievements have been so little appreciated , even among ourselves . Yet the materials are ample for a military history , such as a people much more ambitious than ours of that kind of distinction might well be proud of . We wish particularly that the public mind , in and out of the state , might be more generally enlightened than it is , in regard to the part taken by Connecticut in the war of independence . About ten years ago , a collection of official and other documents upon this subject , was made and published by the late secretary of state , Mr. Hun man , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired , but was so utterly chaotic in form as to repel we fear most of the readers whom its title might invite . Such a work , well edited , would be of great value to the state ; and we hope the editor of the Connecticut Colonial Records will not consider his labors complete till that object is attained . Meantime , we shall expect from the forthcoming volumes of Mr. Bancroft , who has always shown a just and a generous appreciation of Connecticut , as full a recognition of her revolutionary honors , as he has already given of those connected with her early history .
