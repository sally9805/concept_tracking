txt ART . IV . - Five Years of a Hunter 's Life in the Far Interior of South Africa , with Notices of the Native Tribes , and Anecdotes of the Chase of the Lion , IJlephant , Hippopotamus , Giraffe , Rhinoceros , &amp;c . By ROUALEYN GORDON CUMMING , EsQ. , of Altyre . With Illustrations . London : John Murray . 1850. 2 vols. 1 52rno . THE race of fox-hunting English squires , for an intimate knowledge of whose characters and pursuits we are indebted // to Fielding and Scott , has fairly died out . Education has been the death of them ; their hounds have long since howled their requiem , and except these four-footed favorites , no one has bewailed their loss . Squire Western and Squire Osbaldistone exist no longer but in the pages of fiction , where they are represented in quite as favorable a light as they deserve ; for they were a rude , vulgar , and hard drinking set , whose only pretensions to be considered as gentlemen consisted in the length of their pedigrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood was an advantage which the Squire shared with his horse , who often had a pedigree quite as long as his master 's , and perhaps less liable to he questioned in some of its details . The game laws have been stripped of their most objectionable features and most fearful penalties , though they still form a code which is no monument either to the wisdom or the humanity of the English Parliament . Less than thirty years ago , Sidney Smith complained that there was " a perpetual and vehement desire on the part of the country gentlemen to push the provisions of these laws up to the highest point of tyrannical severity . " This is no longer true ; and the reason why it has ceased to be true is , that " the country gentlemen " of England have ceased to be the mere fox-hunting squires that they were only a century ago . The squire of the parish , or the lord of the manor , is now almost invariably a thorough-bred gentleman ; and he is usually something more . He is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cultivated tastes and humane feelings , tolerably well informed as to the literature and politics of the present time , and of the Greeks and Romans , though he may not know much about those of the intervening centuries . As to his opinions , he is usually a stout Conservative , or a very aristocratic Whig , willing to have a reform made in the constitution perhaps once in a hundred years . This is vastly better than being the stupid Jacobite that his great-grandfather was before him . But with all these alterations and improvements , the country squire is still a keen sportsman , - a perfect Nimrod in ambition , if not in prowess . His position in life allows him only two occupations ; his serious business is to hunt , fish , and shoot ; his amusement is to be a member of Parliament . All the business of the nation could not keep Her Majesty 's // faithful Commons together one week after the shooting season commences ; at this important period , all minor engagements must give place to the great duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , - to horses and hounds , angling rods anl double-barrelled guns , pheasants and partridges . With a brave and enterprising spirit , and an athletic frame , doomed by his hereditary rank and fortune to follow no occupation which ordinary mortals consider useful , the English country gentleman is fairly driven to field sports by the necessity of having some object of ambition , some employment . Existence to him would be mere vegetation without them . There is a fascination about these manly , out-of-door exercises which those only can understand who have had some experience in them , and which sufficiently accounts for the not infrequent sacrifice of fortune and happiness in their pursuit . England alone , however , is fast losing its attractiveness as a country for sportsmen . The increase of population , the improvements of agriculture , and the building of innumerable railroads have scared away nearly all the wild tenants of the moor and the forest , who are the huntsman 's legitimate prey . There is little excitement in chasing a poor fox or deer , which is turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendezvous , and after affording the party what is called " a fine run , " is preserved , if possible , from the fangs of the dogs , and carted back to yield another day 's amusement . Carefully preserved game is usually very tame game ; and when one can bag pheasants by the hundred in a single morning , shooting becomes mere butchery . Stalking the red deer among the high lands of Scotland is a kind of sport requiring more skill , and involving more exposure and hardship , if not peril ; and an opportunity to participate in this comparatively noble sport is therefore highly prized . Some of the aristocratic owners of vast estates in the north of Scotland have even been accused of adopting the barbarous example of William the Conqueror , and turning out the human inhabitants of many a square mile of rough land in order to make room for the princely game . Not even is a road allowed to be cut for many miles through these immense mountain parks , so that the deer in their antlered pride may never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few weeks in the year to creep stealthily upon them with his rifle , under cover 31 * // of the rocks and furse . Hunting is indeed the great business of life to those who pursue it under such circumstances . But as very few can have permission to follow the game over the vast estates of the half a dozen noble proprietors who own half of Scotland , and as the deer , even for the favored few , are scarce and difficult of access , many of the squirarchy , with whom sporting has become an appetite and a passion , are obliged to visit other lands to find exercise for their rifles and hounds . Not even the fervor of missionary zeal , nor the ardor of youthful devotion to science , has carried men farther into the trackless and perilous wilderness , or made them more familiar with the remote haunts of savage tribes , or more reckless of sickness and famine , than the Englishman 's love of sport . The knded gentry of England at this moment have representatives hunting the bufiklo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the plains of India , the chamois among the Alps , the lion and elephant in South Africa , and , we believe , the kangaroo over the arid wastes of New Holland . Not even the atari sacra fames has urged men to greater effbrt , or made them peril more . We must not compassionate this feeling as a sort of monomania , or regret the waste of so much energy and bravery . The English sportsman is generally a keen observer , and often writes as well as he shoots . Some of the most entertaining and valuable additions to our stock of geographical knowledge and our stores of natural history have beep made by men whose primary object was amusement in die chase . An awkward attempt is occasionally made , by those who have a glimmering consciousness that shooting birds and hunting tigers is not exactly the most dignified occupation in which a gentleman and a scholar can be engaged , to cover up the waste of time with big words and scientific pretences . The huntsman is an ornithologist , or a zoblogist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific museum at home . But the vanity of the sportsman usually peeps out sooner or later , and we learn that he is more proud of a fine shot with a double-barrelled gun , than he would be of easily bagging a specimen of the gigantic bird , now commonly considered extinct , of New Zealand . Let them follow die chase , then , with as much spirit and as litde concealment as ever , provided that they write books as amusing and instructive as the volumes // by Captain Harris , or even as these by Roualeyn Gordon Cumming , Es q , of Altyre , whose recent publication has sugvested these remarks . The account which Mr. Cumming b gives of himself in the Introduction to his book we shall now transfer to our pages , as the best illustration of that trait of character which we have been considering . " The early portion of my life was spent in the county of Moray , where a love of natural history and of sport early engendered themselves , and became stronger and more deeply rooted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , during these early wanderings by wood and stream , the strong love of sport and admiration of Nature in her wildest and most attractive forms became with me an all-absorbing feeling , and my greatest possible enjoyment was to pass whole days and many a summer night in solitude , where undisturbed , I might contemplate the silent grandeur of the forest and the ever-varying beauty of the scenes around . Long before I proceeded to Eton , I took pride in the goodly array of hunting trophies which hung around my room . " In 1839 , I sailed for India , to join my regiment , the 4th Madras Light Cavalry . Touching at the Cape of Good Hope , I had an opportunity of hunting several of the smaller antelopes , and obtained a foretaste of the splendid sport I was in after years so abundantly to enjoy . In India , I procured a great number of specimens of natural history , and laid the foundation of a collection which has since swelled to gigantic proportions . Finding that the climate did not agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , where , resuming my old hunting habits , I was enabled , through the kindness of a wide circle of friends , to follow my favorite pursuit of deer-stalking so successfully that I speedily found myself in possession of a fine collection of select heads from most of the Scottish deer-forests . Growing weary , however , of hunting in a country where the game was strictly preserved , and where the continual presence of keepers and foresters took away half the charm of the chase , and longing once more for the freedom of nature , and the life of the wild hunter - so far preferable to that of the mere sportsman - I resolved to visit the rolling prairies and rocky mountains of the Far West , where my nature would find congenial sport with the bison , the wapiti , and the elk- With this view I obtained a commission in the Royal Veteran Newfoundland Companies . But I speedily discovered that the prospect of getting from the barrack-square would he small , and that I should have little chance of playing the Niinrod whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange into the Cape Riflemen , and in 1843 found myself once more in the country upon whose frontiers dwelt those vast herds of game which had so often fired my imagination , and made me long to revisit it . " Immediately upon landing I marched with my division of the army of occupation , under the command of Colonel Somerset , into the country of the Amaponda Cafi'res , where we lay for some time under canvas - where our principal amusements were quail-shooting and throwing the assagai . Being disappointed in my expectations , and there being at that time no prospect of fighting , I made up my mind to sell out of the army , and to penetrate into the interior farther than the foot of civilized man had yet trodden - to vast regions which would afford abundant food for the gratification of the passion of my youth - the collecting of hunting trophies and objects of interest in science and natural history . And in this I ultimately succeeded to my heart 's desire. ** Mr. Cumming ' s claims to . be regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vouched . The work is dedicated to " his kinsman , " the Duke of Argyll , because his Grace takes a deep " interest in the sports of the field and in the habits of wild animals ; " and the reader is introduced , in the true spirit of Scotch clanship , to " my cousin , Colonel Campbell of the 91st ( one of the bravest and most distinguished officers in the late Kafir war , and withal about the best rifle shot and keenest sportsman then in the colony , ) a brother of Captain Campbell of Skipness , the author of the Old Forest Ranger , ' a work highly approved amongst Indian Nimrods . " The style and breadth of Mr. Cumming 's outfit and camp equipage also show that the enterprise on which he was engaged is suited only for people of fortune . Two or three enormous covered wagons , each drawn by six or eight pairs of stout oxen , attached to it by a long rope called the trek-tow , were stored with provisions , arms , articles of barter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a whole year . A whole stud of valuable horses , to be used only in the chase , accompanied the wagons ; and four or five Hottentot cattle-drivers and afterriders , of whose laziness , cowardice , and drunkenness their master makes sufficient complaint , made up the personnel of the expedition . Only on the author 's fifth and last trip into the far interior , was he accompanied by a companion of his own rank in life , and also a mighty Nimrod , who appears , // however , to have had enough of it in his first journey , as he had very ill luck in shooting elephants and hippopotami , and before many months had elapsed , he was himself attacked and nearly killed by an immense male leopard . Mr. Cumming 's good luck , together with his great skill as a marks .. man , his fearlessness and remarkable powers of endurance , brought him off scatheless in many a desperate encounter with the wild tenants of the forest and the stream ; and he lived to bring his hunting trophies home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of them in London . We can not say that these volumes add much to our knowledge of the country or of its human inhabitants . The writer is too deeply interested in his proper business as a sportsman to give any thing more than scattered and incidental notices of the peculiarities of the re* , ion that he traversed and the people whom he met . The tribes of natives with whom he came in contact were a feeble and ignoble set , with not even enough of savageness to render their squalor and misery somewhat fearful , and thereby a little dignitied . Yet they had not been contaminated by intercourse with the whites , for our Nimrod boasts that he was the first white man who penetrated into the interior of the Baman * , wato country , and that his axe and spade pioneered the way which others have since followed . His ire was a good deal excited by the cupidity of the natives , and by their slow but politic manner of driving a bargain ; for in striving to turn an honest penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , canny Scotchman as he was , that he could not make a profit out of them of more than a thousand per cent . They were very friendly , as they had reason to be , for his coming was a perfect godsend to them ; the terrible havoc that he made among the elephants , lions , rhinoceroses , and hippopotami supplied them plentifully with meat , while at other times they were often in danger of starvation , their imperfect arms not enabling them to cope with the larger or swifter quadrupeds . For this reason , they resorted to many artifices to induce Mr. Cumming to prolong his stay among them , and not attempt to penetrate into the districts lying beyond . They would not supply him with guides , and they told him horrible lies about the want of water , and other difficulties in his way . But the hope of obtaining abundant and noble game is enough to embolden the // true sportsman to run all risks ; Mr. Cumming persevered , and came out triumphantly . His equipment , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable him to go far beyond the bounds of civilization . Oxen are not very fleet , and when in a difficult country or in want of water , they are not apt to be very tractable . But being content to move slowly , and taking care to follow the course of streams , or to send out scouts in advance in search of water , the party got along without much suffering or peril , except what the sportsman incurred voluntarily by bearding the lion in his wrath , or goading the wild elephant to fury . Starting from Graham 's Town , he passed over twelve degrees of latitude towards the north , travelling through the heart of the country , and stopping only when the objects of the expedition were accomplished , and not because fresh difficulties environed the way . If geographical exploration had been his aim , he might , for all that appears , have penetrated the interior as many leagues farther , and thus have reached a point within eight or nine degrees of the equator , without encountering any greater hardship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlements . From all such natives as he met , a corporal 's guard of white men would have been an ample protection , even if their intentions had been hostile ; but they appeared perfectly inoffensive , and , as already observed , they esteemed the presence of the stranger a blessing . Perhaps it is unwise to hanker after some definite information in regard to that vast tract in the centre of Africa , which is still designated on the maps by a blank . On the paths which lead to it are already whitening the bones of many a gallant explorer who has fallen a victim either to the pestilential climate , the wild beasts , or the savage natives , or who has died of thirst on those parched plains . Why , it may be asked , should more lives be sacrificed in expeditions which , even if successful , would only increase our geographical knowledge , and fill up certain lacunme on the maps , without probably giving any extension to commerce , promoting civilization , or adding to the happiness of man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone to dwell on what is unknown , to people it with marvellous creations , and thus to create an almost irresistible longing to explore its depths . // We now circumnavigate the globe with ease , and send out expeditions which skirt the immovable ice that seems to cover either pole . Yet we are barred out from any knowledge of the interior of a continent the centre of which is hardly a thousand miles distant from the oldest seat of civilization on the face of the globe , or from the shores of two navigable oceans . The exploration of Africa was begun by the Pharaohs and the Carthaginians , and after the lapse of five-and-twenty centuries , it is still unfinished . The source of the Nile is not yet discovered , and a magic circle seems to surround the mysterious Mountains of the Moon , which the foot of civilized man can not pass . It is provoking to know something of a mighty river in the middle of its course , and yet be unable to lay down either its source or its outlet . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt of settlements by Europeans or civilized natives is forming all around the continent , many of which are making slow hut sure progress , and pushing their scouts and pioneers farther into the interior . The Red Sea has once more become one of the grand routes of commerce ; and our knowledge of Ahyssinia on its western shore , through which lies the shortest and safest road into the heart of the unexplored region , is daily increasing . The line which bounds the African terra incognita is daily contracting , and probably before another century has elapsed , the interior will have been traversed in every direction by those who are competent to give a full account of it to the civilized world . To this desirable consummation , if we may judge from past experience , the hunters of wild animals will contribute a large share . Africa is their favorite domain . The huge pachyderms and great cats abound over the southern part of the continent , and countless herds of antelopes , embracing no less than sixty distinct species , find rich pasture on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy that the hunter s skill is taxed to the utmost before be can obtain specimens of them ; but their flesh , which always exhales a pleasant odor from the grasses and scented herbs on which they feed , is so tempting to the palate , that the sportsman will not readily abandon their pursuit . The names which have been given to the several species are uncouth enough ; there are spriughoks , rheboks , gemsboks , and blesboks , hartebeests and wildebeests , pallahs , elands , klipspringers , potaquaines , // and serolomootlooques . Mr. Cumming began by " jaging " a herd of them , as it is called , or chasing them on a fleet horse for many miles , firing with a good rifle from the saddle as fast as he could load ; such a chase is very exhilarating , but not successful , for though he wounded man ) r , he killed and secured but few . The Dutch Boors select a proper spot near a defile where a herd is wont to and build hidinr pass , a b place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boor lies ensconced in this shelter , armed with a tremendously long gun , appropriately called a " roer , " and when the herd comes near , he fires with a sure aim . " The report made by these unwieldy guns of the Boors , charged with a large handful of coarse gunpowder , is to be heard at an amazing distance through the calm atmosphere of these high table lands ; and during my stay on tle flats adjoining Thebus mountain , scarcely an hour elapsed at morning , noon , or eve , but the distant booming of some Dutchman 's gun saluted the ear . " Mr. Cumming at last tried stalking the game , sending out his Hottentots to drive the herds towards him , and in this way he was very successful . We give his account of one day 's sport that he had in company with a Boor , who was even a better marksman than himself . " As we rode along , a balmy freshness pervaded the morning air . We passed through herds of thousands of springboks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired two or three very long shots without success . Strydom , however , was more fortunate . He fired into a herd of about a hundred bucks at three hundred yards , and hit one fine old buck right in the middle of the forehead , the ball passing clean through his skull . We hid him in a hole in the ground , and covered him with bushes , and then rode on to our Liottentots , whom we found waiting beside a small fountain in a pass formed by a wide gap in a low range of hills , situated between two extensive plains which were thickly covered with game . I took up my position in a bush of rushes in the middle of the pass , and remained there for upwards of eight hours , during which our boys were supposed to be endeavoring to drive the game towards us . " The Boer took up the best pass about a quarter of a mile to my right . Before we had been an hour at our passes , the boys drove up four beautiful ostriches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , alas ! he was asleep . About this time I was busy trying to remember and practise a childish // amusement which once delighted me as much as rifle-shooting - namely , making a cap of rushes - when , on suddenly lifting up my eyes , I saw standing within eighty yards of me about a dozen beautiful springboks , which were coming up to the pass hehind me . I snatched up my rifle , and , lying flat on my breast , I sent a bullet through the best buck in the troop , smashing his shoulder . He ran about fifty yards , and fell dead . I unfortunately left him lying exposed in the pass , the consequence of which was that three other troops of spriaghoks , which were coming up as he had come , were turned to the right-about by his carcass . " It was amusing to see the birds and beasts of prey assembling to dispute the carcass with me . First came the common black and white carrion-crow , then the vultures ; the jackals knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their hiding . places in the rocks and holes of the ant-bear in the plains , to share in the feast , whilst I was obliged to remain a quiet spectator , not daring to move , as the game was now in herds on every side of me , and I expected to see ostriches every moment . Presently a herd of wildebeest came thundering down upon me , and passed within shot . I put a bullet into one of these , too far behind the shoulder , which , as is always the case with deer and antelopes , did not seem to affect him in the slightest degree . In the afternoon we altered our positions , and sent the boys to drive the plain beside which I had been sitting all day . The quantity of bucks which were now before our eyes beat all computation . The plain extended , without a break , until the eye could not discern any object smaller than a castle . rrhroughout the whole of this extent were herds of thousands and tens of thousands of springboks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one herd of about three hundred spriaghoks , into which Strydom let fly at about three hundred yards , and turned them and all the rest . It was now late in the day , so we made for home , taking up the buck which Strydom had shot in the morning . As we cantered along the flats , Strydom , tempted by a herd of springboks , which were drawn up together in a compact body , jumped off his horse , and , giving his ivory sight an elevation of several feet , let drive at them , the distance being about five hundred yards . As the troop bounded away , we could distinguish a light-colored object lying in the short heath , which he pronounced to be a spriaghok , and on going up we found one fine old doe lying dead , shot through the spine . This day , and every day since I arrived at these fiats , I was astonished at the number of skeletons and well-bleached skulls with which the plains were covered . Thousands of skulls of spriagbok and wildebeest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun was extremely powerful all day , but , being intent on the sport , I did not feel it , until I found my legs burnt ; my dress as usual was the kilt , with a grey stalking cap . " The springbok is so called from the extraordinary bounds that it makes when pursued . They leap to the height of ten or twelve feet , striking the ground with the elasticity of an India-rubber ball , and clearing from twelve to fifteen feet of ground by each effort . Their extraordinary power in this way is best shown when a herd is chased by a dog . " On these occasions , away start the herd with a succession of strange perpendicular bounds , rising with curved loins high into the air , and at the same time elevating the snowy folds of long white hair on their haunches and along their back , which imparts to them a peculiar fairy-like appearance . " They bound along in this manner for a short distance , and then fall into a light , elastic trot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , as if in sport . If a herd is forced to cross a path lately trodden by man , each animal clears it at a single leap , as if suspicious of the footprint of their adversary ; and they bound in like rn*inner when passing to leeward of a lion or other animal of which they have an instinctive dread . At their annual migrations , they may be compared to a swarm of locusts , so vast are their numbers ; like them , also , they consume every green thing in their course , laying waste a whole district in a few hours . The isolated farmer , therefore , wages war against them with good reason ; hut one can not help wishing ill luck to the marksman who waylays and murders these graceful creatures only for sport . " On the 28th , I had the satisfaction of beholding , for the first time , what I had often heard the Doers allude to , namely , a trek. bokken , ' or grand migration of springboks . This was , I think , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts of the chase , that I have ever beheld . For about two hours before the day dawned I had been lying awake in my wagon , listening to the grunting of the bucks within two hundred yards of me , imagining that some large herd of springboks was feeding beside my camp ; but on my rising when it was clear , and looking about me , I heheld the ground to the northward of my camp actually covered with a dense living mass of springboks , // marching slowly and steadily along , extending from an opening in a long range of hills on the west , through which they continued pouring , like the flood of some great river , to a ridge about a mile to the northeast , over which they disappeared . The breadth of the ground they covered might have been somewhere about half a mile . I stood upon the fore chest of my wagon for nearly two hours , lost in wonder at the novel and wonderful scene which was passing before me , and had some difficulty in convincing myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild and exaggerated picture of a hunter 's dream . During this time their vast legions continued streaming through the neck in the hills in one unbroken , compact phalanx . At length I saddled up , and rode into the middle of them with my rifle and afterriders , and fired into the ranks until fourteen had fallen , when I cried Enough . ' We then retraced our steps to secure from the ever-voracious vultures the venison which lay strewed along my gory track . " The eland is a much larger species of antelope , often exceeding an ox in size , and being much burdened with fat , while its flesh is very tender and savory , it is hunted with eagerness . On account of its great weight , it is not so swift as the other species , and by hard and judicious riding , it may be chased till it drops dead , owing to its plethoric habit . A hunter 's heart knows no relenting , or we might suppose that it would be moved by such a sight as is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eland standing under a tree . He was the first that I had seen , and was a noble specimen , standing about six feet high at the shoulder . Observing us , he made off at a gallop , springing over the trunks of decayed trees which lay across his path ; but very soon he reduced his pace to a trot . Spurring my horse , another moment saw me riding hard behind him . Twice in the thickets I lost sight of him , and he very nearly escaped me ; but at length , the ground improving , I came up with him , and rode within a few yards behind him . Long streaks of foam now streamed from his mouth , and a profuse perspiration had changed his sleek grey coat to an ashy blue . Tears trickled from his large dark eye , and it was plain that the eland 's hours were numbered . Pitching my rifle to my shoulder , I let fly at the gallop , and mortally wounded him behind ; then spurring my horse , I shot past him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his shoulder , when the eland staggered for a moment and subsided in the dust . " // crossed the Great Orange River , he encountered game more worthy of his rifle . His favorite mode of hunting was on horseback , followed hy one or two Hottentot boys riding other horses , so that he could shift his saddle when his own steed became exhausted ; these after-riders being " light-weights , " and taking care merely to keep their master in sight , and to pass over a little ground for that purpose as possible , he was often enabled , in the midst of a long and hard run , to mount a horse comparatively fresh . Another mode , more fatal to the game , though less honorable to the huntsman , was to dig a hole about three feet deep by the side of a fountain or small stream , the banks of which showed that it was a common watering place for wild animals , and ensconce himself in it of a moonlight night to watch for the mighty game as they came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various kinds of antelope usually drink only at night , and often travel many miles to a favorite watering place , returning before dawn to the distant and thick coverts where they pass the day . Nimrod lies in wait for them in his hole at the waterside , and thus has an excellent chance to watch the habits of the animals when undisturbed , to pick out the noblest head among them , and to fire with a steady aim from a short distance . But he must have steady nerves who undertakes to " watch the water " in this fashion ; all the monsters of the wilderness congregate growling and roaring around him , and the imperfect light , which is his only chance for concealment and safety , may prove his destruction , by causing some fierce beast to stumble upon him unawares . In these nocturnal watchings , Mr. Cumming had frequent occasion to observe the proceedings of the wild dogs , which , like their domesticated brethren , are wont to hunt in packs , and by thus rendering mutual aid , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtake the swiftest , and conquer the most powerful antelopes . One night , having watched in vain for game , he had wrapped his blanket round him , and fallen asleep in his hole . He was suddenly roused by the tramp of a heavy animal galloping within six feet of him , and peeping out , he saw a large brindled gnoo dash into the water , and there stand at bay , followed by four savage dogs . On they came at an easy pace , as if sure of their prey , their muzzles already covered with blood . Just as they were // springing upon him , the crack of a rifle was heard , and the poor gnoo , after giving a single bound , sank quietly beneath the surface ; in a twinkling , a shot from the other barrel stretched one of the dogs beside him , while the other three slowly withdrew , and seemed to be searching for the cause of their disappointment . A third shot , as soon as the rifle could be reloaded , sent them scampering away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " remarks our thorough sports-. man , " to fire at the jolly hounds . The whole affair reminded me so very forcibly of many gallant courses I had enjoyed in the Scottish deer forests with my own noble deer-hounds , that I could not divest myself of the idea , that those now before me deserved a better recompense for the masterly manner in which they were pursuing their desperate game . " The sympathies of a common man would have been directly the other way , - with the gnoo rather than the dogs . On another occasion , having carelessly fallen asleep without reloading his rifle , he got a fright from which he did not easily recover . One can not help thinking that the fate which he so narrowly escaped would be no inappropriate punishment for those sportsmen whose tender mercies even are cruel to all the brute creation . There is a moral significance in the fable of Acta*on and his dogs . " I had not slept long when my light dreams were influenced by strange sounds . I dreamt that lions were rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing , I awoke with a sudden start , uttering a loud shriek . I could not for several seconds remember in what part of the world I was , or any thing connected with my present position . I heard the rushing of light feet as of a pack of wolves close on every side of me , accompanied by the most unearthly sounds . On raising my head , to my utter horror I saw on every side nothing but savage wild dogs , chattering and growling . On my right and on my left , and within a few paces of me , stood two lines of these ferocious-looking animals , cocking their ears and stretching their necks to have a look at me ; while two large troops , in which there were at least forty of them , kept dashing backwards and forwards across my wind within a few yards of me , chattering and growling with the most extraordinary volubility . Another troop of wild dogs were fighting over the wildebeest I had shot , which they had begun to devour . On beholding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pieces and consumed . I felt my blood curdling along my cheeks 32* // and my hair bristling on my head . However , I had presence of mind to consider that the human voice and a determined bearing might overawe them , and accordingly , springing to my feet , I stepped on to the little ledge surrounding the hole , where , drawing myself up to my full height , I waved my large blanket with both hands , at the same time addressing my savage assembly in a loud and solemn manner . This had the desired effect : the wild dogs removed to a more respectful distance , barking at me something like collies . Upon this I snatched up my rifle and commenced loading , and before this was accomplished the entire pack had passed away and did not return . " Paulo majora canamus ; let us hear what Nimrod can tell us about the lions . He has a right to speak , for he has probably killed more of these royal animals than any other living man , and has had numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not attack them . He contradicts the common story that they refuse to eat venison which they have not killed themselves ; - " I have repeatedly discovered lions of all ages which had taken possession of , and were feasting upon , the carcases of various game quadrupeds which had fallen before my rifle . " They evince great sagacity in selecting a time and place for satisfying their appetites ; they seldom visit the fountains with good moonlight , but choose an early or late hour for watering , according to the time of the moon* s rising . Their tawny coats are quite invisible in the dark , and Mr. Cumming often heard them loudly lapping the water not twenty yards oW when lie could not make out even the outline of their forms . He allows that lion-hunting is a very dangerous pursuit , though it may be followed with comparative safety by those who have sufficient nerve and skill . " A recklessness of death , perfect coolness and self-possession , an acquaintance with the disposition and manners of lions , and a tolerable knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would shine in the overpoweringly exciting pastime of hunting this justly celebrated king of beasts . " " One of the most striking things connected with the lion is his voice , which is extremely grand and peculiarly striking . It consists at times of a low , deep moaning , repeated five or six times , ending in faintly audible sighs ; at other times he startles the forest with loud , deep-toned , solemn roars , repeated five or six times in quick succession , each increasing in loudness to the third or // fourth , when his voice dies away in five or six low , muffled sounds , very much resembling distant thunder . At times , and not unfrequently , a troop may be beard roaring in concert , one assuming the lead , and two , three , or four more regularly taking up their parts , like persons singing a catch . Like our Scottish stags at the rutting season , they roar loudest in cold , frosty nights ; but on no occasions are their voices to be heard in such perfection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three strange troops of lions approach a fountain to drink at the same time . When this occurs , every member of each troop sounds a bold roar of defiance at the opposite parties ; and when one roars , all roar together , and each seems to vie with his comrades in the intensity and power of his voice . The power and grandeur of these nocturnal forest concerts is inconceivably striking and pleasing to the hunter 's ear . The effect , I may remark , is greatly enhanced when the hearer happens to be situated in the depths of the forest , at the dead hour of midnight , unaccompanied by any attendant , and ensconced within twenty yards of the fountain which the surrounding troops of lions are approaching . Such has been my situation many scores of times ; and though I am allowed to have a tolerably good taste for music , I consider the catches with which I was then regaled as the sweetest and most natural I ever heard . " One bright evening in September , our sportsman " watched the fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had slain near to his hole , as a bait for the lions . He had scarcely lain down , when the terrible voice of a lion was beard a little to the east . He seemed afraid to show himself , though the jackals , hyamas , and wild dogs were crowding thick about the water , and feasting on the remains of a white rhinoceros shot the day before . Presently , a great clattering of hoofs was heard advancing up the valley , and an immense herd of blue wildebeests appeared and rushed into the fountain . A shot from Mr. Cumming 's rifle dropped one of them , when the others retreated and stood at gaze on a rising ground just beyond . The jackals and hy*enas then came up , and began feasting on the dead wildebeest , when their repast was stopped by an appalling roar from the lion , which was followed for a minute by a deathlike stillness ; the wild animals seemed to know and do homage to the voice of their king . " I had then only one shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other barrel of my Westley Richards , and with breathless // attention I kept the strictest watch in front , expecting every moment to see the mighty and terrible king of beasts approaching ; but he was too cunning . He saw all the other game fight shy of the water , so he made a circuit to leeward to get the wind off the fountain . Soon after he roared I heard a number of jackals bothering him , as if telling him to come across the vley to the wildebeest : he growled from side to side , as if playing with them , and after this all was still . " I had listened with intense anxiety for about fifteen minutes longer , when I heard the hytenas and jackals give way on either side behind me from the carcass of the wildebeest , and , turning my head slowly round , I beheld a huge and majestic lion , with a black mane which nearly swept the ground , standing over the carcass . He seemed aware of my proximity , and lowering his head he at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance up the hill . He then halted to take breath , but did not expose a broadside , and in a quarter of a minute he again laid hold of the wildebeest and dragged it about twelve yards farther towards the cover , when he again raised his noble head and halted to take breath . " I had not an instant to lose ; he stood with his right side exposed to me in a very slanting position ; I stretched my left arm across the grass , and , taking him rather low , I fired : the ball took effect , and the lion sank to the shot . All was still as death for many seconds , when he uttered a deep growl , and slowly gaining his feet he limped toward the cover , roaring mournfully as he went . When he got into the thorny bushes he stumbled through them as he moved along , and in half a minute I heard him halt and growl fearfully , as if dying . " Having obtained the dogs from the camp , search was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old blackmaned fellow , was found in the thicket to which he had retreated . No lover could expatiate on the beauties of his idolized mistress with more earnestness and passion than Mr. Gumming does over this token of his success as a sportsman . " No description , " he says , " could give a correct idea of the surpassing beauty of this most majestic animal , as he lay still warm be-. fore me . I lighted a fire and gazed with delight upon his lovely mane , his massive arms , his sharp yellow nails , his hard and terrible head , his immense and powerful teeth , his perfect beauty and symmetry throughout ; and I felt that I had won the noblest prize that this wide world could yield to a sportsman . " // The two following nights , he watched at the same spot , attended by one of his Hottentots , and by two dogs , and had fine sport , besides an opportunity of beholding one of the grandest sights that ever tried the nerves of lion-hunting man . Early the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wounding a fourth , which escaped . The natives , many of whom were now following his party , cleared away the greater part of two of these huge creatures in the course of the following day , cutting the meat into strips and drying it for preservation ; the third was left , according to orders , to serve as a bait for lions . It had the desired effect ; an extraordinary congregation of wild animals greeted the eyes of the sportsman as soon as he came to his lurking place . I quickly arranged my blankets , pillow , and guns in the hole , and then lay down to feast my eyes on the interesting sight before me . It was bright moonlight , as clear as I need wish , and within one night of being full moon . There were six large lions , about twelve or fifteen hyamas , and from twenty to thirty jackals , feasting on and around the carcases of the three rhinoceroses . The lions feasted peacefully , but the hy*enas and jackals fought over every mouthful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growling , laughing , screeching , chattering , and howling without any intermission . The hyamas did not seem afraid of the lions , although they always gave way before them ; for I observed that they followed them in the most disrespectful manner , and stood laughing , one or two on either side , when any lions came after their comrades to examine pieces of skin or hones which they were dragging away . I had lain watching this banquet for about three hours , in the strong hope that , when the lions had feasted , they would come and drink . Two black and two white rhinoceroses had made their appearance , but , scared by the smell of the blood , they had made off . " At length the lions seemed satisfied . They all walked about with their heads up , and seemed to be thinking about the water ; and in two minutes one of them turned his face towards me , and came on ; he was immediately followed by a second lion , and in half a minute by the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were all coming to drink right bang in my face , within fifteen yards of me . " I charged the unfortunate , pale , and panting Kleinboy to convert himself into a stone , and knowing , from old spoor , exactly where they would drink , I cocked my left barrel , and placed // myself and gun in position . The six lions came steadily on along the stony ridge , until within sixty yards of me , when they halted for a minute to reconnoitre . One of them stretched out his massive arms on the rock and lay down ; the others then came on , and he rose and brought up the rear . They walked , as I had anticipated , to the old drinking-place , and three of them had put down their heads and were lapping the water loudly , when Kleinboy thought it necessary to shove up his ugly head . I turned my head slowly to rehuke him , and again turning to the lions I found myself discovered . " An old lioness , who seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her head high and her eyes fixed full upon me , she was coming slowly round the corner of the little vley to cultivate further my acquaintance ! This unfortunate coincidence put a stop at once to all further contemplation . I thought , in my haste , that it was perhaps most prudent to shoot this lioness , especially as none of the others had noticed me . I accordingly moved my arm and covered her : she saw me move and halted , exposing a full broadside . I fired ; the ball entered one shoulder and passed out behind the other . She bounded forward with repeated growls , and was followed by her five comrades all enveloped in a cloud of dust ; nor did they stop until they had reached the cover behind me , except one old gentleman , who halted and looked back for a few seconds , when I fired , but the ball went high . I listened anxiously for some sound to denote the approaching end of the lioness ; nor listened in vain . I heard her growling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comrades crossed the vley a little below me , and made towards the rhinoceros . I then slipped Wolf and Boxer on her scent , and , follow . ing them into the cover , I found her lying dead within twenty yards of where the old lion had lain two nights before . This was a fine old lioness , with perfect teeth , and was certainly a noble prize ; but I felt dissatisfied at not having rather shot a lion , which I had most certainly done if my Hottentot had not destroyed my contemplation . " The African elephant , unlike the lion , is gregarious in disposition , and is usually found in herds of considerable numbers . The calves remain for several years in company with their dams , and a troop is formed in this manner which sometimes contains over a hundred individuals . They are hunted chiefly for their tusks , which , in the case of the bull elephant , often attain an extraordinary size . Mr. Gumming boasts of possessin0 a pair , the larger of which measures ten feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy* // three pounds . As the largest ivory is worth from five to six shillings to a pound in the English market , it is evident that the killing of one of these huge creatures is quite a handsome speculation . Even the female elephants have tusks , though they are not so large as those of the male . Our sportsman appears to have reaped a greater profit from hunting the elephant than is usually obtained by the followers of the chase . In the course of his five years ' experience , he " bagged , " to adopt his own phrase , no less than one hundred and five elephants , victims of his own rifle , and conveyed their spoils safe to Grahamstown . He drove a considerable traffic , also , in the way of buying ivory from the natives , the price paid being usually one " Brummagem " musket for a fine pair of tusks . Still , as a very respectable stud of horses were usually sacrificed in each annual expedition , and any number of oxen were lost , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Nimrod probably found that the balance of profit and loss , at the end of his five years ' work , was altogether on the wrong side . When much provoked , or driven to extremities , the elephant will fight desperately , and from his great strength and tenacity of life is apt to be an ugly customer ; but he usually entertains a great dread of man , and a child can put a whole herd to flight by passing a quarter of a mile to windward of them . They act like timid creatures , choosing the thickest and most secluded coverts , in which they remain quiet during the day , and travel at night a considerable distance to their watering places . Our author avers , that when one troop has been attacked , all the other elephants frequenting the district seem to become aware of the fact within a few days , when they all forsake it and migrate to safer grounds . Their food consists of the branches , leaves , and roots of trees , and also of various sorts of bulbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of smell . They consume a great deal of food , and appear quite capricious in selecting it , often breaking down a great number of trees , till the forest appears as if a tornado had passed over it , and yet devouring but little of what they have destroyed . Our author 's favorite mode of hunting them was by pursuing them on horseback , the flower of his stud being usually selected for that purpose , and the heaviest of his rifles , the // bullet being also hardened by pewter . Pushing the horse to his speed , he could usually keep close to the side of the gigantic game , or not far in its rear . Careering over what is usually a very broken and difficult country , at " a killing pace , " the huntsrnan keeps up a running fire upon the huge brute as fast as he can load and discharge his weapon . Occasionally the wounded animal will turn , and " charge " furiously against his pursuer ; but his unwieldy size prevents him from wheeling with quickness ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilful rider , will easily keep out of his way . In this manner , after from six to forty shots have been expended by one who is bold enough to ride up sufficiently near to secure a good aim , and who knows where to place his bullets , the poor elephant usually falls , and renders up his tusks to his captor . Our Nimrod , in one of these exciting chases , usually wore the garb of old Gael , the philibeg barely covering his knees , and with naked legs rode stoutly through thorny coverts , often marking the bushes with his own blood , as well as with that of the elephant . His dress thus offered no impediment to his motions ; and so confident in his prowess did he become , that he would often select the stateliest bull elephant from the herd , and by skilful riding contrive to separate him from his companions , and turn his head towards the camp ; then , firing upon him as rapidly as possible , the exhausted animal generally dropped at a convenient distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoils . Occasionally , for this prey also , the sportsman " watched the water , " and bagged his elephant ; though in this way he ran a greater risk of only wounding the animal and then losing him , as many shots are usually needed to kill . The following extract gives a good idea of the coolness with which Mr. Cumming pursued the sport in the former method . It is also a tolerable specimen of the writer 's descriptive power , a quality in which he falls far short of Captain Harris , though he has enough of it to make his book a very interesting one . " It was a glorious day , with a cloudy sky , and the wind blew fresh off the Southern Ocean . Having ridden some miles in a northerly direction , we crossed the broad and gravelly bed of a periodical river , in which were abundance of holes excavated by // the elephants , containing delicious water . Having pnssed the river , we entered an extensive grove of picturesque cameel-dorn trees , clad in young foliage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a mile beyond this grove , I looked forth upon an extensive hollow , where I beheld for the first time for many days a fine old cock ostrich , which quickly observed us and dashed away to our left . I had ceased to devote my attention to the ostrich , and was straining my eyes in aa opposite direction , when Kleinboy called out to me , " Dar loup de ould carle ; " and turning my eyes to the retreating ostrich , I beheld two first-rate old bull elephants , charging along at their utmost speed within a hundred yards of it . They seemed at first to be in great alarm , but , quickly discovering what it was that had caused their confusion , they at once reduced their pace to a slow and stately walk . This was a fine look-out , the country appeared to be favorable for an attack , and I was followed by Wolf and Bonteberg , both tried and serviceable dogs with elephants . Owing to the pace at which I had been riding , both dogs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attack the elephants immediately , but to follow slowly , holding them in view . " The elephants were proceeding right up the wind , and the distance betwixt us was about five hundred yards . I advanced quietly towards them , and had proceeded about half way , when , casting my eyes to my right , I beheld a whole herd of tearing hull elephants standing thick together on a wooded eminence within three hundred yards of me. these elephants were almost to leeward . Now the correct thing to do was to slay the best in each trooR , which I accomplished in the following manner - I gave the large herd my wind , upon which they instantly tossed their trunks aloft , a moment snuffed the tainted gale , ' and , wheeling about , charged right down wind , crashing through the jungle in dire alarm . My object now was to endeavor to select the finest bull and hunt him to a distance from the other troop , before I should commence to play upon his hide . Stirring my steed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the white variety , and to these the dogs instantly gave chase . I followed in the wake of the retreating elephants , tracing their course by the red dust which they raised and left in clouds behind them . " Presently emerging into an open glade , I came full in sight of the mighty game ; it was a truly glorious sight ; there were nine or ten of them , which were , with one excepti&amp;n , full-groxvn , first-rate bulls , and all of them carried very long , heavy , and perfect tusks . Their first panic being over , they had reduced their // pace to a free , majestic walk , and they followed one leader in a long line , exhibiting an appearance so grand and striking that any description , however brilliant , must fail to convey to the mind of the reader an adequate idea of the reality . Increasing my pace , I shot alongside , at the same time riding well out from the elephants , the better to obtain an inspection of their tusks . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select , for every elephant seemed better than his neighbor ; but , on account of the extraordinary size and beauty of his tusks , I eventually pitched upon a patriarchal bull , which , as is usual with the heaviest , brought up the rear . I presently separated him from his comrades , and endeavored to drive him in a northerly direction . " At length closing with him , I dared him to charge , which he instantly did in fine style , and as he pulled up in his career I yelled to him a note of bold defiance , and , cantering alongside , I again defied him to the combat . It was thus the fight began , and , the ground being still favorable , I opened a sharp fire upon him , and in about a quarter of an hour twelve of my bullets were lodged in his forequarters . He now evinced strong symptoms of approaching dissolution , and stood catching up the dust with the point of his trunk and throwing it in clouds above and around him . At such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on foot , for I have remarked that , although nearly dead , he can muster strength to make a charge with great impetuosity . Being anxious to finish him , I dismounted from my steed , and , availing myself of the cover of a gigantic nwana-tree , whose diameter was not less than ten feet , I ran up within twenty yards , and gave it him sharp right and left behind the shoulder . These two shots wound up the proceeding ; on receiving them he backed stern foremost into the cover , and then walked slowly away . I had loaded my rifle , and was putting on the caps , when I heard him fall over heavily ; but , alas ! the sound was accompanied by a sharp crack , which , I too well knew , denoted the destruction of one of his lovely tusks ; and , on running forward , I found him lying dead , with the tusk , which lay under , snapped through the middle . " The sport with the rhinoceroses and crocodiles being comparatively ignoble , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to an extraordinary story of a fight with a hippopotamus . When Mr. Waterton , the Yorkshire naturalist , was in South America , he had an encounter with an enormous cayman , or crocodile , his account of which afforded great amusement to Sidney Smith . He actually mounted // the unwounded animal in his native element , after the hook bad been fastened in his jaws , and using his fore-legs as a bridle , in spite of all his fiounderings , fairly rode him ashore . " Should it be asked how I managed to keep my seat , I would answer - I hunted some years with Lord Darlington 's fox hounds . " Mr. Waterton must hide his diminished head his great rival , Mr. Cumming , made himself the rudder of a live hippopotamus , a monster six times as big as a crocodile , and skilfully steered her to the bank , without the aid of hook , rope , or six stout natives . Among all the illustrations of John Bull 's love of daring sport , the preference must surely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and fortune , swimming a river in Africa by clinging tightly to the rump of a live hippopotamus . " On the 18th , a dense mist hung over the river all the morning . Ordering the wagons to follow in an hour , I rode ahead to seek the sea-cow of the previous night , but after a long search I gave it up as a had job , and , kindling a fire to warm myself , I awaited the wagons , which presently came up . Here I halted for two hours , and then once more rode ahead to seek hippopotami . The river became more promising for sea-cow . At every turn there occurred deep , still pools , with occasional sandy islands densely clad with lofty reeds , and with banks covered with reeds to a breadth of thirty yards . Above and beyond these reeds stood trees of immense age and gigantic size , beneath which grew a long and very rank description of gras delights to pasture . s on which the sea-cow " I soon found fresh spoor , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going down , and as I entered a dense reed cover , I came upon the fresh lairs of four hippopotami . They had been lying sleeping on the margin of the river , and , on hearing me come crackling through the reeds , had plunged into the deep water . I at once ascertained that they were newly started , for the froth and bubbles were still on the spot where they had plunged in . Next moment I heard them blowing a little way down the river . I then headed them , and , with considerable difficulty , owing to the cover and the reeds , I at length came right down above where they were standing . It was a broad part of the river , with a sandy bottom , and the water came half-way up their sides . There were foi*r of them , three cows and an old bull ; they stood in the middle of the river , and , though alarmed , did not appear aware of the extent of the impending danger . // " I took the sea-cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a mortal wound , knocking loose a great plate on the top of her skull . She at once commenced plunging round and round , and then occasionally remained still , sitting for a few minutes on the same spot . On hearing the report of my rifle two of the others took up stream , and the fourth dashed down the river ; they trotted along , like oxen , at a smart pace , as long as the water was shallow . I was now in a state of very great anxiety about my wounded sea-cow , for I feared that she would get down into deep water , and be lost like the last one ; her struggles were still carrying her down stream , and the water was becoming deeper . To settle the matter I accordingly fired a second shot from the bank , which , entering the roof of her skull , passed out through her eye ; she then kept continually splashing round and round in a circle in the middle of the river . I had great fears of the crocodiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack me . My anxiety to secure her , however , overcame all hesitation ; so , divesting myself of my leathers , and armed with a sharp knife , I dashed into the water , which at first took me up to my arm-pits , but in the middle was shallower . " As I appronched Behemoth , her eye looked very wicked . I halted for a moment , ready to dive under the water if she attacked me , but she was stunned , and did not know what she was doing ; so , running in upon her , and seizing her short tail , I attempted to incline her course to land . It was extraordinary what enormous strength she still had in the water . I could not guide her in the slightest , and she continued to splash , and plunge , and blow , and make her circular course , carrying me along with her as if I was a fly on her tail . Finding her tail gave me but a poor hold , as the only means of securing my prey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep parallel incisions through the skin on her rump , and lifting this skin from the flesh , so that I could get in my two hands , I made use of this as a handle ; and after some desperate hard work , sometimes pushing and sometimes pulling , the sea-cow continuing her circular course all the time , and I holding on at her rump like grim Death , eventually I succeeded in bringing this gigantic and most powerful animal to the bank . Here the Bushman quickly brought me a stout buffalo-rheim from my horse 's neck , which I passed through the opening in the thick skin , and moored Behemoth to a tree . I then took my rifle and sent a ball through the centre of her head , and ' she was numbered with the dead . " After going through adventures so perilous , we are not surprised to learn that Mr. Gumming 's external appearance , when he returned to the settlements after more than a year 's // absence , was enough to frighten the children of the Dutch Boors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring on the wagon , while I walked ahead under a most terrific sun to the farm where I had purchased Prince and Bonteberg , while en route to the far intenor . My costume consisted of a dilapidated wide-awake hat , which had run the gauntlet with many a grove of wait-a-hits , a dusty-looking ragged shirt , and a pair of still more raggedlooking canvas trousers , which were , moreover , amputated above the knee , while my face was adorned with a shaggy red beard , which tout ensemble imparted to me the appearance of one escaped from Bedlam . As I drew near the farm its inmates took fright at my wild appearance , and two of the Boers , timidly projecting their heads from the half-closed door , loudly shouted to me to lay down my gun . I however pretended not to understand , and advancing boldly I wished them good morning . One of these was the owner of the farm , and the man from whom I had bought the dogs , yet nevertheless he failed to recognize me . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon me as a dangerous character ; but , commiserating the transparent texture of my continuations , he offered to lend me a pair of leather crackers ? Declining the proffered apparel , I entered the house without ceremony , and having come to an anchor I requested some milk . Here I was immediately recognized by the children as de carle wha heb vor Bonteberg haquoch , ' namely , the man that bought Bonteberg " As already intimated , we do not learn much about South Africa , from Mr. Cumming 's volumes except in relation to the objects of his peculiar pursuit . The aspect of the country , however , as it appears from his accounts , is far more picturesque and smiling , and better adapted to the wants of civilized man , than one would expect of a land that is the home of so many ferocious animals , and of men who are but little higher in the scale of being than the brutes . Luxuriant grassy plains and well-watered valleys , noble streams and forests of magnificent trees , among which are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where immense herds of antelopes graze , and birds of beautiful plumage resort in vast flocks , seem to afford as tempting a habitation for civilized man as can be found in any other quarter of the globe . There are deserts and waterless plains , but they do not cover the whole face of the country . There is enough of cultivable ground to support a dense population , 33 * // and no property of the climate seems to forbid the colonizing of this great region by white men . The wild tenants of the country , whether brutes or blacks , would slowly retreat before them , or acknowledge the taming influence of their arts and arms , as they have already done in the immediate neighborhood of the colonists of the Cape . The missionaries are here the pioneers and heralds of civilization ; beyond the farthest limits of the settlements they have made their homes , and the example of their way of life seems to have had more effect than their preaching upon the hearts of their converts . The pure doctrines of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savages , until they have virtually ceased to he savages , or have submitted in some degree to the humanizing effects of civilized life . A missionary establishment , forming an oasis in the wilderness , with its cultivated fields , domesticated animals , and other means of comfort and securities against famine , is the most efficient means of disseminating the bread of life among the wild denizens of the forest . Such establishments are certainly doing a good work in South Africa . The most remarkable natural object which attracted Mr. Cuirnning 's attention was the gigantic nwana tree , which towers over the rest of the forest as a castle does over the hamlet at its base . They stand singly , or in rows , always at considerable distances from each other , as if disposed by art ; and from their wonderful size and height , they appear like interlopers on the ground they occupy . In the Bamangwato country , the average circumference of these trees does not exceed thirty or forty feet ; but farther to the north , on the banks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured from sixty to a hundred feet in circumference , and maintained this thickness to the height of nearly thirty feet , where they diverge into numerous branches , which go off nearly horizontally from the trunk . The wood is soft and unfit for use ; the leaf in shape resembles that of the sycamore , and the fruit is a nut about as big as a swan 's egg . We take leave of this book with tbanks to the author for much entertainment and some instruction . Some of his stories reach the limits of credihility , but we find no reason to doubt their substantial truth . We hope , in any future // expeditions which he may undertake , that he will collect more ahundant materials , and keep more copious notes . When he hunts in a region that has seldom , if ever , heen visited hy civilized man , the public have a right to expect something more of him than a mere list of the animals which he has killed , and the perils which he encountered in their pursuit .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
