said , " How can he get wisdom that holdeth the plough and that glorieth in the goad that driveth oxen , and is occupied in their labors , and whose talk is of bullocks l " After a fiw moments ' pause , he added , " I do not behove that passa* , e is in any of the canonical books ; it ddes not sound canonical ; it certainly is not canonical . " Mr. Webster was right . The words occur in the thirtyeighth chapter of Ecciesiasticus , as the writer was amused to find on his return . From time to time , on meeting his rural neighbors , he would stop to talk over with them the subjects of agriculture in which they bad a common interest ; and it was pleasant to witness the kindly and affeetbaate intercourse between him whose fame filled the world , and the homely neighbors and friends who , " Along the cool , sequestered vale of life , Had kept the noiseless tenor of their way . " To one who anxiously inquired after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for much . My strength is nearly gone . I am no match for you , now . I am scarcely a match for your grandson yonder . " To the question , whether the love of Nature grew stronger in him with the progress of time , he answered , " Yes , undoubtedly . The man who has not abandoned himself to sensuality feels , as ) ears advance and old age comes on , a greater love of mother Earth , a greater willingness , and even desire to return to her bosom , and mingle again with this universal fiame of things from which he sprang . " As he spoke these words , with slow and solemn tone , he seemed to look upon the face of nature , as upon the face of a living being , to whom he was bound by the ties of a conscious friendship and immortal love ; and the soft wind , breathing with a warmth like s miner through the unchanged leaves of the neighboring trees , whispered an audible answer to the voice and look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health from these scenes and these pursuits ; a constitution naturally feeble had grown into heroic proportions and gigantic strength , as he had walked and worked in the intervals of public business , beneath the open sky , and bad " taken this heavenly bath , the air , without measure and without stint . " Stopping at the brow of the hill , where lies the old burying ground , occupied by the graves of the early Pilgrim fami lies of Marshfield , he gazed thoughtfully on the spot where his own tomb and the monuments of his dccc sed kindred stand , and remarked that " he disliked to have the grave surrounded by circumstances of melancholy : he wished a quiet spot , not likely to be disturbed by the noise and tumult of the world , with a few deciduous trees . Such a spot is this : the clatter of railroads and the bustle of business are not likely to break the silence here ; and here I shall lie , when my time shall come , perhaps at no distant day . " Descending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and entered the upper road that runs along the hills overlooking the estate and bounding it on the west . From this road the prospect is one of the softest and most varied beauty , and lies outspread , with all its points clearly in view , and as sharply outlined as a welldrawn picture . It has a bright and sunny aspect , being shielded from the keen and freezin northern winds by ranges of hills on the north and west , and tempered by the breezes of the sea into an oceanic climate . The surface of the soil is moulded into gentle undulations , whose sloping sides are covered with trees and orchards , or smooth and sweeping lawns . Nearly in the centre , on a*knoll or upland of moderate height , and rounded on every side by gracefully curving surfaces and lines of beauty , stands the house  --  the ancient mansion of the Thomases , the fh'st owners , with such additions as the tastes or wants of Mr. Webster have suggested , but all in keeping with the home-like and substantial character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elegant library room , designed by the skilful hand of his loved and lamented daughter Julia . The ground descends from the house , on the north to the shore of a miniature lake , on the opposite side of which runs a thick , semi-circular belt of trees planted wholly by Mr. Webster . Further up swells the highland , bare and bleak , where the Pilgrim sleepers lie , in the deep repose of Nature , unbroken save by the song of birds , the murmur of the winds , and the solemn voice of the neighboring ocean , speaking eternally from its mysterious depths . Lookitig towards the south , the eye dwells on other hills of various slopes , partly covered with trees , and a wooded headland , jutting into the sea . The low grounds , or marshes , come within a few rods of the house , and are frequently // overflowed : oy the tides ; and over them gleams a distant view of the sea . Through these scenes of ever-changing beautyscenes that by themselves would fill the heart with unspeakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that the wild charms of Nature have been UnfAded and completed by the skill and taste of one whose genius and eloquence have surpassed all Greek and Roman fame , and made . the spot on which he delighted to repose , from the toils of the forum , the senate , and the cabinet , as classical as the Tusculan villa of Cicero-through these scenes passed the great statesman and his guest , and then returned to the house , after a drive of three hours . His conversation was deeply interesting throughout-mostly serious , earnest , sometimes pathetic , sometimes lightened with playful touches of humor , always full of kindness and gentleness . His serious thoughts naturally clothed themselves in sublime expressions , in language radiant with poetical but unaffected beauty , suggested by the surrounding objects , or by the themes that spontaneously sprang up in a conversation of three memorable hours . Moral , literary , religious topics were touched upon , but politics not at all . To the question what had been the studies by which his style was formed , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student in college , I delivered a fourth of July oration . My friends thought so well of it that they requested a copy for the press . It was printed , and I have a copy of it now  --  the only copy in existence . ( In this he was mistaken . ) Joseph Dennie , a writer of great reputation at that time , wrote a review in a literary paper which he then edited . He praised parts of the oration as vigorous and eloquent ; but other parts he criticised severely , and said they were mere emptinesses . I thought his criticism was just ; and I resolved that whatever else should be said of my style , from that time forth there should be no emptiness in it . I read such English authors as fell in my way-particularly Addisonwith great care . Besides , I remembered that I had my bread to earn by addressing the understanding of common men-by convincing juries  --  and that I must use language perfectly intelligible to them . You will therefore find , in my speeches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nofierifacias ; and that is the secret of my style , *f I ha*a any . " He spoke of Kossuth 's eloquence , with admiration of its beauty and ingenuity . He thought " his genius wonderful , and his resources extraordinary , but that he was rather an enthusiast , possessed of the idea that he was bora with a mission to fulfil , than a statesman ; that his political ideas were not well defined , nor fixed , nor consistent ; that he was doubtless a sincere lover of his country , but was a poet , rather than a sound reasoner on affairs of state and the condition of the world . " He stopped at a farm-house near his estate , and calling the farmer to the door , said , " Well , Mr. A. , you are engaged to work for Fletcher to-day , I hear . " *Yes , sir . " " That 's right ; now , do you come over to my house , take my gun , and go out and shoot some of the plovers I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay you for the day 's work , and I will pay you for the birds . " Such pleasantries seasoned his salutations to all the rural neighbors whom he chanced to meet . In this case the man smiled , complied at once with the request , and the plovers appeared on the breakfast table the next morning . At the close of the drive , Mr. Webster sat some time in the library . He had recently been studying the work of Cicero , Be Natura Deorum ; and taking the volume from the shelf , he read aloud two or three pages , in which one of the persons in the dialogue discourses most eloquently on the Divine Being , and in refutation of the Epicurean philosophy . The deep feeling and the earnest tone with which he read the harmonious Latin sentences of the great Roman , gave the fullest meaning to those immortal speculations ; and recommending the passage to the careful study of his guest , he closed the volume and retired . In4 subsequent conversation , Mr. Webster spoke of his love of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fragments of time snatched from his other and absorbing pursuits . He had watched the progress of physical science , and mastered the great . results which have distinguished the investigation of the present . age . His knowledge of Geology was extensive and exact . He had studied the principal works upon this science on journeys made for recreation through interesting geological regions ; and many years before , he said , he had employed a learned geologist // to make a collection of specimens , and to arrange them on shelves , in the order of the successive layers in the crust of the earth , that while he read at home he might see with his own eyes the order and arrangements of nature . He had given much attention to Physical Geography , and its relation to the history of man , and to the distribution of the vegetable and animal kingdoms over the face of the earth . Among the books which had occupied his thoughts during the last year of his life , Humboldt 's Cosmos held a prominent place . He had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted passages from it with expressions of admiration for their scientific precision and poetic beauty ; and his general remarks upon the plan , substance , and details of the work showed that he understood it well , and fully appreciated its grandeur as an illustrious monument of a long and splendid scientific career . He mentioned with regret that he had so seldom enjoyed , for any length of time , the society of literary and scientific men . " I have kept very bad company , " he exclaimed , with a merry laugh . " I have lived among lawyers , and judges , and jurymen , and politicians , when I should have lived with nature , and in the company of the students of nature . " With Ichthyology he had not only a sporting , but a scientific acquaintance . His observation of the habits of the fishes in our streams and along our shores was wonderfully minute and accurate . One of the projected occupations of the leisure which he seemed about to enjoy , was to write a book embodying his personal observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last conversation the present writer had the honor of holding with him , he commissioned him to propound certain questions to Professor Agassiz , whose classical work on fresh-water fishes he had recently examined , on some of the facts and phenomena of ichthyology that had fallen under his notice , and of which he desired to obtain a scientific explanation . Yet he seemed to have an inward consciousness that his days were drawing to their conclusion . In speaking of plans for the future he invariably added , " if my life is spared ; " and once , when he was urged to dictate an autobiography , he replied , " My friends have in their possession all the facts of my life which will be of any consequence to the public to know ; but perhaps , if God spares my life three or four years longer , I may do it . " Days and weeks passed on amidst the dignified pursuits that graced the hours of suffering passed by the illustrious statesman of Marshfield . Bat the strength of that heroic form was undermined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that secluded spot passed unheeded by . The drives over the hills and along the loudresounding sea , which he loved so much , entirely ceased . Solemn thoughts shut from his mind the inferior topics of the fleeting hour . The great and awful themes of the future , now visibly opening before himthemes on which he had always employed his profoundest meditations-filled the hours won from the lassitude of illness , or from the public duties which , so long as life remained , nothing could make him forget or neglect . Literature , which had been the consolation of his laborious days , shared his thoughts in illness with the sure testimony of the Word of God . The days went by , thus nobly occupied by the illustrious invalid . The body grew weaker , but the mind shone with undiminished splendor . The respectful sym* pathies of the country surrounded him in his hours of illness , and the prayers of good men went up to Heaven for his speedy restoration . It was , however , written in the inscrutable decrees of God that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his work was completed ,  --  but the work of such a man is never completed while life remains ;  --  and that this heavy bereavementshould fall upon the American peo. ple while hope and expectation were high that a few weeks of repose , and the invigorating breath of sea and land at Marshfield , would carry him safely through the annual attack under which he was supposed to be suffering , and send him back restQred to health , his heart strengthened for another season of strenuous toil in the service of his country at Washington , ominous hints were suddenly dropped that the great Secretary was struggling in a doubtful conflict with an enemy to whom all men must , sooner or later , lay down their arms . From that moment , Marshfield became the centre of anxious thoughts and dark forebodings to an agitated public . Never did the people of a dying king watch with such solicitude for the daily bulletins of the condition of a beloved sovereign , or manifest // qwq // 486 Daniel Webster . snirit kindred to its beauties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rocky caverns the deep-voiced neighboring ocean ISpeaks , and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest . " The scene changes . The evening before the day appointed for Mr. Webster 's burial , a few friends , desirous to share in the sad rites , arrive in Marshfield . It is a night of singular beauty . The sky is clear ; the stars look softly down upon the silent earth ; the air is pure and warm . An evening stroll over the Marshfield farm is proposed , and eagerly acceded to . The friends , in quiet sadness , wend their way across the fields and over the uplands , conversing in low tones of the great departed ; for they loved him in life , and they mourn him in death . They stand by the great weeping elm , a few weeks since weighed down with its leafy garniture , now sprenUing its bare and desolate arms against the sky , as if it had thrown aside its verdurous honors , because its lord could no longer enjoy their sheltering coolness . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which alone breaks the death-like stillness of the night . They wander slowly towards the sea , and then ascend the mount of burial ; they pause reverently before the tomb , the stone of which is already uncovered to receive the sacred treasure of the morrow . They retrace their steps slowly , noting each object under the light of the moon , which seems like a spiritual presence , and harmonizes into the softest beauty all the objects in the silver-veiled landscape . Round the mansion which death has entered and taken into his possession , reigns a solemn and majestic repose . The spirit of the dead tenant still seems to linger about it ; itis still his ; that form so majestical lies in yonder room , composed and stately in death , beneath the unutterable beauty of this midnight sky . The reverent company are permitted to enter , and behold once more those kingly lineaments , so soon to vanish from the sight of man . There he lies , " so like the king that was . " " Such was the very armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debate , he smote the foes of the country 's laws . There he lies , with the habits he wore in life ; with nothing of death , save its sacred and awful stillness ; his face thin , with thought , and age , and illness , but not the ghastliness of dissolution ; his lip slightly retracted , as it had been seen a thousand times at the close of a memorable utterance , but it shall change no more , obedient to the movement of the mind ; his arms folded upon his breast , as if he had fallen into a peaceful sleep , looking up to heaven . Around were the books he had studied ; on the walls , at the side of the fire-place , in shadows thrown by the single wax-candle that lighted the room , the portraits of Mr. Webster and Lord Ashburton , painted in commemoration of the Treaty of Washington , that great work of Christian diplomacy , that withheld two mighty kindred nations from rushing into a fratricidal war . In that scene , and that hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one can hardly believe the spirit is gone for ever from the noble form and features they look down upon . There he lies , just above the spot where he sat five weeks before , and read aloud the speculations of Cicero on the Immortality of the Soul . He has solved the question which exercised the mind of the great Roman . *Yhat if those cold and silent lips should open now , and say to the awe-struck visitor : " Yes ! Cicero was right ; there is no more doubt , no more perplexity . " Ah l the revelations of Christianity settled that doubt many centuries since ; and those lips , now so voiceless , a few days ago eloquently proclaimed the trust and consolation of the Christian Faith . There is no need of a voice from the dead . Farewell , illustrious statesman . To-morrow , thous*nds will take their last look . Neighbors of many years will crowd these spaces , to gaze on the face of him whom they have so long known and venerated . From a distance will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , counsellors , to follow him once more , and to take leave of him at the tomb , where counsel is no longer held , save with darkness and silence . Farewell then , here and now ; in the presence of these familiar objectspictures , busts , books ; under this arched ceiling , traced by the hand of a daughter now resting in yonder churchyard ,  --  here , where so much of intellectual toil has been achieved ; where so much of genial converse has been enjoyed ; where exuberant wit has played with the profoundest thought ; where great authors of classical antiquity have fed // the eager mind of a greater than they ; where high questions of diplomacy have been solved , and treaties have been made ; where prayer has ascended to God from the great heart of the head of the household , surrounded by his family ; where , more solemn still , he lies surrounded by all these memories , the last time , for ever ! It is hard to say farewell ; but of all words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexoi'able doom is laid upon all of mortal birth to speak it , in anguish of heart . And the visitors pass out , musing mournfully on all they have seen , and felt , and thought , during that half hour in the august presence of the illustrious dead . The funeral of Mr. Webster was in all respects according to his character and wishes . There was no pomp or parade of any kind . Bnt the natural expression of the feelings of the people could not be restrained . Many persons had arrived the night before . At sunrise , a flag draped in mourning was raised on a staff set up many years ago by Mi ' . Abbott Lawrence , on a neighboring eminence , which overlooks the mansion and the estate . The sun rose , partially obscured by a cloud , as if in sympathy with the sad solemnities of the day ; and so it continued . Yet there was something beautiful and touching in the softness and quiet of air and sky . On some of the clustering trees , the manycolored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf had fallen . It seemed like an autumnal Sabbath morning . Soon the people began to assemble . From nine to twelve o'clock , the road that runs along the ridge of the hills on the west , and is visible from the house nearly a mile , was filled with an almost unbroken line of carriages , of every description , bringing from far and iiear the multitudes of citizens anxious to honor the memory of the great statesman , whom they should now behold for the last time in this world . Across the field came pouring other multitudes from the neighboring farms and villages ; and up from the sea ascended those who had arrived by yacht or steamer ; all tending towards the centre of interest , the silver-leafed poplar , under which lay all that was mortal of Daniel Webster . The lawn was covered by the gathering crowd , silently and respectfully passing by the spot , and gazing upon the features of their great countryman . Many had even climbed among the branches of the elm and the poplar , and sat mournfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hy the village clergyman , the Rev. Mr. Alden , were singularly appropriate . The selections from the Scriptures , the simple and touching address , the fervent prayer , were all in perfect harmony with the character of the man whom they commemorated . The oldest of Mr. Webster 's rural neighbors were , with great propriety of feel - ing , chosen to lead the procession , and accompany the body to the bnrying place ; and then , next to the relatives of the deceased , the people fell into order , and the vast procession followed down the avenue into the road , and entered the path leading to the burial place , made by Mr. Webster 's order a few days only before his death . And with this solemn following , this immense multitude of loving and mourning countrymen , called thither only by their affection for his memory , the illustrious dust was borne over his domains , and up to that ancient pilgrim burying ' ground ; and after one brief glance at those beloved features , as the body rested at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wending their way across the fields and hills , along the roads , down to the seaside , and left the dwelhng of the departed statesman silent and desolate . " Such honors Ilion to her hero paid , And peaceful slept the mighty Hector 's shade . " From death let us return to his life . He " still lives ; " his example and his works remain ; an example of great and constant patriotism , and works of transcendent power and classic beauty , from which his spirit seems to say , " Non omnis moriar , multaque pars mei Vitabit Libitinam . " These volumes are a *prccious legacy to the American people . Among the most fortunate circumstances of Mr. Webster 's life , is undoubtedly to be enumerated the friendship of Mr. Everett . This gentleman , whose acquaintance with Mr. Webster began in boyhood , nearly half a century ago , whose public life commenced and continued in the closest personal and political relation with him  --  a relation of kindness and affection never for an instant ruffled through all the vicissitudes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fine talent* // his literary taste , to the work of editing the matchless speeches and diplomatic papers of his great leader . This pious duty has been most admirably performed : the trust reposed in Mr. Everett has been executed in a manner that leaves nothing to be desired . The speeches and discourses are carefully revised , and illustrated with explanatory notes , drawn from historical or other sources , so that nothing is wanting to their perfect comprehension . This was a work of the highest consequence ; for Mr. Webster , with a prodigality of genius like that of Shakspeare , had taken little care of his literary fame , except to scatter broadcast over the land his splendid speeches and orations . Many years ago two volumes had been collected ; and more recently one of his friends had published a selection of his diplomatic papers ; but the larger portion of the materials that fill these beautiful volumes were dispersed in pamphlets and newspapers , and many of them could only be found by laborious search through old files and collections . The life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first volume , is drawn partly from preceding biographies , among which are a very elegant one written by Mr. Ticknor many years ago , and the lively sketches by Mr. Marsh ; but we presume the greater portion of it is from Mr. Everett 's personal knowledge and long acquaintance with Mr. Webster . The remarkable narrative is related with singular grace aud beauty ; the facts and incidents are selected with judgment.and arranged with care . In writing the life of a living friend it is a problem of great difficulty and delicacy to strike the right line between the too much of eulogy on the one side , and the too much of caution on the other . It appears to us that Mr. Everett has solved this problem with entire success . The tone of the biography is temperate , and the style exquisitely chaste ; and while the praise is liberal , it is wholly free from overstatement and extravagance . It is no more than a great man , already before his death become historical , is fairly entitled to receive , and the biographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster is gone , a greater fre*dom may be exercised , since no praise " can charm the dull cold ear of death ; " and there must be numerous materials of the highest biographical interest , which could not be used with propriety during his lifetime . We have not space to repeat at much length the particulars of Mr. Webster 's parentage and early life . His family was respectable , but not abounding in this world 's goods . In childhood and early manhood he was disciplined in the hard school of poverty and labor , in the society of a noble-hearted father , and a mother of Roman virtues , both of whom he remembered with the warmest affection to his dying day . He never spoke of them without a softening of the voice and a filling of the eyes . To their virtues and affection , to the strong sense which marked their daily conduct , to the generous spirit of self-sacrifice , which led them to deny themselves the fruits of their labors that their son might enjoy the rich blessing of a liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed how profoundly these manifestations of parental love had sunk into his heart . Ebenezer Webster , the father of Daniel , was a remarkable person . In a recently published letter , Mr. Webster describes him as the handsomest man he ever saw except his brother Ezekiel ; and in his old age , as the most venerable figure he ever beheld . In person he was tall and commanding , his height being more than six feet . He had a complexion as dark as his son 's , a Roman nose and a most piercing black eye . In the war of the Revolution he took an active part . He , with " all his kith and kin , " responded to the resolution of the old Congress of 1776 , and signed the pledge " to oppose the hostile proceedings of the British fleets and armies against the United American Colonies . " In reference to this transaction , Mr. Webster beautifully and eloquently said , in the discourse before the New-York Historical Society , delivered last February : " In the mountainous State of New-Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containiug only a few scattered settlements , was the township of Salisbury . The Merrimac river , forming its eastern boundary , now so pleasant in scenery , and with so much richness and industry on its banks , was then a roaring and foaming stream , seeking its way amid immense forests on either side from the White Mountains to the sea . The settlers in this township were collected , and the promise or pledge proposed by the Continental Congress , of life and fortune , presented to them . All , ' as the record says , freely signed except two . ' " In looking to this record , thus connected *viLh the men of my own birth-place , I confess I was gratified to find who were the signers , and who were the dissenters . Among the former was be , // from whom I am iminedietely descended , with all his brothers , and his whole kith and kin . This is sufficient emblazonry for my arms , enough of heraldry for me . " But he did not rest contented with mere words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was personally engaged in many battles , and continued in active service through the war . At the conclusion of the peace , he returned to his farm in Salisbury . This long military experience had given him a martial bearing and a decisive manner . He had enjoyed but very slender opportunities for even a common-school education . But he was a man of strong natural sense , and even rich intellectual endoxvments . Under more favoring fortunes he would have been scarcely less distinguished than his son : as it was , his personal and intellectual qualities , and the sturdy honesty of his manly character , secured to him a commanding influence over the rural population of that part of the State ; and his name was held in respect throughout that thinly populated region . It was a primitive condition of society , in those times , and in that remote part of the country . The people , living at considerable distances apart , rarely assembled except on Sunday , to hear the news and discuss the political questions of the day . Newspapers seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom to assemble , in the intervals between the morning and evening service , and receive information from those who iepresented them in the General Court , on public affairs . Col. Webster had often been chosen representative from Salisbui-y ; and when the State Convention was summoned to Exeter , to considei- the question of adopting the Constitution of the United States , he was appointed a delegate . The people of the town , and Ccl . Webster with the rest , had some fear of the consequences of establishing a powerful central government ; and in the simplicity of their way of life , thought themselves sufficiently well off without it . On hearing the subject discussed in the Convention at Exeter , his fears entirely vanished ; and when the Convention adjourned , to meet again some months later at Concofl , Col. Webster i-eturned home , strongly in favor of the Constitution . Meeting the people between the services , on the next Sabbath after his return , he gathered them about him , and repeated the aiguments he had heard for and against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote for the Constitution ; but as he supposed their inclinations tended rather the opposite way , he proposed to resign his seat and give them the opportunity of choosing another delegate . They said they would think the matter over for a week ; and at the end of that time they informed him that they had made up their minds to rely on his judgment . Accordingly , when the Convention reassembled at Concord , he resumed his seat , and took an active part in the deliberations . The substance of a brief speech delivered by him in the course of the debates  --  the only speech of his recorded or remembered-has been very recently recovered from oblivion . It was as follows : " GENTLEMEN : I have istened to the arguments for and against the Constitution . I am convinced such a government as that Constitution will establish if adopted  --  a government acting directly on the people of the States-is necessary for the common defense and the general welfare . It is the only government which will enable us to pay off the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which we are hound in honor fully and fairly to discharge . Besides , I have followed the lead of Washington through seven years of war , and I have never been misled . His name is subscribed to this Constitution : he will not mislead us now . I shall vote for its adoption . " This short speech not only shows an accurate appreciation of the necessity of the Constitution , but touches the key-note of that reverence for the name and character of Washington , which has so often been the animating theme of the eloquence of his son . Daniel Webster was not only the defender of the Constitution ; he not only achieved this illustrious title by his own immortal deeds , but he might have claimed it by hereditary right . Col. Webster lived to witness the beneficial operation of the government he had helped to ' establish , and to share the honors which his native State was proud to bestow upon her heroic defenders . After having repeatedly filled the office of State Senator , he was appointed Judge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and held this office until his death in 1800 , having had the satisfaction of listening , on the bench , to the first argument made by his son , some time in the preceding year . The childhood of Daniel Webster , though manifesting no premature intellectual dovelopments , // was marked by solid qualities of character , that early gave promise of future greatness . New-Hampshire was a stern and rugged nurse of virtue . The homely life of the farmer had few indulgences wherewith to pamper the tastes or dwarf the energies of the boy . The daily bread was to be won from a hard soil , under a severe climate , in a mountainous region , by the strenuous toil of the hands . An austere nature , inclement skies , and stern penury , made him conscious of power , by the battles he was forced to wage with them . But he was born of wise and religious parents . Under their humble roof there was self-denying virtue , and the fear of God . Not much human learning was there ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of duty ; there was high consciousness of citizenship , and understanding of the rights of man and the doctrines of republican freedom ; and above all , there was the study of God 's Word , and daily obedience to God 's will . The beauty of holiness dwelt there . The domestic affections dwelt there . Mutual love and mutual helpfulness dwelt there . All the tender charities of life dwelt there in overflowing measure . It was a household where the manly heart found scope and exercise for love and devotion , for faith and hope . It was a household where the loveliness and strength of woman 's nature displayed themselves , in their most beautiful as well as their loftiest exercises . " Justice shines in the lowly cell ; In the homes of poverty , smoke-begrimed , With the sober-minded she loves to dwelL But sh3 turns aside From the rich man 's home with averted eye , The golden-fretted halls of pride Where hands with lucre are foul , and the praise Of counterfeited goodness sways ; And wisely she guides in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . " In a letter written only six years ago , Mr. Webster gives the following affecting account of his father 's determination to afford him the advantage , he had not himself enjoyed , of a liberal education : " Of a hot day in July-it must have been one of the last years of Washington 's administration -I was making hay with my father , just where I now see a remaining elm tree , about the middle of the afternoon . The Hon Abiel Foster , M. C. , who lived in Canterbury , six miles off ; called at the house , and came into the field to see my father . He was a worthy man , college learned , and had been a minster , but was not a person of any considerable natural powers . My father was his friend and supporter . He talked awhile in the field , and went on his way . When he was gone , my father called me to him , and we sat down beneath the elm , on a hay-cock . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a member of Congress ; he goes to Philadelphia and gets six dollars a day , while I toil here . It is because he had an education , which I never had . If I had had his early education , I should have been in Philadelphia in his place . I came near it as it was ; but I missed it , and now I must work here . ' My dear father , ' said I , you shall not work ; brother and I will work for you , and wear our hands out , and you shall rest ; ' and I remember to have cried , and I cry now at the recollection . My child , ' said he , it is of no importance to me ; I now live but mor my children ; I could not give your elder brother the advantages of knowledge , but I can do something for you . Exert yourself ; improve your opportunities-learn , learn ; and when I am gone , you will not need to go through the hardships which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man before my time . ' " The next May he took me to Exeter , to the Phillips Exeter Academy-placed me under the tuition of its excellent preceptor , Dr. Benjamin Abbott , still living . " My father died in April , 1806 . I neither left him nor forsook him . My opening an office at Boscawen was that I might be near him . I closed his eyes in this very house . He died at sixtyseven years of age , after a life of exertion , toil , and exposure  --  a private soldier , an officer , a legislator , a judge-every thing that a man could be , to whom learning never had disclosed her ample page . ' " My*first speech at the bar was made when he was on the bench ; he never heard me a second time . " He had in him what I recollect to have been the character of some of the old Puritans . He was deeply religious , but not sour ; on the contrary , good-humored , facetious , showing , even in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white as alabaster ; gentle , soft , playful , and yet having a heart in him that he seemed to have borrowed from a lion . He could frown ; a frown it was ; but cheerfulness , good-humor , and smiles composed his most usual aspect . " The father was right and wise in this manly , paternal resolxe . It w* high wisdom , as well as affection , that led him to strain his slender means to the utmost , to encumber his farm with debt even , that his son might have the fair opportunities which had been denied to himself . And nobly was he repaid in his lifetime , and gloriously has his memory been enshrined since his death , by the genius which was cherished and unfolded by his generous and foreseeing love , by his strenuous efforts and self-denying devotion . The son , for whom these hardships were endured and these hopes were cherished , made a deep impres // sion wherever he went . At school he was a model of industry , and his teachers never forgot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the earnest scholar , in the brightest days of his renown , forget the obligation he lay under to those who had been the guides of his childhood and youth . Master Tappan , the venerable Dr. Abbott of Exeter Academy-with what glowing enthusiasm and pride did they recall the days when Daniel Webster was their pupil . In college , the same qualities were displayed on a larger scale ; not a duty was neglected , not an exercise left unperformed , or carelessly studied . His mind was exact , methodical , far-reaching , eager for knowledge , seeking truth and culture in every direction ; and so , in college as well as at school , Daniel Webster left the footprints of his progress , left a name of honor and distinction which has been one of the chiefest *rlories of his Alma Mater . As she loved him , and predicted his future triumphs , so he loved her , and repaid her fostering care by vindicating her claims when the radicalism of the day threatened her with ruin . It is a proud recollection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and through her all the universities of the country , on the vantage-ground of the law , impregnable and unassailable . Again , after finishing his college studies , and having commenced the study of the law , how beautiful was the proof of brotherly affection he gave , when he for a time abandoned his profession , and for three hundred and fifty dollars a year taught the town academy at Frieburg , Maine , that his brother Ezekiel might be educated at college as he had been ; and , that the whole of this scanty pittance might be saved for this sacred purpose , gave the evenings of his laborious d. ys to the dull task of copying the records of the county . Little did the great-hearted youth imagine that the village school-house , in which he swayed the rod of power , was thenceforth consecrated in the memories of his countrymen ; that pilgrims would in future times seek it out , and visit its humble precincts with irrepressible emotion ; that the dry book of deeds his hand had transcribed would become instinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by future generations with a love and enthusiasm such as are kindled in the soul when we stand before the shrines and memorials of the most illustrious of the earth ; that the schoolhouse and the volume should become the boast and the chiefest honor of the rural neighborhood where that period of the life of Daniel Webster was passed . But so indeed it is . The consecrating. presence of genius and virtue has transfigured the school-house and surrounded it with imperishable renown ; the consecrating hand of genius and virtue , and home affections , has ipade that book a Scripture to all coming ages . The eminent men with whom his professional novitiate was passed had a like forecast of his future greatness , and lived to see the illustrious reality they had preconceived ; and so , by all good in*uences attended , by all prophetic hopes surrounded , the auspicious youth entered upon the great career of his life . What American does not know that career by heart ? The compeers and rivals with whom he contended at the bar , saw at once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ablest felt they were dealing with their equal , even in his first essays , when he but tried , as it were , his armor . He stood at once in the foremost rank of the profession in his native State ; and when , in 1813 , he took his seat for the first time in the Congress of the United States , and came in contact with the distinguished men who were his political associates or rivals the rest of his life , unknown as he was in the Capitol , he made , by his maiden speech , an impression of power and statesmanship , never afterward forgotten . Through that exhausting and most important session Mr. Webster 's labors were not more remarkable for their variety and extent , than for the broad national views which were disclosed by them . From the beginning he was a man of the country , not of a division of the country ; he was a patriot , not a partisan . There was dignity and decorum in his manner , conciliation and wisdom in his speech , c*ndor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mode of dealing with others ' opinions . Firm in the conscious integrity of his own heart , he never sought to impeach the honor of another . Clear in his own views , wielding a masterly logic in the statement of the*i* , he admitted all the force there was in the arguments of his opponents , and made them even stronger in his own re-st tement. " lie manifested , " says Mr. Everett , " upon his entrance into public life , that variety of knowledge , familiarity with the history and // traditions of the government , and self-possession on the floor , which in most cases are acquired by time and long experience . They gained for him the reputation indicated by the well-known remark of Mr. Lowndes , that the North had not his equal , nor the South his superior . ' " In the next Congress , to which Mr. Webster was rc*lected , he was called , by the conclusion of peace with Great Britain , to handle a different class of subjects from those to which the legislation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his course was alike conspicuous for dignity , ability , knowledge equal to the requirements of every occasion , and eloquence of massive strength , and a beauty superior to any of his contemporaries . In 1816 , Mr. Webster became a citizen of Boston . It is needless to say that he was welcomed to the society of that city where a portion of his professional studies had been pursued , and where he bad been admitted to the Bar on the motion of that distinguished lawyer , Mi* . Gore , with every demonstration of respect and friendship . The distinctions and honors he achieved in this new field are part of the history of the times . His labors in the Convention for revising the Constitution of Massachusetts , in 1821 , were various and most important ; but he resisted the importunity of friends and citizens to reenter the arena of national politics , until longer resistance was in vain , lie was nominated as candidate for Congress in 1822 , and the Committee , headed by Colonel Perkins , who waited upon him to inform him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his part ; and having simply and categorically performed their duty , withdrew . Neither they nor the public would take no for an answer , and so Mr. Webster was forced , by a friendly and ad. miring compulsion , to leave , in a measure , the professional labors to which he looked for the support of his family and for future independence , to engage in the concerns of the national government . He continued a member of the House of Representatives until 1826 , when he was chosen Senator from Massachusetts , in the place of the Hon. Elijah Mills of Northampton , who had recently retired . In this position Mr. Webster continued through the remainder of Mr. Adams 's term , and the administrations of President Jackson and President Van Buren . In 1841 , the accession of General Harrison to the Presidency took place , and Mr. Webster , having declined the Treasury , received the State Department , which he retained after the death of President Harrison , and until 1843 , when , resigning his seat , he remained in private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and continued in it until the death of General Taylor brought Mr. Fillmore into the Presidency , and led to a re-construction of the government . Mr. Webster was again invited to become Secretary of State , and he continued the chief of Mr. Fillmore 's administration until his death , on the 24th of October , the present year . This slight outline of Mr. Webster 's public life is the framework inclosing the great and magnificent picture of his unexampled services to the country . The most brilliant periods of his life were those which embraced his senatorial career , and the two periods of office during which he held the seals of State . his first labors in Congress , in the House of Representatives , gave magnificent promise of what was to come . His speech on the Berlin and Milan decrees , on the Embargo , and on the Bank , established his reputation at a very early age , as a statesman and orator of commanding talent . In 1823 , he delivered his speech on Greece , which rang like a clarion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most eloquent and enlightened defenders of national liberty and the rights of man . His speeches on the Tariff showed him to be a master of the science of political economy ; and his very able but ineffectual speech on the Panama mission , maintained the doctrine of a close relation among the American commonwealths , as a counterpoise to European influence on this continent . It is a curious illustration of the mutability of democratic sentiment , that even this modified intervention in foreig* affairs was severely denounced by the Democratic leaders , and was effectually put down by the self-same party who are now equally vehement in favor of fraternizing with every pretended republican movement throughout the world . But the great occasions on which he iut forth all the splendor of his power were tha " Great Debate , " in which he overthrew Col. Hayne , and scattered his eloquent sophistries into the air ; the second great debate on Nullification , in which he discomfited the eminent South Carolina Senutor , who , after having filled the Vice-L*resi.d.ent 's chair // quarrelled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore the tottering fortunes of State Rights and Disunion doctrine , so rudely shaken by the Northern champion . This conflict was much more like a battle between equals than that with Hayne . Mr. Calhoun was a vastly abler man , and pressed his arguments with infinitely more of logical skill ; but all in vain . The genius of Webster rose with the occasion , and the defeat of the great Nullifier was as signal and disastrous as had been that of his predecessor . Indeed , the whole doctrine on that occasion received its deathblow ; and out of Carolina , and a very small fraction of Carolina , there has since been found none so poor to do it reverence . We can not forbear quoting a passage which will live as long as the English lan-guage : Mr. President , I have thus stated the reasons of my dissent to the doctrines which have been advanced and maintained . I am conscious of having detained you and the Senate much too long . I was drawn into the debate with no previous deliberation , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subject . But it is a subject * which my heart is full , and I have not been illing to suppress the utterance of its spontaneous sentiments . I can not , even now , persuade myself to relinquish it , without expressing once more my leep conviction , that , since it respects nothing less than the Union of the States , it is of most vital and essential importance to the public happiness . I profess , Sir , in my career hitherto , to have kept steadily in view the prosperity and honor of the whole country , and the preservation of our Federal Union . It is to that Union we owe our safety at home , and our consideration and dignity abroad . It is to that Union that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us most proud of our country . That Union we reached only by the discipline of our virtues in the severe school of adversity . It had its origin in the necessities of disordered finance , prostrate commerce , and ruined credit . Under its benign influences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sprang forth with newness of life . Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its blessings ; and although our territory has stretched out wider and wider , and our population spread farther and farther , they have not outrun its protection or its benefits . It has been to us all a copious fountain of national , social , and personal happiness . " I have not allowed myself . Sir , to look beyond the Union , to see what might lie hidden in the dark recess behind . I have not coolly weighed he chances of preserving liberty when the bonds that unite us together shall be broken asunder . I have not accustomed myself to hang over the precipice of disunion , to see whether , with my short sight , I can fathom the depth of the abyss below ; nor could I regard him 85 a safe counsellor in the affairs of this governmcut , whose thoughts should be mainly bent on considering , not how the Union may be best preserved , but how tolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken up and destroyed . While the Union lasts , we have high , exciting , gratifying prospects spread out before us , for us and our children . Beyond that I seek not to penetrate the veil . God grant that in my day , at least , that curtain may not rise ! God grant that on my vision never may be opened what lies behind ! When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time the sun in heaven , may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union ; on States dissevered , discordant , belligerent ; on a land rent with civil feuds , or drenched , it may he , in fraternal blood I Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the republic , now known and honored throughout the earth , still full high advanced , its arms and trophies streaming in their original lustre , not a stripe erased or polluted , nor a single star obscured , bearing for its motto no such miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those other words of delusion and folly , Liberty first and Union afterwards ; ' but every where , spread all over in characters of living light , blazing on all its ample folds , as they float over the sea and over the land , and in every wind under the whole heavens , that other sentiment , dear to every true American heart ,  --  Libei'ty end Union , now and for ever , one and inseparable I " ( Vol . III . pp. 341-2 . ) The debates on the renewal of the Charter of the United States Bank drew from Mr. Webster a series of speeches and arguments , displaying.the most profound knowledge of currency arid the business of the country , and the most cogent logic in the application of principles to the existing condition and wants of the people . But the iron will of President Jackson , and the irresistible influence of the Executive , were proof against knowledge , logic , political economy , and the clearest demonstrations ever addressed to " the reason of men ; and the interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , we are amazed at their convincing power ; and we find it difficult to understand ho**even party spirit , unyielding and unscrupulous as it is , could have resisted them . But at all events , there they stand , an instructive record of Mr. Webster 's genius and profound acquaintance with the practical wants of the times . Perhaps , however , the ablest of all the efforts made by him at this period , was the refutation of the Executive pretensions to represent directly the popular sovereignty , and to administer the Constitution as he understood it ; an idea that no President will be likely again to advance . // Te recall Mr. Webster 's views on this subject , as expressed in his speech at the National Republican Convention at Worcester , deeming them at all times fundamental and essential to the just administration of the Constitution and the laws : In that important document , Sir , upon which it seems to be his fate to stand or to fall before the American people , the veto message , he holds the following language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution , swears that he will support it as he understands it , and not as it is understood by others . ' Mr. President , the general adoption of the sentiments expressed in this sentence would dissolve our government . It would raise every mans private opinions into a standard for his own conduct ; and there certainly is , there can be , no government where every man is to judge for himself of his own rights and his own obligations . Where every one is his own arbiter , force , and not law , is the governing power . He who may judge for himself , and decide for himself , must execute his own decisions ; and this is the law of force . I confess , Sir , it strikes me with astonishment , that so wild , so disorganizing a sentiment should ha uttered by a President of the United States . I should think it must have escaped from its author throu0 h want of reflection , or from the habit of little reflection on such subjects , if I could suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public attention , and of so much national importance , any such extraordinary doctrine could find its w y , through inadvertence , into a formal and solemn public act . Standing as it does , it affirms a proposition which would effectually repeal all constitutiocal and all legal O* ) lL*ations . The Constitution declares , that every public officer in the State governments , as well as iu the general government , shall take an oath to support the Constitution of the United States . This is all . Would it not have cast an air of ridicule on the whole provision , if the Constitution had gone on to add the words , as he understands it ? ' What could come nearer to a solemn farce than to hind a man by oath , and still leave him to be his own interpreter of his own obligation ? Sir , those who are to execute the laws have no more a license to construe them for themselves than those whose only duty is to obey them . Public officers are bound to support the Constitution ; private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more indul , , ence granted to the public officer to support the Constitution only as he understands it , than to a private citizen to obey it only as he understands it ; and what is true of the Constitution , in this iespect , is equally true of any law . Laws are to be executed , and to be obeyed , not as individuals may interpret them , but according to public authoritative interpretation and adjudication . The sentiiseent of the message would abrogate the oh . ligation of the whole criminal code . If every man is to judge of the Constitution and the laws for himself , if he is to obey and support them only as he may say he understands thorn , a revolution , I think , would take place in the administration of justice ; and discussions about the law of treason , murder , and arson should he addressed , not to the judicial bench , but to those who might stand charged with such offenses . The object of discussion should be , if we run out this notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how lie ought to understand the law . " Mr. President , how is it possible that a sentiment so wild , and so dangerous , so encouraging to all who feel a desire to oppose the laws , and to impair the Constitution , should have been uttered by the President of the United States at this eventful and critical moment ? Are we not threatened with dissolution of the Union ? Are we not told that the laws of the government shall be openly and directly resisted ? Is not the whole country looking , with the utmost anxiety , to what may be be the result of these threatened coorses ? And at this very moment , so full of peril to the State , the chief magistrate puts forth opinions and sentiments , as truly subversive of all government , as absolutely in conflict with the authority of the Constitution , as the wildest theries of nullification . Mr. President , I have very little regard for the law or the lo*ic of nullification . But there is not an individual in its ranks capable of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the principles of the veto message , caniiot defend all that nullification has ever threatened . " To make this assertion good , Sir , let us see how the case stands . The Legislature of South Carolina , it is said , will nullify the late revenue or tariff law , because they say it is not warranted by the Constitution of the United States , as they understand the constitution . They , as well as the President of the United States , have sworn to suppoit the Constitution . Both he and they have taken the same oath , in the same words . Now , Sir , since he claims the right to interpret the Constitution as he pleases , how can he deny the same right to them ? Is his oath less sti-ingent than theirs ? Has he a prerogative of dispensation which they do not possess ? How can lie answer them when they tell him that the revenue laws are unconstitutional , as they understand the constitution , and that therefore they will nullify them ? Will he reply to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that precedent has settled the question , if it was ever doubtful ? They will answer him in his own words in the veto message , that , in such a case , the precedent is not biiiding . Will he say to them that the revenue law is a law of Congress , which mus*be executed until it shall be declared void ? They will answer him that , in other cases , lie has himself refused to execute laws of Congress which had not been declared void , hut which had been , on the contrary , declared valid . Will he urge the force of judicial decisions ? They will answer , that he himself does not admit the binding obligation of such decisions . Sir , the President of the United States is of opinion , that an individual called on to execute a law , may himself judge of its constitutional validity . Does nullification teach any thing more revolutionary than that I The President is of opinion that judicial interpretations of the Constitution and the laws do not bind the consciences , and ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nullification at all moi-e dis // organizing than that ? The President is of opinion that every officer is bound to support the Constitution only according to what ought to be , in his private opinion , its construction . Has nullification , in its wildest flight , ever reached to an extravagance like that ? No , Sir , never . The doctrine of nullification , in my judgment a most false , dangerous , and revolutionary doctrine , is this , that the State , or a State , may declare the extent of the obligations which its citizens are under to the United States ; in other words , that a State , by State laws and State judicatures , may conclusively construe the Constitution for its own citizens . But that every individual may construe it for himself is a refinement on the theory of resistance to constitutional power , a sublimation of the right of being disloyal to the Union , a free charter for the elevation of private opinion above the authority of the fundamental law of the State , such as was never presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even by nullification itself . Its first appearance is in the veto messa0e . Melancholy , lamentable , indeed , Sir , is our condition , when , at a moment of serious danger and wide-spread alarm , such sentiments are found to proceed from the chief magistrate of the government . Sir , I can not feel that the Constitution is safe in such hands . I can not feel that the present administration is its fit and proper guardian . " ( Vol . I. , pp. 270-43 . ) We select a passage or two from the speech on the Presidential Protest : such governments ' establish restraint , as well on the power of government itself as on that of individuals . If we will abolish the distinction of branches , and have but one branch ; if we will abolish jury trials , and leave all to the judge ; if we will then ordain that the legislator shall himself be that judge ; and if we will place the executive power in the same hands , we may readily simplify government . We may easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pure despot ism . But a separation of departments , so far as practicable , and the preservation of clear lines of division between them , is the fundamental idea in the creation of all our constitutions ; and , doubtless , the continuance of regulated liberty depends on maintaining these boundaries . ' ( Vol. 1V , p. 122 . ) A few pages preceding the above extract , occurs one of the most celebr* ted passages of Mr. Webster 's eloquence . The poetical image with which it concludes occurred to Mr. Webster , as we have heard him say , while he was one roormug witnessing the parade at sunrise in Quebec . Mr. Edward Curtis , of New-York , was standing by his side , and when the drum-beat , Mr. Webster turned to him , and gave utterance to the idea which several years afterwards he clothed in the transcendently be*mutiful language that follows : qwq sessions and military post* , whose morning drumbeat , following the sun , and keeping company with the hours , circles the earth with one continuous and unbroken strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IV. , pp. 109-10 . ) One more brief extract from this speech : " Mr. President , the contest , for ages , has been to rescue Liberty from the grasp of executive power . Whoever has engaged in her sacred cause , from the days of the downfall of those great aristocracies which had stood between the king and the people to the time of our own independence , has struggled for the accomplishment of that single object . On the long list of the champions of human freedom , there is not one name dimmed by thereproach of advocating the extension of executive authority ; on the contrary , the uniform and steady purpose of all such champions has been to limit and restrain it . To this end the spirit of liberty , growing more and more enlightened and more and more vigorous from age to age , has been battering , for centuries , against the solid butments of the feudal system . To this end , all that could be gained from the imprudence , snatched from the weakness , or wrung from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , secured , and hoarded , as the rich treasures , the very jewels of liberty . To this end , popular and representative right has kept up its warfare against prerogative , with various success ; sometimes writing the history of a whole age in blood , sometimes witnessing the martyrdom of Sidneys and Russells , often baffled and repulsed , but still gaining , on the whole , and holding what it gained with a grasp which nothing hut the complete extinction of its own beiog could compel it to relinquish . At length , the great conquest over executive power , in the leading western states of Europe , has been accomplished . The feudal system , like other stupendous fabrics of past ages , is known only by the rubbish which it has left behind it . Crowned heads have been compelled to submit to the restraints of law and the PEOPLE , with that intelligence and that spirit which make their voice resistless , have been able to say to prerogative , Thus far shalt thou come , and no farther . ' I need hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all which Europe has reached only through such slow and painful steps we sprang at once , by the Declaration of Independence , and by the establishment of free representative governments ; governments borrowing nmre or less from the models of other free states but strengthened , secured , improved in their symmetry , and deepened in their foundation , by those great men of our own country whose names will be as familiar to future times as if they were written on the arch of the sky . " Through all this history of the contest for liberty , executive power has been regarded as a lion which must be caged . So far from being the object of enlightened popular trust , so far from being considered the natural protector of popular i-ight , it has been dreaded , uniformly , always dreaded , as the great source of its danger . " And now , Sir , who is he , so ignorant of the history of liberty , at home and abroad ; who is he , yet dwelling in his contemplations among the principles and dogmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose bosom all original infusion of American spirit has become so entirely evaporated and exhale d , that he shall put into the mouth of the President of the United States the docti-ine that the defense of liberty naturally results to executive power , and is its peculiar duty I Who is he , that , generous and confiding towards power where it is most dangerous , and jealous only of those who can restrain it ; who is lie , that , reversing the order of the state , and upheaving the base , would poise the pyramid of the political system upon its apex ? Who is he , that , overlooking with contempt the guardianship of the representatives of the people , and with equal contempt the higher guardianship of the people themselves-who is he that declares to us , through the President 's lips , that the security for freedom rests in executive authority ? Who is he that belies the blood and lihels the fame of his own ancestors , by declaring that they , with solemnity of form , and force of manner , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty ? Who is he that thus charges them with the insanity , or the recklessness , of putting the lamb beneath the lion 's paw ? No , Sir . No , Sir . Our security is in our watchfulness of executive power . It was the constitution of this department which was infinitely the most difficult part in the great work of creating our pi-esent government . To give to the executive department such power as should make it useful , and yet not such as should render it dangerous ; to make it efficient , independent , and strong , and yet to prevent it from sweeping away every thing by its union of military and civil authority , by the influence of patronage , and office , and favor ,  --  this , indeed , wal difficult . They who had the work to do saw the difficulty , and we see it ; and if we would maintain our system , we shall act wisely to that end , by preserving every restraint and every guard which the Constitution has provided . And when we , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done all that we can do , and all that they can do , it will be well for us and for them , if some popular executive , by the power of patronage and party , and the power , too , of that very popularity , shall not hereafter prove an overmatch for all other brancheM of the government . " ( Vol . IV. , pp. 133-5 . ) But , perhaps , the event in Mr. Webster 's Senatorial career , which has had the most effect upon th' public opinion , and has di-awn upon him the most violent assaults , was the speech of the 7th of March , 1850 , on the Constitution . The slavery agitation , as every one knows , had risen to a point which threatened the stability of the Union . There can ham-dly be a doubt that there was ground for serious apprehension , when the acquisition of such extensive territories from Mexico re-opened the question which had on a former occasion shaken the country to its centre , and of late years had alienated and exasperated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the strongest passions of our age  --  a passion that has reached a morbid development in some of the free States-is an absorbing devotion to the idea of human rights , and the universal brotherhood of the human family . The passion is a noble and generous one : God grant that the aspiration it breathes for universal liberty may , in His good time , become a reality all over the earth . No man has spoken more inspiring words , or done more noble deeds , to bring on that blessed day than Mr. Webster . But the profession of philanthropy is most dangerous not only to the end it aims to accomplish , but to the character of the philanthropist . Seeing its object clearly , conscious of the purity of its motives , and naturally running into excesses of overwrought feeling , it comes by degrees to overlook every consideration that should check its headlong action ; to disregard every obstacle , however formidable and immovable , which lies in the way of the immediate accomplishment of its generous desires . By and by it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selfish interest ; it calls in question the motives of men , however pure their characters and irreproachable their lives , who are restrained by more deliberate judgment from coinciding with its measures or propositions . It becomes fierce and intolerant ; it commits wrongs as violent as those it denounces ; it grows frantic and fanatical , and ends with believing , or seeming to believe , that all the world , except itself , is a mass of corruption , baseness and iniquity . The wron s of slavery are just of that description to move all these philanthropic passions into the intensest activity . It is no subject of wonder or reprtach , that warm-hearted men and even parties have been driven almost to phrensy , as they have contemplated this dark spot on the otherwise bright picture of American liberty ; and we must not judge them too harshly , if they chafe impatiently under the restraints the Constitution lays upon them , seeming to forbid their eager aspirations to right a theoretic wrong . Still , the constitutional restraints are real , and of binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves just and flowing from the deepest sources in the human heart , may overstep the bounds of constitutional action . The danger is great and threatening , that we may sophisticate our understandings , VOL . IX . NO . VI . NEW SERIES . and seek in fine-spun reasoning the means of evading or breaking the guarantees our fathers undoubtedly meant in good faith to establish . No fair-minded man can read the Constitution , together with the history of its formation , without being convinced that , although its framers hoped the time would come when slavery should no longer exist , and the word slavery does not occur in that immortal instrument , yet it was their intention to secure to the slavehoider , so long as the relation of slavery lasted , the means of retaking a fugitive escaping without the owner 's consent into the free States . Another thing is equally clear , that negro slavery in the United States is not a feudal institution , to he dealt with by the feudal law , but is radically a different relation , wholly regulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by constitutional provisions and the legislation of the General Government , so far as the rights of the slaveholder are concerned , to reclaim what the institutions of his own State recognize as property . In one sense , slavery is sectional , to adopt a recently invented phrase ; and in another and limited sense it is national . But if , as has so often been asserted , a man may recover his slave by a suit at common law , or by resorting to the ancient writs which died out with the disappearance of villeinage in England , then we have the Middle Ages back again , and slavery is absolutely and to all intents and purposes a national , and not a sectional institution . If the arguments recently and ably urged upon this subject are sound , this alarming conclusion inevitably follows : that slavery is not a municipal institution at all , is not limited to particular States at all , is not the creature of local legislation at all , is not hemmed in at all by the Constitution , but sweeps over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as universal as the Common Law . This is an extension of the area of slavery with a vengeance . God forbid that any such interpretation-leading to such a comprehensive and monstrous resultshould ever be adopted by any powerful party in the United States .

We are here , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The imagination irresistibly and rapidly draws around us the principal features and the leading characters in the original scene . We cast our eyes abroad on the ocean , and we see where the little bark , with the interesting group upon its deck , made its slow progress to the shore . We look around us , and behold the hills and promontories where the anxious eyes of our fathers first saw the places of habitation and of rest . We feel the cold which benumbed , and listen to the winds which pierced them . Beneath us is the rock , on which New-England received the feet of the Pilgrims . We seem even to behold them , as they struggle with the elements , and , with toilsome efforts , gain the shore . We listen to the chiefs in council ; we see the unexampled exhibition of female fortitude and resignation ; we hear the whisperings of youthful impatience , and we see , what a painter of our own has also represented by his pencil , chilled and shivering childhood , houseless but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's breast , till our own blood almost freezes . The mild dignity of Carver and of Bradford ; the decisive and soldieilike air and manner of Standish ; the devout Brewster ; the enterprising Allerton ; the general firmness and thoughtfulness of the whole band ; their conscious joy for dangers escaped ; their deep solicitude about dangers to come ; their trust in Heaven ; their high religious faith , full of confidence and anticipation ; all of these seem to belong to this place , and to be present upon this occasion , to fill us with reverence and admiration . ( Vol . I. , pp. * , 8 . ) We have dwelt longer than we intended on this point , because we have ourselves been surprised , on reading tile debates of the times , to see how clearly Mr. Webster st.ands acquitted of even an inconsistency . Fairly interpreted , there is not a sentence in the 7th of March speech , inconsistent with any other declaration made by him through his whole life . His disapprobation of the anti-slavery movements of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had been supported in it by the written opinion of Dr. Channing ; his sense of the obligation to execute every provision of the Constitution had been expressed as strongly a hundred times before ; his devotion to the Union had been expressed as strongly a hundred times before . The only topic of the speech on which his sentiments had not been expressed as strongly before , was th. t in which he set forth the anti-slavery tendencies of the men of the Revolution . We have hitherto spoken chiefly of Mr. Webster 's parliamentary career . But there has not been in our day , combined in any one man , such a variety of the foremost distinctions in different fields of intellectual labor . His occasional orations are as excellent in their way as his Senatorial speeches . His genius never fell below the exigencies of the moment His orations at Plymouth , and Bunker Hill , and Washington , are as imperishable models of eloquence as any thing in the language . How beautiful is the following picture of the Pilgrims : His eulogy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Standing in this relation to our ancestors and and pathetic appeals to the deepest feelings of the heart , all the discourses delivered on qwq others by being profoundly moved himself . It was nature , and not artifice , that lent the secret charm to all he said . This is the explanation of what has been recently stated with regard to his forensic speeches : that he never excelled in managing a bad cause . He could not similate a passion he did not feel : all was real with him , or it was nothing . We can not deny ourselves the pleasure of quoting the grand passage on the power of conscience , from the address to the jury , in the trial of the Knapps " The deed was executed with a degree of selfpossession and steadiness equal to the wickedness with which it was planned . The circumstances now clearly in evidence spread out the whole scene before us . Deep sleep had fallen on the destined victim , and on all beneath his roof . A healthful old man , to whom sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held him in their soft but strong embrace . The assassin enters , through the window already prepared , into an unoccupied apartment . With noiseless foot he paces the lonely hall , half li*hted by the moon ; he winds up the ascent of the stairs , and reaches the door of the chamber . Of this he moves the lock , by soft and continued pressure , till it turns on its hinges without noise ; and he enters , and beholds his victim before him . The room is uncommonly open to the admission of light . The face of the innocent sleeper is turned from the murderer , and the beams of the moon , restin* on the gray locks of his aged temple , show him where to strike . The fatal blow is given ! and the victim passes , without a strug*le or a motion , from the repose of sleep to the repose of death ! It is the assassin 's purpose to make sure work ; and he plies the dagger , though it is obvious that life has been destroyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged arm , that he may not fail in his aim at the heart , and replaces it again over the wounds of the poniard ! To finish the picture , he explores the wrist for the pulse ! He feels for it , and ascertains that it beats no longer ! It is accomplished . The deed is done . He retreats , retraces his steps to the window , passes out through it as he came in. and escapes . He has done the murder . No eye has seen him , no ear has heard him . The secret is his own , and it is safe ! " Nh ! gentlemen , that was a dreadful mistake . Such a secret can be safe no where . The whole creation of God has neither nook nor corner where the guilty can bestow it , and say it is safe . Not to speak of that eye which pierces through all dis . guises , and beholds every thin , as in the splendor of noon , such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that murder will out . ' True it is , that Providence hath so ordained , and doth so govern things , that those who break the great law of Heaven by shedding man 's blood , seldom succeed in avoidiuc , discovery . Especially in a case exciting so much attention as this , discovery must come , and will come , sooner or later . A thousand eyes turn at once to explore every man , every thing , every circumstance connected with the time and place ; a thousand ears catch every whisper ; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell on the scene , shedding all their light , and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance into a blaze of discovery . Meantime , the guilty soul can not keep its own secret . It is false to itself ; or rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself . It labors under its guilty possession , and knows not what to do with it . The human heart was not made for the residence of such an inhabitant . It finds itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God or man . A vulture is devouring it , and it can ask no sympathy or assistance , either from heaven or earth . The secret which the murderer possesses soon comes to possess him ; and , like the evil spirits of which we read , it overcomes him , and leads him whitherso ' - ever it wilL He feels it beating at his heart , ristug to his throat , and demanding disclosure . He thinks the whole world sees it in his face , reads it in his eyes , and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts . It has become his master . It betrays his discretion , it breaks down his courage , it conquers his prudence . When suspicions from without begin to embarrass him , and the net of circumstance to entangle him , the fatal secret struggles with still greater violence to burst forth . It must be confessed , it will be confessed ; there is no refuge from confession but suicide , and suicide is confession . " ( Vol . Vi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster 's last speech in Fanenil Hall to his neighbors and friends in Boston , Mr. Webster disclaimed the credit of being a man of letters in the literary sense of the term- " though , " added he playfully , " I sometimes write a letter . " It is true enough that the calls of public *nd professional life withdrew him from the systematic cultivation of literature ; and he was accustomed to lament that the pressure of business had limited his studies to fragmentary portions of time . Technically and professionally speaking , Mr. Webster was not a scholar or a man of science : but where was there a scholar superior to him in all that makes the character of scholarship respectable and dignified l Not much of his life was spent " in the still , air of delightful studies : " but , like Demostheres and Cicero , though his most strenuous labors were in the struggles of the Forum and Senate and Courts of Law , or under the heavy cares of diplomacy and the discussions of the Cabinet , yet in his leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest treasures of the best literature of the world ; and his comprehensive mind was never alienated from the genial pursuits of science and letters .

He trod the earth like a god . His frown was terrible ; but his smile was winning as the opening of a summer morning . His familiar conversation was rich , entertaining , and instructive , beyond that of any other man of his time . He told a story with inimitable dramatic effect , yet never lost his imposing di*nity . No vulgar word , no ambiguous allusion , no scandalous anecdote , no sarcasm upon the absent , no cutting speech upon his ' bitterest enemies , ever broke the charm that held the listener a spell-bound thrall tothe fascination of his talk . But with all natural graces and endowments , these great achievements could never have been accomplished , without unshaken perseverance and unwearied industry . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest particle was precious as golden sands and diamonds , He drew instruction , he disciplined his mind , from every source , and at every moment ; from books , from experience , from life : the lore of sorrow and bereavement had touched and trained his heart- " knowledge by suffering entereth . " Conversation with men , and communion with nature ; the study of human wisdom , and the study of God 's wisdom in the written Word , constantly strengthened his understanding , and chastened his affections . Born and brought up in the healthgiving scenes of the country , he never forgot his rural tastes in the city throng , in the political strife , in the diplomatic circle . How racy and redolent of the soil are his letters to that " true man , " John Taylor , who had charge of his Franklin farm ! Like the giant of old , ever and anon he recruited his exhausted energies , by resting on the bosom of mother Earth . Agriculture , hunting , fishing , and the studies of nature which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intervals of public business ; and these pleasures and pursuits kept alive the habits of manly activity in which his early life was l ) assed . He was always an early riser , until his last illness made him a reluctant prisoner to his bed . Even in the crowded city , or at the Capitol , " The breezy call of incense-breathiug morn " found him up and ready for the work of the day ; and by the time other men were astir , he had done more than the day 's work of a common man . In this way , Nir . Webster made the most of life , and in three or four distinct pursuits did more than many distinguished men have done in any one of them . He was conservative in his ideas and tendencies  --  but only conservative of good . He kept his mind open for the frank reception of new views , and all the real progress of the age . He had no fear of change and reform , provided change and reform were needed by the altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and soul , thoroughly American , while fully sensible to the charms of European civilixation ; in every aspiration of his heart he was republican , while in lofty bearing he was more than equal to the crowned monarch . The haughtiest nobles of England did him reverence , when he visited that country . Mr. Webster fulfilled the precept of Solon , " Grow old learning " y*pasx* &amp;&amp;*rx In old age his mind had all the strength of his early manhood , with greater richness of accumulated knowled* e , and more equable splendor . Retaining the habit which he formed at the commencement of his career of directly dealing with the realities of things , in his later compositions he clothed his conceptions with more of ideal beauty . His genius held , in the evening of his days , the fresh vigor of its morning prime . His capacity for labor , for mastering the complicated details of a great question , arranging them in bicid order , and applying to them the force of a logic more resistless than that of the schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he argued art important case in the Supreme Court of New-Jersey . His style , always chaste and sometimes poetical , in his recent speeches and writings had acquired greater affluence and a more placid beauty . The ideal aspect of human life seemed to open more clearly to his serener vision , and the turmoil and dust of the worldly scene gradually withdrew , and lessened in the vanishing distances of the past . There was a rhythm , a golden poetical coloring , of which his earlier productions gave the prophecy but not the completion . His varied and constantly increasing acquirements , nothing of which was ever lost or forgotten , had been harmonized into forms of solid strength and classical beauty . It was the rich fruit of autumn embosomed in the glowing , many-colored foliage of the ripened year . It was the old story of Homer over again : the Iliad , the sun at his meridian height ; the Odyssey , the same sun in the imperial splendors of his setting . // If we compare Mr. Webster with the great b statesmen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and Cicero and Demosthenes . He had , however , more force and originality than the former , and more varied culture than the latter . To our apprehension , he more resembled Demosthenes than any other modern orator . Dcmosthenes began his career in narrow circumstances ; he nevertheless had the liberal education of a gentleman , but he had to earn his bread by addressing the understandings of common men  --  the Dicasts of the Athenian courts . He overcame the physical weakness of his youth by healthy exercises . He was profoundly versed in the law , and prepared himself by arguing civil cases for his great career as an orator and a statesman . One of his earliest triumphs was a Defense of Vested Rights , strikingly parallel to the Dartmouth College case . On more than one occasion he saved his countrymen , by his wisdom and eloquence , from a foreign war ; he pronounced a eulogy upon those who had died in the service of their country . But the most splendid exhibitions of his genius were the great orations he delivered on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip , and his defense of his policy in the oration on the Crown , which Mr. Everett justly compares to the Reply to Hayne . He traversed the Grecian States , every where addressing admiring multitudes , and Union , Union ! was the burthen of his majestic discourse . But enemies rallied against him . His private life was calumniated ; he was charged with sensuality and licentiousness , with wasteful extravagance , with corruption and bribery , with having been bought by Eastern gold . But he answered his antagonists , and they vanished from the political stage . His days were saddened by the death of a beloved daughter , but he forgot his private woes in the service of his country . At one moment , an inflamed public opinion banished him from the Bema , the scene of his fame ; and , retiring to the sea-shore of the neighboring Agina , he consoled himself by gazing over the blue waters . But his return was a triumph such as never had fallen to the lot of any man before . The whole population poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a magistrate or priest staying behind . " He died soon after , having never been Archon of Athens , though he had controlled its foreign policy for many years . Statues were raised to hi*e memory ; his character was vindicated from the aspersions of his enemies , who live in history only because the immortality of him they slandered has saved their names from oblivion . The purity of his conduct in the administration of public affairs , the ardor of his patriotism , the splendor of his genius , have been only the more conspicuous the more his life and works have been studied ; for every word he ever sp6ke breathed a single-hearted devotion to the interests and glory of his country , and showed him to be a friend of virtue , of honor , and of public decency . His language was grand , yet simple , rich , solemn ; not disdaining ornament , but never seeking it at the sacrifice of sense ; sweet and stately , as welL as forcible . His arrangement of topics was skilful , but natural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was irresistible . It is one of the chiefest glories of republican Athens that her institutions produced such a man ; it is a blot on the history of disunited Greece that she listened to his words , but forgot to act upon his counsels . May the parallel stop short of this crowning circumstance of ruin and disaster@@185030467.txt THE MANCHESTER EXHIBITION . IN a number of the " Illustrated News , " not long since , there was what professed to be a view of Manchester . It represented a thousand tall factory-chimneys rising out of a gray mist , and surmounted by a heavy , drifting cloud of smoke . And in truth a view not very different from this was presented to any one who , standing at the entrance of the Palace of the Exhibition of Art Treastires , turned and looked back before going within . Two miles off lies the body of the great'workshop-city , already stretching its begrimed arms in the direction of the Exhibition . The vast flat expanse of brick walls , diversified by oountless chimneys and occasional steeples , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an enormous warehouse , off ' *rs no single object upon which the eve or the imagination can rest with nleasure . Such a view was neve " to be seen in the world before this century ; a city built merely by trade , built for the home of labor , of machines , and of engines , and for the dwellingpk.ce ( one can not call it the home ) of crowds of human beings , whose value is , fer the most part , estimated according to the development of their machine-like qualities . Beauty is not consulted here . In those places in or near the city , where Nature , reluctant to be driven utterly away , still tries to keep a foothold , she is parched and scorched by the feverish breath of *crrros and furnaces . Standing here , or.e c*ay see the cloud of smoke , which waves in the wind like a pall over the city , slowly moving and settling down upon the land . One may almost hear the roar of the continual fires , the throb of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rattle of the spindles , by which the work of the world is done ; and their noises , blended by the distance into one monotonous sound , seem like the voice of the restless , hard-working , unsettled spirit of gain . Manchester is built and is worked for profit , not for pleasure ; beauty is driven away from her as a thing at variance with practical life ; and even the sky above her and the fields around her yield only at rare moments and for short seasons those precious and gracious shows of beauty which are the free and blessed gift of love to all the world . Smoke , steam , coal-dust , blackened walls , and bare fields lie outside the Exhibition and now let us go within .. The world could show no sharper and more affecting contrast . Outside , all suggests the competitions and struggles of trade , the crowded street , the bustle of the exchange , the cold and dry elements of purely unimaginative life . Inside , all suggests the quietness and composure of solitary and delightful labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , and the frequenting of the springs of poetry . From the present , one is suddenly transferred to the past ; from the near , to the remQte . In place of the blank , black factory wall , there is the low wall of // some Italian Campo Santo , its painted sides more precious than marbles or gold could have made them ; in place of the dull and heavy stone of the Exchange , the glowing mosaics of some southern cathedral ; in place of the factory bell and the rush into the steaming and dirty workroom , the bell of a convent on Fiesole , and the slow walk through its cool cloisters ; in place of the dead files of uniform ugly houses , Venetian palaces , with the water at their base , reflecting the colors which Giorgione and Titian , housepainters at Venice , left upon their stones ; in place of the racket of the street , the quiet greenness of an English lane , or the inaccessible ice and glory of a far-off mountain summit ; in place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burning stretch of the desert with the Sphinx looking out over it century after century ; in place of the shower coming down through the dirty air to wash the dirty roofs , a storm breaking over the sea-shore rocks , or beating down on the broken wreck ; instead of the drabbled calico of the factory girl and her face old before its time , the satins of Vandyck 's beauties , and the fair looks of Sir Peter Lely 's heroines ; instead of Manchester mayors and masters of factories , Tintoret 's noble Venetian counsellors and doges , and Titian 's Shakspearian men . It was a bold thought thus to bring pictures and statues into one great collection at Old Trafford , and to set off the art of the world against the manufactures of Manchester . The Exhibition building was admirably designed for its purpose . Its plan is simple , and not unpleasing , although the proportions , which its object required , were such as to prevent any attempt at grand architectural effect . The general arrangement of the interior is easily understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief entrance leads into a nave , which has on each side an aisle of less height , separated from it by a wall . The wall is broken by two openings , through which is the passage from nave to aisle , or aisle to nave . The nave and aisles end in a transept , and behind the transept are two small saloons , and a large hall or aisle crossing the building transversely and forming its western end . A gallery runs round the transept , and another crosses the nave at its eastern end . This is the general arrangement . The walls of the nave or central hall are occupied by the gallery of British portraits , and between the iron columns that support the roof are set pieces of sculpture , and the cases containing the precious collection of Ornamental Art , ( works of the minor arts , as they might be called , ) which has been brought together from private and public sources , and is quite unrivalled in its completeness . The southern aisle contains the main collection of pictures by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with the works of the British schooL The transept , being chiefly given up to arrangements for an orchestra , contains below little but a collection of busts , but its galleries are occupied with the collection of miniatures , a most admirable and extensive historical series of engravings , a large number of photographs , and a very precious collection of original drawings by the old masters . The saloon at the north end of the transept is filled with East Indian and Chinese tapestries , furniture , and works of ornamental design ; while the opposite saloon continues the collection of paintings of ancient masters , being chiefly occupied with works from the gallery of the Marquis of Hertford , which he sent to the Exhibition on condition that they shouid be kept together . The hall that crosses the building at the western end is filled with a collection of water-color drawings. - Such , in brief , is an outline of the distribution of the treasures contained in this great palace of Art . The first impression , on entering the nave , is that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attention is not attracted to particular details . Separate objects are dwarfed in the long vista . The eye rests on nothing that ls // 35 not precious , and is at first contented to wander rapidly from one object to another , without attempting to delay on any thing . Passing down the middle between the ordered files of statues , ( all modern works , and few of them worthy of remark , ) we enter from the transept the south nave , where the works of the foreign schools of painting are arranged for the most part in chronological order . This nave , like the opposite , is divided into three saloons and two vestibules . We are now in the first saloon . On the one side are the works of the earlier Italian masters , and on the other those of the masters of the earlier German and Flemish schools . And it is here that one observes the chief deficiency of the collection . The pictures which are here have been brought from the private galleries in which England is so rich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations , gains additional interest from its gallery of plc-. tures or of marbles . Blenheim , Wilton House , Warwick Castle , have their old walls hung with pictures by Titian , Vandyck , and Holbein . Who does not remember , as one of his most delightful recollections of England ,  --  delightful as all his recollections of that dear old Mother-land are , if he has really seen her ,  --  who does not thus remember the drive from the little country town to the old family place , up the long avenue under its ancestral trees , the ferny brook crossed by the stone bridge with its carved balustrade , the deer feeding on the green slope of the open park or lying under some secular oak , the heavy white clouds casting their slow shadows on the broad lawn , the dark spreading cedars of Lebanon standing on the edge of the bright fiower-garden ,  --  the old house itseif , with its quaint gables and oriels , the broad flight of steps leading to the wide door ,  --  the cheerful reception from the prim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great hall , and in the pleasant , homelike rooms , in Vandyck 's portrait of the beautiful countess , and in Holbein 's of the fifth earl ,  --  thc satisfaction with which she would point to the pictures and the marbles brought two centuries ag* from Italy , now stopping before this to tell you that " it is considered a very improportionable Virgin by Parmigianino , " and calling you to observe this old statue " of a couching Silenius wrapped in the skin of a Pantheon , "  --  and then , when the Rubens , and the Claude , and all the other pictures have been seen , her letting you pass , as a great favor , through the library with its well-filled oaken shelves , the gilding worn off the backs of many of its books by the love of successive generations ; - who does not remember such scenes as these , and recall the glorious pictures from Florence , or from Venice , or from Antwerp , that enrich many an English country home ? It was , indeed , from such homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought together ; and this being the case , it is not to be wondered at that it was difficult to form an historic sequence of pictures by which the course and progress of Art should be properly illustrated , or that many of the old pictures that hang on the walls of the Exhibition bear the names of greater masters than they deserve to be honored with . Nor is it strange that the earlier schools of Art should be but very scantily represented . The earlier painters did not do much work that would answer for the decoration of homes ; their work was of a public , and , for the most part , a consecrated nature . The pictures of later centuries are more easily appreciated by those who have not made a thoughtful study of Art , and they have consequently been more loudly praised and more generally sought for . The later works have attractive qualities in which the earlier arc often deficient , and it is not until very recently that the real beauty and value of these first pictures of the revival have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourteenth , and of the greater part of the fifteenth century , did not , as we have said , paint pictures simply as objects of // beauty or for mere purposes of adornment , nor were those methods of painting then in use which have brought pictures into private homes and within private means . And so it happens that the schools of this period are not represented at Manchester in any fair proportion to the schools of the sixteenth century . The two most important centuries of Art are not to be studied here . Of the six pictures , for instance , that profess to be by Giotto , the great head and master of Italian Art , there are but two from which even a faint impression of his style can be gained . There is nothing here which would enable one who had not seen his works in Italy to conceive a true idea of their character and merits . Giotto stands at the threshold of the fourteenth century , breaking open the door , so long barred up , that was to let men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dante , he , as painter , stands sid* by side with the poet . In the midst of the tumults , the confusion , and violence of those bloody times , his soul rose above the discord of the world , his hand snapped the fetters of authority and tradition , and revealed by line and color the exalted visions of his imagination . Painting , with him , took its inspiration from religious faith , and spent itself in religious service . Whether at Padua , in the little withdrawn Arena chapel , or on the bare mountains at Assisi , in the great church of St. Francis , or at Naples , in the king 's chapel , his frescos , though dimmed by the dust of five hundred years , blackened by the smoke of incense , abused by restorers , still show a power of imagination , a spirituality and tenderness of feeling , a simplicity and directness of treatment , which give them place among the most sacred and precious works that Art has yet produced . That quiet , solitary chapel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reverence in Italy ; for in the pictures from the lives of the Virgin and the Saviour , that are painted upon its walls , November , there is the expression of such religious fervor , such faith and love , as Art has rarely or never reached in later times . Nor is there at Manchester any picture by Duccio da Siena , the great , and , one may almost say , the worthy contemporary of Giotto , from which his power and feeling are to be well estimated . Like Giotto he struggled to free himself from the swathing-clothes in which the traditions of Byzantine Art had bound up the limbs and the imaginations of artists , and he succeeded in at last breaking loose . But the long restraint had impaired the power of all who were subjected to it ; and as in the works of Giotto , so in the rarer works of iDuccio , one often finds an effort after truth of expression , which is almost pathetic in its character , from its revealing the inefficiency of the band to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to overcome the impediments of bad teaching and imperfect knowledge of the materials and limits of painting . It is this groping effort after truth which results often in the naive rendering of details , and the quaintness of composition , which are so common in the works of these early masters ; but the deep feeling of the artists penetrates throughall , and thus even their awkward and imperfect drawing frequently produces a stronger effect , and seetus a better rendering of nature , than the cold , unfeeling , academic accuracy of Bologna , or all the finished science of the eclectic schools . In passing down through the century one finds lamentable omissions at Manchester . Fifty pictures , of which half at least have been restored , ( that is to say , in part or wholly spoiled , ) and half originally the work of inferior masters , do not represent the art of a century which was full of the glow of reawakening life , and which , as the spring covers the earth with flowers , covered Italy with cathedrals , campaniles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls with sculpture and painting . Art was gaining gradually a knowledge of her ewn powers . Orgagna , the Michel Angelo // of his time , ( one of his pictures is at Manchester , ) was opening a wider field for her progress ; and ten years after his death Fra Angelico was born . He was a boy of fifteen years old when in 1402 Masaccio was born at Florence , and the brightness of the fifteenth century had begun . There is one , among the four pictures ascribed to Fra Angelico in this collection , from which something of the heavenly purity , the sweetness , and the tenderness of this great and gentle master may be learned . It is a picture of the Last Judgment . Unfortunately , it has been much injured by time and by neglect ; its brilliant colors have sunk and become dim ,  --  those pure , clear colors which give to Fra Angelico 's panel pictures the brilliancy of a missal illumination , and which reflect the purity and the clearness of his tranquil life and his reverential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses of color with moral qualities , and which from the coloring of a picture will deduce something of the moral character of its painter . Thus it is not only from the exquisite delicacy of form , the spirituality of expression , and the sweet , reverent fancy m attitude , of the angels from which Fra Angelico derived his name , but also from the brightness of their golden wings , from the deep glow of their crimson , or scarlet , or azure robes , and from the clear shining of the stars on their foreheads , that one learns that he deserved that name as characteristic of his temper and his life . Something of the influence of the cloister shows itself in most of his larger works ; but if his vision was narrowed within convent walls , it did but pierce the more clearly into the regions of tranquillity and loveliness that lay above them . With the end of the fifteenth century religion almost disappears from Art . John Bellini , dying ninety years old in 1516 , was the last and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved Art as the means granted them of serving God upon earth . The manly vigor of his conceptions , the tender and holy purity of his imagination , the delicate strength of his fancy , are not to be discovered in the few pictures that bear his name at Manchester . His pictures are to be fairly seen only at Venice , where , in out-of-the-way churches , over tawdry altars , his colors gleam undimmed by time , and the faces of his Virgins look down with a still celestial sweetness . But there is one picture here , by a Venetian contemporary of John Bellini , before which we shall do well to pause . It is a St. Catharine , by Cima da Conegliano . It is the picture of a noble woman , full of fortitude , serenity , and faith . The richness of the color of her dress , her calm dignity , the composure of her attitude , recall to mind and make her the worthy companion of the beautiful St. Barbara of the church of Santa Maria Formosa . It is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days when such saints as these were no longer painted ; but in their places whole tribes of figures with faces twisted into every trick of sentimental devotion , imbecile piety , and pretended fervor . But before this time , somewhere about the middle of the fifteenth century , the fashion of painting pictures upon panel for private purposes , though as yet religious subjects were principally chosen for treatment , had already begun ; and we find the masters of the early part of the sixteenth century represented with tolerable fulness at Manchester . English collectors have long had a passion for Raphael , and England is almost as rich in his works in oils as Italy herself . Italy , however , keeps his frescos ; and may she long keep them ! There are more than thirty works ascribed to Raphael hanging on the walls of the Exhibition . Many of ' them are of doubtful genuineness ; many of them have been restored . It is impossible to trace in these pictures the progress of Raphael 's manner , and to mark the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of the change from the simplicity and feeling of his early works , produced nader the influence of religious senti // ment , and the still clinging stiffness of traditional restraints , to the freedom and coldness of his later works , painted under the influence of success at a dissolute court , of flattery , of jealousy , and of indifference to the motives of religion . The Venetian masters of the sixteenth century fril a large portion of the sides of one of the great saloons of this aisle , covering it with a glow of deepest color . The opposite side is hung with many pictures by Rubens ; and the contrast between the works of the mighty colorists of Venice and the famous colorist of Antwerp is not without curious interest and instruction . The Venice wall has the color of Venetian sunsets , the gold and crimson of its clouds , the solemn blue of the Cadore hills , the deep green of the lagoons , the brown and purple of the seaweeds , and the shadows of the city of decaying palaces . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color . But on the other wall are the colors of the courts in which Rubens passed so many of his days ,  --  the dyes of tapestry , the sheen of jewels and velvet , the glaring crimson and yellow of royal displays ; while the harmonies that he strikes out with his rapid and powerful hand are like those of the music of some great military band . There are noble pictures here by Giorgione , and Titian , and Tintoret , and Paul Veronese , and Bonifazio . Look at this Musical Party by Giorgione , this landscape by Titian , this portrait of the vile Duke of Alva by the same great master , the greatest master of all in portraiture . It is the Duke himself , not merely in his outward presence , but such as the insight of one as profoundly versed in human as in external nature beheld him . The portrait is a biography of the man , and one may read in the narrow , hard , and wily face the history of his cruel life . The same qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasty portraits , and one learns as much of Venetian men and of their lives from the pencil of Titian and of Tintoret as i*rom the pens of contemporary chroniclers . The picture by Bonifazio of a Virgin and Child surrounded by saints is a splendid example of this almost unsurpassed colorist ; while several of the pictures by Paul Veronese are among the most precious things in all the Exhibition , as clear and uninjured specimens of admirable Venetian work . The Bolognese school is represented at Manchester out of all proportion to its worth , in comparison with the earlier and greater schools of Italy . It is essentially the school of decline , and , after the time of Francia , very few pictures proceeded from it dignified by noble thought , or exhibiting either purity or power of imaginatioA . Its very method condemned it to inferiority . But debased as it is , it has been during the last two centuries the object of perhaps more real and affected admiration than any other of the schools of Italian art . Fortunately , we have entered upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast coming over the puhlie taste . But it is a curious fact , that the most popular picture in the whole gallery of ancient masters , the picture before which larger crowds assemble and linger than before any other , is one from this school ,  --  the three Manes weeping over the body of the Saviour , by Anuibale Caracci . A portion of the interest which it excites undoubtedly arises from the report that Louis Napoleon has offered the sum of ? 20,000 for it to its possessor , the Earl of Carlisle ; but its intrinsic qualities are such as to explain much of its attraction for uneducated eyes . The attitudes of the figures are violent and theatrical , the colors are strong , the surface is smooth , the subject is easily recognized and of general interest . But whatever value be set upon these points , it is an example of many of the worst defects of the school . The expressions of the figures are exaggerated and unnatural , the color , though strong , is cold and inharmonious , the drawing feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a true exponent of the low ebb of artistic power and of religious feeling at the period at which it was painted . // But we are delaying too long in these halls of the old painters . We have scarcely looked at a tithe of the eleven hundred pictures that hang around , and we must pass by with only a glance the long lines of German , Flemish , and Dutch works , and the rows of pictures by the great Spanish masters . We can but see how much there is for pleasure and for study , and wish in vain to pause before Rembrandt , and Cuyp , and Ruysdael , and Vandyck , before Murillo and Velasquez . We come out into the nave , and , forgetting for a time pictures as works of art , let us look at them as representations of men , as we pass along before the portraits of British worthies , with which the two sides of this great hall are hung . It is a gallery of which every or*e of British blood may be proud ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portraits of her famous men , and feel at the same time that so many of her greatest were not to be found in the collection . The gallery begins with a portrait of King Henry IV. ; it ends with that of Mr. Prescott After nearly four hundred English worthies , at last one American ,  --  and only one ; for in the whole collection there is hut one other portrait of an American ,  --  West , the painter ,  - -  and he was English by adoption , though not by birth . We could spare his fame without great loss , but it would not do for us to give up that of our popular historian . In the next great assemblage of the portraits of the worthies of the English race and speech , perhaps those born on this side of the Adantic may appear in larger numbers and in even rank of honor . The first portrait on the catalogue is that of King Henry IV. ; but he has displaced here , as in life , his predecessor on the throne . Henry VI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is not till Henry VHI. ' s time that we really enter upon the field of English portraiture . *y* begin with the king himself . Here is Holbein 's famous picture of him ; a picture that represents a man so gross , so sensual , so disgusting in appearance , that one recognizes its truth , and wonders that the court-painter did not lose his head for such a libellous sincerity . Wolsey is near his master ; his face is that of a man " exceeding wise , fairspoken , and persuading " ; he has a large , full brow , narrow and shrewd eyes , a delicate nose , and somewhat heavy and sensual cheeks . A little later the portraits become more numerous . Of Queen Elizabeth there are seven here , and in them may be traced the great changes of her face ,  --  from that of the plain , awkward , not altogether unpleasing , redhaired girl , to that of the hard , hitter , disappointed old woman . Some of her courtiers surround her ; - Leicester , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mule , and holding flowers in his hand ,  --  an odd representation of the great Lord Treasurer . And here , too , is Henry Wriothesley , the Earl of Southampton , finding a deserved place among the chief men of his time ,  --  for he was Shakspeare 's friend , and to him the " Rape of Lucrece " was dedicated , with the words , " What I have done is yours ; what I have to do is yours ; being part in all I have devoted yours . " Here is Holbein 's portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh , with the face of a true knight . Sidney is not here , but " Sidney 's sister , Pembroke 's mother , " has an honored place ,  --  and though her portrait is not of so " fair " a woman as one might desire to have seen her , it has the look of a woman " wise and good . " And here are Shakspeare and Ben Jonson themselves ;  --  the Chandos portrait of Shakspeare , with which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fame than from its being either an authentic or a satisfactory likeness of the poet ; and Ben Jonson close by , with his strong features and manly face . And Fletcher , and Shirley , and Dick Burbadge , who first acted Hamlet , and whose picture explains why the queen should say , " He 's fat and scant of breath , "  --  and others of the same great band of contemporaries . Their heads he 1857.1 39 // long for the most part to one broad type ; their common characteristics are strongly marked . There were never finer heads than these ;  --  the broad , uplifted , solidly based skulls ; the strong and vigorous marking of the features , giving evidence , both in shape and in expression , of the union of pure intellect and pure imagination . Compare with them the heads of the wits and statesmen of Charles II . ' s time . See the difference ;  --  the high , wide arch of the skull is lowered or narrowed ; the broad brow cramped ; the features finer cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look , for instance , at this Vandyck of Sir John Suckling ,  --  only the next generntion after the great men ; but his portrait is that of an idler , his head that of a man without great thoughts or great interests . The age of imagination had passed ; the age of fancy was setting in . Here and there in the later days one finds a man who might belong to the earlier tine ; - for instance , this likeness of Sir Henry Wotton , also by Vandyck , gives us a broad and noble head ; but one sees the time to which he belonged in his somewhat affected meditative attitude , and in the word Philosopliernur , which is inscribed upon the canvas . The finest type of head which England has had since the time of Elizabeth was that developed among the Ronudheads . Round heads they were , and noble heads too . They are well represented here . Look at this portrait of Cromwell ; - it has the same character and expression with that still nobler likeness of him which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in one of the back halls of the Pitti Gallery , a stern , silent monitor to the dull Florentines . Frederick Tennyson said of it , that it was the best baffle-piece he ever saw ; - " In its red ruggedness it looks as if it had been sketched in by the gleam of Dunbar 's cannon flashes . " Hampden , Eliot , and Pym , with wide individual dif* ferences , all belong to the same class ; - . the lines of their faces , which in Hampden and in Eliot have settled into a cast of resolute melancholy , and in Pym betray the sternness of his nature , tell in all of the hard discipline oftheir lives , and the upright patriotism of their hearts . Compare the faces of these patriots with those of the leaders of the French Revolutions . The Cavaliers , with a type of head less fine , were for the most part handsomer men than the Roundheads . Here is Lovelace , the poet , for instance ; Aubrey says of him , " He was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assertion . His face has a look of enthusiasm and of gallantry , appropriate to the man who could write , " Stone walls do not a prison make . " With the portraits of Brooke , and Fairfax , and Falidand , and Astley , and others of the time , the comparison between Roundhead and Cavalier might be carried still farther ,  --  but we must pass on . The portrait of Hobbes of Malmesbury , as an old man , hangs near that of Sir Thomas Browne . It is a curious contrast between the imaginative and the unimaginativ6 philosopher ,  --  between the student of innumerable books , and the cynic who declared that " he should know as little as other men , if he had read as many books . " There is a whole bevy here of the famous beauties of Charles ll. ' s court , full of the affected airs and languishing graces which Sir Peter Lely knew well how to paint , and rarely showing any thing in their portraits of the sprightliness which some of them at least possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulllength beauties , who calls up any associations but such as belong to Grammont 's Memoirs , is Margaret Lucas , the Duchess of Newcastle . Who does not know her through Chnrles Lamb , and love her for Charles Lamb 's sake ? She looks out of place here , between Charles II . and the Duchess of Cleveland ; and it was not in a fancy dress of most fantastic style that she wrote her memoir of her husband ,  --  in which she tells of what My Lord would eat at dinner , as well as collects the wise things which dropped from My Lord 's lips . // The Manchester Exhibition . The worthy Secretary Pepys appears here , in " an excellent conceited picture , " of which he himseJf has told the story in his Diary " 1666 , March 17 . To Hales 's , and paid him ? 14 for the picture , and ? 1 5s. for the frame . This day I began to sit , and he will make me , I think , a very fine picture . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and I sit to have it full of shadows , and do almost break my neck looking over my shoulder , to make the posture for him to work by . " " March 30 . To Hales 's , and there sat till almost quite dark upon working my gowne , which I hired to be drawn in ; an Indian gowne . " " April 11 . To Hales 's , where there was nothing found to be done more to my picture , but the musique , which now pleases me mightily , it being painted true . " * And here is Kneller 's familiar portrait of John Evelyn , the other diarist of the times . And Lely 's portrait of iRochester , the roue ' , represented in the characteristic act of crowning his monkey with laurel ,  --  laurel to which he sometimes aspired himself And Kneller 's portrait of Lord William Russell , with a face that answers better to the character of the man , as it appeared before he was brought face to face with death , and forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The men of letters of the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century appear here in great force . With the faces of most of them the world is familiar . Here are six of the Kit-Kat Club portraits that were painted for Jacob Tonson . First in order Tonson himself , the very personification of the flourishing publisher and patron of authors , with the pleasant air of the happy discoverer of genius , and the maker of its fortune as well as of his own . He holds a folio copy of " Paradise Lost " ; it is Tonson patting Milton on the back . Dryden , * Mr. Peter Cunningham has quoted these passages in his excellent catalogue of the gallery . Vaubrugh , Congreve , Steele , Addison , and Lord Chancellor Somers are the other five of these celebrated portraits . What a congress of wits ! But we have besides , Atterbury , and Pope , and Lady Mary Wortley Montague , and Prior , and Tickell , and Swift . Pope 's face , as given in Kndller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complimentary verse to the painter , ) has a sad and weary look , and is marked by that pallor , and that peculiar hollowness of eye and cheek , which often accompany bodily deformity . Swift 's face betrays but little of the bitterness of his soul ; but it was painted in his best days , before the cloud of darkness had begun to settle down upon him . It is the portrait of him as he was in London , among his set ,  --  not as he was in the halibanishment of his Irish life . The end of the century brings us to other familiar portraits , and at length to portraits painted by great native artists . Gainshorough and Reynolds appear in full rivalry . Here are Gainsborough 's Johnson , the well-known profile portrait , and Sir Joshua 's Boswell ; Gainsborough 's Garrick , a most delightful portrait of Garrick 's pleasantest expression , and Sir Joshua 's Gibbon , which looks as ugly and as conceited as the little man himself One of Reynolds 's most pleasing portraits is his likeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colors and the cracking of the paint , as so many of Sir Joshua 's best pictures have done ; but it still presents him amiable , cultivated , and unpretending , the accomplished artist and the kindly friend , and affords the best possible illustration of the character which Goldsmith drew of him in his " Retaliation . " We pass rapidly before the portraits of the present century . Every one knows by heart the faces of Scott and Byron , Southey and Coleridge . But there is one little portrait , hung at the end of the gallcry , in front of which we pause . It has no remarkable merit as a work of art , but it is the portrait of Keats , painted in Rome by his friend Severn . The young poet is resting his 18*7. 9 41 // head on his hand , as if it were heavy and tired . His face has a look of illness ; his eyes are large , and the spaces around them are hollow . His wide and wellformed brow , and all the features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to excess . This portrait was painted , according to tradition , in the little summer-house studio , at the corner of the Via Strozzi . The windows look out over the garden with its cypress walks , its old pine trees , its rows of cabbages and artichokes , its weather-stained statues and bits of ancient marbles . Beyond are the walls of Rome , and beyond these the Campagna stretches away in level lines of beauty to the blue billow of the Alban hills . On this view the eyes of the dying poet rested , while his heart gave no prophecy to him of coming fame . Would it have cheered him , during those last disheartened days , to have foreseen that so soon England would rank him among her honored children , and place his portrait in the gallery of the most worthy of her dead ; while a line of his writing , " A thing of beauty is a joy forever , " should be emblazoned in glowing letters at the end of the great hall of her first great Palace of Art ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contains the works of the British school of painters . It is the most complete of the sections of this great collection of pictures , and the lessons which are to be learned from it of the present condition and prospects of Art are of the highest intercst . Here are six hundred pictures , the English record of about a hundred years of painting . Never before has there been such a collection of the works of English painters , and never before has there been an opportunity of studying so fully and satisfactorily the course and progress of the English schooL The beginning of this school hardly dates before the first quarter of the last century . Public taste was then at its lowest level . The fall of Art in Italy , in the preceding century , had carried down with it both the appreciation and the feeling for what was truly good . A factitious taste had taken the place of honest and simple likings . The worst things were often preferred , the w'orst pictures bought . Artists , as a class , had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in the place of Nature , they had put other men 's pictures . They had substituted a system of conventional rules and traditional methods , for the infinite variety and the unceasing study of truth . They preferred falsehood , they liked imitation , and their patrons soon came to consider the feeble results of falsehood and imitation as better than honest work and strong originality . Of course , here and there was a man whose native love of truth or spirit of opposition would give him strength to break loose from the fetters of artistic convention and prevailing taste , and to exhibit the truth in his pictures . Such a man was the first great artist of the English school , Hogarth ; the greatest humorist of a century rich in humorists , with a knowledge of human nature that reminds one sometimes of Fielding 's in its clearness and variety , sometimes of Goldsmith 's in its tender pleasantry . But Hogarth had to struggle all his life against the taste of his time , which was unable to appreciate his merit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures exhibited here is one from his famous series of the Harlot 's Prog .. ress . It is too well known by the engravings to need description ; but when the eight masterly pictures which compose this series were sold at auction during Hogarth 's life , they brought the sum of fourteen guineas each ! The March of the Guards to Finebley , so admirable in composition , so full of incident and character , so rich in humor , could not be sold by the artist , and he disposed of it in a lottery , in which many tickets were left on his hands . And while this was the fate of works which still stand unsurpassed in their peculiar field , the amateurs were payingenormous prices for worthless pictures of secondrate // Italian masters , and talking about their " Correggios and Raphaels and stuff . " From Hogarth to Sir Joshua Reynolds is a wide step . Sir Joshua is well represented here by some thirty pictures ; and Gainsborough is at his side with perhaps half as many . If Sir Joshua had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined by his academic principles . He laid down rules which he constantly violated . He praised the Bolognese masters , and advised all students of Art in Italy to study at Bologna ; but he did not confine himself to the study of other men 's works , but sometimes gave himself , with honest sincerity and affection , to the study of Nature ; and thus it is that it becomes hard to draw the line of praise between some of his pictures and some of those by Gainsborough , and to say which are tbe best . Gainshorough was no academician ; he did not believe in conventionalities . When Sir Joshua laid down as a rule that blue was bad as a prevailing color in pictures , Gainsborough painted his famous Blue Boy , and made one of the most charming portraits and pleasantest pictures that had ever been painted in England . Look at Sir Joshua 's delightful , winning Nelly O'Brien ,  --  what a happy picture of a girl !  --  and then look at Gainsborough 's Mrs. Graham , with her exquisite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not which of ' the artists was the best , for that it is hard to see , but how great both were as students and renderers of human nature . One of the best of ' Reynolds 's portraits is that of Foote , the actor . He is leaning over a chair , and his laughing face is looking out from the canvas , as if he were watching the effect of one of his own most brilliant and easy jokes . But Sir Joshua does not compare with Gainsborough in landscape ; there the lover of Nature had the advantage over the lover of Poussin and Claude . The famous picture of Puck , which Lord Fitzwilliam lately bought at Mr. Rog*rs 's sale for the extravagant sum of nine hundred and eighty guineas , is here for all eyes to see how far the imagination of the President of the Royal Academy differed from that of Sbakspeare . But the principles which Sir Joshua laid down , though they did not ruin his own works , did much to ruin those of the next generation of painters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule and according to convention , and the painters of truth as found in Nature . But the painters of Nature were in a minority so small as to be powerless against the prevailing current . English Art seemed to be running down ; cold formalisms , classicalities , extravagances , affectations , imitations , " high art , " occupied the field almost to the exclusion of better things . West , Fuseli , Northeote , Barry , Sir Thomas Lawrence , Haydon , Madlise , and Sir Charles Eastlake form a famous line of painters who have been admired , but whose works have littie value except as warnings , and as showing into what errors a false method and want of recognition of the foundation and the end of Art may lead men not destitute of ability . But while these men had their day , the school of the lovers of Nature as seen in the external world was making irregular progress . The overwhelming pressure of conventional traditions is shown most forcibly , however , by the fact that the great leader of this school of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given the power to see and to represent Nature in all the changing glories and beauties of her ceaselessly varying moods , the man who knew the value of truth and set his desires upon it accordingly ,  --  that this man should have been for years of his life kept down to the imitation of and competition with the works of painters of previous centuries who were supposed to have painted landscapes . But it was Pegasus running a race with cart-horses . He had reached the goal which they had never aspired after . There are nineteen pictures of Turner 's here at Manchester ; some of them among his noblest works . Here // is his Cologne at Sunset ; look at n , for the picture will fade before your eyes , and you will stand looking at the golden glow of evening over the church towers , and the gleaming river of the ancient city . With the growth of Turner 's power , and the conmiencement of a better period of public taste and feeling , as marked not only in Art , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the English school . In different directions , and with different degrees of success , many artists , but generally with more or less faltering , broke away from the old system . Wilkie , Etty , Constable , Collins , and others , often painted simple and sincere pictures , pictures that showed careful study and real love of Nature . All these artists may be seen to advantage here . But in looking at the mass of the collection , one sees that the true principles of Art have not even as yet been generally recognized by the majority of English artists . The last hall of the gallery , which is devoted to the works of living artists , gives especial proof of this fact . But at the same time , it gives proof of the rise of a spirit among a small body of the younger painters , whose influence promises to be of strong and beneficial effect . The artists among whom this spirit exists are the PreRaphaelites . Great misconception exists with regard to the works and to the principles of Art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has in part occasioned this misconception . It was not happily chosen ; for these Pre-Raphaelites , instead of being three centuries behind their times , are fully up with the day in which they live . Pre-iRaphaclitism was not intended to mean , as it might seem to imply , the going back to worn-out and obsolete methods of painting , the resort to past modes of representation ; it does not mean the adoption of the artistic forms , traditions , or rules of the old painters ; it does not mean the seeking of inspiration from the works of any other men ; but , in theory at least , it means the pursuit of Art in that spirit which the painters before Raphael possessed , the spirit which united Art with Religion ; it means the pursuit of Art with the humility of learners , with the faith of apostles . It does not mean the reproduction of the quaintnesses , and awkwardnesses , and limitations of the early artists , more than it means the adoption of the errors of their creed as exhibited in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose from the bondage of Byzantine captivity , and found in Nature the source of all true inspiration , the exhaustless fountain from which their imaginations might draw perpetual refreshment ,  --  so these artists who took this name would free themselves from whatever they could discern to be false in the teaching and practice of Art in our times , and give themselves to the study of that beauty and that truth which are to be found in God 's world to-day , whether in external nature or in human hearts , actions , and lives . Truth was to be their ( levice ; Nature was to be their mistress . And in the ardor of youth , they set forth for the conquest of new and untravelled lands . It is greatly to be regretted that there should be but an inconsiderable number of pictures in this last hall of the English gallery by Pre-Raphaelite artists . A little private exhibition of seventy-two pictures and drawings , by some twenty artists of this school , which was held in a small house in London , during the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been already accomplished by them , of the practical working out of their principles of Art , and of their present tendencies . Three men stand as the prominent leaders of the movement ,  --  Rosetti , Hunt , and Millais . There is not a single picture by Rosetti at Manchester ; but two ( if we remember rightly ) by Millais ; and although there are several by Hunt , there are none of his latest works , nor the most powerful and beautiful of his comparatively early ones , the well-known Light of the World . Rosetti has never , we believe , exhibited in public . But // whether he paint Dante led in a vision by Love to see Beatrice lying dead ,  --  or the Angel leading King and Shepherd to adore the new-born Saviour , while the angelic choir in white robes stand around the manger in the night , singing their song of Peace and Good-will ,  --   --  or Queen Guinever and Sir Lancelot meeting in the autumn day at King Arthur 's tomb ,  --  or Mary of Magdala flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box of ointment to her bosom ,  --  or Ophelia redelivering to Hamlet his gifts of remembrance , while he strips the leaves from a rosetree as he breaks her heart ,  --  or the young farmer , who , having driven his cart to London , and crossed one of the bridges over the black river , finds in the cold , wet morning his old love , long lost , now fallen at the side of the street , fainting against the dead brick wall of a graveyard ; whether he paint these or other scenes , in all are to be found such sense of the higher truths of Nature and such faithful rendering of them , such force of expression , and such beauty of conception , as place them as works of imagination among the first that this age has produced . With equal fidelity to Nature , with a more definite moral purpose , perhaps with a more consistent steadiness of work , but with less delicate sense of beauty , and with imagination of a very different order , Hur*t stands with Rosetti in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral expression in most of his pictures is such as has for a long time been rare in Art . Art is with him a means of enforcing the recognition of truths often avoided or carefully concealed . Their powerful dramatic character compels the attention of the careless to his pictures . He paints Claudio and Isabella in the prison scene , and it is not merely a vivid rendering of the scene in its external features , but also a true rendering of the character of Claudio and Isabella , of the weakness of the coward , of the strength that dwells with the pure . His Awakened Conscience is a scene from the interior of London life ; a denunciation of the vice of which the world is so careless ; a sad , stern picture of the bitterness of sin . Millais is less in earnest , and his pictures , with many great technical merits , with portions of very exquisite painting , have rarely possessed any great worth as works of imagination . One of the tenderest of them all is the Huguenots , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally known through the engraving that has recently been published . The Autumn Leaves , which is exhibited at Manchester , is one of his least satisfactory pictures . But all these men are young , and what they have already accomplished is but as the promise of greater things to come . It is impossible , however , to look forward for these greater things , without a feeling of doubt and uncertainty as to their being produced . The times in which we are living are not fitted to develope and confirm the qualities on which the best results of Art depend . Ours is neither an age of composure nor of faith . It urges speedy results ; it desires effective , rather than simple , truthful work . But the Pre-Raphaelites are exposed to especial dangers ; just now to the dangers that come from success . And these are of two kinds ; first , the undermining of that humility which is the secret of mastery ; and secondly , the tendency to the development of peculiarities and mannerisms , to the exaggeration of special features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a factitious value set upon them by the public , as they are taken to be the signs and passwords of initiation into the new school . But , lying deeper than these , there is a danger to Pre-Raphaelitism from the tendency to insist on too literal an application of its own principles . The best principles will not include all cases . The workings and ways of Nature are infinite , and the principles of Art are finite deductions from these infinite examples . As yet these , deductions have been but imperfectly made . The most exact and truthful representation of // Nature may be the rule of the artist , but it is hot an easy thing to attain to an understanding of the truth of Nature . The actual is not always the real . Literal truth is not always exact truth ; and the seeming truth , which is what Art must often represent , is very different from the absolute truth . And here there has been much stumbling in Pre-Raphaelitism , and there is likelihood of fall ; likelihood of the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essence . It is , indeed , apparently , a tendency toward this error which has deprived most of the best pictures of the Pre-Raphadites of the quality / of breadth , a quality which Nature usually preserves in herseli which in painting takes the place of harmony in music , and which only the greatest painters have acquired . But if Pre-Raphaelitism be true , not to the letter , but to the spirit of its prim .. ciples ,  --  if its artists remain unspoiled by flattery and success ,  --  if they avoid mannerisms , conceits , and the affectations of originality ,  --  if they can keep religious faith undinuned by the " world 's slow stain " ; then we may expect from the school such works of painting as have not been seen in past times ,  --  works which shall be the forerunners of a new period of Art , and shall show what undreamed conquests yet lie open before it ,  --  works which shall take us into regions of yet undiscovered beauty , and reveal to us more and more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
