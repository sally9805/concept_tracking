UNITED STATES REYJEW . AUGUST , 1855 . T I* I A L B Y J U R Y. THE institution of trial by jury is of very ancient origin . It has been traced back to the very foundation of civil government in England , and is probably of much older date . It existed , though in a crude and imperfect state , among the Saxon colonies ; and its institution was , by them , ascribed to Woden , their captain , legislator , and patron-saint . Traces of the institution are found among all those nations which adopted the feudal system , as Germany , France , and Italy ; and Sir William Jones quotes from one of the orations of Dcmosthenes to prove its existence among the Athenians . By the ancient common law , a jury might consist of a greater number than twelve , but in the decision of causes it was necessary that a majority of twelve should agree upon a verdict , the votes of the others cancelling each other ; so that if twelve only appeared they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the probable origin of the rule requiring unanimity in a j iiry of twelve men . At one time a practice prevailed called afforcing the assize , that is , if a majority of twelve could not be obtained , of adding to the number till such majority could be procured . In 1791 , the institution of trial by jury was engrafted on 7 // the French constitution . The form of the English institution was followed . A grand j ury , or jury of accusation , was also established , consisting of eight persons , five of whom must agree upon an indictment . But either from some defect in its original constitution , or from some peculiarity of national character , the principle of unanimity was soon departed from , and the concurrence of seven made the verdict effective . ii ; however , the judges whose duty it was to deliberate on the questions submitted to them , agreed with the minority of five , they exercised a kind of veto-power which reversed or arrested the decision of the majority . And even now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and juries decide causes by a two-thirds majority . Trials by jury , anciently , were of two kinds , extraordinary and ordinary . One kind of extraordinary jury was organized by the sheriff summoning four knights who chose twelve other knights to unite with them . This form of a jury was called the grand assize . Another kind of extraordinary j ury was composed of twenty-four knights who were summoned to try an attaint against a former jury , for bringing in a false verdict ; and the ordinary , or common jury , was the jury of twelve men now known to our laws . The time when juries were made to consist of but twelve men , and their unanimous opinion required , can not now be precisely ascertained . And the reason why this apostolic number was selected , is lost with the early history of the institution in the darkness of the past . That number seems to have been held in some veneration by the northern nations of Europe . Lord Coke says : " The law delighteth herself in the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its frequent occurrence in the Scriptures . The first account of a jury of that number in England was in the reign of William the Conqueror , in the beginning of the eleventh century ; and during the reign of Henry II. , it became a regular part of the English jurisprudence , and was afterwards expressly recognized by Magna Charta . This institution has come down to us clothed with the veneration of antiquity , and loaded with the praises of legislators and jurists of every age . It has not only commended itself to the reason of the few who make and administer the law , but it has commanded the applause of all ages and nations . It is , and ever has been , essentially a republican institution . There is between jurors and parties a sort of political equality . By the common law , a nobleman in criminal cases , must be // tried by his peers . In theory there is an equality among all persons not born peers , so that all below them in rank were to be tried by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an alien , six of the jurors were to be aliens . But if both parties were aliens , then the jury were all denizens , it being presumed , that in such cases , no partiality could be shown to either party from want of citizenship . By the laws of this State , however , no alien can serve as a juror , either in civil or criminal cases . The vast tide of immigration constantly flowing into our country may be a sufficient reason for the rule , especially in criminal cases . In the ancient German courts , the principle of equality between j urors and parties , was recognized to nearly the same extent . No person could be tried by a jury of inferior , though he might be by a jury of superior rank . By the Constitution of the United States , it is provided that the trial of all crimes , except in cases of impeachment , shall be by jury . This right is also secured in suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those so sacred and dear , secured by that great charter of American liberty . In like manner the Constitution of the State of NewYork declares that the right of trial by jury , in all cases in which it has been heretofore used , shall remain inviolate for ever ; and that no new court shall be instituted , but such as shall proceed according to the course of the common law , except such courts of equity as the Legislature is authorized by law to establish . Closely analagous to the right , in England , of a peer of the realm to be tried , in criminal cases , by the House of Lords , is the right secured to all civil officers of the United States in cases of bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors . In these cases , the House of Representatives is the grand jury of accusation , and the Senate is the tribunal before which the offender must be tried ; and when the President is tried , the Chief-Justice of the United States must preside . The reason that in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers ; or , in this country , a civil officer of the United States by the Senate , is not so much from any particular favor to the offender , as that those bodies may at all times be able to vindicate their own honor and protect the dignity of the government . Another reason may be , that those bodies may be supposed to be better acquainted with the facts and circumstances constituting the offense , in the same manner as // in the case of an ordinary jury , trials are to be had in the county where the offenses were committed . Although this may , at first sight , appear to be rather an aristocratic feature in our government , it would certainly lead to great mischief if public officers of the United States were liable to indictment and trial for misdemeanors in office in any of the counties of the several States . It may not be improper here to remark , that in ordinary language , when we speak of a man 's being tried by his peers , we mean by a jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the course and practice of the common law . The Assembly of the State of New-York , also , has the power of impeaching all civil officers of the State for corrupt conduct in office , and for high crimes and misdemeanors ; but a majority of all the members elected must concur in the impeachment ; and the court for the trial of impeachments must consist of the President of the Senate , the Senators , the Chancellor and the Justices of the Supreme Court , or a majority of them . All persons , then , charged with the commission of crime , except public officers accused of high crimes and misdemeanors , having a right to be tried by a jury of twelve men , it may be well to know how that tribunal is constituted , and then to inquire , Whether the mode of its organization and the result of its action are such as best serve to secure the great ends of justice ? In the first place , as to the qualifications of jurors . Every male inhabitant between the ages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shall be selected and summoned , assess*dcfor personal property belonging to him in his own right , to the amoun*of two hundred and fifty dollars , or , who shall have an estate in&gt;real property in the county where he resides , belonging to him either in his own right or the right of his wife , to the amount of one hundred and fifty dollars , and is in possession of his natural faculties , and not infirm or decrepit ; free from all legal exceptions ; of fair character , of approved integrity , of sound judgment and well informed , is qualified to serve as a juror . And in certain counties of the State , where many persons hold articles for their lands from foreign companies , a person not having the requisite amount , either of real or personal property , but who is qualified in all other respects , and who shall have been assessed upon the last assessment-roll of the town for land in his possession , for the purchase of which he holds a contract , // upon which improvements shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , and who shall own such improvernents , is also qualified to serve as a juror . The property qualification may seem to be an aristocratic feature , and is of no further use than to insure that every juror shall be selected from those who have an interest in pre* serving the peace and good order of society , and who shall have " a local habitation and a name . " If it serves this purpose , it is not a useless requirement , though it is believed the rule is rarely strictly followed . It was long a popular tradition in England , that by the ancient common law butchers wer6 prohibited from serving as jurors . Leigh Hunt in one of his essays fell into this error , and Locke in his treatise on eduention took it for granted , and the author of iludibras embalmed it in his lines , where he says : " An English poet should be tried by his peers , And not by pedants and philosophers , Incompetent to judge poetic fury , As 6 tchers are forbid to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner in which jurors are selected from the class of persons already described . Once in every three years the supervisor , the town clerk , and the assessors of the several towns make out duplicate lists of persons to serve as jurors , one of which is filed with the town clerk , and the other with the clerk of the county . From this list the clerk of the county , after notice given for that purpo*c , at some time not less than two weeks before the holding of any court , in the presence of the sheriff of the county and a county judge , or , in their absence , of two justices of the peace , proceeds to draw by lot , from a box provided for that purpose , the names of so many j urors as shall be required for such co*irt . The list of names so drawn is certified by the clerk , and by him delivered to the sheriff , who , at least six days before the court , summons the j arors to appear . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk of the court draws the names of twelve for the trial of a cause . This is rather uninteresting detail of the manner in which this body of twelve men is organized ; but as the remarks which are to follow , will be founded upon , or closely connected with , this recital , the minutest particular will not be found unimportant . In every well-organized judicial system , there must be a // power to determine questions of law , and also a power to settle the facts to which the principles of law are to be applied . The exercise of the former power may be more difficult than the latter , but it can not be more important . Principles of law , once settled , seldom change , while the facts and circumstances which govern the decision of causes are subject to infinite variations and combinations . Ought these powers , different in their nature , to be vested in the same man , or in the same body of men ? Let us inquire whether both could with safety be intrusted to the judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting jurors to determine que*tions of fact to which he himself was to apply the law . How much more dangerous , then , if the judges exercised both these functions without the intervention of another power , though that power should be appointed by themselves ! The history of a Jeifries , rioting in judicial excesses and thirsting for the blood of his victims , will answer this inquiry with a terrible eloquence . Do we then come to the conclusion , that these powers should be exercised by different men , or by different bodies of men ? It is irresistible . The inquiry then arises , What body of men , or what public officer , shall have the power of selecting jurors ? Shall their appointment be permanent , or shall they be appointed in some impartial manner for each particular case ? If one man were to be intrusted with the power , it would scarcely obviate the objection of leaving it in the hands of the judge or judges , as it would , in effect , be but adding one to their number . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is too great to be borne by a single individual . If the office were to be permanent , whether consisting of one or more , they would be liable to be corrupted . The experience of the world proves this . History is full of the melancholy examples of the weaknesses of human nature , and the inability of men to resist the corrupting influences of power . This power , then , should not be left to a single individual ; nor Qn the other hand should it be delegated to a body of men so large that each would lose his individuality . In the latter case the responsibility would be so divided " that too little would be felt by the individuals composing it . Personal integrity feels itself less injured by errors committed in common with large numbers . It too readily finds excuses for deviating from the path of strict rectitude . It apologizes for itself that it was urged on by the multitude , and too often with good reason . But if this justifies the individual act , it does not correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctified by majorities , or be so // diluted among the number of those by whom they are committed as to prevent the misehiefs that commonly flow from them , not only to others , but to themselves . This brings us , then , to the conclusion , that the power of determining questions of so great moment , should be intrusted to a body of men of a moderate number . The number twelve has no particular advantage , nor is it liable to any objection . It is not so small as to leave any fear of the power being exercised for dishonest purposes ; for , that twelve men brought together for a specified object from different towns and neighborhoods , could be made , without previous concert , to agree upon a fraud , is a proposition too preposterous to admit of belief Nor is the number too large to admit of careful and mature investigation . It is a number easily comprehended , convenient for the purposes of business , and sanctioned by immemorial usage . Next as to the mode of their appointment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might the appointing power be safely transferred to other hands ? It has already appeared that it could not safely be exercised by the judges . Would it be proper that they should be selected by the litigating parties ? This would be to allow the respective parties to select a portion of the judges who are to decide the controversy between them . If this privilege were given and corruptly exercised , each party would select those who had prejudged the case . The principle of unanimity would be destroyed . And here the inquiry naturally arises , Whether the rule requiring unanimity is important , and whether it ought to be preserved ? It is certainly of vast importance that disputes and legal controversies should have an end . There should be no one of those to whom the decisions of questions of fact are submitted , who should disagree with a decision that is binding on the parties . If jurors were not required to be unanimous , those in the minority would endeavor to persuade the unsuccessful party that he had been injured by the verdict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , juries sometimes disagree . The claims of the parties are then left undetermined , and the way is open for a new trial . Again , a jury may give an erroneous verdict . It may be contrary to evidence , or rendered under a mistake of the law applicable to the case . In these , and the like cases , the aggrieved party has a remedy which will be referred to hereafter . But to proceed . Would not the liberties of a people be in jeopardy if the selection of jurors was intrusted to any public // officer ; for example , to the executive of the State , or to any officer holding his appointment directly under him ? Napoleon caused jurors to be returned by his agents , and the monarchs of the house of Tudor sent to prison those who refused to convict . It is always the plea of tyranny to desire more power . Would it not be the first aim of the aspirant for supreme authority to weaken or to destroy the institution of trial by jury ? Suppose the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular trial , as was by many supposed in the case of Alexander McLeod . Who does not see the immense danger in such a case , if jurors were selected by the chief-magistrate of a State ? He might be deeply interested , inasmuch as the result of the trial might in one event destroy , and in the other perpetuate his political power . But happily for our country , this institution is based on a surer foundation . From the great body of tiAc people , possessing the requisite qualifications , are selected , by certain officers in the several towns in the State , a list of persons , the number of which is not limited by law . From these names are drawn by lot , by and in presence* of other public officers , a certain number of names , never less than thirty-six to attend any court . From this last list of names , are again drawn by lot , by an officer of the court , twelve names . From the manner in which the persons are originally selected , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from improper motives , or with reference to any particular trial . And if it were possible to suppose them or any portion of them , to be selected from such intentions , the chances are extremely small that any of them would be required to serve . To illustrate this . In one county there may be twenty towns . Suppose that the town officers select from each town eighteen names , making a total of three hundred and sixty persons . In ordinary cases thirtysix would be summoned to attend any court . Each person named would stand one chance in ten to be summoned : and those summoned and attending , would stand one chance in three to be drawn for the trial of a cause , and each individual upon the original list of three hundred would stand one chance in thirty to be drawn . But this is but one of the twelve . How many chances there may be for having twelve corrupt men upon the same jury , is a question that may be left to the mathematicians . But this is not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury for any informality in the mode in which they // are drawn , summoned , or impanneled . He has also a right to challenge for want of the requisite qualifications , for bias in favor of either party , or for his having been convicted of any infamous crime ; and in criminal cases it is cause for challenge that the juror has formed an opin5on concerning the guilt or innocence of the accused . And every person arraigned and put on trial for an offense punishable with death or by imprisonment in the State prison for ten years or any longer time , has a right to challenge peremptorily-that is , to reject without giving a reason-twenty of the persons drawn as jurors for such trial . The reason of the rule is this . A juror is challenged for cause . The challenge is not sustained . During the trial of the challenge-that is , of the question whether such jnror is competent or not  --  the feelings of the juror may become excited , especially if he were challenged for having committed a felony . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disposed unjustly to convict . The accused having failed in his legal challenge , rejects the juror by his peremptory challenge . This rule is very important to the prisoner , and enables him to reject a juror when he has reason to fear he is prejudiced against him . In all civil causes , either party , dissatisfied with the verdict of a jury , may appeal to a higher tribunal . In criminal cases , there is no review of the verdict of a jury , ex*p t where that review is intended to befor the benefit of the person con victed. - - It is the humane policy of the law , that a person charged with the commission of crime , shall be entitled to the full benefit of all doubt and uncertainty that rests on his case ; and it is provided by the Constitution of the United States , that no per . son shall be twice put in jeopardy of life or hmWfor the same offense . This , of course , does not apply to cases where the jury do not agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the jurors who dissented from the rest were committed to prison . And although they were not suffered to eat or drink , or go at large , the justices were sometimes required to carry them about in carts until they had agreed upon a verdict . But no such forcing process is now used , and if a jury can not agree within a reasonable time , they are discharged . That the present mode of appointing jurors is the best that can be devised , seems now to be plain . It may not be free from objections . What human institution is ? But the power of appointment is so far removed from the parties interested , // as to leave little room for abuse . Add to all these circumstances one other , that any person , interested in obtaining an impartial jury , may , beforehand , procure the names of the jurors to be summoned , in order to be prepared with his reasons for challenge ; and the chances for fraud and corruption are so small as little to be feared . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impartial trial , by procuring a special or struck jury . The parties , after procuring an order for that purpose , attend before the clerk of the county , who selects from the list of jurors the names of forty-eight persons whom he thinks most indifferent between the parties , and best qualified to try the particular cause for which they are required* One name is then struck from the list by each party alternately , till the list is reduced to twenty-four names , which are certified by the clerk to be the persons drawn to serve as jurors . These twentyfour persons are summoned , and a jury of twelve is drawn from them as in other cases . Errors in judgment and mistakes as to facts may , and often do occur ; but these , so far from proving that the institution is not the best that can be devised , only go to show the weaknesses of human nature , and the imperfections of the human understanding . As yet , nothing has been said of the organization of the grand jury . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless on a piresentment or indictment of a grand jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger . This body is selected in nearly the same manner as the common or petit jury . The number is limited to three hundred in each county , who are selected by the board of supervisors , and a new list is prepared every year . The mode of drawing and summoning is the same as that for the petit jury . Twenty-four are summoned to attend any court of criminal jurisdiction , but no more than twenty-three , nor less than sixteen , can be sworn to serve on any one jury ; and the concurrence of twelve is necessary to find an indictment . Their deliberations must be private , and they are not permitted to disclose the fact of an indictment having been found for a felony , when the person indicted is not in actual confinement , until such person shall have been arrested . And in all cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if unexplained , convict the accused of the crime charged in the indictment . Questions of fact are usually submitted to jurors under the // direction of the court , who explain to them the law applicable to the case . Juries may , however , find a special verdict-that is , the facts which are proved before them-still leaving it to the court to pronounce the law upon the facts Thoughjuries are one of the most powerful instruments of the law , yet they are by no means superior to the law . They may be indicted for corrupt conduct in the finding of their verdict ; and if a juror take a gift from a party to a suit he is drawn to try , besides being liable to indictment , he is subject to a fine of ten times the value of the gift ; and the giver is also fined in like manner . But unless liable to indictment , a juror can not be cjuestioned for any verdict . It is proper also to add , that their compensation does not depend upon their verdict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entirely separated from the executive and the law-making powers . Jurors do not derive their appointment from either , or from any other officers deriving their authority from the same source . By the manner in which they are appointed , and by the exercise of their powers , the principle of sovereignty is universally diffused among the people . In monarchical governments , an almost divine reverence is paid to the theory which teaches that all power emanates - from the king ; while the citizens of a free republic recognize the living fact , that it is derived from the people . The people , then , in selecting jurors , and the jurors as representatives of the people , in exercising the powers delegated to them , enjoy some of the highest prerogatives of sovereignty . It may be objected , that jurors are unduly influenced in the verdicts they render , by the eloquence of counsel , and by the sympathetic feelings that are excited in them . But let it be remembered that sympathy , if it exists , is always on the side of distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be - weakness in a jury to be thus affected , yet that noble feeling should be cherished in their bosoms . The law intends that a jury shall consist of twelve men having human feelings , and not of twelve monsters in whom the fires of love and benevolence were never kindled . They should not be like so many rocks in the midst of the desert , on which no wave of human sympathy can beat , but rather like the beacon-lights on the green isles of the ocean , holding out to the last , to the wanderer who is willing to return to duty , the promise of forgiveness and hope . In criminal cases , jurors are the judges both of the law and the fact ; and if the law has not in its tenderness authorized the // exercise of a generous sympathy , it has not in its cruelty forbidden it . While it commands them to be just in the exercise of mercy , it permits them to be merciful in the dispensation of justice . It teaches them to judge as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attendance of jurors upon courts is a great school of wisdom and knowledge , where they learn many useful things , of which they would else for ever remain ignorant . The great qualifications of which they are , almost without exception , possessed , are honesty and good sense . With these they are able to comprehend the strong points of a case , overlooking or disreg rding the minute and perplexing technicalities of the law , and in most cases their decisions answer the ends of justice . IRetaining in their memory what is claimed on one side , and admitted or denied on the other , as well as what is determined by the court , they learn many valuable principles of elementary law . Although it is a maxim , that " ignorance of the law excuseth no man , " it can not be doubted that its precepts would be less frequently broken , if they were better understood ; and it is to be feared that many who are enjoying the blessings of liberty which this institution contributes so powerfully to strengthen and preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would exist , if its powers should be limited , or its existence destroyed .
