NEW ENGLANDER . No . XXXI . AUGUST , 1850 . ART . 1. - LIBERALISM IN EUROPE . History of the French Revolution of 1848 . By A. DE LAMARTINE. 2 vols . Boston : Philips , Sampson &amp; Co. 1849 . To write a satisfactory history of a great popular revolution , we regard as a very grave affair . It can not be done in haste . It is difficult to do it , soon after the event occurs . It may also be added , that the instances are rare , in which it has been well done by those who were themselves chief actors in the occurrences narrated . Time is ordinarily required , to the end that the subject may be studied on all sides ; that the impressions and the testimonies of many persons may be brought together and compared ; and that the excitements and the sympathies called forth by the occasion may subside , and leave the mind to calm and healthful action . All that it is reasonable to expect , in such a case , is that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures no matter how fresh and lively , of what they have seen and known , or of what they have thought and purposed if personally concerned ; and these will furnish the materials out of which , when the proper time arrives , the philosophic historian may construct his well-labored , comprehensive , and impartial work . If , therefore , in writing the history of the late revolution in France , M. de Lamartine has failed to accomplish all that must be ultimately demanded , there are obvious reasons for the failure , which are not at all connected with any question as to the qualifications of the writer for his task . We doubt , however , whether the genius of this brilliant man is well adapted to historical composition . His temperament is ardent and impulsive ; his imagin // ation kindles easily , and rises often to wild and airy flights ; his currents of thought are rapid , and his generalizations not seldom seem to rest on too small a basis ; and although his reflections are often highly original and striking , he lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous reasoning . Even his History of the Girondins , justly popular as it is , does not , in our opinion , rank in the highest class of histories . Still less does the History of the Revolution of 1848 . This work , well known already to the reading public , is written with dramatic spirit , and portions of it with a thrilling power and interest ; yet it exhibits , nevertheless , the defects which would naturally be expected from the characteristic peculiarities of the author . It has , however , a special value , as the apparently honest personal narrative , of a truth-loving , generous , and right-hearted man-himself the hero of the story-written while every incident was fresh in memory . This is all we propose to say of M. de Lamartine or of his book at present . Indeed it would be out of season now to say much more . But as it was the demolition of the throne of the House of Orleans , and the establishment of the French Republic , that opened the drama the progress of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which reached its catastrophe when the sword of the Austrian butcher entered the heart of hungary ; the history of this first act , affords an appropriate point from which to take a departure , in submitting a few thoughts in relation to the actual results of the late deterniiried struggle of the nations for the attainment of a happier social and political condition . We think it of great importance to the cause of freedom that these results should be correctly understood ; and we would gladly contribute even a very little towards the right apprehension of the facts . The present is the offspring of the past . Then only do we comprehend our own time , when we consider it in its relation to all time . To a superficial reader , the history of the world presents only a long succession of struggles and of changes which seem to have been r*gulated by no steady principles , and to have led to no very great results . The revolutions of empires are innumerable . The rise and fall of states and cities , and of political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the events of every century , as we go backward towards the fabulous ages of the race . The men of every period are seen exhibiting signs of restlessness and aspiration ; sensible of wants , and striving and hoping for the attainment of a better condition arid the coming of brighter days . Yet on a hasty view , but little appears to have been accomplished after all . Still the whole race is nnsatisfied ; large portions of it are wretched , and the day of general perfection of condition and of universal joy , looks as remote as ever . // 331 To more profound and thoughtful minds , however , another view presents itself . To such it appears that the travail and the groans of ages have by no means been in vain . There is seen to be reason enough for the opinion that , on the whole , there has been a steady progress towards those things for which the hearts of men have sighed , and to reach which they have striven and suffered ; a progress not always indeed discernible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentary reactions ; but yet a real and prevailing progress . If we admit this to be the truth , we shall of course be disposed to consider the agitations of our own time as the effects of powerful and far-reaching causes , and not of mere impulses and accidents which are wholly of to-day . We shall regard them with hope , and not with despair . Never , perhaps , in any age , were a greater number of thrilling occurrences crowded into an equal period , than have filled the last two years of European history . It was the fortune of the writer to pass over a large part of the arena on which these conflicts have been waged , but a little before the commencement of the strife . We were struck with the portentous calm , the prehide , as it afterward appeared , to the coming whirlwind . We heard the deep low murmur of snffering humanity . We saw power leaning on the apparently firm l ) illars of established and consolidated institutions ; confident in itself , and regardless of the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princes proved delusive . The storm of revolution scattered them like chaff . The civilized world was startled ; and for a time , all eyes and ears were turned , with intense solicitude , towards the fields of desperate strife . It seemed as if universal humanity were rising , in awful majesty , to avenge the xvrongs of ages . But the tempest has gone by . The world breathes again . The hopes of some , and the fears of others , have been realized in the crushing of revolutionary movements , and to some extent in the establishment of the old regimes . Rome , Florence , Venice , Milan , Turin , every part of Italy which dared to strike for liberty , is obliged to succumb to overwhelming force . France holds an ambiguous position , and seems not unlikely to be cheated of the boon for which so many of her sons have bled . Germany already finds her vision of unity fading into thin air ; and heroic Hungary has seen her hopes extinguish ed in the tears and blood of her noblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are effectually subdued . The world laments that the cause of freedom is thrown back . Patriotism is sinking down again in deep despondency ; and brave and high-s ouled men , of late the champions of the people , are wandering over the world in sadness , bearing the bitter woes of exile . What then is , in fact , the position of the cause of freedom in Continental Europe ? This is a question of deep and universal // interest . It is a question of fact , and not of speculation . It is a question on which we are probably not without the means of making at least an approximation to the truth . We shall solve it , if at all , by a careful consideration of the character of the opposing parties , and of the nature and power of the principles which have been brought into collision in the contest between governors and governed . We may perhaps discover , on the side of the liberals themselves , some causes which have necessarily operated to prevent their entire success ; and likewise some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given it some temporary favor and strength . It does not follow of course , that because the masses move , they move towards genuine freedom . It is not certainly true , that because governments resist the upheavings of the masses , they act in opposition to wholesome liberty . We must look deeper than mere names . Governments may move in a way to favor freedom ; and the people may do that which tends only to subvert it . And it is doubtless rarely true when parties are contending , that all the good is on the one side , and all the evil on the other . It is clear that it has not been so in most political contentions . In order to comprehend the present state of the cause of human rights in Europe , there are two questions to be answered . The first is-What is the true idea of social liberty ? The second-How far has this been comprehended and regarded , by the so-called liberal parties ? If we can satisfactorily answer these inquiries , we shall attain a just view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often misconceived , is a very obvious fact . That it should now be clearly understood by the great body of the people in the principal states of Europe , blinded and oppressed as they have been for ages , it would be unreasonable to expect . Doubtless there are many who have no other notion of it , than that it is freedom from all restraint  --  the power in each individual man , of doing just as he pleases . But a moment 's reflection shows , that the only condition in which such liberty can be conceived , is that of the absolute isolation of the individual from the species . The hermit who dwells apart in the solitude of the desert or of the mountain cave , who has not a single relation to any of his kind , may if he chooses , enjoy an entire freedom from restraint . Man in society never did and never can enjoy it . His individual will must often be checked , restrained , or modified , by collision with the wills of others . It is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in the gross and complicated mass of human passions and concerns , the primitive rights of men undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections , that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction . " Still , it is true that man in society has rights which are inalienable ; rights // which neither the convenience nor the pleasure of others , may justly limit or wrest away . What then is social liberty , in the right conception of it ,  --  the question again returns . No one , perhaps , can give a better answer , than that which Sir James Mchtosh , that most acute as well as most learned arid elegant of writers on fundamental law , has given . " The description of liberty , " says he , " which seems to me the most comprehensive , is that of security against wrong . " And he adds in the same connection , that " men are more free under every government , even the most imperfect , than they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any government at all ; " which is simply saying , that even tyranny allows a larger degree of liberty than anarchy . This is not to be disputed . Government is necessary to protect individual man from being xvronged by other individuals about him ; and when it faithfully fulfills its function in this matter , he is , so far , truly free . But government armed with power to afford protection , may itself become the oppressor . Hence it is necessary that by a written constitution or other suitable means , governmental power should be confined to its appropriate work and limits . The right idea of social liberty , therefore , is that of a state in which individual man is secure against the infringement of his personal rights , by his associates in the civil body on the one hand , and by the governors who rule him , on the other . Wherever the individual is effectually protected from injustice at the hands of the many who compose society , and of the one or few who administer the government , there is genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social state is possible . Restraints on personal inclination , impulse , will , there must of necessity be many ; but there will be not one more than the general good requires . Liberty without such restraints , would be perpetual war of conflicting passions , the most insufferable of despotisms , iii its results . With them , it is freedom conjoined with safety , harmony and order . Such we take to be the proper notion of wholesome social liberty , the liberty which human hearts must always yearn for till they find it . Now it is plain that such liberty as this , is the golden mean , whose two extremes are anarchy and despotism . Anarchy usually arrogates to itself the name of liberty , and despotism claims to be the representative of order . In fact , however , anarchy is liberty run mad , and despotism is order petrified . But since order is an indispensable condition of social happiness , society if brought to the alternative , will choose order without liberty , in preference to liberty without order . Fronci the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when in the great struggles of the people against arbitrary power , the cause of genuine freedom becomes incidentally associated with elements of disorganization and disorder , // it will fail to make great progress . It xviii be likely to suffer temporary checks , and perhaps some serious reverses . There will be found not a few who will stand aloof ; or incline to the side of power , from a dread of the excesses of infuriated mobs , urged on by blind and lawless passions . It is only when disconnected from such evil adjuncts , and standing forth as the friend and ally of moderation , intelligence , and general justice , that liberty commands the homage and gains the suifrages of all classes of mankind , to such an extent that she can advance to real and enduring victories . We have thus explained what seems to be the true idea of social liberty . The second question now presents itself . Has this idea been comprehended , and made the basis of their action , by the liberals of Europe , in the struggles which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all large bodies of men acting together in relation to any subject , some individuals who xviii be far in advance of the majority in the breadth and clearness of their views . But we are to look at the movement as a whole . Such men as Lamartine and Arago , Mazzini , Mamiani and Kossuth , with others less conspicuous , are not to be taken as representing the opinions and the temper of the masses . They were the master spirits whose immense intellectual superiority gave them their political preeminence , and enabled them to direct and modify somexvhat the aims and wishes of the people . And it was the greatest of all embarrassments to the most enlightened of the leaders , that taken altogether , the liberal party was composed of the most heterogeneous materials , and was greatly defective in intelligence and soberness as well as unity . It lacked most palpably definiteness of views , soundness of principle , and simpleness of purpose . To these deficiencies are , without doubt , in no small be ascribed its partial failure . We say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views on the revolutionary side . We do not alledge it as a fault ; it was rather a misfortune , growing out of the nature of things ; still it is to be noticed as a fact . question any of that mighty multitude of human beings from the common xvalks of life , who stood up in the name of God and aggrieved humanity against oppression . Ask that care-worn , anxious-looking , and now excited man , who has helped to raise the revolutionary shout , what are his notions as to what is best for himself and for the social system . He answers in vague and general terms . Press him with questions . He looks puzzled and in doubt . He does not know precisely what it is he wants . One or two things there are , undoubtedly , which he knows well enough . He knows that his political relations are not what they should be . He is sure that there is something wrong somexvhere in the constitution of society . He is thoroughly convinced that he was not made to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have his hands bound , his conscience bound , his thoughts bound , his very soul made subject to the will and power of others . There is a deep sense of injury which chafes his soul . He carries within him a consciousness that he is fitted for higher ends , and better destinies of life , than those which are before him . And along with these , exists the hope that in overturning and destroying existing forms of government , relief may at length be found . Such is a picture of the individual liberalist . It is of course substantially the picture of the masses . rrhe crowds that thronged the Champs Elys*6 , the Place Vendome , and the Boulevards des Italiens at Paris , duri*ig the days of February , knew little more than that they really had no political rights and privileges ; that some of the advantages of civil life must rightfully be theirs ; and that there was at least a chance of something better in a change . The same was true of those who at Palermo and at Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Milan and Genoa , as well as in the smaller and larger states of central Europe , lifted up the battle cry for freedom . The true idea of liberty , as consisting simply in that personal security against wrong , by means of which each individual should have full power to make the most of his own capacities , and to eat in peace the fruits of his own labor , they had not comprehended . How should they have understood it ? The whole structure of European society is fitted to perplex and baffle the common mind , exerting as it must , a silent , steady influence from childhood upwards , on all its thoughts and feelings . When the people look about them , they see so many evidences that for ages the many have been subject to the few , that it seems almost as though there is priinafacie evidence that this is according to the course of nature and to the will of God . It is true there is something in each man 's heart that abjures the dogma . But , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoary witnesses that the vassalage of the many has been the established order of things in by-gene centuries . There are the palaces in which popes and princes have wielded the sceptre of despotic power , in the various forms of spiritual and temporal dominion , from time immemorial . There are the names and the monuments of long dynasties of sovereigns , to whom a divine legitimacy has been conceded , and whose right to reign has passed without a question . Connected with the established governments , both ecclesiastical and civil , there are many associations of dignity and grandeur , many traditions of glorious deeds achieved , and of administrations which were wise in their policy , and useful and happy in their influence on society . It is difficult for men to rid themselves of the impressions which such things naturally make upon the mind , and which often cause plain truths and almost selfevident // principles to appear obscure and doubtful . Some are able to do this more , and some less , as the case may be . The same individual , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and at another , towards the novel and the experimental . A great many shades of opinion and of feeling are thus produced among the different classes which make up society ; and it is hard for the masses of the people , destitute as they are to a very considerable extent of even elementary education , to attain to well-defined and rational views of the sources of the evils which exist , and of the nature of the changes which they want . Such views , as a matter of fact , they have not yet been able to attain . And while it is not to be denied that the popular party in revolutionary Europe has been greatly defective in its views of the rights and the necessities of the body of the people , it is equally plain that the political principles which have been generally imbibed and acted on , are many of them radically false . The attempt has been made to construct the social system on unsound and impracticable foundations , an attempt in which failure was of course inevitable . In the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following principles are clearly fundamental . First-that government , in some form , is a matter of necessity and not of choice . Secondly-that it is the right of the people , to determine what shall be the form of the government and by whom it shall be administered . Thirdly-that equal natural rights belong to all who compose the state . Fourthly-that all duties originating in the relations of the individual to society are reciprocal . In relation to the first two of these elementary truths , the most pernicious errors have prevailed extensively , not only among the unlearned and unrefiecting , but among the philosophers , the statesmen and the popular writers who have chiefly molded public sentiment . France has been the fertile hot-bed of error on this subject . The eloquence with which Rousseau maintained the absurd opinions that the savage state is the natural and most perfect state of man , and that society is only a voluntary compact , which may not only be modified as respects its form , but abrogated altogether at the pleasure of its members , caused these gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Revolution . These unsound doctrines have been assisted to obtain and keep their hold by the widely prevailing atheism . This dreary form of unbelief-. - in part the natural reaction of a corrupt Christianity , and in part the fruit of a shallow but arrogant philosophy set off by the witticisms of Voltaire and // the sophistries of the Encyclopedists ,  --  in denying a government to the universe , denies a natural basis to the government of the state . rj7he divine existence being admitted , the dominion of order and of law , as a means of order throughout the universe , follows as a matter of course . Or to place the point in another light , since man 's nature is such that he can not live but in society , and since society can not exist but under government , which gives it organic form , it is a plain conclusion that government itself is a part of the economy of nature , and is to be traced directly up to the will of God . The form of the government and the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of each state , expressing their will in a proper manner . But whether government shall exist or not , as a necessary condition of social welfare , is not , we repeat , a question submitted to man at all . Its necessity lies in the constitution of humanity and of the world . The misconception of so material a point must always prove disastrous in its influence on any efforts at the reconstruction of the social system . A political fabric , resting on loose foundations , and built by fallacious rules , will rise only to fall in ruins . That there must be in every rightly organized society , a full recognition of the entire equality of men in respect to natural rights , is also a vital principle . It is the principle that makes man truly man , whoever or wherever he may be . It is the principle which cuts up root and branch , the pretension , whether of kings or priests , to control by divine right the person or the conscience . It is the principle which makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What it demands for each individual , is that he shall have the same liberty as others to be what he can be , and to do what he can do ; the same security in acquiring good , and in possessing and enjoying it . This is the true meaning of the doctrine . But in the apprehension of great numbers among the revolutionary masses , it has been fatally perverted . The writers of various shades who have advocated communism , from St. Simon to Proudhon and Louis Blanc , have gone so far as to claim not only an equality of rights , but an equality of possessions also . these two things are as different as possible . The principle of equal rights allows to A and B aim equal freedom and equal security in the improvement and exercise of their own powers , and in the acquisition and enjoyment of every attainable object of desire . But suppose that while A is at work , B is idle ; that while A is frugal that he may accumulate something for his future use or pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to dissipation and extravagance . By and by , one has property , the other none . One is rich , if you please , the other poor . One reaps the fruit of his honest industry ; the other that of his willful laziness and vice . Now communism // asserts that this lazy , VICiOLlS , profligate spendthrift , has just as good a right to the earnings and the savings of the industrious , the virtuous , the self-denying laborer , as that laborer himself has . This is according equal rights with a witness , certainly . It is the subversion of all right ; the most cruel and detestable injustice . If any thing like this must be a condition of living in society , there would be ample reason for advocating the savage state as better . No wonder that liberal movements , so far as directed by such a perversion of sound principle , should be regarded by the wise with great distrust . We mentioned one more elementary truth , that of the reciprocity of duties between the individual and society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be unreasonable expectations and demands upon the one hand , and unjust impositions and restraints upon the other . It is the duty of society to ask no more of the individual than the surrender of such rights as it is really necessary to the public good that he should yield . The individual , on the contrary , must demand uo more from society , than it is consistent with the public good to grant . It is the duty of society , by its government , its laws and institutions , to secure to the individual the enjoyment of his personal rights and safety ; and so it is the duty of the individual to lend his influence in support of the rights and safety of society . Society may impose upon the individual his fair proportion of all public burdens ; the individual may claim that society allow him his fair share of social privileges . Society by its organic power and wisdom , is to seek the elevation and improvement of the individual , in the promotion of education , the fostering of industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual owes it to society to repay the debt by habits of diligence , economy and virtue ; by adding , to the extent of his powers and opportunities , to the common means of happiness . In short , the relation is to produce a constant interchange of benefits . Of course it follows that the flagrant neglect of duty on the one side , cancels the corresponding obligation on the other . It the individual is idle and profligate in character , society is not bound to distribute to him the earnings of the industrious and frugal . If he invades the rights and endangers the safety of the public , society no longer owes him its protection , but for its own security , may deprive him of his privileges , or even of the power to pursue his mischievous designs . Choosing to make himself a public pest , he may be dealt with as such . All this has plainly been but little understood by no small portion of those who have swelled the excited crowds of Paris , and other revolutionary centres . Vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing for them , while they should do nothing for society . They have forgotten their own respon // sibilities , and made exorbitant and unjust demands . In this way they have prejudiced the popular cause , and thrown large and influential classes on the side of its opposers . That a movement which was thus characterized by the vagueness of its views , and the unsoundness of many of its principles , should lack singleness of purpose , was inevitable . When our own fathers lifted the flag of revolution , they understood the nature of the work to be accomplished . They knew what freedom was , and they resolved to have it . To this sole end they directed their united efforts . They moved almost as one man in the struggle . This it was that made them strong . But in France and Italy , in Switzerland , Austria and Prussia , diversity of views and theories have generated powerful factions , whose codperation , if they did cooperate , was imperfect . Under the revolutionary impulse , there was a might y heaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing towards a definite point . There were men of intellect , men of courage , men of enthusiasm among the leaders ; but while there were some who were not wanting in political experience arid sound integrity , there were many who were with reason distrusted in respect to both these qualifications , and the number was very small of those whose high moral qualities commanded the admiration and secured the implicit confidence of all . It was a natural consequence that a very considerable portion of the more intelligent and prudent class of citizens , did not dare to venture into what seemed rather a great melee of all kinds of restless elements , than a rational and well-directed movement ; that they were led to seek neutrality , or even to favor governments which were ready to promise all reasonable reforms . It was this sort of holding back , in central Europe more especially , which brought the revolution to a stand , and defeated the wellnigh consummated project of a German Empire , with ample guarantees of constitutional liberty . The more moderate portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their political anchorage , to drift without any certain destination upon a stormy sea . With a greater amount of popular enlightenment , with better political and social theories , with sounder moral convictions in place of the recklessness of rabid atheism , and along with these a spirit of codperation instead of mutual distrust , moving the whole liberal party towards the one great end of establishing the wholesome liberty which rests on order and just laws , the wave which dashed against the thrones of Europe would have s*vept them away forever . It was the great misfortune of the cause of human freedom , that these evils could not be avoided . They were the natural results of those very oppressions against which war was waged . We refer to them simply as facts which are quite obvious , and which help to // explain the failure of the liberal spirit to attain a trinmp'h . The genius of reform has been not unlike the Cyclops , when , Ulysses and his companions having put out his eye , he cast about him with all his giant force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hilled because of his blindness , to do the execution he intended . We are by no means disposed , then , to consider the reverses , and the present apparently discouraging prospects of the cause of liberalism , as indicating any inherent weakness in the cause itself . These do not prove at all , as we conceive , either that the true wants of society , and the right principles of social organizatioti , government , and progress , are not coming speedily to be well comprehended by the great body of the people , or that when they shall be , the pressure toward healthful freedom will not be irresistible . We take the affirmative of both these propositions . We are persuaded that the people of Europe are learning , and will eve long arrive at a competent knowledge of the truth ; and that when they have attained it , they will be as irre*istihle as Niagara . The people , it is obvious , are learning by the universal acceleration of ideas . The state of society which the absolute governments of Europe are laboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages in which power dwelt undisturbed by popular murmurs in its old stone towers , and the people slept in the inglorious repose of ignorance , and of unaspiring vassalage . But the owls and the bats are now scared from these time-worn battlements , by the scream of* the locomotive . The shades are past . Daylight is streaming everywhere . The worldwide commotions of the last half century have so waked humanity to its high destinies that it can never sleep again . The great heart of the civilized world is palpitating with excitement , and in its energetic throbbing is driving the warm life-blood through all parts of the social system . Popes can not stop it . Kings can not stop it . Precedents , associations , aristocracies , institutions , armies even can not stop it . Whatever may obstruct , it will make to itself a way . Meanwhile the constitutional liberty of En gland , and the still more perfect constitutional liberty of the United States , are living illustrations in the sight of all the world , of the practicability of the union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom as thus exemplified , it is impossible to conceal from the growing millions of the contitient . Every traveler that ascends the Rhine , or climbs the Alps , that iin*ers about the classic Amno , or communes with the past upon the Tiher , will carry with him , and will inevitably let fall , such facts and thotights as will serve to feed the fire that burns concealed in the breasts of thousands . Every intelligent emigrant from the Old World to our own shores , as often as he writes // a letter of friendship to those whom he has left behind , will tell them of the difference between a land of freedom and the house of bondage. the interests of commerce , of manufactures , of science , art and letters , all tend in the same direction , all help to circulate , to mingle and intermingle , the views and sentiments , political and moral , of the civilized world . To labor to preserve the ancient statu quo , in these circumstances , is to resist the sweep of time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also true that the liberals of Europe are learning by experience . Contrast , in illustration of this statement , the late revolution in France with that at the close of the last century . In coml ) arison with the horrible ferocity which seemed to possess all hearts in the Reign of rperror , the temper of the Parisian populace in the days of February , was gentleness itself . Never , perhaps , was a revolution , changing the political condition of thirtysix millions of l ) eople , effected with so little bloodshed , and with so speedy a re*stablishrnent of order . It was , in no small rneastire , because the lessons of the former time were well remembered . The desire to avoid the errors and the miseries of that melancholy period was general and deep . The revolution of July , which gave the throne to the house of Orleans , had likewise fixed some wholesome truths in the public mind . And such doubtless has been the result everywhere of the movements of 48 . It is not at all to be believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought for many months together , that so many plans have been formed , so many things attempted , and so many acts heroically done , and yet the people are no wiser . Ignorance and folly live where mind is torpid , and where thought stagnates in its fountains . It is doubtless by successive steps , perhaps through the painful discipline of yet other unsuccessful struggles , that those who bear the wrongs of oppressive government , will be prepared to gain and enjoy a full enfranchisement . In the late contests they have learned their own strength as they had never learned it before . rphey have ascertained how many souls there are that pant for liberty , and how much the zeal and courage of such numbers , even though encompassed by many disadvantages , is able to achieve . They have made the discovery  --  and it is one of moment-that beneath the uniform of standitig armies , warm , sympathizing human hearts are beating , arid that this apparertly firm prop of power may fail it in its need , and even help to hurl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rocks and shoals on which their cause , in its efforts to advance , is in most danger of making wreck . And not the least of all , they have informed themselves , in a degree , of the tactics and resources of the enemies of progress . All this will not be lost . The wisdom gained will remain written ineffaceably on the memories of men . It will add greatly to the effectiveness of future // efforts , whether in the cabinet or in the field , in the discussions of the assembly and the press , or in the plotting and execution of new schemes of revolution . So far , at least , the cause of liberty has gained , and its martyrs have not bled in vain , although it has not reached the highest ends towards which it has been striving . And let the great body of the people of Europe once become intellectually and morally elevated to a capacity for self-governrnent , and nothing adverse to their freedom , however venerable by age , or however entrenched by strong defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not say that the same forms of government and the same institutions of society , will be established everywhere . This is a matter of small moment . All that should be looked for , all that can reasonably be desired , is that the social organization , whatever l ) articular shape it may assume , shall be grounded in just principles , and shall be thoroughly pervaded with the spirit of genuine liberty . We predict with confidence this final triumph of the popular cause . Not merely because we wish that it may triumph . Not in a spirit of poetical dreaming which loves to conjure up bright visions of the future . We make it the solid ground of our prediction , that there are causes in operation which must act with the steadiness and power of nature 's laws to bring the event to pass . There is the sense of justice in the bosom of every man ; of that justice which is outraged by the principles and practices of despotism , whether secular or spiritual . So long as men can be kept ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be too confused to form the basis of any vigorous action . But when , as now in Europe , they can no longer be kept in such a state when once they are excited to intellectual activity , and have within their reach the means of coming at right views , then they will grasp the great principles of natural justice with a clearness of apprehension , and a conviction of individual responsibility , which will prepare them to act against oppression with unconquerable energy . There is no such thing as crushing enlightened , earnest men , who carry , living and burning in their souls , the assurance that God and truth are on their side . They may be doomed to the dungeon , the bullet , or the scaffold ; but in place of every one who is thus made an offering for the welfare of mankind on the altars of a cruel tyranny , ten others shall come up full of their power and spirit , to watch the steps of tyrants . Along with the sense of justice , there is developed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instinctive appetite for freedom . This is a feeling rather than an intellection . It is a yearning of the heart ; vague it may be , but deep and strong as the affections of the soul , and most powerful as a spring of // action . It belongs to universal humanity , and the more elevated men become , the more difficult it is to quiet it , without bestowing the good it craves . It is th 's gnawing of a restless heart in millions of bosoms through all the states of Europe , which disposes the people to welcome agitation ; which is as tinder to the electric spark of liberty ; which urges men to risk name and property and life itself , in the endeavor to gain a position in which they can feel that they are men . It is the same at the foot of iI*tna , over the plains of sunny Italy , on the banks of the Danube , the Vistula , or the Rhine , and in the streets of Paris . And when under the pressure of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , and guided by the dear-botight wisdom of experience in political contentions , the common people of Europe shall fairly muster in their united strength in the last great battle for the rights of man , they will be as overwhelming as an Alpine avalanche . In the complete triumph of free principles , there will be developed a civilization such as the world has never seen . Nor must we omit to add , that in no former age could Christianity , the noblest of all charters of the rights of man , the most efficient of all elevating agencies , exert its vital forces , as it is now coming to exert them , in bringing in the reign of freedom . Never so much as now , did it seem to be evolving its spiritual truth and power , and disengaging itself from the false appendages with which human weakness and presumption in past ages , have encumbered it . Not only its general spirit , but its particular practical applications , are every day becoming at once more widely and more correctly understood . The Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is giving place to an enlightened largeness of heart which embraces all the world . Good men and great men are addressing themselves to the solution of the various problems connected with the causes and the cure of social evils , and are laboriously searching out the most effectual means of ennobling the human race , by vindicating everywhere the rights of conscience , and bringing the power of divine religion to bear directly on their hearts . True Christianity carries general education in its train . It breathes abroad the spirit of order and of peace . It inspires a love for all the genuine forms of beauty and of goodness , and is thus the mother of true taste and art . It begets the sense of personal responsibility , and a health. * ful and untiring zeal for the universal enlightenment and progress of mankind . In short , since it supplies the essential elements of happiness and growth to man in all the relations of his being , it must involve in its own vitality and diffusion , the highest attainable welfare of the race . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there is no occasion to despond in relation to the cause of liberalism in Continental // Europe , even in its present temporary reverses and embarrassments . These reverses and embarrassments are sufficiently accounted for , when we ascribe them to the errors , theoretical and practical , which are an accidental and not an essential part of liberal movements and which increasing knowledge and experience will certainly correct . The cause itself grounded as it is in vital truths , in the moral sense of the human soul , and the deep instinctive yearnings of the heart ; nourished as it is by the spirit of the age , by the circulation of ideas , and by the advancing influence of a pure and spiritual Christianity , may be regarded with a hope full of assurance . It must advance . It will advance . Of course there must be time for the instituted causes to work out their appropriate effects . The great Ruler of the vorld is never in haste ; but with the certainty of unchanging law , he evolves events . We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence , the enterprise and thrift , the virtue , the piety and social happiness which now characterize New England , and even a higher degree of all , are to fill the vast area between the Atlantic and Pacific shores . We already see the glorious era ,  --  with God 's leave but a little way before us ,  --  .  - -  when two hundred millions of freemen shall here dwell happily together . With equal faith may we expect , although indeed we can not place the period so near , that a day not less serene and joyful will break , ere very long , over all the face of Europe . There as here , humanity will stand erect . Society , in its whole economy , in the adjustment of all its relations and its interests will exhibit both political and moral soundness , both general justice avid general content . Whatever convulsions may precede , or may introduce a state of things so much to be desired , that day in which rational liberty shall be finally triumphant , will bring rest to the troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls who have suffered for its sake . It will quiet the throes of long agitated France . It will make lovely Italy forget the debasement and the tears of ages , and look more beautiful than ever , as she sits amidst the riches of historic ruins , and holds in her lap the choicest treasures of modern art . It will bring up wretched Spain from her medieval darkness and stagnation . The Pyrenees and the Jura shall catch the voice of freedom from the Appenines and from the Ural , and shall reflect it back in pleasant echoes . Germany shall have the national unity for which she sighs . Poland will live again . And Hungary , sad , bleeding Hungary , will remember Austrian butcheries only as having helped to make the fire of freedom burn brighter in all hearts . We utter not the idle words of enthusiastic rhapsody , nor yet do we pretend to any extraordinary prophetic insight . But , believe it , well-wishers of humanity : we speak the words of sober certainty and truth , so surely as there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the words of a brilliant poet , we will sayGlory to them that die in this great cause ! Kings , bigots , can inflict no brand of shame , Or shape of death to shroud them from applause* No-manglers of the martyr 's earthly frame ! Your hangman fingers can not touch his fame . Still in your prostrate land there shall be some Proud hearts , the shrines of Preedom ' * vested flame . Long trains of ill may pass unheeded , dumb , But VENGSANcE is behihd , and JUsTICE 15 to come !
