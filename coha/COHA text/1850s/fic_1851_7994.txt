Hale , Sarah Josepha Buell , 1788-1879 : THE TWO MITES. from The two mites ( 1851 ) " Verily , I say unto you , That this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury . "  --  Jesus , to his disciples .  --  St. Mark , xii . 43 . " Why ever to a shining mark Should human hope be reaching ? The heavens may fail to tell the tale That fading flowers are teaching : A little lamp outshines a star , Because the lamp is nearer  --  And Love divine may brighter shine , And come to conscience clearer , Reflected from this humble heroine 's story , Than Solomon 's could give , in all his glory . Poor Widow ! wasted , wan , and weak , I see thy footsteps falter , As through the throng , that flaunt along To gain God 's awful altar , Thou , in thy worn and week-day garb , From silken robes art shrinking  --  And , one by one , the proud pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestowed in ostentation , Will be as dross , weighed with thy pure oblation ! O , sad and stricken poverty ! A scanty pittance earning , How like the dream of cooling stream To lips with fever burning , The Saviour 's sweet and soothing words  --  As though the poor addressing  --  Come in the hour of sorrow 's power  --  " The widow wins the blessing ! " O woman ! in the depths of want and sadness , Heaven holds for thee a fount of hope and gladness ! The cedar 's shade , like cloud , may lie Athwart the lily 's brightness  --  Yet why complain ? it leaves no stain To mar the blossom 's whiteness ; And darkly thus may pride and power Appear to press the lowly  --  Yet never may the shadow stay Where faith , like blossom holy , Keeps white the heart  --  to such there will be given A blest assurance of the love of Heaven !
