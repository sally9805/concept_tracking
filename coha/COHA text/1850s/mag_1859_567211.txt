ARTICLE IX. - AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION . THE cultivation of the soil is the great occupation of the American people . Our agriculture employs more labor and more capital than all other departments of industry combined . Under these circumstances it is a remarkable , and at first sight an unaccountable fact , that there is among us an almost total deficiency of agricultural education . Our condition in this respect presents a contrast to that of other countries , which have reached the same grade of civilization as ourselves . France has its agricultural school in every department , Germany in almost every province , and England a source of the most enlightened practice in the careful study which every large landholder gives to the cultivation of the soil . Our own country , with all its enterprise in practical art , and its pr&amp;minence in general education , is in this respect of agricultural science behind them all . It would seem at first sight that such a state of things must have its . origin either in the lack of knowledge to be communicated on agricultural subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some especial difficulties incidental to the dissemination of such knowledge among those engaged in agricultural pursuits .. In view of the obvious relations of the Natural Sciences to agriculture , and the rapid strides which they have made in advance during the last score of years , the first of these suppositions is extremely improbable . It can hardly be that accumulations of knowledge have not been realized in Chemistry , Geology , and Yegetable and Animal Physiology , of the most important bearing on the culture of the soil . So obviously must this be the fact in the case of chemical science , that the mind can scarcely fail to be satisfied of the truth without descending to those particulars which are at hand , for complete demonstration . Agriculture is , in fi*ct , chemistry on a large scale  --  the transformation of earth , and air , and // water ' , into bread , and meat , and the niaterial of clothing ; and it is scarcely possible that the results of the careful study of the laws of transformation on a small scale , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some light on the chemical work on a large scale , which is taking place in the great laboratory of the soil . It is certain that they have already done so , and that there are principles of chemical science already established , which , if universally diffused and applied , would suffice to increase , in an immense degree , the agricultural wealth of the world . As far , then , as the natural sciences are concerned , in their relation to agriculture , it may be confidently asserted that the deficiency of instruction among us is not a consequence of lack of knowledge to be communicated . Neither is this the case with those special sciences which have grown up within the field of agriculture itself , as a direct consequence of its practices and its necessities . On the principles involved in the breeding and rearing of animals , in the propagation of plants , in the production and perpetuation of varieties , on the diseases of plants and animals , on manuring and drainage , and irrigation , there are vast stores of information which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all its power and efficiency , has not as yet accomplished . And so , with reference to the care of crops and the feeding of animals ; the management of the dairy and a thousand other details of farm practice which have not as yet taken the form of science , there is an amount of knowledge existent in the minds of the best cultivators , the dissemination of which would be of immense value to the country . It is not , then , for lack of existent knowledge , either of science applied to agriculture , or of special agricultural science , or of superiority on the part of individuals in the details of farming , that there is nothing like a system of agricultural education among us . The second supposition of an already accomplished diffusion of the knowledge which exists on these subjects , it is scarcely worth while to consider . Once fertile farms all over our State // are becoming deserts for want of the simplest applications to the soil . Orchards in every part of the country waste the precious juices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lack of the grafting which would convert the same material of nature into the most luscious varieties . Valueless breeds of animals are everywhere perpetuated , when those of double the value could be propagated at the same cost , and adorn every landscape by their symmetry and beauty . Stunted cattle crop a scanty sustenance of thistles and weeds from pastures which might teem with nutritious grasses at no greater cost to the soil or its owner . Our barn-yards fairly shiver with the misery of poor dumb beasts who , in seeming luxury of cruelty , are tortured every winter by exposure to the rigors of our climate at an expense of food greater than would be required to house them in comfort . So long as this is the condition of our agriculture , notwithstanding the immense improvement which has been realized , both in farming and stock raising , within the past few years , it can hardly be maintained that our lack of systematic agricultural education finds its pleasant explanation in the general enlightenment of those engaged in agricultural pursuits . Neither is this deficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge among this class of our people . Wherever the common school exists , a dissemination of the elements of agricultural science might readily be accomplished , and higher institutions of learning would stand ready to complete the education thus commenced , in proportion to the demand upon them for such instruction . An explanation of the destitution of agricultural education among us , is rather to be sought in the history of our agriculture itself , than ii any of the directions which have been above indicated . It is to be found in the position which we have occupied as the occupants of a country comparatively new , rather than in any lack of importance of such education , or any difficulty in its accomplishment . Our fathers found it more profitable to bring new lands under cultivation than to maintain the fertility of the old . This course is still most profitable on the cheap and fertile soils of the west* and the // process of exhaustion is there in full tide of operation . Agriculture , under these circumstances , is an extremely simple process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market of the accumulated treasures of the soil . It needs as little help of science as the excavation of a guano island , or the plunder of an oyster bed . Our virgin soils are practically great grain deposits , bearing an analogy by no means remote to the coal treasures of an earlier geologic period . As long as such deposits exist , to be mined for wheat and corn , it is not strange that little occasion is felt for agricultural science . These accumulated treasures of the soil are the reward of the explorer . They are the prizes which nature offers to the hardy pioneer , who , with axe in hand , and plow to follow , goes forth to battle with hardship , and subdue the wilderness . The older States of our country are long past this period . The accumulated stores of nature being exhausted , agriculture has come to sustain , with them , a much nearer analogy to a process of manufacture than one of mere excavation . And it is a process in which it is quite as essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the production of broadcloths or calicoes . Wheat and beef can not be made out of air alone , and he who would produce them must furnish to the great manufacturing establishment of the soil , the proper materials for conversion . Our agriculture is palsied by a failure to perceive this truth . We persist in the absurd conviction that our wornout New England soil is an amiable mother , who only wants the flattery of occasional tickling with the plough and harrow* to induce her to make crops for us out of nothing , or at least to make for us large crops out of small materials . The fact is , however , indisputable , notwithstanding our I ) lindness , that agricultural production is reduced with us to a simple process of manufacture , in which we get back in a modified form just what we contribute to the soil . And this is the normal condition of agriculture all over the worldthe condition at which it must everywhere finally arrive , when there are no more new lands to be exhausted . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one direction . The soil is the ocean , the crop is the rising // cloud and vapor , the products of animal and vegetable decay are the rivers emptying again into the sea . So long as the rivers run back to their original source , their waters may rise again to commence a new circulation . If this return ceases , the sea itself must in time run dry . The product of the earth is , within certain limits , in direct proportion to the raw material which is furnished it . The maclime has not been overtasked ; its unexerted powers , on the contrary , are vastly greater than those it has been called on to employ . It stands ready to do fourfold its accustomed work , if the raw material is only supplied . But instead of furnishing it with the material for conversion , we prefer fGr the most part to let the machine use itself up in the production of a few crops , and there end its capacity , while we pass on to new acres and repeat the barbarous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . It is a plain rule of economy in all other production , instead of allowing machinery to rattle itself to ruin by running empty , to work it , on the other hand , to its full capacity , and to obtain from it the largest possible product . In a country which has reached the stage of development which ours has , and where the soil has become so expensive , it is the plain dictate of economy to proceed according to the same principle . But for this high farming , all of the helps of science are required . Science may aid to some extent in the crop-mining of a new country-in the crop-making of an old country it is indispensable . We need it , to cite a few instances in addition to those which have already been suggested , in drainage , in irrigation , in the use of the fertilizing materials with which nature has supplied us , and in the reclamation of waste lands . Our muck swamps are basins which God set long ago among our mountains to catch the wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of later generations . Science must tell us how to use these treasnres . They arc the wardrobes whence are to come garments for the granite ribs of our mountains , and a covering for the nakedness of our exhausted fields . Science must tell us how to unfold these vestments and reiirray our hills in beauty and fertility . // Our salt marshes are great water-logged prairies whose arteries need but to be throttled with dykes and humored by tide gates to convert them into the most fertile soils of the world . Science must tell us how this result is best to be accomplished . Our mountain streams hurry away to the sea , bearing with them a priceless freight of fertility which they have extracted from the crystalline masses of our primitive rocks . Science must teach us how they shall best be distributed over the land and woven into tender and nutritious grasses , instead of pouring themselves into the ocean , and ministering to the growth of the fuci and algae of a marine vegetation . Our wide sand plains , with oaks growing on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain vegetable life , are constant reminders of a gross ignorance which stands in need of that simple help from science , which shall inform us what grasses will be the readiest to lift their spears , there , in a warfare with the desert , or what other plants will serve as the pioneers of a successful vegetation . And we need science not alone here in the original subjugatioii of unproductive soils , but at every step of their future cultivation . For in a comparatively thickly settled country like our own , agriculture must consist every year more and more in the stock raising , and dairy farming , and market gardening , and fruit growing , *vhiclm is to supply large towns with the material of their consumption . It must run every year more and more into the refinements of liorticultui*e , with its hot beds and its forcing houses , its various devices of propagation and multiplication , and its manifold appliances for promoting healthy growth and controlling disease . But there is little question among intelligent men as to the need . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffused knowledge is to be supplied . The press does much , but by no means all that is required . The contact of man with man , and of mind with mind , is necessary to inspire the enthusiasm which is essential to a rapid progress . The introduction of books on elementary science into our Common Schools would be a great step in advance , but here // again there would be the absence of that contact of the man of knowledge with the men who need it , which is essential to the highest success . Shall we wait for the establishment by government of great agricultural institutions , similar to those of continental Europe ? Such institutions are among the most obvious and essential wants of our time , but a public and general opinion of their utility and necessity must be created , before either our state or national governments will seriously consider their establishment ? Shall we await the results of private enterprise or beneficence in the creation of Agricultural Institutions with their model farms and apparatus of instruction , and their corps of professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these also we should have long to wait , not so much because of the want of liberality among those who have the means to endow such institutions , as for the lack of a clear conviction as yet of their utility , and the really practical character of the information they would supply . It has seemed to ns that this problem of a more perfect diffusion of knowledge on agricultural subjects , is capable of another solution than that which consists in devising means for obtaining govermental appropriations , or awaiting the munificence of individuals . In the attempts which have hitherto been made in this direction too exclusive reliance has been imposed , as it seems to us , on purely professional instruction . And it has been wrongly assumed that it is necessary to await the gradual production of a class of men qualified to impart it . No necessity exists , as we believe , to await the creation or production of anything that does not now exist for the accomplishment of this great work . The material is at hand . We have undiffused knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of science applied to cultivation , as minute and profound as exists anywhere on time face of the earth . In accordance with this view , the solution which we propose is the enli. *trnent of practical men , who are not professional teachers , in the work of instraction , and their combination in such numbers , that a small contribution of time and labor from // each shall make a sufficierd aggregate to meet the ol*ject in view . The special necessity for such a system , in the case of the pursuit we are considering , grows out of the fact that there is much in agriculture which has not , as yet , taken the form of Science , and can only be acquired from practical men . We are all familiar with the immense results accomplished by combinations of capital in commercial enterprise , in banking , in railroad projects , in manufacturing . The combination which is practicable in agriculture is of another kind-the association of intelligence and knowledge in the work of instruction , for the indirect attainment of great results in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize such association of knowledge we would , then , assemble from the farm , the garden , the nursery , the vineyard , and from the ranks of science , gentlemen distinguished for their skill in the various specialties of agriculture , practical and theoretic , and call on them to make each his contribution to the work of instruction . And then we would summon the intelligent and enterprising farmers of the country , young and old , to gather and learn from the most highly qualified among their own ranks , the secrets of their success . We would propose that such aggregations of knowledge , as have been suggested , should be made at as many different points in the country as the available material would warrant , and that the instruction they would furnish should be adapted as exactly as possible , in time and extent to the circumstances of our agricultural population . Conceive of such a plan as we propose realized and in successful operation all over our country  --  the great lights of agriculture emerged from under the bushels of their restricted neighborhoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning afford  --  the intelligent youth of the country assembled around them to kindle their own torches from the united flame , and carry them away to illuminate the communities in which they dwell ; what an incalculable influence would thus be exerted upon the agriculture of our country ! In addition to the vast amount of knowledge communicated , what might we not expect from the enthusiasm which would // be inspired by the direct contact of the young agriculturist with that leaven of the highest science and the best practice to whose influence he would be subjected ! The impulse thus given to agriculture would react upon the related sciences and stimulate to new discoveries which have not yet been made , simply for want of sufficient interest in the ranks of those engaged in agricultural pursuits . Science has without doubt contributions of immense importance to make to the agriculture of the future-so great that the mere suggestion of their possibility is enough to inspire all but the boldest with scepticism as to the practical wisdom of those who venture the predictions . IReflect , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenditure from the islands of the sea , exists in its elements in boundless profusion , in the air we breathe and the water we drink , and that only a few steps forward may be necessary , on the part of science , in her capacity of cheapening the processes of decomposition and recoinbination , to enable us to produce an artificial ammonia , and fertilize our fields from the great reserVoirs of the atmosphere and the ocean . Let sceptics as to the relations of science and agriculture consider such an obvious probability as this , and perceive how the chemist , amid the fumes of his laboratory , seemingly as far removed from all work of practical bearing on agriculture as from its green fields and invigorating pursuits , may be elaborating results of incalculable value to the cultivator of the soil , and through him to the world . Such a plan of agricultural education as is proposed , might also be employed with great efficiency in promoting systematic field experiment on the part of agriculturists themselves . Most of what has been accomplished hitherto in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to use the illustration of an old writer-if the sow with her snout has happened by chance to imprint the letter A upon the ground , we will not therefore imagine that she can write a whole tragedy . Isolated attempts of this nature are almost valueless . Multiplication of experiment , till it shall embrace the great variety of circumstances which may influence a result , is essential to suecess. // Such multiplied and systematic questioning of Nature on agricultural subjects is , at present , scarcely known . Yet there is every reason to believe that it would achieve as important results for agriculture as it has already done for Natural Science . For it , such a system , as is proposed , would furnish not alone the necessary suggestions , but the means of carrying them out in practice . Let practical men be thus enlisted in the search for general principles , and nothing is hazarded in the assertion that agriculture would make greater progress in ten years of time than it will otherwise attain in a century . In the plan we propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical realization of that fancy of Solomon 's Hon se in the New Atlantis of Lord Bacon , which had its " merchants of light , " to collect and distribute the knowledge of others , its " miners or pioneers , " to devise new experiments and its " inoculators who do execute and repeat the experiments so directed . " Another effect of the realization of such a system of agricultural education would be a perception of the necessity of permanent and well endowed institutions , which should carry , to a greater degree of perfection , the advantages which such a system presents . It would call forth the interest of enlightened and liberal men , and result in the establishment of Agricultural Colleges , which would offer to the enterprising young farmer as extended and liberal a course of instruction as is now pursued by the student of a learned profession . We remark , in conclusion , that the experiment of such a course of instruction as is above proposed , in which practical and scientific talent shall be combined and which shall accomnmodate itself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be made at New Haven , during the month of February next . Its success is regarded as ensured by the fact that a score or more of the leading Agriculturists and Horticulturists of the country are associated with scientific men in the execution of the plan .
