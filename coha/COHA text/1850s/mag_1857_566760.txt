ART . V.-TIIE SPHERE OF THE PULPIT . 1 . Politics and the Pulpit . From the Journal of Commerce , and the Independent of 1850. 2 . Danger of separating Piety from Philanthropy . A Sermon before the General Association of Connecticut , June , 1855 . By T. ID . WOOLSEY . Reprinted from the Kew Englander. 3 . A Sermon at the Installation of Rev. Jeremiah Taylor , at iJfiddletown , Connecticut . By Rev. E. L. CLEYELMD. 4. letters to Rev. William WI Patton . By Rev. THOMAS CHILDS . 5 . The New York Observer . THE foregoing references , which might easily be made far more numerous , will suffice to show how deeply the question of the " True Sphere of the Pulpit , " has taken hold of the public mind . The subject must indeed be always of the deepest interest , wherever Christianity prevails . The ambassadorship of the cross is an office too solemn and important ,  --  an agency whose arms embrace society far too powerfully , not to have its functions well defined . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present age . In an hour of elemental warfare ,  --  when every principle is questioned , and every foundation shaken , or assailed ,  --  when the opposing powers of sin and holiness are marshaled with hourly increasing strength ,  --  when " Satan hath come down , having great wrath , " and " Michael and his angels fight against him , " the cause of truth can ill afford that the batteries of the pulpit should be rendered inefficient by too high or too low an aim . To those , therefore , whose place of service is the pulpit , it is not a matter of surprise , or of complaint , that a thousand minds are addressing themselves to the question , " What is the true scope of the preaching of the Gospel ? "  --  or that so many // voices , and so various , are mingled in the discussion . And though the criticisms which assail them are often ignorant , or foolish , or malicious , they can not but regard the whole dispute as evidence that the pulpit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we take pleasure in contributing our share toward what may eventually make bare the " sword of the spirit , " for a truer and more sweeping stroke . The erroneous , or partial conceptions which have been formed of what constitutes the genuine preaching of the Gospel , are various , though united fundamentally by a " certain common bond . " It has been imagined by some that faith affects ignorance , and that there is an antagonism between " Christ and him crucified , " on the one hand , and learning on the other . The favorite text of these persons has been , " Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it ; " their example , that of the unlettered fishermen of Galilee . They forget that the fishermen were instructed by Him , who taught as never man taught , and were moved by the special and miraculous inspiration of the Holy Ghost , and that , upon him who improved to the utmost the talents already in his possession , additional talents were bestowed . They forget , too , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , if they have none of their own , ) for the external and historical evidences , that the Bible is from God ,  --  for its rendering into a tongue intelligible to them ,  - -  for its sound interpretation , and richest illustration ,  --  and for all those varied stores of knowledge , which even they find it impossible to despise , or altogether to do without . We dismiss this theory with brief attention , since few persons can be found at this day , so well fitted to illustrate the literal sense of the phrase , " not to know anything , " as to maintain it . And yet , the theory , in its rationale , is not so unlike some of far more respectable paternity , ( soon to be mentioned , ) as might be imagined . Some have supposed that to preach " Christ and him crucifled , " we must make Christ the actual and verbal theme of nearly every discourse ; and hence a sermon " without a Christ in it , " to use their own expression , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ; as if the Sermon on the Mount , and half the chapters of the New Testament , had anything in them about Christ ! Such persons confound the making Christ the " chief corner stone , " and making him the only stone ,  --  the making him the center of the system , and making him the whole system ,  --  the making him the soul of the Gospel , and making him the soul and body both . It may reasonably be supposed , that at the first promulgation of the Gospel , when commending the facts of the plan of salvation to the historical belief of mankind was the first great work of the preacher , the name of Christ would be heard more fre4uently from the preacher than now ; just as then , " every spirit that confessed in words , that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh , was of God , " which is by no means true now . But those who make a hobby of the idea which we are now discussing , not only refuse to take notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Apostles , for the Apostles dwelt largely upon the virtues , and even upon the minor morals , quoted Greek poets on Mars Hill , and could even upon an occasion descend to matters personal and social ; although the cross of Christ was always with them , as it should be with every preacher , the foundation , the soul , the life of all religion and all eternal hopes . Another modification of the same essential narrowness in men 's conception of the Gospel , is sometimes expressed in the phrases , " Preach the Bible , " " Preach the Word , " so used as to imply that sermons should be composed mainly of the very laugnage of the Scriptures , varied by permntations as ceaseless and almost as mechanical as those of the Tartar praying-wheel . But why damage and deform so glorious a truth as that of the preeminence of the revealed Word , by crowding it to a preposterous extreme ? There is no truth which may not be misrepresented and turned into folly , by such treatment . The great law of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of justice ; and the sovereignty of God is a falsehood , if made altogether to swallow up the responsible agency of man . Similar is the relation of the Bible to the mind of man . Has God given us the royal endowment of reason for nought ? IDid he intend all religious // literature to stand still when the Bible was completed ? Or is the pulpit alone a place where the throne of reason is to be abdicated , and the rational soul , created in the image of God , go prone on its belly like the serpent cursed in Paradise ? Can we suppose that the Holy Ghost is to take us up , and carry us to the skies , without thought or intellectual effort of our own ? Are we not , on the contrary , so made that we can not grow in grace , or in the knowledge of God , save by our own most earnest and diligent exertion , uniting with the aid received from on high ? Where shall such efforts be made , if not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And by whom shall such efforts be made , , if not by those who are commissioned to lead , to guard , and feed the flock of God ? And what efforts of ours can be more appropriate , more profitable , than searchings amid the deep things of God with a mind that works , as well as passively receives ,  --  that works with thought and language of its own , ever guided indeed , ever enlightened by that holy , eternal Word , of which it is so appropriately said " A glory gilds the sacred page , Resplendent like the sun ; It gives a light to every age , It gives , but borrows none . " But the very light it gives , like that of the natural sun , must be received by the ceaseless exercise of our own faculty of seeing ; otherwise it will fall on dark and soulless orbs . In fact , the truth of God is the food of the soul , and can only be assimilated by mastication and digestion ; and these are processes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent . But language is the necessary instrument of thought . How then is the mind of preacher or hearer to work upon the great field of Christian truth , if restricted to language prepared and stereotyped by another ? As well might the b*dy be nurtured to a vigorous and manly growth , while locked in fetters or encased in swathing bands . It is a sufficient and final objection to this theory of one // idea , that its advocates themselves can not reduce it to practice . A sermon was once read to a company of ministers , designed to establish the theory here controverted ; but the sermon was itself so flagrant a violation of its own principle , that when it was criticized on that account , the writer confessed that his conscience had not been fully at ease since it was written . His frank confession was an instance of the power of native common sense , to unseat a rider for the moment , even from a favorite hobby . Minds of the same class sometimes represent that as the purest preaching , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those religious convictions which exist within the soul by nature . Those persons have a morbid fear of the dangers arising from an undue confidence in human reason , and can scarcely believe that any exercise of that faculty on religious themes can be better than the " philosophy and vain deceit , " against which the apostle warned the Cobssians. 3m their view , to preach the Gospel in its simplicity is to preach it on the unsupported authority of the Bible , ( as they suppose ; ) although in reality the Bible itself is sustained in the minds of such men , by the authority of tradition , education , and their church or party . With them , the proof for everything is , " Thus saith the Lord ; " but if it be asked how we know that the Lord says thus , the voucher seems to be %pse dixit . " We would commend to the consideration of these men the truth expressed by Paul , in the words " Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the words , " Those having not the law , are a law unto themselves . " If we mistake not , it would be a curious thing to hear some men undertake to preach on these texts . Indeed , nothing could be more unscriptural than this idea , in the extreme statement of it . There is scarcely a more distinguishing characteristic of the preaching of Christ , than his appeals to that intuitive moral judgment ,  --  that inner voice which exists in every human soul . Witness the parables of the good Samaritan , the talents ,  --  and indeed almost all the parables . And was it not so with the Apostles , in their preaching of the word ? // What are those most elaborate , most important of all the epistles ,  --  those to the Hebrews and to the iRomans  --  but herculean masses of reasoning , addressed to the self-a*cting intellect of men , far more than to any blind reverence for authority ? To what did Paul make his appeal on Mars Hill ? Was it to the Hebrew Scriptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his hearers had no regard for that authority . He appealed , therefore , to such witnesses as the Athenians could appreciate , and would be likely to receive . Nobody needs to be informed that , among the hearers of preaching at this day , there are some who do not believe the Bible ; or that there are others who have only a partial confidence in it . Shall we doggedly persist in doing nothing but hurl the Bible at the heads of these men , when there are authorities within their own souls , which can be developed and made to speak in tones of thunder for the great doctrines of the Bible , and finally in confirmation of the Bible itself ? Nay , what but a mere superstition would Christianity become , were the recognition of the reason as an independent source of authority and evidence to drop from its theory . Without the just exercise of reason in religion , we have only a 6lind regard for a supposed Superior Power . Such a regard is merely superstition . The Papist , the Mohammedan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just such a blind and unreasoning religion . The superiority of the faith of the Christian consists in the fact , that it is illumined by intelligence , and consequently fastened upon a holy God ,  --  and not upon an arbitrary or a malignant power , nor upon an empty and characterless name . Undoubtedly there is such a peril as that of a proud and too confident reliance on human reason . Evidently this is one of the imminent dangers of the Church in our day . God forbid , that his watchmen should mistake or conceal it , or fail to guard against it . But how shall we most successfully guard against it ? The r*tioualizing tendency , so far as it finds a lodgment in the minds of good men , and to a degree indeed beyond this , is an honest protest against the blind reverence just mentioned . Its real strength consists in // the fact , that there i8 a voice in the human soul , which has been , in some quarters , neglected and silenced , instead of being trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable of becoming . This voice God had created , and he had created few nobler things . It deserved to be developed . It needed to be developed , for the sake of God 's glory and the salvation of men . The rationalizing tendency found here a work for itself to do , and it has " magnified its office . " If you wish to check its growth , take away its work . Do , yourself , the work which it lives by doing . No power can crush it while its mission lasts ; for , it is the struggle of eternal realities to harmonize and balance themselves . Turn your eye with a reasonable respect to the light that shines within you . Fear not to let it shine on the page of Revelation . Revelation is able to bear the scrutiny , nay , will gather new and more enduring effulgence from every ray . The reason is not a thing that can be put down . It may be a powerful ally-it will be a dangerous foe . Never was a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times can be extinguished by trampling on , or ignoring the divinely-created faculty of reason . That is by no means necessarily the purest Gospel , which creeps trembling to the farthest remove from all philosophy . There are those , too , who seem to think that a pure Gospel must needs stand at ajealous distance from all attempts at moral and cocial reformation . They see that the various moral and social " reforms " of the day are by many made the substitutes for spiritual religion , and are employed by some as methods of assault upon the Gospel . They see men reversing the order recommended by the Saviour-that of " cleansing first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also , " and vainly dreaming that by purifying the outside the inner can be made clean . They conclude , therefore , that plans of reformation are to be rejected altogether ; or they conceive a timorous jealousy of them which amounts practically to the same thing . But is there no medium between elevating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turning the back on all public // virtue , and allowing sin to riot nucontrolled ? Must piety be divorced from righteonsness , and a man fancy that his heart is accepted with God in view of its supposed love and penitence and faith , while his outward life is unjust , unkind and untrue ? When will men recognize the heavenly wisdom of the saying , " This ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone . " Christ indeed preached " faith and repentance , " buthesaidalso , " Bytheirfruits ye shall know them . " He taught that love to God and love to man are essentially one principle ; and he showed , in the parable of the good Samaritan , by what conduct that principle is to be manifested . And now shall we be told that a regard for the present welfare of men is antagonistic to the cross of Christ , and must have no place in the ineulcations of the pulpit ? An Apostle has told us , indeed , that we are justified by faith ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works is dead ; " and that " pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world ; " and a prophet has said , " Is not this the fast that I have chosen , to undo the heavy burdens , and let the oppressed go free ? " And what were the principal charges brought by the same prophet against Israel , with the announcement of overwhelming judgment from God ? " Woe unto them that join house to house , that lay field to field . " " Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink . " " Woe unto them that call evil good and good evil . " " Woe unto them which justify the wicked for reward , and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him ; therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people , and he hath stretched forth his hand against them , and hath smitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearful of evoking the spirit of moral reformation ? Is this the voice of a modern conservative , whining with ceaseless cant about faith and piety , while the very orgies of darkness are enacted before his face , and robbery and outrage and wrong nestle fondly beneath his skirt ? Talk of fasting and prayer , and faith and piety , " Is not this the fast that I have chosen , to loose the bonds of // wickedness , to undo the heavy burdens , and to let the oppressed go free , and that ye break every yoke ? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry , and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house ; when thou seest the naked that thou cover him , that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh ? " And are we to be told still , that faith and love and inward piety are the only words which must sound from the pulpit , and that our prayers can sanctify our robberies , and our orthodoxy cover our dishonesty , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never , never let such defilement of the pure garments of piety be wrought in the house of her friends . Undoubtedly there are men of a different character from those contemplated in the above remarks , who entertain a strong prejudice against reforms . They are men of constitutionally timid , quiet , or conservative temperament , with a strong disrelish for the excitement , collision , and noise , often evolved in the progress . of reformation . They are more afraid of the evils attendant upon progress , than of the foulest sins , hoary with years ; and they believe , that to preach " Christ and him crucified , " means first and chiefly , to ignore , if not to oppose in the pulpit , all external reform . But , do such men consider that progress , the universe over , is attended with more or less of labor and rupture and pain-sometimes with the throes of birth-travail ,  --  sometimes even with the rack of mortal agony . The plant does not shoot but from the perishing of the seed ,  --  every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its succession of life in the succession of death . Christianity was not planted , but amid the struggles and groans of expiring paganism ; ignorance and barbarity never yet looked with friendly eye on the approach of knowledge and civilization liberty advances over the neck of prostrate despotism ; sin always , as in the demoniacs at the ejecting word of the Saviour , bellows and foams before the holiness which comes to cast it out . Shall darkness then , brutality , ignorance , falsehood , bondage , sin and Satan , be allowed quietly to possess their prey ? Shall the physician withdraw from the bed of disease , because by the keen knife or nauseous draught alone can its // deadly progress be arrested ? He who has fixed the constitution of nature , is wiser than we . He may have seen that society needs for its highest health , and therefore for its growth andstrength and beauty , precisely those strnggles , which the comfort-seeking conservative so much dreads , but which may be to the social system like wholesome and invigorating , though irksome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative friend , ( ultra-conservative we mean , ) answer to himself one thing . Who , among all the " immortid names " of those in every age , by whom the real victories of truth , righteousness , liberty and civilization , have been won ,  - -  who among them all , from Moses to Christ , and from Paul to Luther and Wilberforce , have not been cast out as agitators and fanatics , doing more harm than good , by just such persons as these our excellent conservative friends ? Ah , the Jews of our Saviour 's day were not the only people who have " builded the tombs of the prophets , and stoned those who were sent unto them . " Will men never recollect that the deepest heart of love that ever beat on earth said , " Think not that I am come to send peace on earth , but a sword ; " and that the order of the Apostle was " first pure , then peaceable . " Certainly Christian reform is widely different from the wild howl of fanatical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Christian reformation of morals and of society . We have heard much of late about " politics and the pulpit , " and the idea seems to be entertained that the field of politics is the quarter whence danger to the purity and singleness of the pulpit chiefly threatens . Now , first of all , in relation to this matter , it should be settled , what is meant by politics . If everything which relates to the official conduct of magistrates and governments , is politics , and is therefore to be shunned by the pulpit , then the struggle of our fathers for liberty was politics , and the preachers of that day , who from their pulpits sounded the alarm for freedom , should be remembered as beacons of warning . Then Temperance has become a political subject , and the pulpit must be silent concerning that . Then the acts of French magistrates in suppressing Protestant prayermeetings , and those of Italian courts in punishing the crime // of reading the Scriptures , are political themes , on which the preacher must be respectfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been hushed in the sikuce of the grave , when the martyrs of the IReformation , one by one , yielded up their breath ; for it was by political edicts that they died . Then the trembling congregation of the primitive believers must have held their breath , when they wept over the cold remains of a Paul , or a Polycarp ; for they too were slain by the powers that were , and that were ordained by God . Why , the crucifixion of the Son of God was a political act , concocted and compassed by the rulers of the Jews , and executed by the civil and military powers of IRome . And dare Peter allude to it as he did in those heart-piercing sermons of his , in which , instead of canting about faith and repentance in the abstract , he cried , " Him ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain ! " But look for a moment at the reason of the thing . If we may not touch a sin which is involved with politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any siu from the sword of the Gospel is , to mix it up with politics . To adopt such a principle , is to surrender the whole field of human affairs , and allow the arch-enemy to reign unresisted . For there is not a doctrine or a practice , a point of faith or an ordinance , belonging to the Christian system , but has been , or may be made , the subject of political interference , or legal enactment . With politics in one sense of the word , few would wish the pulpit to interfere . Banks and tariffs , currencies and sub-treasuries , land distribution , and river and harbor improvements-these are themes which have no place in the temple of God , not because they are political , so much as because they are not moral . They are not on fire in every fibre and every vein with the great battle between sin and holiness-between Satan and the Son of God . But when politics have become morals , when politicians have chosen openly to outrage all that is holy , and defy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppression , and crime of every deep and damning dye , entrench themselves behind legal enactments , and in a country where the laws are only the reflection of the popular will , // shall the pulpit then keep silence , or " roar you an t were any nightingale ? " 0 minister of Christ , the trump of the Lord of hosts is at your lip , and woe be to you if you flinch from giving it breath , because the Devil has undertaken to protect the blackest sins above the pit by his label of " politic8 . " But we are told that the arena of politics is a filthy pool , in which the garments of the minister will be defiled , and the dignity of the sacred office compromised . Doubtless those who most insist upon this consideration are good witnesses as to the character of the political circles in which themselves are wont to move ; and if they judge that those are too foul to admit the presence of a Christian gentleman , we have no reason to doubt the truth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two sides to some things ; and that while one side is dark and murky with vapors from the pit , the other may be illuminated with heaven 's warmest and brightest beams . Were we to go into politics as some men go , leaving conscience and courage , justice and manliness behind ,  --  and sacrificing all that can be most precious to our children and the race on the altar of party , or interest , or pusillanimous fear-we should indeed be unworthy to stand in a Christian pulpit , or to sit in the seat of a brave and good man . But we beg to know if the freeman 's suffrage is not a most important instrument of influence , and of accomplishing either good or evil in this country . Nay , at some crisis of the nation 's history , may not the force of the ballot be the very force which shall determine the most precious interests , not only of the passing age , but of countless ages ? And , if so , why is it not the imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not for evil . In this , as in other departments of human activity and responsibility , why should not the word of God , dispensed by the ministers of Christ , warn men against the shame and peril of ill-doing , and call sinners to repentance ? And if this is done kindly , decorously , conscientiously , we desire to know how it is that any man 's robes , whether official or personal , will be defiled thereby . Will pleading for eternal right defile a man ? Is any man , or any office , so holy as to be dishonored and " soiled " by upholding God 's most holy law ? What rule // are we violating in the course supposed , save the mere conventional one , that a minister must be silent on politics . So the Jews charged the disciples of Christ with defiling themselves in disregarding a conventionalism of theirs respecting the washing of hands . But let us not be misuuderstood . It is not necessary , in dealing with politico-moral questions , that the pulpit should descend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , of party operations and tactics . Let the minister of Christ cast his ballot as a Christian citizen , and exert his influence with dignity , out of the pulpit , ( if he finds it necessary , ) for the candidate who represents right moral principles . But in the pulpit , let him confine himself to the sacred bearings of his themes . Let him hold forth the fundamental principles of human rights ,  --  the unity of all mankind in the essential nature of the soul , and in Christ . Let him denounce the wickedness of robbery and oppression , and of the ruthless violence that tears asunder those whom God hath joined together . Let him show the sin of conniving at these things . Let him preach on such texts as , " lie that stealeth a man and selleth him , or if he be found in his hand , shall surely be put to death ; " " Remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; " and " Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it unto me . " But let him , in applying the Divine warnings to the sins of the times , keep as close to the Biblical and religious aspects of the case as conscientious faithfulness to his hearers will permit . It is worth the while of those who feel , or affect to feel , so greatly scandalized at the freedom of the pulpit in these times , to settle their minds upon a definite answer to two or three quotations which underlie this subject . And first , in a country like this , where every man is one of the sovereigns , and therefore bears , in part , the responsibility of the national character and conduct , does , or does not , a man 's political conduct form a part of his moral character , for which he must give account to God at the last day , and acc@rding to which , as good or evil , his soul will be saved or lost ? If the affirmative of this ques // tion be granted , on what principle , which does not yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can the minister of Christ excuse himself for warning his people of their responsibility with reference to national , as well as with reference to private sins ? Is there in reality any such principle save that of avoiding offense ? And if it all comes to this at last , then we ask , if the truth is to be blinked for the sake of avoiding offense , on one subj ect , why not on all ? Is it not plain that the question whether offense shall or shall not be taken at any presentation of truth from the pulpit lies wholly in the hands of the enemies of the truth ? They can take offense at anything that is preached ; and who that will be honest and earnest , can prevent it ? Let it be understood that the pulpit is silent whenever they are offended , and the game is completely in their hands . With what delight may we not suppose the adoption of such a principle by the Christian ministry would be hailed by the rulers of the darkness of this world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every faithful preacherwe can not consent to any such surrender . We will hear what you have to say ,  --  we will regard with as much respect as we can your very particular solicitude for the dignity and sacredness of the pulpit ; ' but , by your leave , questions which involve the very foundation principles of morals , were ours before they were yours* . You may have dragged them into politics ; we do not dispute your right to do so ; but you have not thereby stripped them of their moral character , nor altered the relation which they have ever sustained to our work . Our commission is not from you , but from a higher authority . We do not find it there written that we are to war against all sins , except those which governments and parties choose to uphold . Sin* , whether individual or public ; whether social or political ; whether of rulers or ruled ; whether of parties , societies or persons ; Sm is the foe against which we are to war . You tell us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object which we have in view . Thank you , gentlemen , we hear you , and we have just two things to say in reply . In the first place , the assertion is not true ; in the second place , if it were , that would make no difference . If men do not choose // to hear our message , that is not our affair . They will settle that at another tribunal . Meantime , our commission is , " Thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear or whether they will forbear . " We designed to show , in distinction from all the partial or distorted views which have been noticed , what is the true theory of the scope and range which the preaching of the Gospel should take . That we have little remaining space , is the less to be regretted , inasmuch as what has already been advanced will aid materially in developing our idea . We venture , then , without further preface , to propose the following as a definition of the phrase " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles involved in the cross ,  - -  as so involved ,  --  in their due order and proportion ,  --  logically unfolded in their relations to human need and human duty ,  - -  and commended to every man 's conscience by all reasonable and valid arguments . The Cross of Christ , considered merely as a name , is worth no more than any other name . Considered as a fact , with no principles lying behind it , however strange and curious it might be , it would still be a meaningless , and therefore a useless fact . lit is the principles involved in the Cross , which give it its power and its value . Those principles are the real Cross , just as the soul of man , and not the body , is the real man . To preach the Cross , then , is to preach the principles which are involved in the Cross . And this proposition must be understood to include not only those principles which shine directly from Calvary , but those secondary or resultant principles which , logically flowing from the former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the death of Christ . The fact of human sinfulness ,  --  the deep and terrible nature of that fact ,  --  the consequent exposure to eternal wrath ,  --  no salvation without repentance and faith in Christ , * are principles which , none can doubt , are either expressed or implied in the Cross . " Repent and believe , " therefore ,  --  " repent and be converted , " - " ye must be born again , " - " why will ye die , " - tliese are themes which , while the day of probation // lasts , will resound from the trump of the " everlasting Gospel ; " and woe to the herald who forgets or conceals his message . But this is truth in one only of its radiating lines . The boundless love of God is another idea no less clearly expressed in the Cross than those mentioned . And this involves with equal certainty , the freeness and earnestness of the offers of salvation ,  --  the sure and eternal hope which is built upon Christ ,  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast out . " Repent and believe , " then , for " why will ye die , " is still , when proceeding from the Cross , the first word of the message with which the pulpit is charged . Or , to start from another point ,  --  the immaculate holiness of God is a part of the Gospel of Christ ; for that surely , if anything , is directly expressed in the Cross . But the principle of God 's holiness , as illustrated in the Cross , carries with it , by inevitable implication , the principle that God abhors all sin , and the principle that the Gospel is designed to restrain sin no less than to save from wrath . " Faith and repentance , " therefore , are not the whole Gospel , but , " by works is faith made perfect , " - " works meet for repentance , " and inseparable from it . Or , we may take still another line . Christ died for man , a man ,  --  for all men without distinction . The Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of race or nation ; but to the soul in its universal humanity . Mankind , therefore , in all the great facts involved in their relation to the Cross , are one . In the elements of their moral nature , ( involving of course the intellectual , ) they are one . In the law under which they act in their accountableness to God 's judgment , they are one . In the way of salvation offered , in their dependence on Christ and the relation they must sustain to him ,  --  in immortal life ,  --  in the infinite worth and inconceivable destinies of the soul ,  --  in all these great overshadowing facts and relations , men are one . The absolute , universal , and inalienable rights of man , absolute and inalienable as toward his brother ,  --  the fundamental position of those rights in every true system of human morals ,  --  the unspeakable sin of denying or violating them ,  - -  these and other resultant ideas are no less inevitably involved // in the Cross of Christ , than the love of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Christ and him crucified , " which ignores a part of these on pretense that others lie nearer the center . Because the hand is not the heart , is it therefore not of the body ? Because the branch is not the root , is it therefore not of the tree ? And will the tree live , nay , will the root itself live long without the branches ? Inward piety will wither and die without the cultivation of outward righteousness and the rebuke of outward sin . But our definition speaks of " the principles involved in the Cross , as so involved . " Yes , let those principles be evolved from the Cross . Many of them , indeed , are not in reality based in the Cross . They were true before the Cross was ,  - -  would eternally have been true , had the Cross never stood . Yet even these find their utmost power only when drawn as lines of light from the Cross . The Cross is God 's great symbol of divine truth to men ; and both because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let it have the central , the honored place . These are times for showingas the Apostle Paul was wont to show-that the fundamental principles of religion are founded in the nature of things , and affirmed by universal reason ; but every argument must converge toward the Cross , and the Cross will be the source when every truth will radiate , armed with a power which merely intellectual demonstration can not give . " In their due order and pr*portion . " Some principles , undoubtedly , lie nearer the center than others . Some are first in logical order , first in order of importance . There is a foundation , and also a superstructure . The foundation must first be laid . There is a root , and also a branch . In the heart the root must be buried before the plant can be watered and nurtured . " Cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside may be clean also . " In preaching " Christ and him crucified , " the enforcement of inward piety will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , upon the foundation is built the superstructure ; and from the root should spring the branch . Let not the pulpit look so closely at faith in the abstract , as to forget the character of the // object upon which faith must be fastened ,  --  the holiness to which faith , if not worthless , must serve to unite us ; nor let repentance be inculcated so exclusively as to throw into the shade the necessity of " bringing forth fruits meet for repentance . " What is faith , unless it unites the soul to holiness . The African has faith in his fetich . And what is repentance if it be not a turning to righteousness ? Charles V , on his death bed , repented that he had not persecutcd the Protestants more rigorously . What was such repentence worth ? Was that a " repentance unto life ? " The Gospel undoubtedly has a center , and that center is the Cross ; but then it has a circumference also , and when was it ever seen that the center and circumference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross are also to be " logically unfolded in their relations to human need and human duty . " Let every principle be traced to all its legitimate results . You preach benevolence , as a principle involved in the Cross ; then carry it out , and tell your people what conduct benevolence requires toward your neighbors and countrymen , and likewise toward the stranger , the down-trodden , and toward the world . You preach love to souls , as written in letters of blood on the fatal tree ; then pursue the thought , and show your hearers the prayer and labor , the self-denial and regard toward high and low , rich and poor , to which that love will prompt . You grow eloquent on the worth of the soul , for on what does the Cross speak eloquently , if not on that theme ; then go on to write in letters of fire , the sin of degrading that soul to a mere piece of merchandise , to be bought and sold like an ox . And so of the rest . The principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , are only streams which do not run , a life that does not live , or winds which can not blow . And finally , let this pure , comprehensive , glorious system be " commended to every man 's conscience by all reasonable and valid arguments . " If , with one man , the authority of the Bible will be most effectual , then peal upon his ear the thunders , and breathe to his heart the whispering invitations of the Bible . If , to the soul of another , the // voice of reason , or the ripe fruits of learning can find access , why should you despise the aid of reason and learning ? " God hath made everything beautiful in its time . " Is philosophy , in its essential thing which God hath not nature , a b made ? Send by whom thou wilt , or by what thou wilt , but send thy truth , 0 Lord , into the hearts of men . Such , as it seems to us , is in brief , the true conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , if realized , will give us as the true system of Christianity and the Christian life ; a root , and also a branch ; a soul , and also a life ; a fountain , and also a stream . This will form a style of piety epially symmetrical , harmonious , scriptural and beautiful ; " commending itself to very man 's conscience in the sight of God , " or in the sight of men . This will create a religion which will be a power in the world ,  --  a power of which governments and rulers will be obliged to take account , in calculating causes and results . This will make not helpless recluses , nor harmless neutrals in the great battle of Armageddon , but men and women , and Christian citizens and soldiers for the Lord of Hosts . This will create a religion which will educate , develop , and ennoble the Christian soul , and present it at last before the throne of God , in the " fullness of the stature of the perfect man in Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thing .
