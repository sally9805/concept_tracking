txt ART . VI. -SELF-DEVELOPMENT , NOT AGGRESSION , THE TRUE POLICY OF OUR NATION . Tm*nE are two widely different methods of seeking national Strength or Greatness . The one may be characterized as the Self-developing method , the other as the Aggressive . The nation adopting the former seems not to interfere in the domestic affairs of other nations , not to be entangled in offensive and defensive alliances with them , not to encroach by artifice or arms on their territory ,  --  but quietly to develop its own strength . It admits of and encourages the intercourse of its // Nov. citizens with their citizens by commerce , letters , and the amenities of civilized life . It even stimulates to the utmost energy and enterprise in such intercourse , so far as it is calculated to develop its resources , and not suppress them . But in its national character and in all its relations to other governments , its aim is to maintain peace , and so conduct its affairs as to secure the confidence of all with whom it has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes by bringing out its own resources and possibilities , and firmly with holds itself from appropriating power foreign to it . The nation adopting the latter method , on the contrary , aims not so much as to draw out of , as into itself . It mainly looks abroad for its strength , to what it can transfer from other nations . Itself it regards as a gatherer and combiner and holder , rather than a producer of power . And it embraces every opportunity to bring under its sway whatevei- will build it up , or would be likely to build up a rival . Accordingly it deals much in arms , much in diplomacy , much in real , though perhaps clumsily concealed , national freebooting . It has a voice and a hand in the commotions around it , and impatiently waits to gain some advantage from them . It is an Ishmaelite among the nations . The characteristic difference between the two may be briefly stated in this way : The one seeks by some means-b arms acquisitions , alliances  --  to brino- greatness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vitalities of peace  --  to bring greatness out of itself . The latter we regard as the true policy for every nation to adopt , but especially for this one . And our object , in this Article , is to enforce and illustrate this position , and then to point out some of the sources of danger that our country may eventually be drawn into the opposite course . We may commence , then , by referring to the general principle , that true strength is the result of growth , not of aggression . No living object can become strong , save by the process of self-development . Whatever comes to it from abroad , must be taken up into it and become a part of it by a vital process , or it is still foreign and does not contribute to its intrinsic vigor . Without growth , there is no living union of parts ; and without this , while there may be accumulation and enlargement , there can be no increase of living power . The parts will be without sympathy or concert . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthful growth takes place , they are blended in one living whole , and combined so as to secure the greatest amount of Vigor. // Now , society , and a nation as being one of those natural unities of humanity , which constitute 8ociety* come under the same laws of growth . Society , according to its true idea and construction , is a living thing , made up of those whose views , sympathies , manners , pursuits , stations , are indeed not common , but dovetail into each other-nay , meet and intertwine in one tangled , living and inseparable mass of humanity , like the roots of different grasses in a common sward . It is a living convolution , where different trades , ranks , professions , are rolled up and grown together . And such a state of society can not be made ; it must grow . Time and quiet are necessary . But when and where it does exist , it is strong . Each citizen , heatlifully filling his station , however humble , adds *omething to the aggregate power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the best of men , having no common working purpose or sympathy sufficiently strong to absorb and reconcile their differences , should be assembled in one locality , from all parts of the world ; if such an aggregation were bound together by the best of laws , and the best of institutions were transferred among them , there would be no more cohesion between them than between the particles of a heap of sand . It would be necessary that the vital process should go on for years , perhaps for generations or centuries , before they could be sufficiently fused , assimilated , and grown together to present any high form of unity or strength . Moreover , in those communities where this unity exists because they have followed the laws of growth , and when consequently there is a measure of strength , the true method of increasing it is everywhere by self-development . It is to bring out the latent power , rather than to introduce foreign power . There are always resources that will bear further expansion , and when these are developed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the ratio of advance among the nations on the scale of power , is much greater than the ratio of the development of resourccs . If a people , having the average self-development , were to double it , their relative power would be increased many fold ; on the same principle that , if a man were to have his present ability , which we will suppose already compared favorably with that of those around him , increased twice , his rank for ability as compared wth them , would be increased ten times , and more . The true way , therefore , for a nation to become stron g , is not to grasp after advantages from abroad , for that would leave themselves still intrinsically weak ; but to test their own capabilities to the utmost  --  to press their agriculture to its verge , // and their manufactures , and their commerce , and their scien*e and art , and their institutions of learning , benevolence , and religion . They should call forth every slumbering energythose relating to the spiritual nature of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of enlarged but inherent weakness , not of consolidated and enduring strength . We say those relating to the spiritual nature as well as the physical ; for it takes something more than muscles and material wealth to make a nation inherently strong . Something more than so many head of human beings , so many acres , and so much material glory , is requisite . A people having all these , may be weak at heart , corrupt , ready to fall to pieces , only as it is held together by artificial and forcible means . There must also be patriotism , and intelligence , and virtue , and religion ; and these spiritual sinews-as we may call them-are the mightiest of any that bind society together and give it inherent power . There are no laws or constitutions , no legions or fortresses , ' so potent as these . They create outward splendor and might ; but these do not generate them . Accordingly they , and not the returns of the census , point to the truest measure of national greatness . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet having in some measure developed her resources , spiritual as well as material , has , with a population not a tenth part as great , far more inherent , national force , than China , which has endeavored to live within and out of itself , it is true , but has suppressed all spiritual development . And the United States , for a similar reason , are mightier in everything , save brute strength , than Russia . Now , it is just these spiritual and most essential sinews , that can not be gathered in from abroad , and put in their proper place , and made to discharge their proper function , by any trick of the state or ruler , whether by purchase , conquest , or diplomacy . Patriotism can not be imported . The state can not stipulate with its neighbors to have its citizens made thoughtful , intelligent , and wise . It can not , by some brilliant stroke of arms , rob them of their virtue and distribute it within its own borders . It can not seize on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its return home . It may gather from the nations , choice , religious , moral , and scientific teachers ; but this does not make the people sound and strong at heart , sound and strong in mind and will . That can only be developed . It must be wrought out ' from within . It must be a growth , and requires time , and quiet , and effort . // It is , therefore , a general principle , that true national strength is the result of growth , and not of aggression . But there are , as it seems to us , special reasons why this nation should pursue this policy . They are such as these . We have a noble model , struck out for us under Providence , of a Republic . We have , it should seem , plenty of land and every natural advantage of earth , water , mineral , climate , and position . We have a population as hopeful for development and progress as any on the globe . Our institutions , with one exception-alas ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expansive , and could readily be adjusted to the highest condition of humanity . The outlines here marked off or rational freedom , education , virtue , and religion , are on the grandest and most brilliant scale . The ideal of our republic is magnificent . But it is immature . We are young , quite in our youth , as the age of nations is reckoned . The outlines want filling out a has been begun needs consolidating and perfecting . Agriculture must be matured , and other soil coaxed to the freest and most generous productivity . The ultimate of manufacturing skill and facility is to be reached or neared . The farther side of the capabilities of commerce is to be striven after . Love is to be perfected ; and the best mode of working our government , to be ascertained and adopted ; and then the higher reaches of general culture , morality , and piety , to be overtaken . Every mountain , stream , mineral , yard of earth , and human being , is to have its value tested and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republic , is to be called out and put to use . But to measure thus our capabilities by our attainments-to reach the farther side of our possibilities , will require the concentrated and best energies of the nation for generations and centuries . To bring out the force that is latent , or the seeds of which are slumbering in us , can only be the result of our earnest and combined effort at national self-development , and that protracted over a long period . Now , to arrest all this growth and prospective greatness , by diverting , the public mind and heart to foreign acquisitions , would paralyze our destiny and consign us to our present standard of attainment , or something worse . We could henceforth reach no higher degree of internal strength . We might possibly spread , for a short time , our present style of culture and power over a larger area ; but we could make no advance to anything intrinsically higher or better . And this very process of diffusion without growing internally , would , in fact , weaken us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely , he // must also increase the strength of the fastenings and timbers in an equal or even greater proportion , or it will be intrinsically weaker , less able to breast the waves and the storms . Enlargement is by no means always an increase of strength . The moment , therefore , we with our immature growth begin to look abroad for strength , and especially to expansion , and fail to give our concerted and best energies to developing it from within ,  --  . that moment we begin to fall , we arrest our high destiny , and doom ourselves to weakness . Again , the theory on which our government is constructed , is that of self-development , and not of aggression . Our fathers planted the " Tree of Liberty , " and counseled us to watch4 it with all vigilance , secure its best growth , and not neglect or imperil it by interfering in the affairs of other nations . To depart from this line of policy , and adopt the intermeddling , would require a re-construction of our governmental system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy , and extensive national defenses . And in these things much of our material resources , and very much more  --  a consideration inconceivably more serions-of the mind and heart of our p eople , would be absorbed , and so absolutely sunk and lost . F or the wealth and the soldiers , necessary to hold up a government pursuing such a policy , do not give to it intrinsic strength , any more than the shores and props do to an old and stooping building . They keep it from falling , and are the necessity and the evidence of its weakness . And besides this direct deduction of men and means from the national thrift , there would be a much greater indirect loss in the changed temper , sympathy , and ambition of the people . Their thoughts would be turned away from the arts of peace and self development . A feverish habit , a restlessness , a fondness for national adventure , and a constant roving of coveting eyes to foreign lands , quite opposed to enthusiasm in developing our own resources , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be dazzled and occupied with schemes of foreign aggrandizement , and in the same proportion withdraw from that which alone can make us really great . We can not afford thus to leave the policy of the fathers-a policy , by which in a short time-unexampled in the history of the world-we have risen from feeble colonies to a first class nation . We can not afford to arrest our internal progress here , and have henceforth only accumulation . And there is no reason why we should abandon our inherited and proved policy . Providence has planted us at a distance from the powers *ible to do us serious harm , if we let them alone ; and we need // not be driven into the aggressive line of policy , on the plea by which it is sometimes excused in Europe , as a species of selfdefense . Three thousand miles of ocean is a wall that can not be battered down ; and behind it and on it we may give all our energies to developing internal strength-with the exception of employing , as we always have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit in the watch-towers on this side of itin safety , and realize the truth of the declaration of Isaiah to the Jewish nation , " In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength , " ( xxx , 15 . ) Again , no people , adopting the appropriating policy , can expect to be able to pursue it for any great length of time unmolested or unchastised . They will soon be likely to incur such opposition as to become themselves the victims . It is quite as true of nations as of individuals , that " they that take the sword shall perish with the sword . " And this law , it is to be feared , would be summarily and gladly executed on us .. We carry the banner of freedom and popular rights for humanity almost alone . The rest of the nations are mainly against us in the radical idea of their governments ; and hence in feeling . Our influence , even in peace , and when attending to our own affairs , is regarded as dangerous . We are a marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , be glad to get rid of us ; and if we should annoy them by our aggressions over much , they being judges , they might quickly combine , and exterminate our republicanism . Now , the interests of free and popular institutions , which are entrusted to us for the race , are too sacred to be hazarded by any such policy . We owe it to the world and to generations unborn , to make our experiment of self-government as triumphant as possible . It is their right , even though we should relish the mad adventure , that we should not adopt a course of procedure which would inevitably lead us to the brink of a precipice , and then plunge over it . The world has no other great and hopeful republic to lose* and if this be lost , despotism may close over humanity again , it may be for another long *I ? hus the general truth that true strength is the result of growth , rather than accumulation , is one which specially commends itself to us , and one which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds abundant confirmation in history . Those nations everywhere and always , which have most developed their resources , have had the most intrinsic strength . This was emphatically the method adopted by Je // hovah in the institutions and regulations for the Jews ; and it is a remarkable fact that whenever they attempted to become strong by the other method , they at once grew weak . The Assyrian empire was an aggregation  --  a bundle held together by the withe of soldiery ; and as soon as that separated at any point , especially when it sundered in the hands of the prince , it fell to pieces . The conquests of Alexander are a notable instance of enlargement without cohesion or strength . He reared a gigantic empire , but one which had not vitality enough to abide the death of one man . When that man fell , the empire fell with him . Rome destroyed herself by drawing in , and failing to draw out . Spain passed from a first class , to a third or fourth class , state , by neglecting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get abroad . America fed her almost to death . Attica , on the other hand , with a territory so small that a man could walk over it in any direction in a few hours , by pressing to the utmost the development of her resources , especially in the matter of intellectual and artistic culture , left a broader and deeper mark on the history of the world than any other ancient nation , perhaps , save the Jews . And the strength of Britain at this day is not her possessions in India and America , and the isles of the sea , but what she has succeeded , in spite of her foreign acquisitions , in evolving out of herself in the form of both spiritual and material force . Indeed we have , in our own history , illustrations , not erfect but approximate , of both of these policies of growth . ma start with them from the two colonies at Jamestown and at Plymouth . The idea lying at the basis of the southern colony - an idea which has since spread through , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , that lying under the northern colony , and which has since diffused itself throughout the North , is development . Accordingly , the South has expanded , gained great accessions from abroad , but has overrun and exhausted her soil , neglected her commercial and manufacturing resources , and left the mind and heart of the mass of her people without cultivation . If she wants anything , she looks away for it , and does not wring it out of her own capabilities . The North also has expanded quite as much , nay , more ; but it has been the expansion , for the most part , of a natural growth , the unfolding of a life . Her strength lies in what she has wrought out of herself in mind and matter . And if she wants anything that can be had in herself she produces it . Hence her agriculture , her arts , her commerce , her // schools , her science , her letters , her men , are , as classes , all prosperous . We may safely conclude , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation in order to reach true strength , and which is specially necessary for us , and which , moreover , is so emphatically urged upon us , by the experience of the past , is the course which this nation ought ever to pursue . Plain , however , as the course of true and permanent prosperity is , there are yet , to the thoughtful mind , causes for apprehension that this nation may eventually be drawn into the aggressive policy , some of which we proceed to name . There are certain things which predispose the nation to this policy . Our course hitherto has been onward , and upward , with few reverses . We have achieved height after height of progress . We have run past many of the nations , that were even with or before us when we began the race , with the speed of a swift destiny , and now we are side by side with the foremost rank . This marvelous unfolding of greatness out of littleness has been attended with an equal growth of pride and an exacting spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flattery , and now will put up with only triumphs and flattery . We have done something , are a power on the earth ; and we know it , and want that other nations should have due regard to this fact also . We have reached just that point when we want them to take off the hat civilly to us , but are not particular if our* s remains on ; and any slight neglect or disrespect sends the hot blood through us in a moment . It is easy for a people so sensitive and so exacting , to get entangled in difficulty with its neighbors , he drawn away from developing its own resources to foreign strifes . Closely connected with this is a singular infatuation . We are beginning to draw that strange inference , which nations as well as individuals , ion g signally favored by Providence , are wont to draw , and which is the precursor of a fall-viz , that we have a charmed life , that we are the favorites of heaven-and have been raised up for a great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are more than an Achilles , for we acknowledge no vulnerable point . The pillars of the Universe would about as soon fall , it seems to us , as we , who are so manifestly pillared on the favor of destiny . We begin to feel that we could repose our volcanoes soon to open their fiery throats , or await the shock of contendin* nations , and experience no damage . And this infatuation is dangerous ; for we must be an exception to the general rule , if we are not swept // on , in our dealings with other nations , from infatuation to recklessness , and from recklessness to madness , and from madness to destruction . Again , we have among us , natives of our own land , a large number of restless spirits , desiring adventure , having nothing to lose , reckless , fired with the passion for distinction , but too indolent to earn it by toiling worth , and busy in fomenting strife abroad . These are the grappling-irons by which free governments are wont to be drawn alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , like England , large armies , and distant colonies in a tropical climate , whither by means of a commission we can send them , and have absence , and finally , perhaps , a fever save the country from their restlessness and dangerous ambition . The swamps of Florida once promised something of this sort , but no longer . The uneasy elements have no provided outlet . They are kept within us , where they form into knots , heads , marauding parties and expeditions , and finally drag the nation into embrofiments . Besides this natural element , there is also a large percentage of foreigners in our population-some of them the political charlatans , others the true patriots , of the old world , who have been driveii out thence , and have found a home here ; and others having more or less sympathy with those they have left behind them . These all live a divided life , partly here , partly there ; and under certain circumstances might rush like an avalanche into the contests of Europe , drawing the nation after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national sentiments is sympathy for the oppressed nations in their struggles for freedom . The whole heart of America burns when such a contest is raging ; and it is with difficulty that she can hold down and back the impulse that spontaneously leaps up to help them . But this very sentiment , so admirable and worthy in itself , and backed as it often may be by easily aroused feeling , that , as we are the sole representative of republicanism , therefore we ought to be itsdefender and propagator , may very easily , in some crisis of freedom , incite us to arms and propagandism . When we remember that , at the time when Kossuth rang the mingled notes of his patriot-wail and war-blast through the land and aroused so much sympathy for his unfortuuate country , if the issue had been still pending and doubtful , or with the chances against freedom , it would have been difficult , if not impossible , to have kept America this side of the waters ,  --  it is evident that the danger of which we speak is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every administration to // try to mark its existence by the splendor of some achievement . It wants to write its name among our annals with illuminated letters . It desires to go down to posterity standing out in some way from other administrations , as being more illustrious , more brilliant , as having done some greater thing for the country . But as little that is imposing or magnificent can be accomplished in four years by the self-developing process , there is a strong temptation to avail itself of any excuse for striking a speedier and bolder blow , and snatching that lustre from abroad which could not be wrought out from within . But passing on from these predisposing causes , we come to the much more serious consideration of fact . We have already begun on the aggressive policy , and are plotting an extension of it . As we have already stated , this has ever been the policy of one section of the Union ; and the Government has followed that section ; and the other section has followed the Government . The nation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no insignificant portion of it-as ravenons for more as a hungry lion that has just dipped his tongue in blood . We have g1ained Louisiana with all west of the Mississippi , Florida , Texas , Northern Mexico and California-whether wisely or not , is not our present purpose to discuss . But one thing is certain , that the appetite for acquisition thus whetted , will not be easily allayed , and is even now urging to expedients for further gratification . Private enterprises are formed , keeping their organization and objects secret , and hoping to surprise the nation by some movement that shall ultimately lead to the acquisition of new territory . Secret enlistments are made in our large cities , proclamations framed , and bonds of republics having no existence save in the imagination of adventurers , issued . The Government also is active , now busy with concealed diplomacy , now offerino ' large sums of money to gain by purchase what at other times*as been gained by arms , and now availing itself of some small difficulty as a pretext for a quarrel and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having but just disposed of its last morsel , is again turning the eye piercingly and hungrily , now towards the Sandwich Islands , now towards Cuba , and now towards-it may be-Central America , or the region of the Amazon , or still more of Mexico ; and shows a restless movement of its feathers and gives signs of darting off soon and swooping up the one or the other of them , or some other alien territory . No passion develops itself in a nation more rapidly or powerfully than that for national acquisition ; and our 's has begun . Where and when shall it end ? // Now this fact of a begun movement towards enlargement and aggregation to the neglect of growth , is countenanced by another still more ominous . It is that good men seem to have a secret relish for this imposing and showy kind of prosperity . They make a demonstration of opposition , as the Government sometimes does , to satisfy conscience and keep up the appearance of good faith in treaties . But when large sections of rich territory fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the result , and in their hearts would not much care if men should soon follow . There is something fascinating and brilliant in the process ; and instead of rising up and resisting it with united strength and voice , they  --  the better portion of citizens , whose opposition alone can be expected or would be worth much-are charmed into apathy , acquiescence , good humor , pleasure . And'when the good are thus swept away in the general tide , what shall restrain and steady the nation ? Such are some of the dangers that we may in the end be drawn into the aggressive policy , which would arrest all progress towards a higher kind of civilization and culture , and finally reduce us to weakness and ruin . It becomes us , therefore , as a nation , to beware of our danger and avoid it . Let , then , every citizen , who wishes well to his country , not be captivated by the present brilliancy of acquisition . Let him not sacrifice for this the good and the glory of our future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from growth , with the slow but true unfoldings of strength from within . Let him not fail to rebuke with his whole soul , for his country 's sake , for humanity 's sake , for posterity 's sake , every reckless attempt at foreign acquisition , and every enterprise , private or governmental , calculated to draw away the national enthusiasm and energy from quietly developing our resources , religious , and moral , and intellectual , as well as physical . Let him do what he can to check and put down in high and low , in wild adventurers and cunning diplomatists , in reckless borderers and equally reckless Senators , in marauders and Executives of the nation , every manifestation of the aggressive disposition , already developed and developing still more ;  --  and ma yet permit us to realize the high destiny of being the greatest , strongest , freest , and happiest nation .
