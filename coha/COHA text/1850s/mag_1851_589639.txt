JOHN RANDOLPH . ( Concluded . ) AFTER fourteen years of active service , he is again at Bizarre ; but circumstances compelled him then to go to Roanoke , where he was entirely alone . He frequently writes to some of his esteemed friends , freely commenting of the day , occasionally mingled with grave reflections . A good letter is a mark of a refined and cultivated mind , at least of a nervous and vigorous intellect , and displays much of the writer 's cast of thought . Randolph often compared himself to Logan , who told Lord Dunmore that he was the last of his race  --  a circumstance which was galling to him in after life  --  but now he was superintending the education of his nephews , who were grown up , and pushing them up into active life ; but consumption attacked the younger , and madness the elder . He writes thus to Key , on the subject , under date of July 31 , 1814 : " Affliction has assailed me in a new shape . My younger nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen , I fear , into a confirmed pulmonary consumption . He was the pride , the sole hope of our family . How shall I announce to his wretched mother , that tbe last stay of her widowed life is falling . Give me some comfort , J beseech you . What a scene awaits us here ? His birthplace in ashes , his mother worn to a skeleton with disease and grief , his brother cut off from all that distinguishes man , to his advantage , from the brute beast-I do assure you that my own reason has staggered under this cruel blow . I know , or rather have a confused conception of what I do , and sometimes strive , not altogether ineffectually , I hope , to do it ; but , again , all is chaos and misery . My faculties are benumbed-I feel suffocated-Let me hear from you , I pray . " - Vol. 2 , p. 43 . This year he visited New-York and Philadelphia , to renew some old friendships . About this time he adopted John R. Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reti*rned , but the result afforded him no pleasure : " You will have heard of my re-election  --  a circumstance which has given me no pleasure , except so far as it has been gratitying to my friends . It is a station as unfit for me , as I am unfit for it . For a long time my mind has refused to travel in that track . I can not force myself to think on the subject of my public affairs . I am engrossed by reflections of a very different , and far more important nature . I am a stricken deer , and feel disposed to leave the herd . The hand of calamity has pressed sorely upon me . I do not repine at it ; on the contrary , I return thanks for the ( apparent ) evil as well as good , which He who linows what is good for me , has appointed for my portion in this life . May it have the effect of drawing me close unto Him , without whose gracions mercy I feel that I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 46 . ) The rupture and difficulty with Britain weighed heavily upon the NewEngland States . The climate is cold ; the soil sterile ; commerce and manufactures were her sole support ; her position was deplorable , and every nerve was strained to ameliorate her prospects . Disunion was // dreaded , and the interposition of Mr. Randolph , as a distinguished leader of the opposition , and a southern man , was invoked . He explained his views very forcibly to one of her most distinguished senators , examining thoroughly the whole war , the evils , and the proper remedy for their alleviation . But his mind was now strongly occupied with religion . Born at a period when atheism overspread all christendom-when France , in her madness , deluged the scaffold with blood , the wisest and best did not escape the prevalent infection . But the examples and precepts of his mother , the bending of the knee , and clasping of the tiny hands , never had left his memory , and he sought the waters of life at their very source . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressions-Bishop Meade , whom he always held in affectionate remembrance , and Dr. iogue ; and in a letter to Dr. Brockenbrough , he observes : " I have only known three men , Meade , Key , and Rogue , who would observe what they taught ; and yet ambition , avarice , and pleasure , as it is called , have their temples crowded with votaries , whose own experience has proved to them the insufficiency and emptiness of their own pursuits , and who obstinately turn away from the only waters that can slake their thirst. - ( Vol. 2 , p. 68 . ) Of the vanity of earthly things , he had crc this been fully convinced . In one point of view he possessed advantages prized by all , envied by many  --  a time-honored name , an ample fortune , a brilliant position-but he had felt the bitterness and insufficiency of them all . He thus writes to his friend : " Without puzzling ourselves , therefore , with subtle disquisitions , let us ask , are we conscious of the necessity of pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned by infinite wisdom , and canvassed by finite comprehension , to ask of our Heavenly Father that faith and that strength which , by our own unassisted efforts , we never could obtain ? I am no disciple of either Wesley or Calvin . There is no person in the world I would injure , not even Bonaparte. - ( Vol. 2 , p. 69 . ) The church liturgy of England is a model of perfect and beautiful simplicity ; to Randolph it was the essence of the sublime . He never reasoned upon the subtilties of Christianity ; it was enough for him to believe ; the creed was his idea of faith , and from that he never departed . Through his changeful life and its many trials , till summoned to a higher tribunal , an awful sense of the majesty and presence of his God never deserted his mind . In twenty-five years , liberty had made tremendous strides : government was more firmly established . When the great financial question of the Bank of the United States was agitated in Congress , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing and commercial interests of the community . A host of pamphieteers on both sides scattered their publications broadcast throughout the Union ; some , dilating on the affluence and splendor of the old republics of Genoa and Florence , and the solid wealth of the Dutch , quoted their National Banks as precedents ; the other party deprecated such an establishment as the source of corruption and political intrigue . Among the latter Mr. Randolph stood prominent . Some had voted for the bill conscientiously ; others , because they deemed opposition useless ; and it was signed by the // President , because it seemed the will of the nation , and on the score of precedent . Mr. Randolph argued that the bill was unconstitutional , inexpedient and dangerous ; basing his reasons on the decisions of Congress , when it refused to re-charter the old bank , and the instruction of the legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky to vote against it . " I declare to you that I am the holder of no stock , whatever , except live stock , and had determined never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not only be a stockholder to the utmost of my power , but will advise every man over whom I have any interest to do the same-if I must have a master , let him be one with epaulettes , something that I can look up to , but not a master with a quill behind his ear . " - ( Vol. 5. p. 83 . ) Again was he called to suffer ; his brother 's widow sunk under her accumulated woes ; he felt her loss very acutely , and was not the selfish misanthro*e that men have been pleased to paint . He possessed all the warm and enthusiastic feelings of our nature , in the absence of which , no great undertaking can be prosecuted or important cad achieved . He took charge of the orphan sons of Mr. Bryan , and their education , and that of young Clay , requiring their separation from home , he was left to utter and entire solitude , deprived of those joyous spirits that cheered his hearth , and whose merry voices rang in his ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental derangement . By him it was bitterly felt . Religious feeling again worked upon his sensitive and iritable temperament almost to madness . The perplexing doctrines of the Trinity , free grace , man 's salvation , and the mysteries of religion , when long pursued , are enough to unsettle the strono-est most gigantic intellect . * brain , and prostrate the A journey through the mountainous parts of Virginia was advised , for the health of both mind and body . Nature , in her calm loveliness , soothes the diseased intellect , and heals the wounds of the soul . Upon him it had the same effect ; and he writes more cheerfully and con soling ly . Religion with him was no sect or party ; it was the homage of man to his God , the soul to her Creator . Tie suffered severely by the failure of a mercantile house in Richmond , and he speaks bitterly of the delinquents . His correspondence is too voluminous to be here more than mentioned , but will amply repay a perusal . The ensuing session of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interest , and was barren of any events ; but in the session of 1821 , the Missouri question was discussed . It admitted of much reasoning , and many views of the Constitution were presented . In fact , if that instrument , or its provisions , be once violated , it opens the door to a thousand frauds . Slavery had been plainly discussed at the framing of that compact , and but one mention is made of it , ( prohibiting the importation of slaves after 1804 . ) Upon the mind of Mr. Randolph it exerted a great influence , and during the debate he hardly eat or slept . The Speaker of the louse ( Clay ) solicited a private interview ; but even the magic power of that great orator was lost upon him . " The bill was passed through the forms of law . Missouri was admitted into the Union contrary to the Constitution ; as much so , as if I had voted the other day in the first instance , and the Speaker had ordered the Clerk to put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had voted no ; because , sir , agreeably to // the Constitution of the United States , every member has a right to his vote under the forms of the House , whether these forms are observed or not , and my colleagues and myself were ousted out of our right to reconsider , for which I would not have taken all the land in the State of Missouri . " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 130 . ) The death of Commodore Decatur followed closely on the Missouri question . To him Randolph was warmly attached , and he now first showed the symptoms of madness ; but a retirement to Roanoke , and the society of his friends , restored him perfectly . At the opening of the next session , the Missouri question was discussed under another form . His remarks were sound , logical , and evinced a great knowledge of the Consti-* tution and privileges of the states . The measure was passed , and he returned to his own ingleside . He then made his will , emancipating and providing for the comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he calls it , his log-book , contains , like the conversations of Colerid*e , many gems , hit off in a short and abrupt manner . After a trifling conversatior*with some chance traveler about the weather , he remarks : " As I pressed my little mare on , or rather as she pushed her way on , after Conrade and Johnny , I thought of Sir Arthur , 1'VLiss Wardour , and the old gaber-lunzie . They turned the headland , and found the water-mark under water . Polack , a most dangerous ford at all times , from the nr*ture of the stream which is called a fish-kettle bottom , is behind me , and no retreat , and no house better than old Lear 's hovel , except the church , whure were no materials for a fire . When I reached Acotink , the sandbank , in the middle of the stream , was uncovered ; but for near a mile I was a great prince , my good sir , for the privilege of frankincr a letter , and the honor of being overlooked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 153 . ) The Apportionment Bill was the measure of the session , and was extremely important . As the inhabitants of the United States have at all times cherished liberty , and the idea of a popular representation , the ratio was fixed , varying from 35,000 to 75,000 ; the committee reported 40,000 ; Mr. Tucker of Virginia 38,000 ; by this ratio , Virginia would still retain her present standing , but by the estimate of the committee , she would fall below the states of Pennsylvania and New-York . The project was disrelished by Mr. Randolph , and combatted in his usual masterly style . His views are remarkably far-sighted , and displayed much research and political sagacity ; a small representation is to be dreaded ; the members become too sectional in their feelings , and are too apt to bebiassed . The measure was passed , and Virginia numerically ranked as a second or third-rate state . Death again deprived Mr. Randolph of another friend and colleague . Mr. Pinekucy of Maryland , an eminent member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served his country , paid the debt of nature ; Mr. Randolph pronounced a feeling and touching tribute to his memory . On the 9th of March , in a speech of two hours ' length , he opposed the bankrupt bill ; but , finding opposition useless , he obtained leave of absence , and sailed for Europe . The most powerful essayist and profoundest of the English critics ohserves , that in a sea voyage , where escape is impossible , when food , air , and exercise are taken in common , intimacy is inevitable , and that a close connection of this kind breeds more friendship than in a life-time on shore . Mr. Harvey was his travelling companion ; he carefully retained // the incidents of the voyage , and thus relates his opinion of some of the poets : " His favorite author was Milton , and he frequently gave us readings from Paradise Lost , stopping occasionally to point out the beauties of the poem . Young , Thomson , Johnson , and Southey did not please his taste ; they were too artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir , I first place upon the list Tom Cribs ' Memorial to Congress , for its great wit and satire ; next , The Two-penny Post Boy , for similar excellencies ; and third , Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage , for lively sentiment well expressed . But , sir , ( no otli'ence to Ireland , ) I ca n't go Moore 's Songs , they are too sentimer*tal by half ; all ideal , no nature . Take my advice , and do n't read any of the novels when you get home , sir ; tell your father that I recommended abstinence from novel reading and whiskey punch , they are both equally injurious to the brain . " - ( Vol. 2 , P. 173 , ) In the most intellectual game of cards , whist , he excelled , and was passionately fond of the amusement . Mr. Harvey remarked some books , marked " To Bet , " a favorite young lady friend , and remarked , that they were the works of the old dramatists , and some passages were scarcely fit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He glanced over them , and thanked him for the observations . He had with him , Fanny , a witty and satirical poem , by Mr. Halleck , to be given to the wittiest woman that he should meet ; the volume was bestowed upon Miss Edgeworth . His first letter from the mother country abounded in striking delineations of English character and scenery ; complains bitterly of the venality of the tradespeople of every class ; but to the English country gentleman , gives the full meed of approbation : " But I should do the greatest injustice were I not to say , that the higher ranks , a few despicable and despised fashionable* excepted , are as unpretending and plain as an old Virginia gentleman , whom they greatly resemble . This class is nearly extinct , to my great shame and grief , and to the great loss of our country . They are as distinct from the present race , in their manners , dress , and  |p6nci|ples*  and everything bat anatomical structure , as an eagle is from a pig , or a wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not graceful , not affable , but plain , social , kind , without one particle of pretension , in dress , name , or anything else . " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 185 . ) The wonders of the British capital long entertained him , but there was a spectacle of the moral sublime , of the wonderful and divine efficacy of Christian charity , which interested his benevolent and philanthropic heart , more than the architectural splendor and triumph of the arts , or even the intellectual magnificence of the great metropolis . The condition of the female convicts , in that city and throughout the kingdom , had long been neglected ; vice of all kinds prevailed in its deformity , and the unfortunate beings were ranked below animals ; but the holy zeal of Elizabeth Fry , a high-born quakeress , rescued the fallen portion of her sex from entire ruin , and held out a hope of future usefulness . " I have seen , he remarked , two days ago , the greatest curiosity in London , aye , in England too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tower , Somerset House , the British Museum , nay , Parliament itself , sink into utter insignificance . I have seen , sil. , Elizabeth Fry , of Newgate , and I have witnessed there , sir , the miraculous effects of true Christianity upon the most depraved of human beings , bad women , sir , who are worse if possible than the devil himself , // sir , and yet the wretched outcasts have been tamed and subdued by th' Christian eloquence of Mrs. Fry . I have seen them weep repentant tears , while she addressed them ; I have heard their groans of despair , sir . Nothing but religion , sir , can effect this miracle , sir ; for what can be a greater miracle than the conversion of a degraded , sinful woman , taken from the very dregs of society . Oh , sir , it was a sight worthy of the attention of angels . " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 186 . ) The celebrated Virginian met with much courtesy and hospitality . A nobleman at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-informed a gentleman on every subject-literature , history , belles-lettres -- -  --  and besides possessed a particular and minute local knowledge of many places in England and Ireland . As a mark of particular distinction , a private entrance near the throne was granted , so that access could be had without encountering the crush , of which he availed himself to hear the discussion on the Roman Catholic Peers ' bill , and where he was also near Castlereagh , Canning , and Sir Robert Peel . Some days af .. ter he attended a relief ball for the Irish , who were then suffering from the combined effects of famine and disease . At the meeting of the African Institution in London , he spoke with great applause on the suppression of the slave trade . He left England , and returned a few days before the adjournment of Congress , hurried to Virginia , and thence to Long Island , to attend the races , and back again to Roanoke ; but still in the same desolation , he laments : " The life I lead here is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . It resembles , in many points , solitary confinement . It is the daily recurrence of the same dreary scene ; and when evening sets in , so that I can not read or write , nothing can be imagined more forlorn . But I always struggle through it , as the will of Providence . " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 193 . ) Spain , formerly the noblest nation in Europe , the discoverer of America , and the representative of European chivalry , had just been despoiled of the brightest jewels of her diadem . Mexico and the South American colonies had shaken off the Spanish yoke . Their independence had been recognized , and ministers had been despatched to their respective governments ; but the mother-country resisted such dismemberment , and the allied powers of Europe , report affirmed , would lend her aid to conquer her revolted provinces .

" Two of the most eloquent orators of the House , Clay and Webster , in speeches of extraordinary power and brilliancy , advocated that theme so dear to American hearts , liberty , and under the specious guise of enabling the oppressed to throw off their chains , and to drive the invaders from their soil , presented her claims in all the dazzling and fervid eloquence of those great statesmen ; but Randolph sternly quoted the axiom laid down by Puf* // fendorg and insisted that such an interference would be an aggression on the rights of a country with whom the United States were at peace , and a violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained many pointed and bitter allusions ; and in consequence of that view of the subject prevailing , the matter was laid upon the table , never to be resumed . In the debate on the internal improvement bill , he participated , being opposed to Mr. Clay , alleging that so liberal a scheme of internal improvement far exceeded the powers granted by the Constitution to Congress . After a short debate on the tariW he retired from the House for a season , and again visited Europe . Mr. Harvey called on him the morning of his departure , and found him looking for a verse in the Bible to finish a letter to his constituents , and quarrelling with his servant John ; but at the sight of the tears he added : " What , does he shed tears ? " He does , replied I , and you may see them yourself . " Then he shall go with me . John , take down your baggage , and let us forget what has passed .

He advocated the principles of the old Federal party , and Clay was its leader in the House , its ardent defender in private , its most impassioned orator at the hustings . Andrew Jackson was comparatively a novus homo , but of a strong , energetic , and masculine intellect , who had risen from poverty and obscurity to honor and distinction , a brave soldier and a daring general , who has stamped upon the period of his administration a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republic .

He received but one vote of the electoral college , and four in the House ; and at the time it was commonly asserted that he experienced a secret gratification at the result . Charges of bribery and corruption brought against Mr. Clay , cost him the vote of Louisiana . The aspirants were balloted in the House . Adams received 13 votes , Jackson 7 , and Crawford 4 . Messrs . Randolph and Webster were appointed by the tellers to announce the result ; in which the former reported , that Adams , Jackson , and Crawrord , had received the votes of so many states ; showing his accuracy in the statement of facts , and not only the observance of the rights of the states , but even of the phraseology in which these rights might be clad .

With the design of guarding their recently acquired freedom , and to arrange measures for the successful prosecution of the war against Spain , delegates had been elected , and a General Congress was held at Panama . The matter was discussed in the National Legislature , and strenuously advocated ; and it *was intimated to // the resident ministers , that if an invitation were extended , the United States would likewise send a representative . It met with opposition , but the Secretary of State informed the South American Ministers , that should the Senate concur , commissioners should be appointed ; and on the 6th of December , in his report , informed Congress , that the invitation has been accepted , and envoys on the part of the United States will be empowered to attend those deliberations .

An answer was returned in the affirmative , and that he could not prescribe the conduct of the Senate . In a speech of some length , Mr. Randolph strongly condemned the conduct of the Executive , and the bold presumption of the Secretary of State , not sparing the most searching sarcasm and bitter invectives , and thus finished : " I knew that the measure would not be done at all , or done unanimously ; therefore , in spite of the remonstrances of friends , I went away , not fearing that any one would doubt what would have been my vote if I had staid .

Clay and Randolph , is perhaps one of the finest in the book , and abounds in striking passages . The custom of duelling was unfortunately too prevalent at that time , and seemed an essential part of the high-toned chivalry of the South . It had cost the nation one of her most gifted orators , and blighted the prospects of his great compeer and antagonist , and plunged the people in sorrow . The contrast between the two is in the author 's most happy style : " These two remarkable men , so often meeting in the arena of debate , now for the first time in the bloody field , were born within a day 's ride of each other ; one in the baronial halls of his ancestors , on the lofty banks of the Appotomax , the other in an humble dwelling amid the slashes of Hanover .

In daily contact among his fellows , the one became affable , courteous , winning in his ways , and powerful in his influence over the mind and the will of the admiring multitude ; the other , in retirement and solitude , cherished those sterner virtues that made him the unbending advocate of truth , the unwavering defender of the Constitution , and the intrepid leader of those who rallied around the rights of the states , as the only sure guaranty of the rights of the people .

But in the career of Clay there was a crisis : the eagle eye of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character , and a single false step would have caused his public ruin . The practice is to be reprobated ; it is a bastard valor , the last and worst relic of the days of chivalry ; and it is a blot on the escutcheon of Christian states , that no means have yet been found of obviating it . Colonel Hamilton , of South Carolina , called upon him the evening : before , and found him reading Milton : he criticised its beauties , and after some conversation on the duel , remarked , that he did not mean to return Clay 's fire , unless he saw malice prepense in his eye . They reached the ground , and he observed , " Clay is cool , but not vindictive ; " the pistol , however , went off before the word was given . A second fire was equally harmless ; and the instant his antagonist saw it , he exclaimed , " I trust in God that you are untouched ; after what has happened , I would not have harmed you for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ties which Randolph was destined never to enjoy ; for him " No busy housewife plied her evening care , Nor children climbed his knee , the envied kiss b share . " He was the last of his line , the sole survivor of his house ; a sympathy must be felt for his desolate condition . Mr. Garland expresses himself feelingly : " Mr. Clay had a wife and children to mourn his loss ; hut there was not one to shed a tear over his solitary grave . He knew the safety of his adversary ; * but , with the immediate prospect of death before him , the sublime strains of the godlike Milton attuned his heart to softest influences ; and the chords of affiection , so long silent , and rusted by the ch*lling breath of a cold world , awakened by the soft echoes of long past memories , now vibrated a sweet , though mournful melody , that mingled its harmonious notes with the divine song of the poet .

His speech , March 2d , on Negro Slavery , is remarkable for its just predictions : he treats the subject with all the gravity that it merits , but speaks fearlessly and to the point ; he saw the danger , which , if injudiciously managed , that it boded to the Union . His correspondence is a daily historical index of events in the political world , and often contains matters worth preserving , and unveils the inmost recesses of his mind . His thoughts on emancipation coincide entirely with the moderate of both parties . Under date of July 20th , 1836 , writing to Dr. Brockenbrough , he says I told him ( the Ch . J. ) also of my firm and positive refusal to present to the Senate the petition of the Colonization Society , though earnestly entreated to do so by Mr. Key .

The ministry Will not find themselves upon a bed of roses , when Parliament meet . " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 275 . ) Political parties in Virginia had changed in the last quarter of a century , and Mr. Randolph was not sufficiently pliable to meet the wishes of some of his constituents . The bank question , the tariW internal improvements , and connection with foreign republics , had divided factions ; and men who had formerly fought under the same banner , were now opposed personally and politically , and not a few were taunted as renegades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often personally , which drew down upon him hatred and aversion .

The news of his defeat having reached Dr. Camp , then a representative from that district , he published a circular , declining a re-election , and Randolph was again returned . His letters are filled with complaints of feeble health , which prevented him from accepting the hospitalities of his friends and constituents . But the times demanded his aid , and he boldly buckled on his armor , and took the field against the administration- " men , measures , the principles they announced , and the manner they came into power . " His speech , in answer to Mr. Everett , delivered this session , on the unfitness of the present rulers , emphatically declares , that to guide the ship of state , orators and logicians are not needed or desired , but that the hard-working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , and khows how to deal with its wants and stern realities , are the best pilots to conduct the vessel to a haven of safety . It is dedicated to his constituents , and is a masterly effort . Sickness , sorrow , and loneliness , were his portion in the summer . He depended entirely on his friends for comfort and consolatien ; but his letter to Dr. Brockenbrough is a sad picture of his existence : " My good friend-I am sick , body and mind . I am without a single resource excel ) t the workings of my own fancy . Fine as the weather is , and has been all this month , I have not drawn a trigger .

It presented a strange scene of fusion . Old federalists and modern democrats , men who had been in political war the whole of their public life , for the first time met on common ground . The House was divided into several committees ; Mr. Madison was Chairman of the Legislative Committee , of which Mr. Randolph was a member . Seated in a remote corner , his keen eye closely scanned their proceedings ; and ever and anon , his musical voice would startle those in the room , and the audience crowded around to see from whence those unearthly sounds proceeded . Many partially lost the brilliant reputation they had acquired at the bar , and in the Senate chamber ; but the statesman of Roanoke enchained universal attention by his fascinating eloquence . " His profound knowledge of men , of history , of government , the causes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty of winnowing the chaff , and collecting together the scattered grains of a protracted debnte , his concentrated , pointed , and forcible expressions , making bare , in a few words , the whole of a complicated subject , and his vast experience in parliamentary proceedings , gave him an unexpected and controlling influence over the proceedings of the convention . " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 326 . ) His speeches were always brief ; rarely exceeding two hours iii their delivery . As the most distinguished member on the floor , he closed the business of the convention in a neat address to Mr. Barbour , who presided . On the 16th of December , 15fi9 , the mission to Russia was tendered and acrepted , and he sailed for St. Petersburgh , accompanied by J. R. Clay , as Secretary of Legation . The mission has nothing to interest the reader , and he returned in the autumn of 1831 , much emaciated . Opium soothes disease , and allays the pangs of suffering more effectually than any other drug , and the excruciating agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intellect would resume all her clearness , and he would converse with his usual brilliancy ; but fitful gleams of insanity were too obvious , and he himself lamented his use of stimulus : " I am fast sinking into an opium-eating sot , but , please God , I will shake off the incubus yet before I die ; for whatever difference of opinion may exist on the subject of suicide , there can be none as to rushing into the presence of our Creator , in a state of drunkenness , whether produced by opium or brandy . " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 345 . ) The degeneracy of his native state , and the contrast between her past and present condition , affected him deeply . He recalled the period when the stately mansions which now lay in ruins , were the seats of luxury and hospitality ; that the old gentry were gone ; that their descendants were scattered , and Virginia no longer held the first rank in the confederacy . He had many contests with his servants . The following incident exhibits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Randolph 's friends witnessed during the winter many ludicrous scenes between him and his servants ; but his fits of excitement did not last long . His // extreme irritability was occasioned by disease , and the stimulants he was compelled to take to alleviate pain ; but he was prompt in making reparation . His private body-servants were soon restored to their proper station . About the first of April , he called on the overseer , and asked him to ride out with him , and said he was going to make friends with his headman , Billy , whom he had put to work in the ditch . They rode out to the ditch , and Mr. Randolph said , Your servant . Billy . ' Your servant , master , ' replied Billy . Well , Billy , said he , I have come to make friends with you . ' Thank you , master , ' said Billy . Billy , ' said Mr. Randolph , you stole my wool , and sold it for fifty cents . ' Yes , master . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for I took your pumpkins , and turned you out of a comfortable house , and gave you three damned whippings , and now , I think , that I owe you something , and have come to settle up with you . ' As the result of this settlement , Billy was transferred to his place , and restored to his property . " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 329 . ) About the middle of May he was reduced to a skeleton , but he regained the use of his mental faculties , which , with a few exceptions , he retained to the hour of his death . On the accession of General Jackson , he vetoed the bill for the Maysyule road , stopping all the wild internal improvement schemes projected by his predecessor . The veto of the bank of the United States , the removal of th , e deposits , the tariff , and the compromise bill , are measures that are identified with the history of the country , political  --  and comtnercial ; but the doctrine of nullification struck terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his energies for a last struggic . He saw the temple of liberty , reared by the labor , and cemented by the blood of our ancestors , in danger , and he put out his hand to stay its fall . Too weak to stand , he addressed vast audiences sitting ; his eyes shone with an unnatural lustre , his voice sounded like the echoes of an *racle , and like Isaiah , a burning coal seemed to have touched his lips . From county to county , town to town , village to village , his notes resounded ; the fate of the Union was at stake . Worn down by sickness , he went to Baltimore , and in the boat , almost alone and neg1ected , save by his servants , he fortunately encountered Dr. Dunbar , an eminent physician , who paid him all the attention that his melancholy situation demanded . He gasped for breath , and remarked that he was past surgery ; as the doctor was reading to him , he corrected a mispronunciation , conversed about his friends in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mr. Randolph proceeded to Washington . lie was anxious again to mingle with the great of the land , and once more to hear the silvery tones , and look upon the beaming face and commanding form of the self-made Kentuckian . He entered the chamber when Clay was addressing the senate . " Raise me up , said Randolph-I want to hear that voice again ; when Mr. Clay had concluded his remarks , which were very few , he turned round to see from what quarter that singular voice proceeded . Seeing Mr. Randolph , and that he was in a dying condition , he left his place , and went to speak to him . As he approached , Mr. Randolph said to the gentleman with him , raise me up . ' " As Mr. Clay offered his hand , he said , Mr. Randolph , I hope you are better , sir . ' No , sir , ' replied Mr. Randolph , 1 am a dying man , and I came here expressly to have this interview . ' " They grasped hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vol. 2 , p. 370. // he arrived in the midst of a pitiless storm , and had some difficulty in procuring lodgings . At the City Hotel he was accommodated , and immediately sent for Dr. Parrish , to whom he described his symptoms with " medical accuracy , " and then added : " I have been in idiosyncrasy all my life . All the preparations of camphor invariably injure me . As to ether , it will blow me up . Not so with opium ; I can take opium like a Turk , and have been for some years in the habitual use of it in some shape or other . " Before the doctor retired , the conversation became curiously diversified . He introduced the subject of the Quakers-complimented them in his particular manner for neatness , economy , order , comfort in every thing . Right , said he , in every thing , except politics ; they are there always twistical . He then repeated a portion of the Litany of the Episcopal Church , with apparent fervor. " - ( Vol. 2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won his heart , and he repeatedly solicited his visits . On one occasion , commenting upon the Holy Scriptures , he observed , that the account of the creation presented an example of great sublimity . After he had made all his preparations , he suddenly rose in his bed , and exclaimed : " Remorse , remorse . ' It was thrice repeated ; the last time at the top of his voice , with great agitation . He cried out , let me see the word ; get me a dictionary ; let me see the word . ' rfhere is none in the room , sir . Write it down ; let me see the word . ' The doctor picked up one of his cards . Randolph , of Roanoke , shall 1 write it on this card ? Yes ; nothing more proper . ' The word remorse was then written in pencil . He took the card in a hurried manner , and fixed his eyes upon it with great intensity . Write it on the back , ' he exclaimed . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extremely agitated . Remorse ! you can form no idea of it whatever . it has contributed to bring me to my present situation ; but I have looked to the Lord Jesus Christ , and hope I have obtained pardon . ' " - ( Vol. 2 , p. 374 . ) The last scene was deeply impressive  --  the dying roan , enveloped in blankets , and supported by pillows , with his hat on his head . His last action was for the good of his fellow-beings . Surrounded by all the witnesses , when the spirit was on the eve of taking its flight , he concentrated his mental and physical forces , and his soul speaking in his eyes , in his dearest tones , with his long index finger in the air , he exclaimed : " I confirm all the directions in my will respecting my slaves , and direct them to be enforced , particularly in regard to a provision for their support . ' And then raising his arm as high as he could , he brought it down with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added these words , especially for this * - ( Vol. 2 , p. 374 . ) His mind then sank . He wandered amid his familiar haunts , and held converse with absent friends ; and two hours after , he breathed his last . His remains were carried to his loved Virginia , and repose under the shadows of those ancient trees which had witnessed the sports of his childhood , the joys of his youth , the agony of his manhood and old age . He was a person of undonbtQd genius ; and among all the remarkable men that crowded the halls of legislation , he held a distinguished rank . His peculiar temperament , fiery eloquence , and deep insight into character and human nature , stirred up the different elements which surrounded him , and elicited on all sides sparks of intellect . // The peculiar circumstances of his domestic circle , his crushed affections and utter loneliness , cast a deep shade over his mind , and left an indelible impression upon his soul ; but to his credit , let it be noted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , no moral dereliction stained his purity , and his exertions in the cause of his country were untiririg ; and when death had laid upon him her iron hand , he raised his voice to guard the Union .
