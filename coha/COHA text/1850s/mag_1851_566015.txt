txt ART . VII. - STEAMSHIPS TO LIBERIA. - AFRICAN COLONIZATION . Report of the Naval Committee to the House of Representatives , Angust , 1850 , in favor of the establishment of a line of Mail Steamships to the western coast of Africa , and thence via the Mediterranean to London ; designed to promote the emigration of free persons of color from the United States to Liberia : also to increase the Steam Navy , and to extend the Commerce of the United States . With an Appendix added by the American Colonization Society . Washington : printed by Gideon &amp; Co. , 1850 . Letter of lion . T. Butler King to Hon. F. P. Stanton , in relation to the proposed line of Steamers to the Coast of Africa . THIS report originated in a memorial by Joseph Bryan , of Alabatna , for himself and his associates , George Nicholas Sanders and others , praying for aid from the government of the United States in establishing and maintaining a line of steamships from this country to the coast of Africa , with the design to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppress the African slave trade , to carry the mails , and to extend our commerce . rphat memorial was referred by the House of Representatives to the committee on tiaval affairs , consisting of Hon. Messrs . Fred . P. Stanton , of Teun. , Thomas S. Bocock , of Va. , // Robert C. Schenck , of Ohio , Emile La S*re , of La. , Hugh White , of New York , Elbridge Gerry , of Maine7 E. Carrington Cabell , of Florida , John McQ*ueen , of South Carolina. , and Lewis C. Levin , of Pa . The report which they presented , and the bill founded thereon which they proposed , evince the wisdom and benevolence of enlightened and phihuthropic statesmen . The report recommends the acceptance of the proposal of the memorialists or contractors , though with some important modifications , to w hick they assented . The committee propose that the contractors shall build three steamships of the largest class ( each of not less burden than 4,000 tons , and at an expense of not more than $900000 ) in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Navy , and under the superintendence of an officer appointed by him , and in such a manner that they can be converted at the least possible expense into the best of war steamers ; and moreover that they shall make such alterations , additions and repairs in them , as in the judgment of the Secretary of the Navy will render them adequate to all the exigencies of the stipulated service  --  the government advancing two-thirds the cost of construction as it proceeds , in the form of five per cent . stocks payable at the end of thirty years , and repayable by the contractors in equal annual installments , beginning and ending with the service . The ships are to be commanded by officers of the Navy , who will each have four midshipmen to serve as watch officers ; they are to be under such control of the Secretary of the Navy as may not be inconsistent with the terms of the contract ; who will have the right , at all times , to place on board each two gums of heavy calibre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodated and provided for at the expense of the contractors , and the right also , in case of war , to take any or all of them for the exclusive use and service of the United States , on paying such a price , not exceeding the cost , as shall be determined by appraisers mutually chosen by the Secretary and the contractors . The plan of ordinary service for the ships-two of which are to be built within two and a half years , and the third within three years , after the execution of the contract-is this . One will leave New York every three months , touching at Savannah for freight and mails ; one will leave Baltimore every three months , touchlug at Norfolk and Charleston for passengers , freight and mails ; and the third will leave New Orleans every three months , with liberty to touch at any of the X*iTest India islands . They will proceed directly to Liberia , with liberty to touch at any of the islands or ports of the coast of Africa ; thence to Gibraltar , carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of Spain , to be designated by the government ; thence to Lisbon ; thence to Brest or such other port of France as the government may designate ; and thence to London-bringing mails // 72 Steamships to Liberia . from all these points to the United States . The contractors stipulate , on their part , to carry on each and every voyage as many free colored emigrants as the American Colonization Society may send not exceeding hoxvever two thousand five hundred , at the price , to be paid by that Society in advance , of $10 for each emigrant over twelve years of age , and of $5 for each one under that age-this price securing not only passage for each person , but the transportation of his baggage , and a daily supply of sailor 's rations . And , on its part , the government is to pay $40,000 for each voyage , taking a lien on the ships for the repayment of sums advanced for their construction , and also ample security for the faithful fulfillment of the contract , which is to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To afford the means of judging as to the fairness of the compensation offered , the committee present an estimate of the expenses and profits of reducing this plan to practice . We can not enter into its details but present it summarily . Interest at 6 per cent . on the $2,700,000 , the cost of three steamships at $900,000 each ; depreciation and repairs at 10 per cent. ; insurance at 7 per cent. ; and the cost of running the ships twelve voyages in a year at $50,000 per voyage ; make an annual expense amounting to $1,221,000 . On the other hand estimating the number of passengers at 1500 for each of the twelve voyages , the whole number during a year will be 18,000 ; which , at the rate of $10 for adults and $5 for children , may average a profit of $3 each , making $54,000 . This , added to the $40,000 of government pay for each of the twelve voyages , makes an aggregate of $534,000 of annual profits ; which subtracted from the preceding aggregate of estimated annual expenses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by commerce and passengers , over and above the government pay and the profit from emigrants sent by the Colonization Society , in order to save the contractors from loss . This , and enough more to remunerate them in the enter* prize , they expect to realize . And this expectation , in the judgment of the committee , is well founded . Such is the plan . It reflects honor upon the committee who proposed it . We wish we could add that the House of Representatives have honored themselves by passing the bill which embodied it . The bill if we remember rightly was not brought to a direct vote , but was either laid on the table or postponed to the next session . We hope it will soon be resumed or offered anew , and be made the law of the land . The letter of the Hon. T. Butler King , which we have also prefixed to this article , was written to Mr. Stanton , in reply to a letter from that gentleman requesting Mr. King , as his predecessor in the position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give his view of the policy of the // measures proposed in the bill of the committee ; and to make such " suggestions as should occur to his mind , either favorable or unfavorable to the bill . " This letter of Mr. King expresses warm approbation of the project , and communicates valuable information relating to the whole subject , of which we have freely availed ourselves . The reasons which commend this enterprise consist in its relation to our commerce ; to our naval armament ; and to the settlement by colonization of the African coast , and the prevention thereby of the slave trade . It is a very beneficent idea , which was first advanced in England about the year 1839 , of uniting the military and commercial marine of a nation-of making the vast expenditures , required in naval armaments , subservient to the purposes of commerce in time of peace . This idea is destined to revolutionize the navies of the world  --  to turn the very expensive , and for the greater part of the time idle , or no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peaceful industry . It employs for useful objects vast forces of capital , skill and labor , which for the most part are unemployed , or employed to little purpose . It will change the officers and privates of the navy , who for the great portion of the time are idlers , or employed in doing nothing that they may be kept busy , into industrious agents of productive business . It will ere long cause the inquiry , why huge and expensive vessels should lie under huge and expensive houses , in navy yards ; or should lie rotting at the docks or in harbors ; when the same or less expense would build steam vessels , capable of constant and useful employment , in time of peace in the duties and protection of commerce , and in time of war for its dread purposes . And it will cause the inquiry , also , why the men and officers of navies , maintained at great national expense in the many years of peace , should not be engaged in the war which it opens-in promoting national prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time they guard the nation 's commerce , and are ready at the first call for the sterner duties of war . Indeed , by the extension of maritime business , and the multiplication and interweaving of commercial relations over the world , it will go far toward preventing war . The substitution of steam navies capable of commercial business for the ordinary vessels of war , accomplishes on the sea , what it would be on the land , to turn swords into plough shares and spears into pruning hooks . It may not suit at once the chivalrous notions of our naval officers to be employed in anything so useful as commercial business . It may seem to their martial tastes quite inglorious to be occupied in promoting freedom of intercourse and the exchange of products between nations . But , under the tuition of the popVOL . IX . 10 // ular common sense , and the popular sense of what is right , they will soon come to understand that production is far more honorable than destruction ; that it is more honorable to transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of other lands , than it is to send them suddenly and violently into eternity ; and that it is far more dignified to be useful workers than to be fruitless consumers . But in order to realize in any considerable degree this idea of the union of the military and mercantile marine , the ships must be steamships . It has been found by experiment that ocean steamers are not capable of resisting safely and successfully the efforts of a heavy sea driven by a head wind , unless they are built strong enough to carry guns , and to withstand the discharge of a heavy battery . It has also been found that they are far superior to sailing vessels in the certainty and celerity with which they convey freight and passengers . On the other hand , it is well known that sailing vessels can not answer the purposes both of a mercantile and military marine . If they are built so strong as to render them safe and suitable for service in war , they are so loaded with timber as to make it impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ordinary construction , and still less with steam vessels . The opinion of the English government respecting the wisdom of creating a steam navy , to be employed in time of peace for the purposes of commerce and the transmission of mails , is forcibly expressed by what that government has done . On this point we quote , from the report before us , a statement of facts , for which the committee acknowledge themselves indebted to a speech made in the House of Representatives by Hon. Thomas Butler King of Georgia  --  the author of the letter to which we have referred , a gentleman who has evinced great intelligence and wisdom respecting commercial and naval affairs . Soon after the idea was conceived in 1839 of uniting the commercial and military marine by steamships ; " A contract was entered into with Mr. Cunard and his associates , for the conveyance of the mails from Liverpool , via Halifax , to Boston , in five steamers of the first class , for ? 85,000 , or about $425,000 per annum . It was stipulated that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be inspected on being received into the service , and certified to be capable in all respects of being converted into ships of war , and of carrying ordnance of the heaviest description . Various stipulations were entered into in this and other contracts of a similar character , which placed these ships under the control of the government ; thus , in fact , making them , to all intents and purposes , at the same time a part of the mercantile and military marine of the country . " In 1846 , the government enlarged the contract with Mr. Cunard and his associates , by adding four ships to run from Liverpool to New York , and increased the compensation to ? 145,000 , or about $725,000 per annum . " In the year 1840 , a contract was made by the Admiralty with the Royal Mail Steamship Company , at ? 240,000 sterling , or $1,200,000 per annum , for // fourteen steamers to carry the mails from Southampton to the West Indies , the ports of Mexico on the Gulf , and to New Orleans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first class , and are to conform in all respects , concerning size and adaptation to the purposes of war , to the conditions prescribed in the Cunard contracts . They are to make twenty-four voyages a year , leaving and returning to Southampton semi-monthly . Another contract has lately been entered into for two ships to run between Bermuda and New York . These lines employ twenty-five steamers of the largest and most efficient description . " In addition to the above , a contract was made , 1st January , 1845 , with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for a line of similar steamers , seven in number , from England to the East Indies and China , at ? 160,000 sterling , or $800,000 per annum . This line passes from Southampton , via Gibraltar and Malta , to Alexandria , in Egypt ; thence the route continues overland to Suez , at the head of the Red Sea , from whence the steamers again start , touching at Aden , Bombay , and at Point de Galle , in the island of Ceylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a branch line connecting with this , from Point de Galle to Calcutta , touching at Madras . " A contract was made , 1st July , 1846 , for a Pacific line of British steamers , four in number , running from Valparaiso to Panama , touching at intermediate ports . This line connects overland , from Panama to Chagres , with the West India line . " Besides these , there were , in 1848 , twelve more lines of government steamers running between Great Britain and the continent of Europe ; making a grand aggregate of one hundred and fifteen ocean steamships fitted for war purposes . Very recently the British Parliament has resolved to extend the mail steamship system to Australia . " - pp. 5-7 . This statement , we presume , applies only to steam vessels of the larger class ; for as long since as the year 1846 , Mr. Secretary Bancroft reported , in a communication to the Senate , that the total steam navy of Great Britain at that time consisted of one hundred and ninety-nine vessels , of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of that country has resolved to put on a line of steamers from London to the Cape of Good Hope and the western coast of Africa . He also stated in the same report that the steam navy of France at that time numbered fifty-four vessels , ( much increased now , as we see by the preceding extract ) and that of Russia , exclusive of her Caspian fleet , numbered thirty-two-  --  a statement which evinces that those powerful governments entertain the opinion on this matter so strongly expressed by the acts of the British government . The necessity which this course on the part of European governments , and especially of the British government , imposes on the government of the United States , of entering promptly and vigorously on the same course , is very apparent . The United States can not otherwise protect their immensely extended coasts on the Atlantic and Pacific ; nor can they otherwise maintain their proper relative position in the commerce of the world . The new phenomenon of steam navies renders comparatively ineffectual means of coast and harbor defense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmed by Mr. King , that our extensive coasts-consisting of the shores of the Atlantic from the St. Croix to the southern point of Florida , the shores of more than three fourths of the Gulf of Mexico , and the shores of the Pacific through seventeen degrees of latitude-can not be defended against a fleet of armed steamers by any system of fortifications which the skill of man could devise , or the wealth of the nation could establish . This affirmation is nndoubtedly correct , as any one can see . Plainly , nothing but a steam navy can adequately protect our coasts and harbors against a steam navy . Equally manifest is it that the United States must employ the improvements made by the application of steam to the purposes of foreign commerce , if we would maintain , indeed if we would recover , our former relative position in maritime business . It is well known that before the employment of steam in the navigation of the ocean , our lines of packet ships had overcome all competition in the great business of conveying passengers , correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that no packet ships from other countries entered our harbors . It is also well known that the enterprise of Great Britain , in entering first , by the union of public with private expenditure , into the business of ocean steam navigation , has in a great measure reversed this state of things . For some years past , the lucrative business carried on by our packet ships in the transportation of passengers and the lighter and costlier merchandise , has been chiefly transferred to the English steamers . The skill , ingenuity and experience , and the vast amount of public and private capital , employed by England in this new method of commerce , have , until lately , distanced all competition . And it is very plain that her steam mail packet system , extending to all parts of the globe , will , if she is not rivalled in it , monopolize the carrying trade , and secure the control and the profits of the commerce , of all nations ; beside giving a partial and perhaps complete support to a steam navy , powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such is the superiority of steam ships to sailing ships in the certainty and rapidity of conveyance , that the former must inevitably take the place of the latter in all important branches of the carrying trade . The merchant who employs the latter can not loncr compete with the merchant who employs the former . The difference in the interest upon capital , and in the cost of labor , arising from the difference of time ; and the difference in the seasonable supply of the market ; would soon enrich the one and impoverish the other . The same change which has taken place on the land from the turnpike to the rail-way , and from the slow moving stage coach to the flying rail-car must take place on the ocean from the sailing ship to the steamer . Indeed , it is far advanced already . Who thinks now of travelling , or of // sending letters , by a sailing vessel , on any route which rejoices in a line of steamers ? But the change from our commercial marine of sailing ships to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of our commerce , can not be made , even gradually , with-. out the aid of our government . The well known ingenuity and skill of our mechanics , and the sagacity and enterprise of our merchants , might , in time , compete successfully with the ingenuity , skill and longer experience in this department of labor , of English mechanics , and with the enterprise , and greatly superior capital , of English merchants . Indeed , the former decided superiority of our mercantile marine , as evinced by our packet ships , in the construction of vessels , and in the activity , intelligence and integrity of commanders and crews , assures us of this . But when the immense patronage of the English government is added to private English enterprise , the struggle of private American enterprise therewith is hopeless ; competition becomes impossible . The reasons , both as regards naval defense and commercial prosperity , for creating a steam navy which can be employed during peace in conveying mails , passengers and merchandize , have been in some degree appreciated by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or companies , has provided for the establishment of several lines of steam ships , engaged to carry the mails , consisting of seventeen large vessels , suitable for service in war , and at all times liable to be taken by the government for such service . Nine of these , according to the arrangement , are to run between New York and European ports ; five between New York and Chagres ; and three between Panama and San Francisco . rPhis arrangement has bee 11 partially carried into effect already . The line between New York and Liverpool , which commenced its trips during the last year , has been brilliantly successful ; rivalling , if not surpassing , the long established Cunard line of English steamers . The line on the Pacific from Panama to San Francisco commenced its work at a very fortunate period-soon after the discovery of gold in California . It has afforded the means of conveyance thither to a multitude of emigrants , of safe and speedy transportation of a great amount of gold to our Atlantic states , and of communicating regularly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was passing through momentons changes , of which it was very important that we should be informed . This line , and the line from New York to New Orleans which connects with it at the isthmus , are paying , as Mr. King judges , into the treasury of the government , in the form of postage , a sum quite equal to that received from the government toward their establishment and support . It was one object of // the line from New York to New Orleans to run off a British West India line of fourteen steamers ; which received from the British government twelve hundred thousand dollars a year ; and was under engagement to that government to touch at Havana , the ports of Mexico on the Gulf , New Orleans , Mobile , Savannah and Charleston ; being designed not only to carry mails , passengers and freight between those ports , but also to act in case of war upon our southern coast . This object has been accomplished . The American line , connecting with the European lines at New York , afforded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It thus has resulted in the withdrawal of the British line ; and now guards the coast which that line endangered . The wharves and coal belonging to the British coinpany in Havana have been purchased by the New York company . We think , in view of the operation of these lines thus far , that our Government may be congratulated on making a very successful beginning in the system of steam ships adapted to the purposes both of commerce and of war . It is now proposed in the Report before us to add to these small but snccessfnlbeginnings this African line . This project is commended by the general considerations which we have advanced in favor of creating by the union of public and private enterprise , a steam navy that will answer both military and mercantile purposes ; and also by reasons peculiar to itself . it is good policy for our government to follow in this respect the example of the English government , which is not deterred from establishing a line of ocean steamers by the prospect that receipts from postage into the treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line from the treasury , but makes postage quite a secondary consideration in its contracts ; aiming principally at the creation of a steam navy to be called into military service when necessary , and at affording such commercial facilities as will be profitable to the people of Great Britain . rphat such a line of steamships to Africa would greatly facilitate , develop and increase our commerce with Africa , is very apparent . On this topic we quote the language of the committee 's report . " The establishment of prosperous colonies on the western coast of Africa will , doubtless , tend greatly , in the course of time , to the augmentation of the commerce of this country . It appears that British commerce with Africa amounts to no less than five millions sterling , or about $25,000,000 per annum . The belief is now confidently entertained in Great Britain , that an immense commerce may be opened up with that continent , by putting an end to the slave trade , and stimulating the natives to the arts of peace . " The commerce of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of observation , that the proposed steamers will open entirely new sources of trade . " On this subject , the committee beg leave to submit the following particulars , from which the future resources of this vast undeveloped region may be , to some extent , anticipated . // 79 " Palm oil is produced by the nut of the Palm tree , which grows in the greatest abundance throughout Western Africa . The demand for it , both in Europe and America , is daily increasing . The average import into Liverpool of palm oil for some years past has been at least fifteen thousand tons , valued at ? 400,000 sterling . " Gold is found at various points of the coast . It is obtained by the natives by washing the sand which is brought down by the rivers from the mountains . An exploration of the mountains will probably result in the discovery of large quantities of the metal . It is calculated that England has received , altogether , $200,000.000 of gold from Africa . Liberia is adjacent to the Gold Coast . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important staple of commerce . " Coffee , of a quality superior to the best Java or Mocha , is raised in Liberia , and can be cultivated with great ease to any extent . The cofibe tree bears fruit from thirty to forty years , and yields an average of ten pounds to the shrub yearly . " Cam wood and other dye woods are found in great quantities in many parts of the country . About thirty miles east of Bassa Cove is the commencement of a region of unknown extent , where scarcely any tree is seen except the cam wood . " Gums of different kinds enter largely into commercial transactions . " Dyes of all shades and hues are abundant , and they have been proved to resist both acids and light . " Pepper , ginger , arrow root , indigo , tamarinds , oranges , lemons , limes , and many other articles which are brought from tropical countries to this , may be added to the list . Indeed , there is nothing in the fertile countries of the East or West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Africa . " The soil is amazingly fertile . Two crops of corn , sweet potatoes , and several other vegetables , can be raised in a year . It yields a larger crop than the best soil in the United States . One acre of rich land well tilled , says Governor Ashmun , will produce three hundred dollars ' worth of indigo . Half an acre may be made to grow half a ton of arrow root . " An immense market may be opened for the exchange and sale of the innumerable products of the skill and manufactures of our people . Africa is estimated to contain one hundred and sixty millions of inhabitants . Liberia enjoys a favorable geographical position . She is protected by the great Powers of Europe . The Liberians have constitutions adapted to the climate , and a similarity of color with the natives . They will penetrate the interior with safety , and prosecute their trade in the bays and rivers of the coast , without suffering from the diseases which are so fatal to the white man . Liberia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the agricultural and commercial resources of that continent , besides the means of regenerating her benighted miihions. " - pp. 18-21 . We notice that the committee say nothing of the capabilities of that country for the culture of cotton . They are , as we understand , quite promising ; and are regarded with great interest , especially in England . Perhaps the committee thought it unwise to excite against the measure the jealousy of our own cotton growers . We think that the committee have been led into an extravagant estimate of the annual amount of British commerce with Africa . According to the best information which we can obtain , that amount falls far short of $25,000,000 . The Colonization Journal for January 1851 , gives a tabular statement of the commerce // of England , and of the United States , with Africa . Duririg fifteen years ending with July 1841 , the imports of England from the western coast of Africa , according to this statement , amounted to a little less than fourteen millions and a half of dollars , or nearly one million of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British goods to the same region amounted to a little more than twenty-three millions and a half of dollars , or more than a million and a half annually . Great Britain also exported to Africa of foreign goods , chiefly of India cottons and American tobacco , during the same period , an amount of nearly half a million of dollars yearly . Since the year 1841 , the trade between England and Africa has considerably increased . We have seen a statement , in the Colonization Herald , that there are at the present time two hundred vessels trading to the coast from the ports of Great Britain . MeCullock estimates the exports to the western coast , during the period from 1839 to 1844 inclusive , at two millions three hundred thousand dollars a year ; and to the whole of Africa at seven millions of dollars a year . These statements fall far below the estimate of the committee , after making all due allowance for the increase of commerce between Great Britain and Africa . The trade of the United States with Africa is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1849 , the imports of African products into this country amounted to three millions three hundred thousand dollars , or a little more than half a million annually ; and d.uring the same time we exported to Africa yearly , a little more than six hundred and forty-three thousand dollars worth of our own products , and nearly sixty-one thousand dollars worth of foreign merchandise . The increase in African commerce thus evinced , will doubtless continue , and would be vastly accelerated , by a line of steamers ; and the nation which first establishes one will gain possession of a very large and lucrative trade . That nation should be the United States . For the principal article of export to Africa is a coarse quality of manufactured cotton , an article , whose raw material is produced here , and in whose manufacture we can compete with the world . Indeed , these coarse cotton goods can be made in the very states where the cotton is raised ; and can be carried by the New Orleans ship of the proposed line directly to Africa , and exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses the expectation , " that Africa will be the great customer , if not the main stay and support , of the infant cotton manufactures of the South ; for it is plain that a great demand can be created , through the medium of the Liberia traders , for articles which can be manufactured more advantageously in the South than in any other part of the Union . " However that may be , it is certain that through Liberia  --  the door to the mu // lions of Africa who need our products , and who will send in r&amp; turn their products , old and new and very valuables to our mark* ets-.  - -  there may be made to flow , by proper and seasonable enterprise , a commerce , if not as rich as that of the Indies , yet well worthy of the attention of enlightened statesmen and sagacious merchants . But this proposed line of steamers would benefit other depart* ments of our commerce besides that with the coast of Africa* It would give the impulse of steam communication to our trade with the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit from Marseilles to Constantinople , and Smyrna , and along the northern African coast to Gibraltar-a trade which is increasing in value every year . The American arid foreign f'reight between the Mediterranean and the United States during the year ending January 1850 , was 208,703 tons . The value of the exports from the United States to that region during the same time amounted to $6,933,601 ; and the value or the imports , as nearly as it can be ascertained , amounted to $5,077,110 . A line of American steamers would greatly stimutate and increase this trade , besides extending our national infin. ' ences in that quarter . The contemplated line would also facilitate the transmission of mails , arid of freight and passengers , between the ports at which it would touch in Spain , Portugal , France , and England , and between those ports and the United States , and also between the West India islands ( at which it has liberty to touch ) and the ports of Europe and America . It is worthy of notice , moreover , that this line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans and Europe than is likely to be afforded in any other way . The New Orleans trade alone will not warrant a private company in the expense of ocean steamers . Brit one of the steamers of the African line could run direct from London and Havre to New Orleans ; bringing the light and valuable fabrics of England and France to that city , as well as passengers for the south and for the west by way of the Mississippi river . But the great argument for the proposed line of steamers is that it will promote the removal of free colored persons from this country to the western coast of Africa , where they will be established in prosperous and Christian communities under a republican government ; and that thus it will tend powerfully , and in the only effectual way , to suppress the African slave trade . This the committee consider the great argument ; and it gives us pleasure to state rhat they have presented iL as their chief reason for recommending the proposed measure . On this point we will give their views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But it is chiefly for the great and beneficent objects of removing the free persons of color from this country to the coast of Africa , and of suppressing the slave trade , that the committee are disposed to recommend the adoption of the proposed measure . The latter of these has been the subject of treaties hy our government with other nations , with whom we have engaged to maintain a large naval force on the coast of Africa to assist in suppressing the inhuman traffic ; while the emigration of the free blacks has long been an object of great interest in all parts of the country , and especially in the slave holding states , where they are looked upon hy the whites with aversion and distrust . The policy of all or most of these states has been to discourage manumission , except on condition of the removal of the liberated slave . * * " The committee believe it is expedient to aid private enterprise in the colonization of the western coast of Africa , because it is the most effectual , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The success of this measure will doubtless render the African squadron wholly unnecessary , thus reimbursing a large portion of the expense attendin* it , and at the same time better accomplishing the object for which that squadron is maintained . It may be expedient for some one of the great naval powers to keep a small force on the coast of Africa to protect Liberia , for a limited time , against the slave traders . But the attempt to suppress this unlawful traffic by blockading the coast has so signally failed that it will probably soon be abandoned by the great European powers . While the influence of the Republic of Liberia has been shown in the complete suppression of the trade along a coast of several hundred miles in length , the combined squadrons of Europe and America have not been so successful on other portions of that unhappy shore . In 1847 no less than 84,356 slaves were exported from Africa to Cuba and Brazil . * * * " The committee beg leave here to present some interesting facts which satisfy them that the territory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States ; that the establishment of this line of steamships by the government will be a powerful stimulus to the cause of colonization , and will he the means of securing the emigration of great numbers of free blacks ; that the slave trade will be substituted by a peaceful , legitimate , and valuable commerce , opening new sources of enterprise and wealth to our people ; and that the civilization and christianization of the whole continent of Africa may be expected eventually to follow . The facts presented are collected chiefly from the publications of the Colonization Society . " That portion of the western coast of Africa , called Liberia , embraces a tract of country included between the parallels of 40 21 ' and 70 north latitude , extending about 400 miles along the coast . The first settlement was made by free negroes from the United States , under the auspices of the American Colonization Society , in the year 1820 . The objects of that Society were " 1st . To rescue the free colored people of the United States from their political and social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where they may enjoy the benefits of free government , with all the blessings which it brings in its train . " : 3d . To spread civilization , sound morals , and true religion throughout the continent of Africa . " 4th . To arrest and destroy the slave trade . " 5th . To afford slave owners , who wish , or are willing , to liberate their slaves , an asylum for their reception . ' " The funds of this Society have seldom exceeded $50,000 per year , but they have purchased territory , enabled nearly 7,000 free people of color to emigrate to Liberia , and have made provision , for such of them as required it , for six months after their arrival , in July , 1847 , an independemit government was formed , which has been recognized by France , England , and Prussia . Upwards of 80,000 of the natives have become civilized , and enrolled themselves as citizens of the Republic . The Liberians have a flourishing commerce . They have not only succeeded in suppressing the slave trade along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with several tribs , numbering over 200,000 souls , for the discontinuance of the traffic . They have purchased their territory from time to time of the natives , and are gradually extending themselves up to the British settlement of Sierra Leone and down to the Gold Coast . " The interior settlements of the purchased tracts usually extend from about ten to thirty miles from the coast , and can easily be enlarged by purchase in that direction at a moderate amount . In no instance have the natives from whom the land was purchased been required to remove their residences . The land in the immediate vicinity of the ocean in Liberia is generally low , and in some places marshy ; but there are some elevated spots . The land generally becomes more elevated towards the interior ; and in some places , within fifty miles of the coast it is quite mountainous . It is desirable for the colony to become possessed of this back country as it is much healthier than the coast , and when the emigration from the United States becomes extensive , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine , healthy , athletic race ; and even the emigrants to the lands on the coast have enjoyed better health than the emigrants to some of our western states in the first few years of settlement . " Liberia is on the grain coast , ' and is protected from the scorching winds of the north and east by ranges of mountains . The soil is fertile , and produces an abundance of Indian corn , yams , plantains , coffee , arrow-root , indigo , dyewoods , &amp;c . " Every emigrant is welcomed to the colony , and receives a grant of five acres of land , besides which he can purchase as much more as he pleases at one dollar per acre . " The climate is not suited to the whites . The President and all the officials are colored men . There are flourishing towns , churches , schools , and printing presses . According to the statement of the Rev. R. R. Gurley , who has recently visited the colony , the people are highly moral , well conducted , and prosperous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present $500,000 per annum , and is increasing at the rate of 50 per cent annually . " Not only will the slave trade be abolished by the establishment of colonies of free colored people on the coast of Africa , but , as already intimated , these colonies will be the means , at no distant period , of disseminating civilization and Christianity throughout the whole of that continent . Already , a great many of the natives have placed themselves under the protection of the Liberians , whose knowledge of agriculture and the arts inspires confidence and respect . " As a missionary enterprise , therefore , the colonization of Africa by the descendants of Africans on this continent , deserves , and no doubt will receive , the countenance and support of the whole Christian world . " Two points are now regarded , both in Europe and in this country , as settled truths , viz : 1st . That the planting and building up of Christian colonies on the coast of Africa , is the only practical remedy for the slave trade . 2d . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African coast . " That the free negroes of the United States will be induced to go in large numbers to Liberia , if a quick and pleasant passage by steam vessels be provided , and suitable preparation be made for them on their arrival , by the Colonization Society , can not admit of any doubt . " The funds of that society , augmented probably twenty fold , will then be available , almost exclusively , for the comfortable establishment of the emigrants in their new homes  --  the expense of transportation chargeable to the society being merely nominal . " It is estimated that there are no less than five hundred thousand free colored people in the several states , and that the annual increase therein of the black race is seventy thousand per annum . With respect to slaves , who may hereafter be manumitted , no doubt such manumission will , almost in every instance , be upon the condition that the parties shall avail themselves of the opportunity of emigrating to Liberia . // " The committee do not propose that the emigrants should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Liberia is at present incapable of receiving and providing shelter , subsistence , and emyloyment for any great number of emigrants who may land there in a state of destitution . It has been the practice , heretofore , for the Colonization Society to provide for the colonists , whom they have sent out , for six months after their arrival , and the cost of such provision has averaged $30 per head , in addition to the cost of transportation . " A large amount of money will be required to settle the colonists in the first instance comfortably in their new homes . But there is no doubt , that if the government establish the proposed line of steamships , the people of the different states , and the state legislatures , will at once turn their attention to the subject of colonization , and that large appropriations will be voted , and liberal collections made , in aid of that object . The State of Maryland has already appropriated and laid out $200,000 in this work , and the Legislature of Virginia has lately appropriated $40,000 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant in comparison to what may be expected , if the government shall give its high sanction to the colonization of Africa , and provide the means df transportation by a line of steamships . In that event , the whole mass of the people , north and south , who for the most part do not appreciate the rapid progress , and the high capabilities of Liberia , will quickly discover the vast importance of colonization , and will urge their representatives to adopt measures adequate to the exigency of the case and the magnitude of the enterprise . " There is good reason to anticipate , that important assistance will be rendered to the emigrants , not only by the missionary societies of Europe , but also by those governments which hay taken an interest in the suppression of the slave trade , and which are desirous of opening channels for their commerce , and marts for their manufactures , on the western coast of Africa . " - pp. 9-17 . These statements we believe to be in the main correct . We would add many other facts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by statements with which many of them are familiar . We will confine ourselves within narrow limits . The emigrant population of Liberia , and of the Maryland colony , according to the recent report of Mr. Gurley , is estimated at 6,900 , and the native population at 240,000 . During the past year , the government of the Republic has purchased many miles of additional coast , embracing the Gallinas-one of the most active and extensive slave marts on the whole Africar* shore-for the express purpose of suppressing the slave trade . This purchase makes the colonized coast seven hundred miles in length , along the whole of which the slave trade was formerly carried on with great activity. * Louisiana is about to found a colony of her own in the * We suhijoin the letter of President Roberts giving an account of this purchase .

Kentucky has made a purchase of forty miles square on the St. Paul 's river , with a sea-coast of forty miles ; whither an expedition xviii sail in a few weeks . During the last year , New Jersey has moved with great energy in the founding of a settlement , to hear the name of that state . CornmlssioneFs have been sent out to select a location , who xviii explore the interior ; expecting that it will offer much better advantages than the coast as to health , soil , comfort , and trade .

The legislatures of many states are taking favorable action on the subject ; and some of them have instructed their senators , and requested their representatives , to use their influence to induce the national government to acknowledge the independence of Liberia , and to engage in the enterprise of colonization . During the last year , moreover , private benevolence in support of this enterprise has greatly exceeded that of any previous year . One man , McDouogh , has given by will $25,000 a year . for forty years-an amount of $1,000,009 . The statement of the committee that Virginia has appropriated $40,000 a year for colonization is not quite accurate . The legislature of that state appropriated for this purpose from its treasury $30,000 a year , for a period of five years ; and in addition to this laid a special tax for this purpose of one dollar a year on every free colored man in the state , between the ages of txventy-one and fifty-five ; which , it is thought , will amount to $10,000 annually .

For these tracts we have incurred a large debt , and we confidently look to you to aid us in meeting these liabilities at maturity . had I not deemed it absolutely important to secure the Gallinas , to prevent the revival of the slave trade there , I would not have paid the price demanded . The purchase of Gallinas and the neighboring tracts will cost us about $9,500 . The chiefs were aware of the object of the purchase , and urged strenuously the sacrifice , as they consider it , they must make in abandoning forever the slave trade , and demanded a large sum as an equivalent . In addition to the amount stated above , we have obligated ourselves to appoint commissioners immediately to settle the wars in the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil with the interior tribes ; and also settle among them , as soon as convenient , persons capable of instructing them in the arts of husbandry . This will also cost us a considerable sum , which will no doubt be returned in the end by the advantages the trade will give . Still the present outlay will be , I fear , more than equal to our ability . // The argument in favor of the proposed line of steamers to Africa , evnbodied in this extract from the committee 's report , and in the facts which we have stated , must , we think , be ConVilICing and moviii* to all XThosC minds are not preoccupied with opinions , judgments , or feelings , adverse to African colonization . We are aware that many excellent men have been , and are , strongly opposed to the enterprise of colonization . there has been a long and bitter conflict between those who advocate the colonization of free people of color , and those who advocate the abolition of slavery ; or more ace urately , between portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ists have been charged with being moved in their enterprise by hatred to the negroes , when the great body of them have been moved by true benevolence ; and a society , which originated in the pure and heroic goodness of Samuel J. Mills , and was long warmly supported by the anti-slavery philanthropy of the country , and especially of New England , has been visited with reproach and opposition , on account of the manifold indiscretions and nuphilanthropic heresies of some of its advocates , for whom it was in no wise responsible . And , on the other hand , it has been thought good support of the colonization society to pour contempt upon Anti-Slavery societies ; and to heap abuse on those who imitate their divine Lord and exemplar , in preaching deliverance to the captives and the opening of the * doors to them that are botind . This conflict1 in our judgment , is wholly unnecessary , unwise and nunatural. rilliere is no reason why the friends of the abolition of slavery , and the friends of the colonization of free colored people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are harmonious . Both may be aided by the friends of the African race , with entire consistency ; and we may add that duty binds them to aid both . this conflict we regai 'd as one of the most deplorable instances of that waste of strength and feeling , by reformers avid philanthropists , in needless contention with one another , of which we spoke in our last number . We are heartily in favor of the abolition of slavery . And we are as heartily in favor of African colonization-of course with the full and unforced consent of those who are colonized . We believe that it will give a demonstration of the true and equal manhood of our colored brethren-of their capabilities of intelligence , enterprise , self-government , and social and religious prosperity . We believe it offers the host means of carrying civilization and Christianity through the darkest continent of the globe . We believe that it affords the best asylum for our colored brethren from those inferiorilies in privilege , those prejudices and antipathies against them , which , however unjust and inhuman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of philanthropy and Christianity , do now widely exist , and will exist , we // fear , for a long time yet to come . We believe that it offers a sure , and , so far as we can flOW see , the only sure , or even promising , method of suppressing , and forever ending the inhuman slave trade . The history of Liberia has proved this fully ; so that they who have hitherto doubted and even denied , must now admit it . the half a million which our government now expends annually in sustaining her African squadron for the prevention of the slave trade ; and the great sums which the British government expends for the same purpose ; would do vastly more for the accomplishment of the object , if they were expended in building up on all the slave coast , civilized , enterprising and Christian communities , endowed with all needful institutions of education and religion . Such communities , established on all the slave coast ( as they may he ) must annihilate that accursed traffic in Africa ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which vaunts the inalienable right of all men to he free , alone in their infamy . Indeed , we think that it will do much toward the removal of slavery itself-more than we have been accustomed to believe or hope . The events of the few past years , and those which promise to he in a few years to come , give us courage . We would not call it the only remedy for slavery . We would not discourage , we would encourage , all righteous and wise measures and movements for the abolition of that wicked and inhuman institution . But we do feel authorized to hold up African colonization , as at least a partial remedy for slavery-an auxiliary in the good work of its removal . If a demonstration is made in Liberia , in free , enlightened and Christian communities there , which will convince colored men that the native home of their race is the place for their happiness and honor ; if the government of the United States , the governments of the several states , and the governments of other Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treasures of individual philanthropists and Christians , and will use , and multiply that they may use , for this purpose , the channels arid vehicles of a mighty commerce between the two continentswho can say that the result will not be the entire removal of slavery , sooner , not than it might otherwise be if men were what they should be , but sooner than it ever will otherwise be , men being what they are ? Such being our view of the beneficent tendency of colonization itself , we would not reject pecuniary aid given to it from whatever quarter , from advocates however unwise , or even from unjust and even inhuman motives-provided we do nothing to invite or encourage such evil motives , or the folly of such aclvocates . If men accompany their pecuniary aid with such remarks , as the Hon. R. J. Walker , of Mississippi , makes in a letter published ( not wisely ) by the Colonization Society , in the Ap // pendix to this report , " I have ever regarded colonization and abolition as antagonistic measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter ; " while xve should regret the remark , as evil itself and fitted to do evil to the cause , we would take his money , and with it send men to Africa . If individuals or legislatures emancipate slaves , on the condition that they shall go to the African colonies ; while we should regret the unjust condition , the unrighteous limitation on their free choice , we would prefer such an emancipation to their continuance in slavery . Though we should think it impolitic , as well as unjust , for southern legislatures to insist that slaves shall be colonized , if they are emancipated ; deeming it more wise to employ them as free laborers , in a climate where white men can not safely work , and that it is an impoverishing process to send so much labor out of the country ; we should yet rejoice in their emancipation , preferring it , with that impolitic condition annexed , to unrighteous bondage . And even if men should aid colonization from a desire to perpetuate slavery , or from hatred to negroes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that desire , or to attain the ends of that hatred , we would accept the aid ; believing that it would help a good object , and that it is better to have a good act with an evil motive , than to have both the motive and the act evil . Meanwhile , we ought to insist , and call on others to insist also , that colored men have a right - as good a right as any men  --  to stay in this land of their birth , if they choose ; and that all men are bound to treat them , while here , or if they choose to remain here , as men and brethren , even to the full meaning of our language in the Declaration of Independence , and to the full meaning of the law of humanity and of Christ .
