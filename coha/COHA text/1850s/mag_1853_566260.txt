txt ART . VIIL-LIFE AND WORKS OF JOHN ROBINSON . The Works of JOHN ROBINSON , Pastor of the Pilgrim Fathers . With a Memoir and Annotations . By ROBERT ASHTON , Secretary of the Congregational Board , London . ( Three volumes . ) Boston : Doctrinal Tract and Book Society . Tnis edition of the collected works of " that famous and worthy man , Mr. John Robinson , " the restorer of the primitive church-government , was prepared and published in England under the patronage of the Congregational Union of England and Wales , the Rev. Dr. Campbell of Whitefield 's Tabernacle , London , having generously and courageously assumed the pecuniary responsibility . We , on this side of the Atlantic , are indebted to the Doctrinal Tract and Book Society for its appearance here . The Society very properly aided in the undertaking ; andjiccordingly a portion of the edition bears upon the title-page the name of the Society as publisher . We can not but express our regret that , as yet , the Society 's arrangements for the sale of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it has undertaken . Such books as these three volumes and the volumes which contain the collected works of Bellamy , I-Iopkins , and the younger Edwards , are of course not designed , like the devotional and practical volumes published by the American Tract Society , for general circulation* by the agency of colporters and auxiliary societies . And yet some arrangement is surely practicable by which these books , of so much intrinsic value , and yet so little likely to be sought for by the booksellers , or to circulate in the ordinary channels of trade , may be brought more generally within the reach and under the notice of the public . Considering the character of the man , his place and relations in church history , and the multitude of churches in two hemispheres that trace their ecclesiastical descent from him , it is somewhat remarkable that the works of Robinson have never before been published in a collected edition ; and considering bow he lived and died , in exile , poverty and deep affliction , and how his works were originally published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , and chiefly for a few readers persecuted and impoverished like himself , it is no less remarkable that , at the end of two centuries and a quarter after his death , all his works , with the exception of one unim // 137 Life and Works of John Robinson . portant tract , are still extant and appear unmutilated in the present collection . The traces of his personal history have been investigated , with great carefulness , by reverent and loving inquirers on both sides of the Allan tic ; and all that is known concerning him , or is likely ever to be known in this world , is well summed up by Mr. Ashton in the introductory Memoir . It is a touching story ; and familiar as it is in the outline to all our readers , we are sure that they will thank us for laying before them in a connected form the scanty results of the latest and most exact investigations . In so doing we shall follow in part , but not exclusively , the guidance of Mr. Ashton . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of fifty years . This gives us 1575 as the year of his birth . His parentage , the events and circumstances of his childhood , and even the place of his nativity , are wholly unknown . The first that we know of him is his appearance at Cambridge , in his eighteenth year , a candidate for matriculation in the University . Two of the same name were matriculated that year , ( 1592 , ) one of Immanuel College , the other of Corpus Christi . Of these the latter was probably the Robinson of Congregationalism . If so , Lincolnshire was the county from which he came . In 1598 , he became a Fellow of his college , a distinction which testifies sufficiently to his place among his compeers and his proficiency in the scholastic learning of the day . Corpus Christi was the college in which William Perkins , the great Puritan preacher and teacher of that age , was public catechist and lecturer on Divinity . The mind of Robinson it may be presumed was aided and guided in its progress by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tru* . Joseph Hall , afterwards Bishop of Norwich , one of the most eminent prelates in the history of the church of England , was contemporary with him at the University , and appears to have had some acquaintance with him . At what time Robinson left the University , and where or in what capacity or relation he began his work as a minister of the Gospel , are questions on which we have no definite information . He resigned his fellowship in Corpus Christi College in 1604 . The fellows of that college are required , by the statutes , to " take orders " within three years after their election . Had he never been ordained , at least to the deaconship , in the church of England , he must have vacated his fellowship in 1601 . He seems to have had some benefice sear Yarmouth , in Norfolk . From the first , so far as any indications of his course can be found , he was a Puritan . More explicitly , he was of the reforming party in the national church of EngIand-. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinsan. which included among its adherents a great variety of opinions as to the extent to which existing regulations , superstitious or frivolous , might be observed with a good conscience . All Puritans , who had not advanced beyond mere Puritanism , believed in a national church , and hoped that the same power of Queen and Parliament , which had already reformed the church in part , would ultimately resume and complete the unfinished work of reformation . Meanwhile , their lot being cast in England , by the providence of God , they were members of the church of England , and were to obey the constituted authorities and the existing laws , as far as was consistent with their allegiance to the higher law of God . Robinson , belonging to this party , and being probably from the first , one of the most scrupulous class , 500fl came into collision with the ecclesiastical authorities . We afterwards find him at Norwich , where he seems to have held some unauthorized meeting or conventicle for prayer and religious conference . Henry Ainsworth , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says to a clergyman of the church of England , " If any among you , not meddling with the public estate of your church , but feeling or fearing his own particular soul-sickness , do resort to a physician whose receipts are not after the common sort , for advice about his health , or of friendship or acquaintance to see him , he is subject to the censure and thunder-bolt of your church . " To understand what follows , it should be remembered that " censures , " in the church of England , are accompanied with civil " thunder-bolts , " such as fines and imprisonments ; " excommunication " carrying with it not merely exclusion for church ordinances , but the loss of civil rights " Witness , " says Ainsworth , in illustration of his general statement , " the late practice in Norwich , where certain citizens were excommunicated for resorting unto and praying with Mr. Robinson , a man worthily reverenced of all the city for the grace of God in him , as yourself also , I suppose , will acknowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ere while committed . " There was already , in secret places and in exile , a separation from the established church of England . Those whose zeal for reformation was most earnest and ardent , had begun to protest that the ecclesiastical system by law established , was altogether contrary to the arrangements instituted by Christ for the perfecting of his saints and the edifying of his body ; and accordingly they had begun to set up their own worship , independent of the state , conforming to the rules and examples which they found in the Scriptures . A little church of separatists in London , patticularly , had learned by a terrible experience , that though the // conscientious neglect of ceremonies was more offensive to the rulers of the establishment than profaneness or lewdness , any measure of non-conformity within the Church was punished with less severity than the attempt to separate from the Church . Separation from the Church , and the setting up of a worship not authorized by law , was sedition . Words uttered and printed in argument against the Church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seditious words " against the Queen its bead . Under such changes , Barrow and Greenwood , and Penry , had been put to death , the martyrs of separation . In 1593 , an act was framed by which separatists were banished from the realm . Sometimes as voluntary fugitives , sometimes judicially banished , the separatists found refuge in the Netherlands , where all forms of religion were tolerated . Thus a little congregation of English exiles was gathered at Amsterdam , with Francis Johnson for its Pastor , and the learned Henry Ainsworth for its teacher . At the same time , the number of separatists in England was kept up , and was increased from year to year , as the increasing rigor with which strict conformity was urged in the national church , not only made it more and more difficult for scrupulous men to remain in that connection , but also extinguished more and more the hope of a farther reformation by public authority . Meanwhile a painful and exasperated feeling had arisen between the Separatists and the Puritans or " Reformists " - as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were commonly denominated . The two parties , notwithstanding their many points of agreement , were acting on opposite principles in regard to the great question of the day . Each weakened the hands of the other . The position of each was a. protest against the other . The controversy between these two parties became embittered by their mutual upbraiding . The Reformist could not endure what would now be called the " ultraism " and " come-outerism " of the Separatist . And on the other hand , the zeal of the Separatist for the pure ordinances of Christ burned like fire against what seemed to him the inconsistency , the half.heartedness , and the time-serving and cowardly compliances of the Reformist . While Robinson was at Norwich , he was as yet only a Puritan . Many of the Puritan clergy were enabled to exercise their ministry without violence to their scruples , by obtaining some employment in which they could preach without being com* pelled to a strict and entire conformity . A lectureship in * church , without the " cure of souls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a chaplainship in the house of some nobleman or gentleman , was often sought for by clergymen // whose scruples about the want of discipline and the ceremonies , or about the unscriptural constitution of the hierarchy , would hinder them from accepting a rectory or a vicarage . Some such employment , Robinson might have gladly accepted at that period . Some such employment , occupying his powers and cheering him with the prospect of usefulness , might have hindered his mind from arriving at that position in which he saw and felt the duty of separating from the corrupt and secular establishment which sacrilegiously called itself the church of Christ . Long afterwards , his university acquaintance . Hall , bishop of Norwich , writing against him , was so ungenerous as to insinuate that mercenary considerations might have been potent enough to retain him in the ministry of the establishment . " The mastership of the hospital at Norwich , " says Hall , " might have procured that this separation from the cornmunion , government and worship of the church of England should not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord of Norwich ! But why was it that John Robinson desired the mastership of that hospital ? Why was it that he could not get it ? If mercenary considerations could have prevailed with John Robinson against his convictions , what hindered him from retaii*ing his original preferment ? If mercenary considerations were what governed the man , what hindered him from taking the side which had mercenary considerations in its favor ? By taking that side you became a bishop and a peer of the realm , while he , by taking the other side , suffered the loss of all things and became an outlaw and an exile . Robinson himself thus describes in part the inward conflict through which he passed before he arrived at the conclusion which separated him from the church of England : " I do indeed confess , to the glory of God and my own shame , that a long time before I entered this way , separation , I took some taste of the truth in it by some treatises published in justification of it , which , the Lord knoweth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very principal thing which , for the time , quenched all further appetite in me , was the over-valuation which I made of the learning and holiness of these and the like persons the Evangelical Puritans , blushing in myself , to have a thought of pressing one hair-breadth before them in this thing , behind whom I knew myself to come so many miles in all other things . Yea , and even of late times , when I had entered into a more serious consideration of these things , and , according to the measure of the grace received , searched the Scriptures whether they were so or not , and by searching found much light of truth , yet was the same so dimmed and overclouded with the contradictions of these men and others of the like note , that , had not the truth been in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my hones , I had never broken those bonds of flesh and blood wherein I was so strictly tied , but had suffered the light of God to have been put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . " ( Vol . I , p. xviii . ) We have already stated that his resignation of his fellowship was in the year 1604 . This may be assumed as the date of his // separation from the church of England . About two years before this date , a handful of enlightened and devoted men , whose homes were near the borders of the three counties of Lincolnshire , Nothinghamshire and Yorkshire , " shook off the yoke of anti-Christian bondage , and AS THE LORD 'S FREE PEOPLE , joined themselves by a covenant of the Lord , into a church estate , in the fellowship of the Gospel , to walk in all his ways , made known or to be made known to them , according to their best endeavors , WHATEVER IT MIGHT COST THEM . " With this little company Robinson may have had some connection by previous acquaintance , for Lincolnshire was his county . Certainly he was one of them at a very early period in their history . After a while , probably in 1606 , it became convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to worship in two localities . One of those churches , after maintaining its existence for a few years , appears to have been gradually broken up , and makes no figure in history . The other , at the first , was under the guidance of Richard Clifton , " a grave and reverend preacher , " and John Robinson . At the same time William Brewster , a layman who had been in various employments , and , who had probably more of this world 's goods , and more of that kind of knowledge and influence which was necessary for their safety than any other among them , was " a special stay and help to them . " Their ordinary place of meeting on the Lord 's day was at his house , " which was a manor of the bishop 's , and with great love he entertained them when they came , making provision for them to his great charge " Recent investigations by Joseph Hunter , ESq. , in England , have identified the village of Scrooby , in Nottinghamshire , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkshire , and not far from the borders of Lincolushire , as the ordinary place of meeting for those worshipers . At Scrooby was an old manor-house belonging to the archbishops of York , and in former ages frequently their temporary residence . There , in particular , Wolsey , the proud cardinal , had rested when he had been disgraced at court and sent to his own diocese . In that same mansion , bluff King Harry himself had passed a night in some northern progress . Of that old manor-house William Brewster was then the tenant under the Sandys family , to whom it had been , in effect , alienated by the archbishop.of that name some twenty years before . But these men who held *their Lord 's day meetings at Scrooby were violating the law of the land , and what was more , they were setting at nought that great political compromise of the age , the Church of England , as constituted and established by *tct of Parliament ; and consequently they suffered such things as // native Protestants now suffer in Florence-such things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suffer , if , in obedience to their religious convictions , they give the protec. tion and hospitality of their homes to fugitives from the slavetrade . In the words of Governor Bradford , " Some were taken and clapped up in prisons , others had their houses beset and watched night and day , and hardly escaped ; and the most were fain to fly and leave their houses and habitations and the means of their livelihood . " Their only hope , under God , was in a migration to some shore beyond the reach of their oppressors . Only a few leagues distant from the eastern coast of England , just opposite to the low and fenny lands of Lincolnshire , there was a country where , if they were willing to lose all things else , they might enjoy their religious convictions . In " the United States of the Netherlands , " as well as in the city of Geneva , there was " a church without a bishop and a state without a king ; " and there they might find " freedom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued together about a year , and kept their meeting every sabbath in one place or another , exercising the worship of God among themselves , notwithstanding all the diligence and malice of their adversaries , seeing they could no longer continue in that condition , they resolved to get over into Holland as they could . " We need not repeat the story of the sacrifices , the perils , the opposition from their enemies , the persecutions from the minions of power unwilling to permit their escape at so easy a rate as banishment , through which , in the years 1607 and 1608 , they succeeded in executing their purpose of emigration . Amsterdam was their place of rendezvous . Robinson and Brewster , as became their rank in the community , were among the last to make their escape ; for they " stayed to help the weakest over before them . " At Amsterdam the " ancient church " of English Separatists , under Johnson and Ainsworth , was still in existence . The new comers exhibited their prudence , their gentleness , and their simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with brethren whose spirit , and whose principles , were not in all respects exactly like theirs . Smith , who had been their pastor at first , before their division into two churches , and who , with a portion of his company , had escaped into that exile before them , had already fallen into some contention with " the ancient church ; " but Robinson and Brewster were wiser , if not more peaceably disposed . At a great sacrifice in respect to their opportunities of earning a subsistence , they and their company removed to Leyden , " a fair and beautiftil city , and of a sweet situation , but made more famous by the university wherewith // it is adorned . " There , as Bradford reports of them , " they fell to such trades and employments as they best could , valuing peace and their spiritual comfort above any other riches whatsoever ; and at length they came to raise a competent and comfortable living with hard and continual labor . " Brewster became a printer . Bradford learned the art of dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they bad generally known only " the innocent trade of husbandry . " But in that land of their exile , the occupations by which they had subsisted at home were for the most part no longer availahle . It is most probable that Robinson , like the rest , was under the necessity of resorting to some sort of manual labor for the support of his family . It has formerly been believed that the Pilgrims , while they resided at Leyden , were provided with a place of worship by the authorities of the city . As long ago as 1714 , when Thomas Prince , whose contributions to our early history are so important , visited Leyden , one of the churches there was pointed out to him as that in which the English exiles had formerly worshiped . But recently the researches of Mr. George Sumner have shown that whatever kindness the Pilgrims received from the citizens of Leyden , there was no such hospitality shown to them by the public authorities . The Scotch merchants and residents at Leyden enjoyed at that time the privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the churches belonging to the city ; and that was the church which old citizens , less than a century afterwards , pointed out to Prince as having been occupied by the English Separatists . Robinson is described , in the record of his death , as having lived " by the Clock-house . " There is no more probable conjecture than that Robinson 's " hired house , " by the Clock-house , was to the P11-grims what Brewster 's house had been at Scrooby . In some private apartments , and not in any building publicly devoted to religious uses , that little congregation enjoyed those forms of worship and of religious organization , for the sake of which they had sacrificed so much . One of their ministers , Clifton , " a grave and fatherly old man , having a great white beard , " had accompanied them in their exile ; but having found a home and some method of subsistence at Amsterdam , he had remained there , and had been dismissed to the church in that city . Accordingly on their removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordination of the church , their pastor . " Being thus settled , after many difficulties , they continued many years in a comfortable condition , enjoying much sweet and delightful society and spiritual comfort together in the ways of God , under // the able ministry and prudent government of Mr. John Robinson and Mr. William Brewster , who was an assistant unto him in the place of an elder , unto which he was now called and chosen by the church . " A passage in Governor Bradford 's Dialogue , gives a picturesque description of " those two churches that were so long in exile . " " Truly there were in them many worthy men ; and if you had seen them in their beauty and order , as we have done , you would have been much affected therewith , we dare say . At Amsterdam , before their division and breach , there were about three hundred communicants ; and they had for their pastor and teacher those two eminent men before named , Johnson and Ainsworth , and in our time four grave men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for deacons , one ancient widow for a deaconess , who did them service many years , though she was sixty years of age when she was chosen . She honored her place and was an ornament to the congregation . She usually sat in a convenient place in the congregation , with a little birchen rod in her hand , and kept little children in great awe from disturbing the congregation . She did frequently visit the sick and weak , especially women , and , as there was need , called out maids and young won*en to watch and do them other helps as their necessity did require ; and if they were poor , she would gather relief for them of those that were able , or acquaint the deacons ; and she was obeyed as a mother in Israel and an officer of Christ . " And for the church of Leyden , they were sometimes not much fewer in number , nor at all inferior in able men , though they had not so many officers as the other ; for they had but one ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great integrity ; also they had three able men for deacons . And that which was a crown unto them , they lived together in love and peace all their days , without any considerable difference or any disturbance that grew thereby , but such as was easily healed in love ; and so they continued , until with mutual consent they removed into New England . " ( Young 's Chron. of the Pilgrims , pp. 455 , 456 . ) The pastor of the Pilgrims , with his scholastic tastes and attainments , could not but appreciate the privilege of a residence at the seat of a university so eminent in the Protestant world as that of Leyden . Mr. Sumner has ascertained that on the 5th of September , 1605 , " Joannes l*obintsonus , Anglus , " thirty-nine years of age , was registered by permission of the magistrates as a member of the academic body . Just then the Arminian controversy was at its height , particularly in that city , where the two professors of theology , Episcopius , the immediate successor of Arminius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of the Arrninian scheme , ) and Polyander , the champion of Calvinism , were every day discussing in their lectures the points of that great dispute . Robinson , notwithstanding his three sermons every week , and the other labors of his pastoral care , was a constant attendant on the lectures of both champions . He seems to have thoroughly studied the controversy , and to have entered with his calm , earnest , English mind , into the debates which were agitating not only the university , but the city and the nation . Bradford and Winslow both // 145 report , with affectionate pride , the story of his disputing with Episcopius publicly , ( more academico , ) at the request of Polyander and " the chief preachers of the city , " and of his victory and the honor and respect which it won for him . Nor was his controversial skill a matter of university reputation merely . His published works in English and in Latin , were giving him an honorable name both in his native country and among the learned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some ten years passed over him in his exile . Yet , doubtless , he felt , habitually , in common with his flock , something of that heart-sickness which the exile always feels ; when with a foreign language in his ears , and surrounded with the forms and symbols of a government to which he has not transferred his allegiance , he remembers that native land which he may never more behold . " Truly if they had been mindful of that country whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to return . " It was only necessary for them to deny their religious convictions . It was only necessary for them to become Episcopalians . They need only profess a willing conformity to the ecclesiastical regulations of the realm of England ; and thenceforth they need be exiles no more . Be it that they were in an error . Be it that Episcopalianism and statechurchism are the truth ; and that their scheme of independent Congregationalism was a figment of their enthusiasm . They believed , and therefore they spake and acted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they thought they found their Congregational order . Who will not honor them that when their choice lay only between " the renegade 's curse " and " the exile 's despair , " they bravely chose the latter ? Of such men it may be safely said , " they desire a better country , that is an heavenly . " " Having seen the promises afar off , they were persuaded of them and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and PILGRIMS on the earth . " " Wherefore God is not ash amed to be called their God ; for he hath prepared for them a city . " It was not their only trouble that they were exiles . They had learned , indeed , to bear their burthen ; they had learned to win by toilsome industry a scanty subsistence . Yet such was " the hardness of the place and country " to them , that " few in comparison would come to them , and fewer would bide it out and continue with them . " " Old age , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and their great and continual labors , with other crosses and sorrows , hastened it before the time . " It was a hard lot for their children also ,  --  that constant battle with poverty in a crowded country . " Many a loving father and mother " saw their children , even those " that were of the best disposi // tiohs and gracious inclinations , " bowing under the oppression of labor , and growing " decrepit in their early youth ,  --  the vigor of nature being consumed in the very bud as it were . " And what was " of all sorrows most heavy to be borne , " others of their children " were drawn away by evil examples unto extravagant and dangerous courses . " Should they continue where they were , they would cease to be English ; their little community would be gradually disintegrated and lost ; and " their  |p05-terity  would be in danger to degenerate and be corrupted . " Such were some of the motives urging them to attempt another removal . But there was another motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and more martyrlike character to their inquiries , and at last to their undertaking ; and that was , " a great hope and inward zeal which they had of laying some good foundation , ( or at least to make some way thereunto , ) for the propagating and advancing the Gospel of the kingdom of Christ . " After long inquiry and discussion , accompanied with many prayers , they determined on a removal beyond the Atlantic , if there they might be allowed to constitute an English colony by themselves , and to enjoy their own church-order unmolested . The utmost they could gain from the English government , on the essential point of their religious liberty , was an indefinite promise not of protection or toleration , but only of connivancea promise in which they trusted less than in the providence of God . But how should those few impoverished and friendless men , obtain the means of transporting themselves and their families three thousand miles ? How should they meet the great expenses incident to the enterprise of founding a colony upon a savage coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been engaged , though with ample resources , had been wholly disastrous ? After long negotiation , they succeeded in forming a partnership or joint-stock company with a few merchants in London , on terms which they could not have accepted but in the spirit of martyrdom . The Londoners contributed capital in shares of ten pounds . The Pilgrims contributed themselves ; and each colonist , sixteen years old or upwards , was to be reckoned as one share . All the property employed in the undertaking was to be thrown into a common stock , from which the colonists were to be fed and clothed , and other necessary expenses paid . This partnership was to continue seven years ; and at the end of that period the capital and the profits were to be all divided among the shareholders . In a word , the Pilgrims , in order to purchase the opportunity of exposing themselves to the perils and horrors of the wilderness , were compelled to sell themselves // as slaves for the term of seven years , at the rate of about fifty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bargain which capital was making with labor ; they attempted in vain to stipulate for what is conceded to a Spanish slave , the privilege of a day or two each week in which to labor for themselves ; but when that was denied , they consented to all the hardness of the bargain , rather than to miss their end . Because they were compelled to yield to these hard terms , careless historians , such as Robertson and those who have taken his statements as authority , have charged them with being fanatical Socialists . And on the other hand , because they did not come without capital , and did not attempt to live without labor , some modern Episcopalians have affected to believe that the migration of the Pilgrim Fathers was a merely secular enterprise , which received no dignity from their heroism , and which their martyr-spirit gave no sanctity . In all the discussions and negotiations which preceded the migration , Robinson , of course , had a leading part . Nothing appears to have been done without his approval-almost nothing without some personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan was , partly at least , his own , the " private thought , " of the reverend pastor and the grave elder , and by them , " upon mature deliberation , " imparted to the brethren . ( Young 's Chron. , p. 381 . ) The voyage of the May Flower in 1620 , that great event , from which so much of the world 's subsequent history proceeds , was in a most important sense the work of Robinson , whom New England therefore , and all the states that have sprung from New England , have a right to honor as their first founder . When their removal had at last become possible , under the hard conditions above mentioned , it was concluded , after a day of prayer , that it was best for one part of the church , the youngest and strongest , to go at first , and the other to stay ; ' that they who went should freely offer themselves ; ' that if the majority went at first , the pastor should go with them , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As only a minority of the church could go at the first voyage , Robinson was required to remain at Leyden . Yet how entirely his heart was in the heroic enterprise-how reluctantly he remained on the quay at Delft-Haven , when the sails of the treacherous Speedwell were hoisted to the breezeappears in the letters which he addressed to the emigrants after their departure . " Constrained for a while to be bodily absent " from them , he calls God to witness " how willingly , and much rather than otherwise " he would have borne his part with them in the " first brunt " of the great enterprise . " My heart is // with you , " he said , " and I will not foreslow my bodily coming at the first opportunity . " That opportunity never came . The pastor 's post , especially after Brewster had gone , was with the remnant at Leyden . And two years afterwards , when he would have come to his friends this side of the ocean , there was another hindrance . The impoverishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had proceeded to that extremity that they could not command the means of paying for his passage , especially as a dominant party among the capitalists in London , with whom they were associated , were determined to prevent his removal . While he was thus waiting , in want , and in weariness and sickness of heart , there came another summons than that for which he had prayed and waited ; and on the first of March , 1625 , the exile went to a better country , where the wicked cease from troubling , and the weary are at rest . He was honored in his death , not only by the grief of the failing remnant of his flock ; but members of the University , and pastors of the city churches , accompanied him to his grave with customary funeral honors . That grave-where is it ' ? Mr. Sumner 's researches have ascertained , that on the fourth of March , he was buried at the church of St. Peter , in a grave hired for " nine forms . " The poverty of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him the fee-simple of a grave . Such was the interment of the humblest class in Leyden at that day ; and the lease of a grave at that price expired in seven years , after which period the mouldering remains were carried away Under that old cathedral , he found a temporary resting place ; and then " his ashes flew ; no marble tells us whither . " We have left ourselves no room to speak distinctly of Robinson as an author . These volumes will make him better known in that respect , than he has been for the last two centuries . As we examine them , we cease to marvel at the homage which they extorted from Baillie . That acrimonious Scotchman , and bitter Presbyterian , writing against the New England churches , was compelled to testify of Robinson , that he was " a man of excellent parts , and the most learned , polished , and modest spirit that ever separated from the church of England . " The Just and Necessary Apology , is perhaps to this day the best defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usages " which are so prone to turn aside towards Presbyterianism , and other forms of Hierarchy . The New Essays , or Observations , Divine and Moral , for their shrewdness in the analysis of human nature , for their depth and riches of thought , and for their antique beauty and force of expression , deserve a place among the classics of our language .
