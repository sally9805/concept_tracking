Part I. 34th Congress , 1st Session , Executive Document No. 1 . THE questions relating to the Danish Sound Dues , overshadowed as they have been by other matters of more critical importance , both in our foreign and oar domestic affairs , still present many interesting features , and involve considerations // at once delicate and perplexing . The dispute is a curious instance of conflicting rights , where claims , founded upon centuries of prescription and acquiescence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid equity of a commercial age , on the other . For as many as six hundred years the right to collect tolls from all vessels passing through the Sound or the Belts has been deemed one of the highest , and has been one of the most valuable , prerogatives of the Danish crown . For a considerable part of this time the sovereignty thus exercised over these straits has been used beneficially for the security of commerce , by the maintenance of lights , the removal of obstacles to navigation , and the suppression of piracy ; and although the Danish jurists do not found the claim to tolls upon these services , but , as we have intimated , upon immemorial prescription , it may still be regarded as an open question , whether the tolls were originally paid in acknowledgment of benefits conferred upon commerce , or were collected , as many other taxes - were collected in the feudal age , by the right of the strongest . As early as 1202 Waldemar the Victorious erected a light-house at the extremity of the Sound ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ascertained , although a charter is still extant regulating the duties paid by the Dutch , dated A. D. 1319 , at which time the claim seems to have been converted into a fixed toll . But the demand did not pass altogether unquestioned . The ilanseatic League , upon whose commerce the tolls were a severe burden , fre* quently contested the right of Denmark to make this exaction , secured for themselves considerable immunities , and indeed , in the middle of the sixteenth century , seem to have been entirely exempt from all payments at the Sound . When Charles V. , acting in concert with Henry VIII . of England , formed his great combination against France , a combination so complete that Mahometan Turkey was the only ally that did not desert the French king , the emperor secured the good offices of Denmark by a treaty , concluded at Spires in 1544 , in which the continued payment of the Sound Dues by the merchants of the Low Countries was solemnly stipulated . But as the Danish government some years later proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own // necessities rather than to those of commerce , the Dutch foi med defensive alliances with several of the nations int*rested in the navigation of the Sound , and war ensued , attended by such unfortunate results for Denmark , that she was forced in 1645 to release Sweden entirely from all further payments , and at the same time , by the treaty of Christianople , to determine definitely the duties to be paid by Dutch vessels . The tariff of duties then agreed upon was explained by another treaty in 1701 , and , with this addition , continues at the present day to furnish the basis upon which the collection of the Sound Dues is regulated . The exemption obtained by Sweden lasted for three quarters of a century ; but at the conclusion of the last war into which that country was plunged by the wild ambition of Charles XII. , this immunity was surrendered as the price of peace , and has never been regained . France and England found themselves under the same necessity of complying with the demands of Denmark as did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty of Christianople , France was glad to accept for her commerce the privileges accorded to the Dutch . As early as the close of the fifteenth century , Henry VII . of England recognized the Danish claim to the sovereignty of the Sound . The matter did not fail to attract also the attention of Cromwell , and shortly after the passage of the Navigation Act , which undermined the Dutch and built up the English commerce , he negotiated a treaty for the purpose of securing equal privileges with the Dutch in the payment of the Sound Dues , the chief stipulations of which were renewed under Charles II . A treaty placing France on the same footing with the most favored nations was concluded two years later , and this example was followed by most of the maritime powers . The basis upon which the Sound Dues were finally established by these various treaties was somewhat peculiar . By the treaty of Christianople , a tariff of specific duties upon certain enumerated articlcs was adopted , and it was directed that other goods should be taxed according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who framed the tariff to make the specific duties equal to an ad valorern duty of one per cent , and this principle was in the treaty of 1701 extended // also to the non-enumerated articles . But no provision was made by the contracting parties for those changes of value which time and the progress of commerce inevitably produce , and the result was , that the duty upon many important articles of trade , by gradual decrease of price , was increased to three , four , and even seven per cent , while the duties upon articles not named in the tariff of 1645 , though nominally amounting only to one per cent ad valorem , frequently exceeded that proportion , being assessed upon a valuation often arbitrary , and fluctuating at the caprice of the official charged with the computation . No essential change seems to have been made , however , for the space of two centuries . The subject is said to have presented itself for examination at the Congress of Vienna ; but in the general re-establishment of the European balance , it escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was undoubtedly in a measure the result of the unfortunate situation to which the war had reduced the kingdom of Denmark . The disasters beginning with the destruction of the fleet and the bombardment of Copenhagen by the English , and ending with the compulsory surrender of the entire kingdom of Norway , had so seriously affected the finances and political strength of Frederic VI. , that it is even supposed by some that the Congress guaranteed him the enjoyment of the Sound Dues as an indemnity . If such was the case , the particulars of the arrangement were never made public ; but we must add , that the conjecture seems to be corroborated by some expressions contained in a recent document issued by the Danish ministry , to which we shall hereafter have occasion to refer . The paper in question , communicated to the minister resident of the United States in October , 1855 , alluding to " the part which these Dues have played in the politics of the North of Europe , " deprecates the introduction of secondary questions , " which may do very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in an arrangement intended to serve as a complement to treaties of peace , and to transactions by which the system of political equilibrium has been regulated . " If the treaties and transactions here spoken of occurred during the present century , - a natural // and almost necessary supposition , - they can hardly be other than the arrangements made by the Congress of Vienna . Finally settled upon this basis , the Sound Dues have proved to be an extremely important branch of the Danish revenue , the entire income of the government from this source having averaged during the last twenty-five years about 2,000,000 rixdollars , and for the latter part of this period nearly 2,500,000 . A small portion of this is made up of the light-money , a tax amounting to two and a quarter specie dollars upon vessels in ballast , and four and a half upon vessels which are laden ; and there are also certain other slight incidental charges . By far the greater amount is , however , made up of the Sound Dues proper , - the duty upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sound . It is this duty alone which is the subject of the present discussion , the United States having consented , as late as 1855 , to pay its share of any charges necessary for the maintenance of lights and beacons . The number of vessels annually passing through the Sound , and paying their duties for themselves and their cargoes , varies from fifteen to twenty thousand , sometimes exceeding the latter number . Of these , full one fourth are usually English , and as many Swedish and Norwegian , the number of American vessels being very small , and averaging not much more than a hundred per annum . But as our vessels are all obliged to cross the Atlantic , while for the English and Continental vessels a trip up the Baltic is hardly more than a coasting voyage , the American ships are usually of larger capacity than the others , so that the amount paid by us as Sound Dues is much greater than might be supposed from the number of vessels , averaging about $ 100,000 . We are not aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States until the year 1826 . On the 26th of April in that year , Mr. Clay , then Secretary of State , concluded at Washington a convention of friendship , commerce , and navigation , which , together with the provisions usually found in such instruments , contains the following clause - " V. Neither the vessels of the United States , nor their cargoes , // 53 THE DANISH SOUND DUES . shall , when they pass the Sound or Belts , pay higher or other duties than those which are or may be paid by the most favored nations . " It was also provided that this convention should remain in force for ten years , and further until the end of one year after either party should give to the other notice of its intention to terminate the same . The convention thus agreed upon , aside from its value in other respects , secured for the commerce of the United States an important and substantial advantage , since , by the clause quoted above , the amount of the duties to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a quarter to one per cent , the former being the nominal rate paid by nations not enjoying special privileges by treaty , and therefore paid up to that time by the United States , and the latter the rate established by the treaties of Christianople and Copenhagen . It does not appear that Mr. Clay , in negotiating this convention , attempted either to deny or to evade the claim of Denmark to the Sound Dues . Avoiding all acknowledgment of their justice , he seems to have acquiesced in their existence by ancient prescription , and to have wisely limited his efforts to securing a practical diminution of the burden upon our commerce . His success in this undertaking was at the time a subject of lively congratulation among those interested , and no change is known to have been sought by our government until the administration of Mr. Tyler . In the years 1840 and 1841 , public attention was drawn anew to the subject of the Sound Dues . The nations in the North of Europe and on the Baltic felt more severely than ever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restive under the infliction . In addition to the duties themselves , which , as we have already explained , the course of trade and decline in prices were gradually rendering more and more onerous , the collection of the tolls was accompanied by unnecessary delays and vexatious ceremonies , which made the tax still more odious . Vessels bound to or returning from ports in the Baltic were obliged to lower their topsails before the castle of Cronenberg , in token of respect ; to stop at Elsinore , and thus become subject to unnecessary port charges ; to submit to an examination of their cargoes , and frequently to // encounter a delay , arising from the limited number of hours during which the custom-house was open , which was tedious , and , in those seas , often dangerous . These evils were a serious check upon the growing trade of the Baltic , and accordingly , at the period which we have named , there seems to have been a general movement among the nations most interested for the purpose of obtaining such modification of the regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In March , 1841 , Mr. Webster entered the cabinet as Secretary of State , and the movement to which we allude early attracted his attention , alive as he ever was to all that in any degree concerned the commercial prosperity of the country . On the 24th of May he addressed to the President a paper , asking his consideration of the existing regulations in regard to the Sound Dnes and their influence upon our Baltic trade , and advising negotiations with Denmark for the purpose of securing a full participation in the benefit of any new arrangement . While Mr. Webster was thus engaged in bringing the subject before the American government , England , moved by the loud complaints of her merchants , had entered into a negotiation , which , eleven days after the date of Mr. Webster 's communication to the President , was brought to a successful close . As the arrangements then made are almost the only important change which has taken place in the collection of the duties since 1701 , they deserve a somewhat particular explanation . The specific duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Mr. McGregor ( the British consul at Elsinore ) and the comptroller of the Danish custom-house at the Ocresund were commissioned to examine and reyise the tariff for non-enumerated articles , charged by the treaty of 1701 with a duty of one per cent ad valorem , and also to adjust the method of collecting the duties . Now it must be observed , that , while it was undoubtedly the intention of those who framed the tariff of 1645 to enumerate in it the principal articles of trade which passed through the Sound and Belts , still , so great has been the change in commerce , in the requirements of art , and the entire list of wants of civilized life , // that many of the articles which are now most important are not so much as named . This is especially the case with some of the staple articles of American trade in the Baltic , so that the proposition to revise the duties charged upon articles not enumerated in the treaty of Christianople intimately affected the interests of the United States . The commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one per cent , proceeded , for certain reasons of convenience , to fix a valuation for a long list of articles , and , computing one per cent upon this valuation , established it as a specific duty . As considerable pains were taken to obtain a correct appraisal of the articles taxed , some important reductions were made . For example , the duty on coffee was reduced from twenty-four to six stivers per hundred-weight , that on many kinds of dye-woods was diminished to less than one fourth its former amount , and that on cotton-yarns to about one half . But that the system , owing to radical defects , still operated unequally in many cases , will be seen by the following statem cut in regard to the toll upon raw sugar . The duty upon this article was reduced from nine to five stivers per hundred pounds . Complaint was made that even this amounted to about two per cent on the value of common sugar , which led Mr. Webster to inquire into the circumstances , when it appeared , that , Russia having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better kinds of white Havana were sent up the Baltic , so that the commissioners had fixed upon a valuation which nearly doubled the proportion to be paid by low-priced sugars . This would in turn contribute , even in case of a change of the Russian policy , to exclude from the trade all except the high-priced article . The general result , however , of the labors of the commissioners was favorable , and the satisfaction was increased by the abolition of the rule requiring the lowering of topsails before the Cronenberg , by an important reduction in the port charges at Elsinore , and by the extension of the hours during which the officers were to be in attendance at the custom- The Danish stiver is about 2 cents , the rix-bank-clollar 52* cents , and the specie rix-dollar $1.05 of our money . // house , all visitation of vessels being dispensed with , and their despatch being generally facilitated . Upon receiving official information of the new tariff and regulations , Mr. Webster expressed great satisfaction with all the arrangements , and the correspondence closed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet in May , 1843 , and his place was occupied a few weeks later by Mr. Upshur , who opened the subject afresh , upon a new and unusual basis . Following the example of Mr. Webster , the new Secretary of State addressed to the President a communication giving a general view of our commercial relations with Denmark and the Zoll-Verein . He dwelt at some length upon the subject of the Sound Dues , and declared that the time had come for taking decisive steps towards freeing our commerce entirely from this burden ; arguing that , as the tax was founded upon no services rendered to navigation , it could not be demanded with any show of right , and should no longer be submitted to . Whether Mr. Upshur took any further steps in the matter does not clearly appear . No correspondence has been published , and the Danish official journal , in March , 1844 , stated that nothing had passed between the two governments in regard to this subject since the negotiations under Mr. Webster . But Mr. Irwin , the representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 10 , 1844 , remarks that Mr. Upshur 's " observations with regard to the Sound Dues , and the treaties with the Northern powers , have given rise to much comment and speculation on the part of his diplomatic colleagues , " and refers to a possible refusal on the part of this country to submit to the Sound tolls any longer . The " observations " here alluded to , which may have been no more than the letter to the President before spoken of , seem in fact to have occasioned no little excitement ; both in Denmark and in the North of Europe generally . Reports were widely circulated that the American government contemplated a peremptory refusal of any further payments , and that a formidable squadron was to be fitted out to act as convoy to vessels passing through the Sound ; and these rumors gained so much credit , that it was thought necessary to publish a formal contradiction of them in the ministerial journal // THE DANISH SOUND DUES . at Copenhagen . The unfortunate disaster on board the Princeton , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given currency to these stories to retreat gracefully , and furnish an explanation for the continuance of peace . Mr. Calhoun , who succeeded to the post of Secretary of State upon Mr. Upshur 's death , seems to have attempted nothing beyond the collection of information . But it had happened , meanwhile , that the Prussian government , regarding the Sound Dues as unfavorably as the United States , had commenced negotiations , to aid the prosecution of which the king of Prussia , in the course of the year 1845 , visited in person the Danish court . These efforts were so far successful , that in the following spring a proclamation appeared , reducing the dues upon raw cotton from eighteen to ten stivers per hundred pounds , on spirits from four to three stivers per barrel , and on sugar from five to four stivers on the hundred pounds . The advantages gained to our Russian trade by this change , however , do not seem to have been as great as was anticipated . The imports of cotton into Russia up to the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had sometimes fallen nearly to 4,000,000 . Russia continued to import yarns and twist from England largely , although it must be observed that the gradual increase of her own manufactures considerably diminished her wants in this respect . It is hardly necessary to remark , that England has thus generally found the Sound Dues advantageous to her manufacturing interests , while Russia has equally strong reasons for opposing them , which family alliance and sympathy alone can overcome . As the case now stands , Russia refuses admission into her ports to any vessel which does not produce evidence of having discharged the Dues at Elsinore . Prussia , with less reason for acquiescence , and feeling severely the check upon her trade , has been anxious to use every opportunity for relieving herself . In March , 1848 , disturbances commenced iii the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein , followed by an obstinate struggle between Prussia and Denmark , which diminished the revenue and crippled the resources of the latter so far as to embarrass the action of all departments of her government . As it ap // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the German negotiators might insist upon the entire abolition of the Sound Dues , Mr. Flenniken , the Charg6 of the United States at Copenhagen , represented the case to Mr. Buchanan , then Secretary of State , who in return transmitted instructions to which more recent events give an unusual degree of interest . Agreeing with Mr. Flenniken that the time was favorable for opening negotiations , Mr. Buchanan entered into an elaborate argument to show the injustice of the Danish claim , dwelling at some length upon the superior advantages derived by Denmark from the reciprocity of trade , and urging that the abolition of the Sound Dues would be no more than a fair equivalent for these advantages . He instructed Mr. Flenniken to negotiate for a new treaty of commerce , providing also for exemption from toll , the exemption to be perpetual if possible , and then authorized him to make the following somewhat singular offer . As there would be considerable delay in procuring an act of Congress giving notice for the termination of the existing convention , and as the instrument provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a new treaty going into effect immediately would thus cut off the Sound Dues certainly two years sooner than could be done otherwise , Mr. Flenniken was to offer to the Danish government $ 250,000 as an indemnity for the amount thus lost to the royal exchequer , in return for which liberality the exemption provided by the new treaty was to be perpetual . In compliance with these instructions , Mr. Flenniken proceeded , on the 20th of November , 1848 , to open a discussion with the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs , informing that officer at the outset , that , unless there were a reasonable prospect of extinguishing the dues by treaty , Congress would proceed to terminate the existing convention , and that for this purpose he must have a reliable answer on or before the 15th of the following month . This overture , which at least had the merit of decision and vigor , he followed up by a statement in writing , embracing most of the points developed in Mr. Buchanan 's instructions . But as the Danish Minister objected to negotiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged , Mr. Flenniken agreed to postpone // the subject until the following year , and then , - we quote from his despatch , - " To convince him of the generous and liberal disposition of the United States towards Denmark , I informed him that , in addition to my written proposition , I would stipulate on the part of my government for the payment of $ 250,000 , not for the purchase of a right enjoyed by Denmark , but as an equitable equivalent for that branch of her revenue which she would thus give up , and mainly to furnish a liberal precedent on the part of a government who was strictly under no obligations to pay , in order that Denmark might be enabled profitably to settle with European nations , who were in fact under obligations to submit . " This proposition was received with great satisfaction by the Minister , Count Maltke , who undoubtedly regarded it as a thinly disguised offer to purchase the extinguishment of the dues , and Mr. Flenniken was assured that the king would be urged to accept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumption of hostilities with Germany broke off the negotiations , and the matter rested , until it was again brought forward by the present administration . Mr. Marcy , as early as July 18 , 1853 , instructed Mr. Bedinger , the new Charg6 at Copenhagen , to press the subject as soon as possible to a conclusion , and , giving an accurate account of the history of the Sound Dues , took the broad ground that the United States " can recognize no immemorial usage as obligatory , when it conflicts with natural privileges and international law . " Subsequently also , in reply to an inquiry from Mr. Bedinger , the Secretary wrote that the President declined authorizing him " to offer to that power any compensation for the removal of that as a favor which we have demanded as a right . " The interviews which , in pursuance of these instructions , Mr. Bedinger had with the Minister of For*eign Affairs , did not result in any practical measures . Some delay was occasioned by the pending crisis in European politics , and also , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russia ; and the Danish authorities solicited the postponement of the discussion until tranquillity should be restored to the political world , assuring the American representative that , as soon as possible , an effort would be made to enter into arrangements with all the powers interested to abandon // the Sound tolls upon receiving a certain compensation , - a settlement of the question which Mr. Bedinger replied could not be made by the United States . This intimation of an intended proposition for the adjustment of the question was given in March , 1854 , and nothing more seems to have been done in any quarter until the President , in his annual message , December 4 , 1854 , recommended to Congress that notice should be given for terminating the convention of 1826 . The Danish Chargd at Washington immediately received instructions from home to present to the government of the United States a statement of what was deemed the true nature of the right claimed by Denmark . The document in which this was done relied mainly upon the argument drawn from established custom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ingenuity . The whole argument of the Danish statement was concisely expressed in the following words - " His Majesty 's government holds that the right of Denmark to the Sound Dues is a right existing under the law of nations , by immemorial prescription , and therefore independent of all treaties . " Hence , it was argued , the abrogation of the convention would not restore anything to the United States , nor take anything from Denmark , while , it was added , the exemption claimed by this country could not be conceded without affording our commerce an undue advantage , which other nations would immediately demand to share , and our claim was therefore equivalent to a demand for the entire abolition of the Sound Dues . Nevertheless , the Senate proceeded to pass a resolution for giving notice of the termination of the treaty , and after a final interview , in which the Danish Minister steadily refused to listen to any proposition for abandoning the Sound Dues without some equivalent , and Mr. Bedinger as steadily refused , in compliance with his instructions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our right , " the notice was at last given , April 14 , 1855 , that after the expiration of one year the convention of April 26 , 1826 , would be at an end . In regard to this measure , which is the chief result attained // by the negotiations for the remission of the Dues , several questions arise . First in order comes the inquiry , Was this abrogation of the treaty , by a resolution of the Senate , instead of an act of Congress , constitutional ? This question was raised in the Senate by Mr. Sumner , and was referred to a select committee , who reported favorably to the view already taken by the Senate . It was considered , that , as the treaty provided for its own termination , and was created by the will of the President and Senate , it implied an authority by which that will might be revoked , and that this revocation must necessarily proceed from the body exercising the will . As to treaties not containing any provision for termination by the act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of such a stipulation as an essential condition . It must be observed that only one case similar to the present has ever occurred in our history , and in that , - the case of the treaty with England concerning the joint occupation of Oregon , - the action of both houses of Congress was deemed necessary in order to break off the treaty . And not only was this the sole precedent , but the opinions of the courts and of individuals , frequently expressed , had almost uniformly been , that , while the President and Senate might make a treaty , Congress alone could abrogate it . As to that clause of the Constitution which declares " all treaties made under the authority of the United States " to be " the supreme law of the land , " and hence , by natural and almost necessary inference , repealable only by the legislative power , the committee contented themselves with a denial of its application , and evaded the direct argument . They also contended that " The President and Senate could certainly terminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the opposite contracting party , by the negotiation of a new treaty , in terms annulling it . And what is the present case but such consent , providing in advance for its termination on a contingency , and without negotiations ? " But , it must be replied , the consent here spoken of is a mere stipulation as to the mode of procedure in abrogating the treaty , and not by any means a consent to the abrogation // itself , like that implied in the adoption of a new treaty ; and while the Constitution may give to the President and Senate a right to supersede a treaty , in such a manner as insures the continuance of friendly relations , it can hardly be argued that therefore it is intended to give them power to break off all treaty connections , - a step which in most cases would be deemed preliminary to hostilities . On the contrary , ( most of the reasoning upon this question being general and inferential , ) this power might be very properly sought for in the charge of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress . The question was practically settled for the present by a vote of the Senate , declaring its previous action to be proper and sufficient ; but the legal question as to the limits of executive power in such cases is interesting , and can hardly be said to have received a satisfactory solution . We must add , however , that , as regards the treaty with Denmark , the question is merely a matter of domestic concern , and does not affect the validity of the notice given to that power . But besides this constitutional question , a grave inquiry presents itself , whether the abrogation of the treaty was a judicious measure . It can not be pretended that this step was necessary in order to place our government in a position to claim and negotiate for the complete remission of the Dues ; for it was not admitted on either side that the convention of 1826 ii*nplied any obligation to continue the payment , or indeed had any effect at all upon the general question as regards this country . The convention merely regulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contending that the question as to the right of Denmark to the tolls was held in abeyance , Denmark claiming that her right existed prior to any treaty , and both denying that any new obligation was incurred by this country in 1826 . The abrogation of the convention can , then , be construed only as a preliminary step towards a refusal to pay the tolls ; and we must now inquire whether the time had arrived for such a measurc . It is of course understood that Denmark could not grant an immunity to ships sailing under one flag and deny it to // others . On the contrary , a concession of free passage to one nation would be a virtual surrender of the entire sovereignty claimed by her over the Sound . If , then , our vessels should attempt to enter the Baltic without paying the dues , it is certain that Denmark would enforce payment , and that hostilities would be the natural consequence of such an attempt . It is then fair to expect , that such measures for throwing off the imposition would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ; only after diplomacy had failed , conciliatory offers had been rejected , and all efforts to obtain a peaceful settlement of the question had proved unavailing . Now it appears that when Mr. Bedinger first opened negotiations under the present administration in December , 1858 , nearly five years had elapsed since the last previous communication upon the subject had taken place . Mr. Bedinger had three interviews with the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs , the last in March , 1854 , when it appeared that the Danish government had certain propositions to offer as soon as there was an opportunity for a general arrangement , to which the Minister said " he had strong reasons for believing that we would assent . " The time was certainly unpropitious for negotiation , and , even with the utmost alacrity on thepartof Denmark , it is difficult to see how she could then have taken steps for adjusting a question of European interest . With a serious quarrel between the Diet and the Ministry , threatening n political if not an armed revolution , and paralyzing her energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - with a near prospect of a general European war in which she mPrht he c to take an part , two *ompelled active the nations most deeply interested in the question of the Sound Dues then actually engaged in hostilities , and each eager to thwart any arrangement beneficial to the commerce of the other , - it is not surprising that Denmark was reluctant to enter upon the discussion of this important subject , and not snrprising that she should ask to have the matter deferred . And as our government had been willing to allow the question to slumber for five years , it was to he expected , that , under such circumstances , it would not hastily proceed to extremities . These considerations , however , appear to have had no // weight at Washington . No further communication was held with the Danish government , and if any took place with the Danish Charg6 in this country , it has not appeared in the published documents . Mr. Bedinger called the attention of the Secretary of State to the subject , but received no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's recommendation , in December , 1854 , to break off the existing convention . We believe that no argument is required to show that such a step as this was unwise and premature . Considering that for five years the question had been suffered to rest ; that negotiations were finally opened at a time when it was manifestly impossible for Denmark to act promptly , and hardly honorable to ask her to act at all ; that then negotiations were opened upon a basis notoriously impracticable , without any effort or apparent desire to learn upon what terms a settlement could be made ; that they were abruptly closed four months later ; and that , after eight months ' silence , a measure was resorted to which was avowedly designed to settle the dispute in the most offensive manner , and in the way most likely to lead to interruption of peaceful relations , - we may fairly say that a policy was pursued such as would hardly have been adopted with an opponent of more formidable military or naval strength . If such duties had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted as important a part of the revenues of Great Britain as the Sound tolls do of the income of Denmark , we should hardly call so peremptorily upon England to abandon the whole , and , without seeking for any middle ground of agreement , proceed to resist all further payments , after an acquiescence of three quarters of a century . Forced to act amid these unfavorable circumstances , the Danish government drew up a plan for a general congress of the powers interested , to meet at Copenhagen as early as possible . This document , communicated to our government early in October , 1855 , after explaining the position in which Denmark found herself , and the necessity for action occasioned by the course of the United States , and premising that a mere revision of the tariff of Sound Dues would not satisfy the positive demands of this country , snggested the project of // capitalization , and proposed that the quota to be paid by each nation should be ascertained by the quantity of merchandise passing through the Sound and Belts , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of vessels of each flag as regarded the light-money and similar duties . It was of course indispensable that this arrangement should be concurred in simultaneously by all the powers interested . " Besides this condition ; there is yet another which the Danish government regards as essential : it is , that the affair in question should be treated , not as a commercial or money transaction , but as a political matter . This would correspond with the history of the Sound Dues , with the part which these dues have played in the politics of the North of Europe ; otherwise it were impossible to give to the negotiation the necessary scope and character , in order that it may not be encumbered by questions of a secondary class , which may do very well in a purely commercial and fiscal arrangement , but not in an arran*ement intended to serve as a complement to treaties of peace , and to transactions by which the system of political equilibrium has been regulated . " The condition thus introduced into the Danish project was lone sufficient to insure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply , dated November 3 , 18.55 , Mr. Marcy very justly remarked : - " Of the utility or wisdom of the political theory of the balance of power , in its application to the European family of nations , it is not proposed to express an opinion ; but enough of its operations has been seen to impress upon this government a fixed determination to avoid being brought within its vortex . It has long been the cherished policy of this government to avoid such a dangerous complicity , and the President will not yield in any case to the slightest relaxation of it . " But prudent and judicious as was the course of our government in this respect , there are views set forth in its answer to the Danish proposal which seem to be of more doubtful propriety . It is objected by the Secretary , that the proposed congress was not authorized to pass upon the question as to the original rights of Denmark . But this objection is scarcely a reasonable one ; for if Denmark had proposed to submit that question to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have saved herself the trouble of a formal 6* // congress . The offer to arrange a plan , with the concurrence of the other powers , for the extinguishment of the Dues , without material detriment to her own prosperity , was as much as could reasonably be expected , and was certainly as much as we ourselves , in such a situation , should have offered . But the grand objection to the proposed congress undoubtedly arose from the fixed determination to consent to nothing short of a complete surrender of the tolls , - a position already laid down , as we have seen , in the most explicit terms , and now repeated in the remark that Denmark must expect no proposition to be " favorably entertained , if it should include , either expressly or impliedly , any compensation for the surrender of her pretended right to control the free use by our ships of the Sound and the Belts of the Baltic . " We have already shown that the right to levy dues in the Sonnd is held to exist by immemorial prescription @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nations . Denmark rest her claim upon that ancient and continued possession , which , by the municipal law of all countries , is held to confer a right of property , and not upon any express grant or general principle . This claim has been admitted for centuries by all the maritime powers of Europe , and acquiesced in by our own government for nearly the whole period of our national existence . The essential principle upon which it rests is one which could not by any possibility be adduced in support of a claim of recent origin , so that the parallel drawn between the Sound Dues and the tribute exacted by the Barbary powers , and the assertion that , if the Danish claim were admitted , similar demands might be made at the Straits of Gibr* itar , or of Messina , or at the Dardanelles , are alike unfounded and preposterous . In each of these cases there would be wanting the fundamental idea of prescription , upon which alone Denmark founds her claim to the Sound Dues proper . It is clear , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would bind us to submit to the unfounded demands of any power in the future , and we may inquire whether , with reference to this single case alone , the policy of our government has been the most judicious that could be // adopted . So far as the question concerns our interest , the quota which this country would furnish for capitalizing the Sound Dues would not defray the charges of the smallest squadron which we should send to the Baltic as convoy , leaving out of view the possibility of a long naval contest . As to the point of honor , - the only other motive which can have influenced our course ,  --  it is generally found that no individual is eager to distinguish himself above his fellows in the defence of his personal reputation , unless he is conscious that it requires more than ordinary support , and is peculiarly liable to be called in question . A settlement of this disputed claim which should be satisfactory to the European powers , whose pecuniary share in it is tenfold greater than our own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as watchful over their interests as ourselves , whose naval force could by a single blow strike Denmark from her place among the independent nations of the Continent , - would not be unworthy of our acceptance . And it is also to be considered whether our national reputation would be most advanced by an over-scrupulous attention to our own rights , or by a generous deference to the situation and feelings of others . The claim preferred by Denmark is one which she has been encouraged to make by the world and by ourselves , and the position of this country , its wealth and its power , place it so far above all suspicion of timidity or constraint , that we can well afford to judge that claim with a liberal spirit of equity , rather than by a rigid and exacting estimate of our legal obligations . Without admitting any necessity which compels such a course , we can honorably concede something to the demands of a weaker nation , - demands not recent or of any ordinary nature . Without denying the justice of our own views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as to accept a middle ground of conciliation and harmony . Notwithstanding the refusal of the United States , a congress assembled at Copenhagen , during the last winter , in which England , France , Russia , Sweden , Prussia , Austria , the Netherlands , Spain , Belgium , and Denmark were represented , and after consultation the Danish delegates made the following proposition . Setting the annual income of the Sound // Dues at 1,750,000 rix-dollars , - a considerable sacrifice , since , as we have seen , the average product of the tolls is over 2,000,000 , - twenty years ' purchase would give a capital of 35,000,000 . This amount , which was to include all dues on ships as well as cargoes , was to be apportioned according to the merchandise imported and exported , Denmark paying her share with the others , and the arrangement was to be agreed to by all the powers represented , before it should become obligatory . Upon this basis the proportion to be paid by England would be more than 10,000,000 rix-dolJars , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much , while the United States would be called upon for 2,100,000 or $ 1,050,000 . While these negotiations were pending , the year 's notice prescribed by the convention of 1826 came to an end , but our government agreed with the Danish to continue the operation of the treaty for two months longer . We believe that no official announcement has been made of the course finally adopted at the expiration of the treaty in June last , but it is understood that the question has been bequeathed to the next administration . Sweden and Russia immediately gave in their adherence to the Danish proposition , and other powers are understood to be ready to take a similar step , if there should be a prospect of its general adoption . But the disposition of the British government to oppose the scheme of capitalization , for a time destroyed the hope of a speedy adjustment . Lord Palmerston 's cabinet , contrary to the opinions of the press , and , it is believed , of the country , is said to have objected to the plan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have submitted a proposition , intended to perpetuate the exactions , by simply providing that they shall be collected at the ports of entry and of departuire in the Baltic , instead of Elsinore . But more recent advices give us reason to hope that this objection has been withdrawn , and that England has been induced to accede to the scheme of capitalization , while at the same time it is said that France , also following the lead of her great ally , is about to signify her compliance with the proposed arrangements . Certain it is , that , - leaving out of view all desire to check the commerce of Russia by imposing // THE DANISH SOUND DUES . indirectly import and export duties , and passing by all fears of diminishing the British exports to the Baltic by opening the trade fairly to the producers of raw material as well as to manufacturers , - no British statesman should be unmindful of the necessity of a speedy settlement of this question , not only to the true commercial interests of his own country , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sound Dues now offers a perpetual menace . The United States are , then , the only important power whose consent to the Danish scheme has not been given ; and taking into consideration therefore our independent position , - free as we are from all the complicities of European politics , our unquestioned ability to enforce our will in a contest with Denmark alone , our ample means to pay the small sum required to free our commerce from these restrictions , without its being felt in the slightest degree by our national finances , the great importance of this concession to Denmark , and the fact that it can never by any possibility he distorted into a precedent , because no similar case can ever arise , we believe that the honor , dignity , and interest of this country will be far better sustained by yielding with an easy grace to this demand , than by the most successful war which might grow out of a determined adherence to an abstract principle . And finally , it must be borne in mind that all onr efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rendered nugatory by those Northern powers who have acceded to the Danish proposals , and whose interest impels them to seek the accession of all the nations oncerned . We have already referred to the refusal of Russia to open her ports to vessels which have not paid the Dues at Elsinore . In the event of our refusal to unite in the compromise , that nation has only to extend this policy to vessels not released from payment by treaty , and our Baltic trade is cut off , without hope of redress or opportunity for complaint . The Northern powers may well refuse to receive into their ports vessels which have evaded or refused the payment of duties to which they willingly subject their own navigation ; nor can we expect them , by giving a preference to our ships over theirs , voluntarily to place in our hands the carrying trade to and from their own ports . // From all these considerations , then , we believe that it is clearly the most certain , the most manly , and the simplest way of closing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the amicable settlement of this question , and , by an inconsiderable sacrifice , to free our commerce for ever from this imposition , and from all danger of interference by the great Northern powers .
