txt ART . 11. - RESPONSIBILITY FOR ERRORS OF OPINION . Works of Lord Brougham . London . 4 vols . SIN is the great fact of human society . Hardly inferior to it , in obviousness and magnitude , is its correlate , error . All classes of men , all subjects of thought , and all ages of the world are pervaded by false opinions to an extent which our faculties must at*cept as infinite . The wisest is an errorist . In the course of his life , he has been found in a multitude of mistakes , of every degree of importance , from those which relate to the state of the weather , up to those which relate to the essence of religion . Where the strong have failed , the weak have fallen . Amusement and business , politics and literature , science and religion-no field of thought escapes what escapes no intellect . Hardly an opinion which has not been controverted . Hardly a topic on which there are not as many different sentiments as there are different men surveying it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals in precisely the same light . This diversity of opinion measures its erroneousness . The error which lies about us in huge and endless profusion , stretches away in Alpine ranges to the ends of the world , and the beginning of time . An evil so great and obvious has naturally attracted much attention from thoughtful men . Various inquiries have been started respecting it . Among the most important of these is one relating to the degree of responsibility it involves . Some deny that men are responsible for any of their errors of opinion . They claim that belief is under the control of a rigid necessity-that the judgment is determined by a law of circumstances as inexorable as that which constrains the circling // planet-that believers in God and Jupiter , in Christ and Mohammed , in philosophies empiric and transcendental , in moral distinctions and materialism , are all , in respect to believing otherwise , equally poxverless and equally blameless . Others reject these ideas with abhorrence . In their view , all errors involve guilt . No exception is allowed . From religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mistakes must be reckoned as falling within the scope of conscience and a moral government . And again , both these views are extreme in the estimation of others-who maintain that we are responsible for all religious errors , or at least all religious errors of the higher degrees of importance , while in inferior matters one may fall into mistake without blame . This last view is that to which the conduct of men is usually adjusted . Lord Brougham , in his Inaugural Address , as Rector of the University of Glasgow , laid down the broad principle that man is not responsible for his belief . Dr. Wardlaw replied to Lord Brougham , in two very able sermons , though we think not in a manner entirely satisfactory . The subject is evidently of some considerable importance , and we propose to give it an independent investigation . How far are men responsible for errors of opinion ? Before attempting to answer this inquiry , we must offer a word to prevent misapprehension . Our belief is , that if men were faithful to themselves , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injurious consequences . If God did not secure their fallible natures from mistake , he would prevent their being injured by it . This much we suppose to be taught in the following passages : " The Lord shall guide thee continually . " " All things shall work together for good to them that love God . " These scriptures promise to secure the strictly righteous from all such mistakes of conduct , and hence of opinion , as would prove injurious to them . They promise nothing more . If God chooses to allow the mistake and prevent its evil results , he does not violate his word . With this precautionary statement , we proceedto inquire how far men are responsible for errors of opinion . A general and useful answer , is the following : We are responsible for our mistakes as far as they are the result of past sin , or of the absence of due present effort to prevent them : and no further . We shall be asked what we mean by due effort . We answer : effort proportioned to the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming our attention . Duty does not require us to expend the entire force of our faculties and opportunities on any one subject . // On the contrary it forbids such expenditure . We have many duties to perform , and many important topics of inquiry to investigate . And our limited time and capability of effort are to be shared among these according to their relative importance . With this explanation , our position finds easy proof . The sin of some far- back period may so vitiate our faculties and circumstances as to make it impossible for our best efforts of to-day to escape a given error . What is plainer than that this error is criminal , although our present efforts to ascertain the truth are entirely unexceptionable ! Neglect of due present effort to ascertain truth may cause error , though our past conduct presents no obstacle . What is plainer than that the error is criminal which results from our not doing the best we consistently can to prevent it ! Moreover , what is plainer than that the error is not culpable which we neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty in other directions ! This general answer to our inquiry , though useful , is too vague to be entirely satisfactory . Jt may still be asked how far error of opinion would be averted , were men from the outset perfectly just to themselves . We therefore reply again in several particulars . 1 . We arc not responsible for all errors of opinion . The question before us is whether a man who has always been morally perfect , would be free from all mistakes . Would he never form a false judgment , however trifling ? Would he never mistake a path in a journey ? Would he never misapprehend the meaning of a speaker or author ? Would he never misjudge the character or capacities of those with whom he comes in contact ? Would he never miscalculate in the least in the management of worldly business ? Would he never be accessible to any degree of imposition from unscrupulous men ? Would he never take up an incorrect view in philology , metaphysics , or any other subject on which there is so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jn a word , would he never fall into any mistake ; however trifling ? If this question can be answered in the negative , man is blameworthy for every one of the innumerable erroneous opinions with which the world is burdened : for he is blameworthy for not having been always morally perfect . If it must be answered in the affirmative , there are some mistakes which do not involve guilt . We say then that perfection of moral character from the outset , would not exempt a person from all mistakes of opinion . We shall regard this assertion as containing two elements ; first , that a perfect man could not avoid all error if left to his // own natural powers ; and secondly , that God would not make good their deficiency . Let us first conceive a man ever morally perfect , yet left entirely to his owa natural powers . In this position it is quite impossible for his limited nature to avoid mistake . Would not a perfect man like all others be forced to judge from appearances and probabilities within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation would be limited . In virtue of his finite faculty , he would have but a finite field of view . Facts necessary to avoid wrong decisions would be just as liable to be beyond his field of view , as beyond that of any other man . Such facts in great numbers do lie beyond the field of view of other men . To the child or the adult of some barbarous land , the apparent unity and fixity of yonder star which adorns his evening sky , necessarily seem real . All the appearances within the range of his faculties , favor the impression . The facts which demonstrate its incorrectness lie beyond that range . It is only the cultivated philosopher standing on the shoulders of many generations , who can see that twinkling point a multiple star , wheeling through the abyss in elliptic curves , whose immensity terrifies the imagination . Many such instances might be mentioned . If then existing men often err from ignorance of facts , which lie beyond the scope of their faculty-and if a perfect man would be just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just as limited ; then it follows that we might expect to find mistakes in one who has always been morally perfect-Limited faculties must from their very nature understand many things superficially . The subjects of human thought are of all degrees of difficulty , from that which is above the comprehension of an such as are level with the capacity of a child . Hence an intelligence with given bounds must know some of them well , others partially , and others still not at all . But how often does mere superficiality of knowledge show itself a most apt cause of mistake ! A very large fraction of the errors of the world may readily be traced to this source alone . To see some things imperfectly , is sooner or later to see many things falsely . Let us turn to another argument . It is from the mental and other differences of men . Such differences are entirely independent of moral character and would exist though all the race should revert to its primeval holiness . Some would have more intellectual ability than others . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find a correct understanding of these subjects of more consequence . Now what we have to say , is , that these differences can not // exist without more or less error . We have seen the subjects of human thought have all degrees of difficulty . Of course there are some upon which a given man can barely form an accurate opinion , if left to himselti Hence all men of his ability , or less favorable circumstances for investigation , or less actual and felt need of correctness on these subjects , would fail of accuracy , if they ventured an opinion . Would they venture it ? Many of them doubtless would . Partially understood and difficult subjects are as likely to interest and solicit an opinion as any others , and a perfect moral character would not , of itself , show them their incompetency to form an accurate opinion . Yonder is a man , whose feeble powers scarce lift him above idiocy . Yonder is a child , whose faculties are as yet undeveloped . Would these be infallible , if they had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature and subtle genius to impose upon their weak intelligence , sophistry for sound argument , and falsehood for pure truth ? It is ' plain that if they were left entirely to their own resources , these resources would be inadequate to their protection . It would not be their splendid virtue that would save them . The great and resourceful genius could readily make the worse appear to them the better reason , and so paint and apparel error , as to make her pass for heavenly truth . Perhaps it will be thought unfair to draw an inference from the idiot and the child , to the usual men and women of the world ? But to angels , we are all children . , What causes the errors of the child in the face of a perfect virtue ? Is it not the disproportion of his mental strength and skill to the difficulty of the subject on which they are employed , and to the power of that adroit and commanding intellect which masters them ? There are questions of actual speculation just as much above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost idiot mistakes , is above his . There are actual sophists and deceivers about us , as much more capable than the highest man , as that man is more capable than the child . Hence , let God leave the mass of men to their own powers and it is no virtue of theirs , however perfect , which would secure them from errors of opinion . No close survey of society is needed to show that the theoretical correctness of man is not strictly proportioned to their previous virtue . A chronic inferiority of heart is not unfrequently found connected with l*rge superiority of judgment . Men , who have ever maintained unusual amiability and integrity , are sometimes seen managing their worldly affairs with much less skill than others of less moral pretensions . The bad sometimes proceed with greater success through the intricacies // of learning and science , than the good . These facts show that correctness of opinion does not depend solely on the tenor of moral character . Of course , no per%ction of virtue would secure perfect truth of opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning of his career , would not , if left altogether to his own powers , escape all errors of opinion . But it may be thought Divine power would here step in to make good his deficiency and avert the error which he had done his best to avert for himself . This view seems to 115 inadmissible , and for the following reasons . The benevolence of God does not require this interference . It may seem inconsistent with Divine goodness to allow men to fall into error after they have always done their best to prevent it . But it matters not whether God prevent the error or neutralize the evil of its consequences . No one can show that it is not as often possible and proper for him to do the latter as the former . Doubtless God often interferes to prevent errors of opinion . But we have seen that his interference is not extended to men in exact proportion to their previous virtue . This is ground for believing that the interference would not be universal even if the character were perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , other than those of character and independent of it . Divine interference to prevent suffering is not extended to men in exact proportion to past virtue . *rhi shows that perfection of character would not be likely to secure in this world absolute perfection of happiness . Now there is no more likelihood that God can consistently secure , in the present state , perfect correctness of opinion to a man always perfect , than there is that he can here secure to him perfect happiness . Thus it appears that a man morally perfect from the outset , would not be exempt from all mistakes of opinion . Ills own faculties would not give him this exemption : nor would the added grace of God . 2 . We m*re not responsible for all our errors of religious opinion . Religions mistakes are more important than secular . Hence it is thought that God may have qualified us to avoid all of the one class , though he may not have qualified us to avoid all of the other . He would take most pains against the most serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We proceed on the supposition that these views may be just . Let us assume that they furnish valid ground for inquiring whether we are responsible for all mistakes of opinion in matters of religion . Yet there is no necessity for doing this . Truth // will allow us to assert that there are as unimportant opinions on religious subjects as on any other . You believe that the Divine Spirit is such , that no other spirit can co*xist with it in precisely the same place . What imports it ? You believe that God has a particular form as well as substance . What imports it ? You believe that the seat of his throne is the planet Saturn , or the Sun , or that great central orb around which revolve all the systems of the creation . What impoits it ? And so we might instance to any extent , opinions respecting God and duty which are practically as unimportant as any which can be cited from the fields of secular speculations . But grant it otherwise . Allow that religious error is always more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to qualify us to avoid it . We now ask whether we are responsible for all errors of opinion on the subject of religion ? We answer , unhesitatingly , in the negative . We do it on the ground that a man , morally perfect from the outset , could not avoid all religious errors , if left to himself , and would not be secured from them by Divine interposition . Does any reason exist why a man , without this interposition , can avoid religious errors better than secular ? None whatever . Sacred truth may not be reached in a way peculiar to itself-man has , by natLire , no special adaptation to its investigation-nor is this investigation less difficult than the other . We are under the necessity of forming our religious opinions , as we do our secular . They are not found innate . We reach them not by a special instinct . A powerful grace of intuition does not qualify us to go at once to the depths of profound and embarrassed religious subjects . Nor do we reach our results by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is by ordinary investigation , conducted according to the ordinary principles of investigation-by the same i*culties , and the same modes of using the faculties , which conduct us to truth in business and science . This is the existing way : and this would be the way were men perfectly virtuous from the outset . Amid the striking variety of moral character , we notice a striking uniformity of experience . The best Christian is as consciously subject to an inexorable necessity of reaching religious truth by the ordinary rational process , as the worst sinner . This shows that our present mode is strictly independent of human virtue . Were that virtue perfect from the outset , logic would sustain to faith the same relation which it does to-day ; only this blade of Damascus would be wielded with great facility and more signal success . It would be as indispensable as ever . // We sometimes meet with instances of special natural adaptation to the investigation of a particular subject . One is preeminently fitted for mathematical studies , who has but an ordinary fitness for moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is simply dull in metaphysics . Why may not the race have some such special adaptation of nature to religious inquiries , that though they were as intrinsically difficult and as circumstantially embarrassed as any secular , they would yet be mastered with greater facility ? Because there is no essential difference in nature between religious and ordinary secular investigation : both depending on evidence of the same moral kind and of the same laws of ascertainment and management . Of course an adaptation for one is an equal adaptation for the other . Religious questions are to the full as intricate as any . Who knows a problem in nature so profound that a problem in morals can not be found to equal it ? When Newton turned from the study of celestial mechanics to the study of the Divine Word , he found that the powers which strode so sublimely from mountain-top to mountain-top of scientific discovery , would strain and falter through the more intense Switzerland of theology . When Pascal withdrew from that abstruse geometry of which he was the natural high priest , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion which his vast powers sought in vain to solve . When Locke retired from his stubborn metaphysics to a more thorough religious study , it was to feel that he needed in his new vocation all the great powers which bad grappled so successfully with the recondite theory of mind . Now the religious studies of these men , were approached under circumstances at least as favorable as belonged to their secular . They brought to these the full maturity of their powers , the highest zeal , and a moral condition much more favorable to religious investigation than secular . As a corrupt tendency and sin do more to obscure moral than other truth ; so a correct tendency and holiness do more to illustrate it . Now the latter were largely predominant in these equal ornaments of science and religion . Genius was the least part of their greatness . They were good men . In them the nature of a carnal birth was overruled by the nature oPa spiritual . And they were largely under the influence of that Divine Spirit which is ever an illuminator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most sensibly within the sphere of their religious inquiries . But it is said that they had peculiar natural or acquired qualifications for their scientific studies , and that the fact that // they found no peculiar difficulty in investigating these , is no proof that such difficulty did not exist . Has the objector read the " Provincial Letters ? " Has he passed under his eve the tracts on " Toleration and Government ? " Has he taken soundings through the " Observations on the prophecies of Daniel and John ? " If so , he has seen , or ought to have seen , evidences of as masterful ability in the marshaling of probabilities , as was ever displayed in the marshaling of differentials-in the exposition of the laws of expediency and right , as was ever concerned in developing the laws of mind . These men were not freaks of nature-prodigies of mental disproportion-very Fortizebes , shaking one arm as huge and mighty as a giant 's , and another as diminutive and feeble as a child 's . Their sword , like that which kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way-flashing with equal facility and force , toward every point of the intellectual horizon . One perfect from the beginning , could not escape all secular mistakes : we believe that one left to himself , would be in as bad a condition in respect to mistakes in religion . Another argument may be found in the consequences which would naturally flow from the adoption of different sentiments . Each man would account all those holding views in religion , differing at all from his own , as sinners for so doing . He x*rould treat them accordingly . A degree of severity , hitherto unknown , would characterize the intercourse of different sects and members of the same sect . The arrows of controversy would always be dipped in poison . Denunciation would feather every argument . What so likely to provoke acerbity of feeling toward our opponent , as the belief that his hostility arises from wickedness , or his imputation of such wickedness to ourselves ? Everywhere bitterness and alienation would reign in exact proportion to the reign of faith  --  to the misery of society , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By reverting to the considerations from which was inferred the impossibility of escaping all error of opinion without Divine aid , it will be found that they all apply with equal conclusiveness to the support of our present position . We will instance only one . It is an observed fact , that the theoretical correctness of men in religion is very far from being strictly proportioned to their previous virtue . The unhappiness of very many is , that with so r*uch light , they have so little obedience : and again the unhappiness of others is , that with so much obedience , they have so little light . If religious orthodoxy depended solely on moral character , it would always be measured by the // excellence of that character . As it does not so depend , we might be without stain of sin , and yet without freedom from religious error . The argument has proceeded on the assumption , that we are left altogether to our own natural powers . Doubtless God can keep us from mistake . But would he do it , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frorri a limited nature , and an imperfect condition ? His benevolence does not require it . This attribute is as well satisfied with his preventing the evil consequences of mistake , as with his preventing the mistake itselL And positively , as God does not interfere to prevent religious mistakes in men in exact proportion to the virtue they have exercised , we are authorized to conclude , that he would not interfere to prevent them entirely , were their lives without stain . 3 . We are not responsible for all religions errors of the higher degrees of importance . We have shown that some of the positions which may be laid down in regard to God and duty , are of no manner of consequence . But as much is not true of the many . All degrees of injury , from that which is simply serious , up to that which is infinite and everlasting , may tend to result from some mistaken views in religion . And the question tomes up : Would a man always doing , and always having done his best , escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning attached to the word " importance . " If it denotes only what , if it actually occurred , would certaiiily produce personal injury to the mind , we must answer in the affirmative . If it means anything more-if it means what tends to do injury to any one-if it means what , if it actually occurred , would certainly produce evil to some , then we must answer in the negative . We believe that if a man were from the beginning faithful to himself and to duty , he would either escape all error or all personal injury from error . Thus far God has promised ; and no further . It is indeed very susceptible of proof that any further promise would contradict facts . Do men always avoid errors of highly injurious tendency , in exact proportion to the virtue they have exercised ? Do they always avoid errors of highly injurious effect upon others , in exact proportion to that virtue ? Witness the pantheist Spinosa set over against the father of the inductive philosophy ! Witness the Romanist Fenelon set over against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ errorist , and of worse effect in society , than those which the good are often permitted to embrace , and the bad often enabled to avoid ! The Holy Scriptures , the correct opinions // of good men , are actually wrested by many to their own destruction : it is to be expected that the errors of good men will often be turned to as bad an account . Thus we see that men do not in exact proportion to virtue , secure exemption from religious errors of highly injurious tendency to themselves , and actual importance in society . This security depends in part on things independent of virtue : so that virtue might fill all her banks with her pure , heaven-imaging flood , and yet the security be imperfect . But the benevolence of God ! And what of the Divine benevolence ? Is it forfeited , when a man without guilt falls into error which tends to his considerable injury ? Not if God prevents that tendency from becoming effect . Is it forfeited , when a man with out guilt falls into error which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goodness in God to allow evil to flow in through any and every channel upon the righteous for discipline , and upon the wicked for discipline or punishment . But is not the Bible a perfect rule of faith ? It is . Is it not essential to such a rule that it furnish the means of avoiding all religious errors , of at least the higher degrees of importance ? It is not-in all senses of the word " importance . " It is enough if the rule put it in the power of each   escape all religious error which would do himself serious injury , and thus place the world in a condition to escape all the world 's serious evils . This the Scriptures do . To do anything beyond this would not be a plain advantage . To prevent errors which would only tend to considerable injury , would not add to personal merit , it would subtract from it to prevent such as would actually inflict considerable injury on others who needed it for discipline . Hence we do not fall upon the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Long after Antichrist has been broken upon it , may it stand as immutable in its place and honors , as it does in its truth and utility . A perfect rule of faith are the Scriptures-though they may only Oiler to each , the means of escaping such errors as would involve himself in serious injury . 4 . We are responsible for all errors of opinion which are incompatible with repentance , a fervid and rapidly advancing piety , and indeed a perfect discharge of any duty . God requires all men to repent . The penitent should wax swiftly from the crescent to the full orb . A thousand duties subservient to this are clearly laid upon us in his two-fold revelation . He holds us responsible for their discharge . Yet they can not be discharged without correctness of belief on certain points . A sound faith must precede a sound work . We can not repent // without belief in the existence of a God , in the essential distinctions of vice and virtue , in personal sinfulness , and in the Divine mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety , without belief in the efficacy of prayer , in the weakness of human nature , in the necessity of spiritual watchfulness , and in the various ordinances of the Christian Church , which are divinely appointed means of grace . So every duty will be found connected with some truth , or system of truth , upon the belief of which it solely reposes-Dodona 's statue of gold upon its pillar of alabaster . Cast down the pedestal and its precious burden will follow . Now correctness of belief is just as obligatory as the duties to which it is essential . If it is my duty to repent , and I can not repent without a belief in human responsibility , then that belief is my duty . God holds me responsible for mistake . And if we see one prevented from doing anything which we know to be his duty , by an error of opinion incompatible with any other result , we are at once authorized to conclude that the error was avoidable-that he is responsible for it-that on account of it , he is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finished . To prevent misapprehension of our sentiments , we add the following remarks . It does not follow from what has been said that men are not responsible for all their opinions . We may be responsible for other attributes of an opinion without being responsible for its error . Take an example . I institute an inquicy as to the mode of connection between the threepersons of the Trinity . I proceed in my investigation in a most careless and irreverent manner . I argue under the influence of passion , prejudice , and ambition-from these and other principles , I occasionally violate the fundamental laws of just reasoning-I reach , we will say , an erroneous result . I am culpable for the result : for its illegitimacy , its irreverence , its motive . Yet I may not be culpable for its erroneousness . For those , a heavy responsibility awaits me at the two-fold bar of the Divine administration-for this , perhaps none . If I had done my best from the outset of life , I might not have avoided the mistake . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible guiltless matter . So in proving that we are not responsible for all our errors , we have not proved that we are not responsible for all our opinions . We are so . Not a faith but challenges us to judgment-not a sentiment but is subpenaed to the trial of our characters . Each sentiment is voluntary-depending for its formation or retention on a variety of acts which we may do or not do as we choose . // Each sentiment has been formed under the inspiration of a Sincere desire to know the truth , or it has not -- under suitable efforts of every kind to know the truth , or it has not . Even the opinions to which we have been bred , are criticised by the balances of the sanctuary and born Moslem and Pagan , Christian and Jew , fall alike within the scope of a tekel which treats with equal respect the novelty of yesterday , and the heirloom of a hundred generations . Even all our mathematical conclusions have a moral character : and the mind of Euclid marched along its diagrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majesty along the highways of its splendid analysis , under the burdens of as actual a responsibility as oppressed the great St. Bernard in resolving cases of conscience . Birth and education do not force opinions : they only exert a powerful influence to determine them . The stringency of geometry on the mind never amounts to compulsion : it never does more than ensure a result which it can not necessitate . Its theorems are never launched upon us with such precision and force as neither to be missed nor repelled . A vicious mode of study , such as we may form if we will , is more than a match for the heaviest park of artillery . In fine , no conclusion whatever is reached except through the avenues of serious responsibilities . Some of its attributes are under the control of the will , if not its relation to truth . Neither does it follow from what has been said , that we are not responsible for vastly the greater part of our errors of opinion . We have surveyed three concentric classes of opinion . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views , for the error of which we are not responsible . We did not say how many . They may be as few as they are undesirable . They may resemble islets in the ocean , or planets in the skyseparated and almost absorbed by abysmal solitudes . We are inclined to think it is so . When I bring together all the errors I can remember in my own history , I think I can see how I might have avoided by far the greater part of them . When I recall the various mistakes which my friend has committed since I knew him , I think I can see how he might have done as much . And when I generalize my view so as to embrace all the mistakes which oppress an extended community , I find no difficulty in admitting that while many are unavoidable by those who commit them , as much can not be said of the most : that the number is comparatively small , which do not carry with them whither they go , the responsibility of an evil which could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition which our limits will allow : and it so happens that the chief lesson of our subject is so obvious , that but a single word is needed . They rend the mantle of charity who stretch it over all varieties of opinion . Within a certain range of which infidelity is the centre , we are at liberty to draw an inference from the state of the intellect , to that of the heart , and to esteem the faith of the errorist , as the errorist 's sin . But beyond this narrow and well-defined circle , our highest severity should recognize the possibility of mistake without blame  --  a recognition which should soften our tone toward all the evangelical sects , and abate for all the asperities of theological controversy .
