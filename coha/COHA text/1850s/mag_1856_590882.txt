YOUNG AMERICA ABROAD . OUR readers need not be reminded of the peculiar strength and ability of the articles signed " A. J. C. , " published in the Review . They are strong , clear , and striking in style and thought , and have been very widely copied . The author has prepared a work with the title at the head of this notice , a " specimen brick " from which we are allowed to present our readers . We have had the pleasure of looking through the whole work , and feel sure that when it is published it will have a marked success . INTRODUCTION . I STOOD on one of the highest peaks of the great Apalachian range of mountains , stretching my eye as far as possible in the direction of the western horizon across the mighty valley of the Mississippi . If the view itself was not the most extensive and the grandest in the world , it at least seemed to excite in the mind thoughts and images that were incomparably sublime , lofty , and magnificent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The immense region before me , bounded on the one side by the Rocky Mountains , and on the other by the great eastern range I have just mentioned , contained within its bosom the materials of a moral and physical creation like to which nothing had yet been noted on the pages of history . It was the cradle of a new world , about to unfold its resources on a scale of magnificence corresponding to the new era which is pointing with such emphatic promise to the future . It was the central stand-point of YOUNG AMERICA , rising in her giant strength amidst the unfolding energies of an age of wonders , and proclaiming to the nations of the earth the mighty part she was destined to fulfill in all time to come . What a wonderful anticipation of power and glory does this unbounded prospect call up to the human mind ! It passes before us in silent majesty and grandeur , like the bright forms that fell on the rapt vision of prophets and wise men in days of old . We gaze down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open like the skies above us , revealing the creations of a brighter and better state of existence . Science , art , invention , the proudest achievements of human genius , the highest attainments of the human intellect , all that is calculated to render life dignified and happy , the blessings // of freedom , of virtue , and religion-these form the bright and beautiful objects of that glorious vision . No wonder that we should fondly dwell on sights so pleasing and lovely , and should turn again with reluctance to the cold realities of our own passing and more vulgar times . Nor must we believe implicitly in the flattering dream that is so pleasing to our imaginations . It were presumptuous to suppose that happiness is designed for our own proud land alone . We should not indulge in the vain fancy that greatness is at any time exempt from care , that improvement is exempt from error , that the most perfect form of goodness is exempt from selfishness and infirmity . We should constantly remember that the highest state of worldly prosperity , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us regard the vision as fraught with the strongest incentives to industry and exertion , with the strongest persuasives to hope and encouragement . But at the same time let us not forget , that where much is accomplished , something must necessarily be lost and neglected , and that not unfrequently our extravagance and folly will be found to bear no small proportion to our intrepidity and success . It is so with individuals , and particularly with individuals who are youthful , forward , and inexperienced . It is often so with societies and nations , and will unquestionably be so for a long time to come with YoUNG AMERIcA . But I am looking across the great valley of the Mississippi , and will not suffer myself willingly to be deprived of the anticipated marvels which this mighty view suggests . What massy structures , what everlasting monuments , what splendid palaces , what grand institutions , what halls of legislation , what colleges , what temples ! Slowly they rise , one after another , to fill up and consecrate the vast extent of territory lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And yet this broad expanse of wealth and enjoyment , of moral grandeur and improvement , holds not alone the boundless treasures of this growing continent Far beyond these immense barriers , sloping down on one side to the deep Atlantic , and extending on the other to the broad Pacific , lie other portions of the same youthful country , equally fertile in resources , and growing , if not with the same rapidity , yet affording the same promise of one day astonishing mankind with a spectacle of moral and physical grandeur unparalleled in the world 's history . The mind feels bewildered and overawed in contemplating the boundless extent and capabilities of this wide-spreading continent . All that we read of in the history of ancient and warlike nations-all that we know of Egypt , Assyria , and Persia-all that we learned at school of the splendid triumphs of Greece and Rome-all that we have been taught to admire and study in the arts and elegancies of life , in the chaste embellishments of architecture , in the exquisite beauty of sculpture , in the dignified pursuits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the refined pleasures of music and painting-these are one day to fill up , and adorn , and make happy , the people that shall inhabit the immense territory that lies between the two mighty oceans we have mentioned . // Nor are these the only blessings that would seem to await the future generations inhabiting this mighty continent . Modern discovery and improvement will add a thousand-fold to the arts and enjoyments of the ancient world , and even to the measure of progress that has been reached in our own days . Agriculture , commerce , and manufactures , the skill of multiplying and refining the ordinary comfoAs of life , the already astonishing discoveries connected with the subjects of steam , of electricity , of chemistrymust be carried to still greater perfection , in order that mankind may reach the high destiny which the present progress of the world would seem to indicate . Add to all this a more liberal and just mode of thinking , a more rational philosophy , a more scriptural and charitable religion , a thousand new and surprising discoveries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future prosperity and happiness of this great and expanding country ? What a mighty achievement was the discovery of a new world ! And how remarkable it was that the inspired navigator whose soul seemed to be informed with an energy and wisdom not given to other men , should have been subjected to so much hardship and opposition , to so much persecution and neglect , in the attainment of his object , and that , blending the utmost spirit of Christian meekness with aa iron strength of purpose , scarcely ever before witnessed in the same individual , he should calmly and patiently have completed the work committed to him ! It was a sublime and noble work , and yet , like all other extraordinary achievements , its true import was hidden from the generation of mind in whose times it was performed . Even Columbus himself seemed but half persuaded of its vast practical issue , of the extent and importance of its moral grandeur and sublimity . We sometimes regret that a genius so prolific and so amiable , so full of resources , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet so sensitive , should not have been let into the full perception of the mighty consequences that were to result from his discoveries . Such a perception would have been a consolation to his heroic and struggling bosom . But the secret , for wise purposes , was reserved by Providence as an inscrutable mystery , and it is only now that its full import is about to be revealed to the world . To thine own proud genius , YOUNG AMERICA , we would erect no servile altars , and render no extraordinary homage . Thy merits so far as they may be discovered from thy works , are thus far but the mingling of good and evil in thy eager plans of social happiness . We believe that , with nothing to boast of on thine own part , thou hast been endowed with extraordinary* qualifications , and hast been blessed with uncommon advantages . We see in the enterprising promise of thy youth , the approaching development of a full and vigorous manhood . And yet thou hadst need regard with distrust thine own peculiar blessings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apt to create in thee an overweening presumption , the very conceit of thy great powers will lead thee into temptation . Nay , thou art // even now proud , and confident , and headstrong , and although thou hast not yet realized the full measure of thy strength , thou wouldst fain believe thyself grown to the perfect stature of knowledge and discretion . In the revolution of days , and years , and centuries , thou mayst indeed become great . Such would seem to be thy inevitable destiny . But so long as thy wisdom is incompetent to the task of guiding thee aright , so long as thy presumption outstrips the just proportion of thy deserts , so long wilt thou ever be running into trials and difficulties , which a gentler spirit and a more modest discretion might have avoided . May thy goodness and wisdom , and , in the mean time , as a necessary consequence , thy peace and prosperity , be equal to the greatness that awaits thee ! Such were the reflections that passed through my mind while standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended prospect before me . Reaching with my natural eyes from ocean to ocean across the great continent of America , I was at the same time pursuing with my spiritual sight the progress of its inhabitants , and their future works and history . But I very well know , that what they are to become hereafter , must greatly depend on what they are now . It was on this account that my mind was busy in tracing the peculiar characteristics of YOUNG AMERICA , in looking at her manners and institutions , in considering what the world thought of her , and in endeavoring to form something like an estimate of her true merits . While engaged in these contemplations , my spirit became wearied and exhausted , and whether I really fell asleep on the spot where I was standing , or was deprived of my powers of external sensation in some other way , I found myself suddenly shut out from the world around me , and seemed to pass through all the changes of the following curious dream or vision before I was again restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made for holding a splendid festival in Westminster Hall , in England , where all the nations of Europe and America were at liberty to be present or represented , and were to be convened for the purpose of exchanging with each other the civilities of a courteous and friendly intercourse . The festival was to be one of magnitude , affording every opportunity for social recreation and pleasure , especially for the benefits of conversation , and was to last three whole days . The hall was to be fitted up for the occasion in a style of splendor that had never before been surpassed . Its interior arrangements were to be adapted to the purposes of feasting , dancing , etc. , and were intended worthily to entertain so august and famous a company . A hundred flags already waved on the outside o the building , and were to welcome within its venerable walls the heads of as many kingdoms and nations . I imagined that the time had arrived for this splendid festival to be given at the place appointed . For some reason or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me very distinctly , I myself was invited , with several others , to become a part of the company , and to witness the ceremony and rejoicings of the occasion . A constant succession of arrivals took place from different quarters of the two hemispheres , and one after another the dignified visitors were received into the venerable building , until , the crowd having fully collected , I found myself an honored listener and spectator of this remarkable assemblage . At first it was somewhat difficult accurately to distinguish between the different personages who were present . But as the confusion of their first arrival subsided , and each one found his or her proper place , I was soon able to discriminate between the collected representatives of so many nations and kingdoms . It was remarkable that these were composed of an almost equal number of males and females , each nation being represented not according to the particular sex of its governing sovereign or ruler , but in agreement with some interior quality which predominated in the character of the people by whom it was inhabited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and England , in this particular , was entirely reversed . The first  --  the gay , the gallant , the LA BELLE FRANCE of former days of chivalry-was represented by a female of corresponding genius and manners ; whereas the nation of England appeared before the company in the sturdy and standing effigy of JOHN BULL , filling up the full measure of his bluntness and all his peculiarities . Many other nations were represented in the same way , making it evident , that instead of each independent sovereign or ruler appearing on the occasion in his proper person , it was rather the genius of his own people that was present . After the company had all assembled , and each one had found his am pointed place in the courtly hall , I could not help scanning the gay and busy multitude with some degree of interest and curiosity . It was a world 's convention , and a convention , too , not of subordinate and paltry individuals , but of mighty nations , of sovereign principalities , of independent republics , of old and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enlightening each other on the subject of social improvement , and ascertaining the true ends and purposes of government . Being well aware that they had these objects in view , and frying to ascertain the true character and genius of the several personages assembled , it can not be wondered at that I should have felt an irresistible curiosity to learn to what particular country each individual present belonged . A little inquiry soon put me in possession of the desired knowledge , so that I was able to point to each nation in the character of its delegated chief or representative . The distinguishing traits and peculiarities of some of these I will here endeavor to enumerate . Composing the central group of all , and arranged on royal seats placed near each other , were the three most enlightened nations of modern Europe - ENGLAND , FRANcE , and GERMANY . Next came the more free , but less // powerful , states of BELGIUM , HOLLAND , SWITZERLAND , and some other principalities of similar institutions and government . Then succeeded the independent nations of AUSTRIA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differing materially in the genius and temper of their political institutions , came RUSSIA , DENMARK , NORWAY , and SWEDEN . And last of all , TURKEY and GREECE were posted in the back-ground , as if hardly mingling on equal terms with their more powerful or more enlightened neighbors . The different states and provinces o* SOUTH-AMERIcA were in like manner huddled together by themselves in an obscure corner , at some little distance from the rest , peering at the brilliant circles before them , as if they were at a loss to understand their meaning and intentions , and sometimes frowning ill-naturedly at each other , as if only half resolved to live on terms of friendship among themselves . here and there seats remained vacant and unoccupied , caused by the absence of some who either had not yet arrived , or who had made up their minds not to come at all . But taken altogether , I thought it one of the most brilliant and imposing spectacles that had ever been witnessed by mortal eyes . As usually happens on occasions like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties who were collected together at this great festival . Each one was willing to show himself off to the greatest advantage , and in this endeavor was very apt to betray the peculiar characteristics of his own temper or disposition . JOHN BULL , as on all similar occasions , seemed resolved to put his best foot foremost . He was evidently , from every indication about his person , no longer young , and yet there was a floridness and hardihood in his countenance betokening how well he had worn in passing through the changes of a long and eventful life . It was plain that he was a gentleman of good sense and good breeding , but it was easy to see that these qualities were not always kept in healthy and vigorous exercise . Vanity , and a morbid fear lest he should not in all things command the honor and respect of the distinguished guests by whom he was surrounded , seemed to be his besetting sin , and this was evidenced in no small degree in the precise arrangement of his costume , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stars , and ribbons , and garters , not to mention the costly gems stuck in here and there without much regard to propriety or taste , some of them being too bright and glaring , while others were in the same proportion too mean and insignificant . But what I was most pleased with in the countenance of this celebrated personage , was his sterling benevolence , and his sincere concern to see all his friends around him comfortable and happy . So strong did this feeling on his part seem to be , that even in the manifestation of his greatest folly , when boasting of his own prowess , or recounting his own achievements , 14 // when admiring his stars and garters , or siyiy weIghing the Jewels that adorned his fingers , the moment a subject was mentioned , having for its end some scheme of practical good to others , he was sure to forget at once all about himself ; and to enter into the proposed measure with a heart as disinterested and as free as if he had never cherished a particle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been disposed to find fault with in the character of JOHN BULL , I was fully convinced that he was practically a benevolent person . With all this , however , he was not unfrequently reserved , anQ sometimes even melancholy and sour . And when he set his heart on an object , as for instance , on the acquisition of some particular toy , or the satisfying of some particular resentment , he was unreasonably self-willed too , and seemed obstinately bent on achieving his purpose , no matter at what enormous cost and sacrifice . But after having exercised enough of this kind of folly to support what he believed to be a proper degree of respectability and honor , he woul suffer his good sense again to take precedence of his vanity and selfishness , and would become immeasurably happy in the enjoyment of the plain , simple , and reasonable pleasures , that first came in his way . Tot the least of these was the study of philosophy and polite literature This was an employment in which he delighted exceedingly , and about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion . One of his favorite benevolent schemes  --  a scheme which he never lost sight of ; amidst the severest pressure of his own indebtedness and embarrassments - was that of bestowing a liberal patronage on the productions of men of learning and genius , and for the successful cultivation of the arts and sciences . And what recommended him still more to my notice , was , that he always spoke respectfully of*religion , never suffering it to be impugned in his presence without standing up in its defense , and declaring it to be the greatest security , as it was the greatest good of his country . Such were some of the peculiarities of character which I was intent on becoming acquainted with in the person of JOHN BULL . Of course I did not make this acquaintance in a single moment , or even in a single hour , but the knowledge grew on me as I watched more closely , and comprehended more fully , the true tendency and import of all that he said and did . That he was without faults , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . That these faults were serious , sometimes unpardonable , and often ridiculous , I was not long in perceiving and regretting . And yet , when urged by necessity to pass on him even the fairest and the mildest censure , his better qualities would constantly interpose between my temper and judgment , so that however much I was sometimes disposed to complain of his follies and absurdities , I could not in the end help exclaim-ing : " England , with all thy faults , I love thee still 1 " // interest his good nature or excite his anger , was LA BELLE FRANCE blazing before the whole company in all the smartness and finery of an accomplished female . She was not young , and yet her elegant person and interesting manners , her wit , her good humor , and her cheerfulness , seemed to make amends for the numerical abrasion of years which seemed somewhat to have disturbed the beauty and equanimity of her countenance . She looked like a person who had met with some troubles in life , but who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ill-fortune , to be happy . I did not judge that she was capable of any remarkable profundity of thought , although she set herself up for a great philosopher , and was constantly boasting of the zeal she entertained for the progress of truth , and of the affection she cherished for the whole human family . That she was sincere I had no doubt , but thought it was not difficult to discover the cause of her many mistakes and errors . The truth is , she was too careless and happy to apply herself closely to any pursuit that interfered seriously with her worldly pleasures ; I call them worldly pleasures , because little that was of a grave character seemed to please her taste , or to excite her attention . She walked erect , it is true , and sometimes assumed a port of uncommon grace and majesty , but seldom suffered her beautiful eye to pierce beyond the visible heavens . That was the secret of all her levity and all her rashness , of all her presumption and all her weakness , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the power by which she was able to dazzle and deceive others . She was confessedly superficial , but she was shrewd , witty , and cunning , and was never in a better humor than when she had silenced her adversaries by the grotesqueness of a lampoon , or the point of an epigram . The playfulness and buoyancy of her disposition made her exceeding fond of every thing that was showy and brilliant , from the coloring of a ribbon to a tippet of ermine , from the tinsel glitter of a lady 's fan to the jewel sparkling on the head of nobility , from the simple preparation of eau de Cologne to the precious ointment used at the coronation of kings and emperors . The truth is , LA BELLE FRANCE was something of what in America we call an exquisite , inordinately gay and glittering in her person , a little chivalrous and high-toned in her sentiments , and if not inwardly neat and clean in proportion to her outward love and display of ornament , at least a great admirer of external polish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semblance , if she could not produce the essentials , of pleasure ; and indeed her whole life lingered a good deal among the ideal and beautiful , making its happiness consist more in the enjoyment of the present moment , than in useless regrets for the past , or painful anxieties about the future . She found it far easier to do without her dinner than without music , to burrow in a cellar or starve in a garret , than to be without flowers ; and one of her greatest consolations was , that if she was frequently deprived of a meal at home , she was sure to find something better abroad , in plac*s // of resort that were equally accessible to the rich and the poor , to the great and the humble . LA BELLE FRANcE thought herself preLiminently the artilicer of her awn fortune . As happens with easy , careless people everywhere , she was by no means supremely selfish , and always expressed a reasonable concern for the web fare of those around her . Hence it happened that she was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal panacea must somewhere exist for all the evils and distresses of life She seemed to see with sufficient clearness that it was intended from the first that men should be happy , and she was sadly puzzled to know why they were not so . Hence originated her many contrivances , , some of them clumsy enough , for arriving at a point where the interests of humanity might be deposited with safety , and where something certain might be achieved for ameliorating the condition of the poorer classes of society . But like all her other efforts in behalf of the ordinary and vulgar blessings of life , she seemed willing to found her hopes and to build her promises on speculations that were deeply tinged with the lightness and extravagance of her own active imagination . Of course she was doomed to behold her expectations crushed by disappointment . She saw , or ought to have seen , that human happiness must be constructed on a more solid and rational basis than the fanciful arrangement of groups and series , and that the mere external order of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure to its possessors the blessings so much and so ardently desired . Nor did her views of political reform , in any essential particulars , differ from those which she entertained on the subject of the great moral reform she was anxious to secure to herself and to the world at large . They may in both cases be characterized by a single expression-they were too superficial . That men wore born to be free , that they ought to be free , are great truths , deeply and instinctively impressed on the human heart . We may see and understand this as plainly as we see and understand that two and two make four . But to see and understand in what true freedom consists is another and quite different matter . The French nation seemed to comprehend at a glance that liberty was beneficial , that it was practicable , that it was desirable . They regarded it as the great enlightener and sweetener of life , and were willing to bow down and worship it as a goddess . But the great mistake was in thinking too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means and not the end of government . When they persuaded themselves to worship this goddess , they carried their regards entirely too far , and by paying divine honors to the mere instrument , they wholly lost sight of the end for which it ought to be used . They soon found that their divinity was not so easily to be propitiated as they imagined . Just in proportion as they offered incense at her shrine , and became more devoted and enthusiastic , just in that proportion did she become proud , insolent , and intractable . They honored her too much , and she paid back their honor by // insults , by disorder , and by blood . They offered whole hecatombs at her altar , and the only return she condescended to make for so much idoLtry and flattery , was to subject them to the cruelest sufferings , and to the wildest anarchy . And yet LA BELLE FRANCE 15 not a personage lightly to be spoken of : If she lacks the ability and wisdom to make a proper use of freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all desire and all praise . Nay , she does more than reverence it , she loves it with an ardor that will not always go unsatisfied . She is like the exile banished from his native country , which he only admires with the deeper affection as he remains longer in a state of painful expatriation . And then her bravery and heroism are worthy of her love of liberty . She knows how to endure hardships and sufferings . She knows how to meet , without murmuring or shrinking , the greatest privations , as well as the most painful disasters . God grant , that , if she is doomed to suffer hereafter , she may learn how to suffer in a good cause . Now what I have just said , I seemed to think and believe of LA BELLE FRANCE , even while she stood before me in all the splendor , and gayety , and thoughtlessness of her own joyous nature . I forgot her faults-faults that the whole world has wept over-in anticipation of a glorious day of deliver .. ance , when her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall grow more rational and spiritual , when her public spirit shall become more enlightened , when her genius shall become graver and wiser , when her gayety shall become simpler and purer . And while watching the grace and alertness of her movements in that bright assembly , her faded but majestic features , her playful , half serious , but frank and open countenance , I was sure that she herself was looking forward to a more glorious future . Our next great star in the bright galaxy before me was GERMANY , accompanied by several lesser lights , that went to make up a mighty and flourishing empire . He made his appearance in the person of an elderly gentleman , with somewhat harsh and rugged features , an antiquated garb with little style or ornament about it , an air of deep abstraction seated in his countenance , and an expression as if he did not like to be disturbed in his meditations , and as if he really scorned , although he was all the time dreading , the approaches and interference of the company around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although no body seemed able to assign any good reason for it . To relieve himself from this embarrassment he would occasionally take snuff , besides which he was in the constant habit of retiring from the company for the purpose of smoking a long pipe , an indulgence in which it was said he very much delighted . At first sight , he might have been taken for an English antiquary , condemned by a singular eccentricity of taste or fortune to the solitary employment of hunting stones or fossils , and greatly less interested in the passin , g events before // him , than in contemplating geological eras , and changes that took place before the flood . But it might soon be discovered that the resemblance was only in the outward man , and that his real taste for the ancient and antique , unless it had relation to the musty books or manuscripts of some lumbering library , scarcely extended beyond the traditional history of a baronial castle , or the stories so graphically embodied in the Helden Buch , or connected with the halls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be called singular , or quaint , or old-fashioned , but in no sense of the word ancient , or unreasonably devoted to geological researches . He rather , perhaps resembled what we Americans have so tastefully popularized by the appellation of old fogy , that is , one who sticks to the good old customs and maxims of his ancestors , and who is a mortal foe to all disorganizing and modern innovations . But in another sense OLD TEUTON , as his companions called him , was a real antiquary . He delighted in polyglot books and libraries , and in the discovery and investigation of old moth-eaten manuscripts , especially if they were difficult of interpretation , and involved a question of obscure or doubtful meaning . He was certainly a great philologist . He would sit for whole days together , calculating the value of a single root , adjusting the proportions of a single termination , and deciding with the utmost gravity on the difference betwixt a learned tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee . All this seemed to be his vocation , and came to him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's milk . But there was another branch of learning in which OLD TEUTON excelled as much as he did in the study of philology  --  a study , indeed , with which it was closely connected . I allude to his character as a biblical critic and commentator . Whether , indeed , this branch of learning has added as much to his wisdom and understanding as it has to his reputation , may be a question of somewhat difficult solution . Doubtless he has thought much and written much on this grave and important subject ; but it would seem to be his peculiar misfortune to think and write on this subject , as on almost all others , in a style and manner peculiar to himself . He begins with the simple and practical-at least , that is always his avowed aim when questioned on the subject  --  but in the long run he is sure to embarrass and lose himself in the shadowy regions of the mystical and extravagant . The plainest lesson of wisdom , the most unadorned incident of a novel , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest theological and metaphysical truths , must be pushed out of clear sunshine into the twilight , if not the visible darkness , of a sphere lying beyond the confines of ordinary apprehension . Nay , it may be reasonably doubted whether OLD TEUTON , with all the fervor of his philosophy , and all the strength of his imagination to boot , is himself able to pierce the mystical clouds which , in almost every instance , he is sure to throw round the plainest and the choicest of his theories . Thus when Luther , the heroic monk , whose first movements // 1&amp;5*3. commenced in wielding the simple weapons of common sense against the abuses and follies of a superstitious age , had caused the hierarchies of a corrupt church to tremble and grow pale before the strength of his single rrn , he was not content to rest satisfied with the success of his first achievements , but must needs jeopard the mighty system of truth and reason he had been so nobly and so ably preaching and defending , by proclaiming to the world the irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder that the simple and triumphant conquests of his early manhood should afterwards have been well nigh lost and overwhelmed amidst the confusion which his doting fondness for a mystical dogma created . And this is the very spirit and embodiment of the Teutonic literature . It must all be comprised in a myth or a legend , which it will happen at last that nobody cares for because nobGdy nnderstands . The same mystical adumbration overshadows as well the schools of its philosophy as of its theology-as well the didactic teachings of its novels and fables s the sentimental beauty of its poetry . When Goethe wrote what he called " Das Miihrchen , " ( The Tale , ) and which the enthusiasm of his ountrymen has been pleased to designate as the " Tale of Tales , " it may be doubted whether one person in a thousand understood either its design or its imagery ; and yet all agree to praise it as a work of superior inspiration and genius . And perhaps , on the whole , it is not more mystical than the trancendentalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straus . Even the sublimated lawlessness of Moore , as depicted by Schiller in the " Robbers , " must find its model in the same school . So that the very students of Germany were foolishly seduced into a life of disorder and violence by listening to the dreamy conjurations of a philosophical bandit . How remarkable ! Luther , Goethe , Kant , Straus , and Schiller-all differing widely on the subjects on which they spent the force f their genius , and yet each one as inevitably travelling to a land of darkness and shadows , as if they had been harnessed together in the same team , and impelled forward in their course by the same driver . One is almost fraid to imagine whether the spirit that guided them was a spirit of good or of evil . But it would be unjust to say that OLD TEUTON , as a writer and philosopher , has done nothing to benefit the world at large . He is , after all , a scientific man ; and if we can only make up our minds merely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confine our wanderings in his company to this side of the clouds , we may reasonably hope that he will not only prove an enlightened and profitable companion , but a scholar of most rare and surprising attainments . Indeed , he is the very model of an industrious student : strong , persevering and determined-discouraged by no opposition , and overcoming all difficulties . No wonder that he should have brought off from the field of literature the spoils of a hundred conquests , which have justly acquired for him the admiration and envy of the workL // Nor while praising his scholarship would it be fair to forget the glory and superiority of his soldiership . I do not mean by this that war is at ny time to be named either as an art to be studied , or as an occupation to be followed . It is scarcely less barbarous in itself than the abominable practice of some of the German princes , of kicking each other on the shins , or pulling each other by the hair ; but it is entirely a more approved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for its observance , and I am afraid will continue to have it for some time to come . It is one of the greatest causes of popular enthusiasm , and is calculated to raise the feelings of a nation when nothing else wilL OLD TEUTON delighted in it formerly as one of his dearest , and what he believed to be one of hi noblest pastimes , and he is still ready to muster his ponderous strength in the same cause whenever legitimately summoned to do so . Perhaps he no longer enters into the service with the same eagerness and with the same extravagance . He may be no longer indulging a passion for men seven fcet high , ( by the by , in this particular , only carrying out something of that same spirit noticed above , ) or be desolating and impoverishing whole regions of country for the sake of glory alone . But he is , nevertheless , re* dy to don his cassock , and to march with the same pride and the sam alertness that distinguished him under the walls of Prague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosbach and Breslan.
