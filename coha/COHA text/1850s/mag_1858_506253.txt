STRAIN 'S GALLOP ACROSS THE PAMPAS. *JEN7DOZA-City of the Plain-is so cornLYLpietely hedged in with poplars that it can hardly be seen till one is aetnally in the streets . Having passed this barrier the traveler finds the suburbs pleasing . Instead of the poor and dilapidated tenements that usually snrround a city , pleasant cottages , shaded with trees and encircled by gardens filled with fruit or planted with clover , greet the eye on every side . Next morning after his arrival , Strain was informed by Frederico and his father-in-law that it would be necessary to visit the policeoffice , to have his passport visaed ; and , as a preliminary step , he must mount the devise of the Rosas party , which consisted of a red ribbon in the button-hole and on the hat . To this he stoutly objected ; but , on being told that without these badges he could not get access to the government-house , he reluctantly consented . Passing through some brigand-looking soldiers called the guard , he reached the Chief of Police , himself a fit person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He then pointed to his badges , and asked if he was expected to wear them . Being answered in the affirmative he remonstrated , saying that he was an American officer , and to wear the badges of one party made him a partisan , which was contrary to the instructions of his Government . He quoted international law , and tried in every way to induce him to change his determination . Finding that argument and expostulation were alike lost on him , he quietly took the ribbons from his hat and coat and flung them on the floor , saying , at the same time , that he would be obliged to him if he would make out his passport to Yalparaiso , whither he would return , and represent , through our charge des affaires there , to Rosas , that an American naval officer was forbidden by him from traveling peacefully through the Argentine provinces . This determination changed the position of affairs , and the Chief of Police said he would not insist upon it , but advised him to wear the devise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack him . Strain replied that he had * K THE DEYLSA. // no apprehension on that score ; and he was allowed to traverse the city , not only without the badges , but with a long beard , which had been proscribed because of its supposed resemblance to the letter U , which stood for the Unitarians , their enemies . His victory , however , cost him some inconvenience , for without the devise he could not enter a government office , and hence had to resort to a friend to get his letters from the postoffice . He staid a week in Mendoza , waiting for the arrival of a gentleman with whom he had agreed to cross the pampas to Buenos Ayres . He thus had leisure to study the habits of this isolated people . One could hardly be in a civilized city and yet more completely out of the world than in Mendoza . On one side stretches a plain nearly eleven hundred miles in extent , over which roam herds of half-wild cattle or wilder Indians , living on pillage ; and blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be traversed only on the backs of mules , through dangerous passes . With a mountain and desert on either hand , both equally difficult and dangerous to pass , its inhabitants can engage in but little commerce , and live a listless , lazy life . Sir Francis Head , in describing them , says : " Provisions are cheap , and the persons who bring them quiet and civil ; the climate is exhausting , and the whole population indolent . Miais que voulez vous ? How can the people of Mendoza be otherwise ? Their situation dooms them to inactivity . They are bounded by the Andes and by the pampas , and , with such formidable and relentless barriers around them , what have they to do with the history , or improvements , or the notions of the rest of the world ? Their wants are few , and nature readily supplies them . The day is long , and therefore , as soon as they have had their breakfasts , and have made a few arrangements for their supper , it is so very hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better ? " After dinner the stores and shops are closed , the streets are deserted , no one is moving , and the whole city , men and animals , are asleep , and the place appears like a city of the dead . The habits of the people are filthy , and often disgusting . Into the room in which Strain dined a bedchamber opened , with the bed unmade at meal-time , while dirty children rolled about on the floor among mangy dogs . His bed was not made nor the rooms swept during the whole week he remained there , except by himself . Disgusted with his quarters , he one day went to the Posada and ordered a meal , to see if he could not make a change for the better , but he found it still more repulsive . The room was dirty , while the young guacho who waited on him was loaded with filth . The ragged urchin bad , however , on his bare feet , a huge pair of jingling spurs , to show his gentility among the herdsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , his proper place being upon the back of a horse scouring the plains . The city contains about 12,000 inhabitants , bat offers nothing of interest except its Alameda , or public promenade , a mile long , and shaded by several rows of magnificent poplars , and cooled by a murmuring brook that flows along its margin . Formerly it must have been exceedingly beautiful , but it is now much neglected , and left untrimmed . Of a summer evensing it is crowded with people , and presents a lively and singular appearance . Benches made of mud are scattered round , on which men and women are sitting , smoking cigars or eating ices . Others are strolling up and down , under the shadow of the poplars , lulled by the murmur of the rivulet and cooled by its freshness , while at intervals a band of music strikes up some favorite air . But the most extraordinary part of this spectacle is presented by the number of women bathing along the margin of this promenade . Women of all ages , stripped naked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee-deep , with all the freedom and apparently unconsciousness they would in the most secluded retreat . The bent and shriveled figure of an old woman , the full , faultless form of a girl of eighteen , and the plump , chubby child , meet the eye at every step . Shakspeare says that " The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her heauttes to the moon . " But Shakspeare was not acquainted with thc ladies of Mendoza , nor their amount of prodigality . In broad daylight , morning and evening , men and women , naked , bathe with the coolest indifference together along the public promenade . To a stranger the scene is a most extraordinary one ; but the people of Mendoza regard it with the same indifference they would the bathing of so many children . It is their system to enjoy life , and the coolness of this mountain stream offers a strong temptation to them , weary and heated by the rummer sun ; but one would think they might find other methods of getting its benefits . Strain 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day he passed in Mendoza . About eight o'clock in the morning , while still in bed , a female servant brought him his tea in a small silver-mounted gourd , which he was expected to drink through a silver tube . He then rose , or took another nap till breakfast at ten . Between that and dinner he passed the time with an Englishman whom he found there , and a Scotch physician . After dinner , of course , the invariable siesta . Having no books to read , and the air without being intensely hot , there was nothing to do but take a nap also . He says : " After the siesta , and when the declining sun and the'afternoon breeze have made the temperature somewhat more bearable , I frequently rode in the suburbs , which are highly cultivated , and , being shaded by trees covered with vegetation , and abounding with vineyards whose vines bent beneath their // luscious loads , were really delightful . In these rides I sometimes called at a country house , where the richer denizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberal hospitality of the owners , drinking a glass of ca*ia with the father , smoking a cigarito with the ancient matrons , whom I astonished by the length of my beard and the extent of my travels , ' and listening to the wild , though pleasing and plaintive songs of the seiloritas , who , accompanying themselves on the guitar , sung without being pressed , and without the array of maudlin excuses so common in some other countries hoasting a higher degree of social refinement , and rightly considering that they were conferring upon me a favor for which I ought not to he expected to importune them . Returning from my ride I visited some families with whom I had become acquainted , and was almost invariably entertained with music , tea , and cigars . No excuse , apology , or invitation is considered necessary should the guest during his visit wish to smoke . He simply takes out his cigarito , and either striking a light with the flint and steel , with which every one is provided , or receiving one at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were a matter of course . The older ladies will frequently join him , or , perhaps , take the initiative ; hut the younger ones seldom smoke , at least in company with strangers , being aware that it is not considered comme ilfaut ' in all parts of the world . Among the more refined in the city it is necessary to ask for a national song to have it sung , as Italian operas have banished them almost entirely from the drawing-rooms , and I have been surprised to hear cavatinas and arias from even the most recent operas in this remote city , where so few other elements of European refinement have found their way . French and Italian dances and songs are as familiar as household words , where the substantial improvements of the Anglo-Saxon race are considered almost in the light of pleasing pictures . While in the country , the same ladies who would accompany the music of Bellini , Rossini , or Donizetti , on the piano , will take up a guitar and sing their Spanish songs without a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not always distinguish musical amateurs . The Spanish voice I can not consider nausical , as there is almost invariably something narsh in its tones-whether due to the character of the indigenous music , or some peculiar construction of the larynx , I am not able to pronounce , though , on account of its universality , I am inclined to the latter opinion . Among the ladies with whom I became acquainted in Mendoza were some fair specimens of the mezzo-soprano voice ; and one , particularly , sung the beautiful barcarole from Marino Faliero with a taste and execution I have seldom heard surpassed . My evenings were generally passed at the house of the ex-Governor , Don Tomas Godov Cruz , who gives tertulias every evening , to which his acquaintances , male or female , come or not at their discretion , invitations once given being considered as extending ad infinitum '  - -  an arrangement which possesses its peculiar advantages for the few strangers who may find themselves in Mendoza . On Snnday evening the rooms are generally full ; while any evening there is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while Don Tomns entertains his male guests in his sanctum adjoining with ca*ia , cigaritos , and cake . " At length , on the evening of the 12th of March , Strain learned that Seilor M , who was to he his companion across the pampas , had arrived the night before . He immediately called upon him , and , to his surprise , found him entirely changed in his demeanor . He made no apology for not notifying him of his arrival ; could not tell when he should be ready to leave ; in short , treated the whole matter cavalierly . The same evening Strain met him again at the house of Don Tomas , where he set himself up for an oracle ; talked loud and in an overhearing manner , to which the Mendozans present suhmitted meekly . This puzzled him , and made him not a little anxious to know more of his history before trusting himself in his company in the long journey across the pampas . No one knew where he was horn , though he hailed from Buenos Ayres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe hy the people of Mendoza , because they suspected him of being a secret agent of Rosas . Having learned thus much , Strain called on him again to ascertain when he proposed to start . The Se ? ior quietly informed him that he had concluded to postpone their departure for some days ; kindly promising , however , to give him timely notice . He added , by-the-way , in the most indifferent manner , that he had changed his plan of traveling , and that they would cross the plains in a carriage instead of on horseback ; and , without asking him to he seated , remarked that he was then busy , but would be happy to see him at dinner , and dismissed him with a graceful bow . Strain was so completely taken aback by the coolness and assurance of the whole proceeding that he departed without uttering a word . Arriving at the house of a friend , he asked for pen and paper , and politely informed the Seiior that the mode of travel he had selected was different from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pleasure of his society during the transit across the plains in the carriage , as he should start with the Government courier on horseback in the morning . To carry out this hasty determination required activity . He first saw the courier , who agreed to take him through for forty-five dollars , and pay all charges for horses and food . This was reasonable ; for he would have to pay about twenty dollars for post-horses , leaving him only twenty-five to meet the expenses of Strain 's food and reimburse himself . Having arranged this satisfactorily , he got new reins for his bridle , a pair of holster-pistols , and a pair of ch*fres , or bullock-horns , in which to carry // water or spirits , as circumstances required . Having completed his preparations , he went to take leave of Don Frederico . He found him quite ill in bed , hut not so sick as to be unable to look after his own interests . The fellow made not the slightest allusion to the money he had borrowed , but uttered a casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leagues in the country . " Oh yes , " replied Strain ; " those mules , you will please send them to my friend the doctor . " He was caught at last . Having charged Strain fifty dollars for them , when they were worth but thirty , he had sent them into the country out of the way , so that at his departure they would revert to him by default . There was not much affection wasted in this leave-takin* , . With his pretty little wife , however , Strain parted far more cordially . He esteemed her for her unvarying amiability and gentleness , while he felt a deep sympathy for her in being tied for life to such a selfish , unscrupulous scoundrel as Don Frederico . As he turned away he thought to himself , " Alas ! poor girl , you , too , have been dealing in animals ; but when you eventually discover the fraud , you will find it more difficult to dispose of your bargain than I do in getting rid of my mules I ' It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Doctor 's house to take his long-delayed dinner . Before sitting down , however , he gave him a written order for the mules , which the latter had the shrewdness to send round immediately for Don Frederico 's acceptance . After dinner the hours passed swiftly in conversation , until , nt length , Strain remarked that he must get some rest for the next day 's journey . To this the Doctor would not listen ; be could not let go of the only link which connected him with his home ; and bringing a new supply of cigars , proposed to finish the night . Not many weeks after this the kind Doctor was found murdered in his bed . At daylight Strain repaired to the place appointed to meet the courier , and found him and the postillion , with the horses saddled and bridled , waiting for him , With an affectionate adieu to his friends he turned away , and , striking into a gallop , soon left the ancient city of Mendoza behind him . The wind blew fresh and free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that he had entered upon a new existence , he dashed on at a rapid pace . About nine miles from Mendoza they stopped to obtain regular post-horses . The party consisted of three . The Government courier was a man about fifty , tall audwell-made , though heavier than one would expect in a person who for eighteen years had every month rode , at a furious gallop , eleven hundred miles . His dress was a jacket and trowsers , varied occasionally by the chiripe  --  a square piece of red flannel tied around the loins , and worn over white cotton drawers , fringed with lace at the bottom . He wore a Panama hat , while a cartrid*e belt , fastened by Mexican dollars for buttons , and ornamented with sixteen more , encircled his waist . A poncho , holster-pistols and a silversheathed knife completed his equipment . The dress of the postillion was similar in style , though far inferior in quality . The duty of the latter was to return at each station with the horses , and to carry the mail portmanteau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of Strain 's spare clothing . The courier had stowed the latter away in the beg for convenience , which made such an extraordinary bulky mail that each postillion in turn expressed his astonishment , and wondered what the Mendozan Government was communicating to Buenos Ayres , which made it the heaviest mail that had traversed the country since the last Unitarian pronunciamiento had carried consternation through the provinces . Strain wore a slouched felt hat , light woolen frock coat , gray lancer trowsers , and carried a poncho and pair of pistols . After a few hours ' ride he and the courier became sworn friends , which desirable state of things was doubtless much facilitated by the gift of a poncho to the latter on ' starting , with two thick blankets in perspective at the end of the journey . During the morniug , having evidently given the important subject due reflection , the courier drew rein for a moment , and , dropping ' alongside of Strain , gravely defined their respective positions . He said , being a Government officer , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but would call him companero ( companion ) . Strain was , however , always to have the second best horse , the first cut of the roast , the first drink at the cliifre , and not be at the trouble of saddling and bridling his animal , which the courier himself would see to . In conclusion , he told him that in case he , Strain , was sick , the mail could not be detained ; but gave him to understand that they both , undoubtedly , would be sick or fatigued at the same time . Having arranged these preliminaries to the satisfaction of all parties he gave his horse the spur , and away they went at a tearing gallop . Thus far , the plains were well watered and tilled . A little after noon they arrived at the house of a friend of Don Antonio , the courier , who humanely suggested that , it being the first day , they had better take a siesta , and finish the day 's journey in the cool of the evening . Not having slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a little rest , and , throwing himself on a bed , was soon fast asleep-not before , however , he heard Don Antonio say to his friend that he was afraid his companero would not stand the fatigue of the journey . He afterward learned that , while he was asleep , the two friends held a sort of coroner s inquest over his body , and it was . decided that it would be impossible to carry him much farther , at the rapid rate Don Antonio was compelled to travel . When they had again mounted , no traveler , with a long and severe journey before him , ever examined more carefully // the withers and wind of his horse than did Antonio the expression of Strain 's countenance , the state of his eyes , and the bend of his back . He seemed surprised at the state of things ; and , brightening np at the result , shouted out , " Pega fuego al campo ! " ( " Set fire to the plain ! " ) and , dashing his spurs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Past pleasant cottages-past the cultivated fields-over streams and plains gallop , gallop , without drawing rein they kept on , till , at sunset , they dashed into the little village of Retama , where Don Antonio proposed to wait till the moon should rise . The postmaster was a magistrate , and having some legal case to decide , his court-yard was filled with guachos , who , with their ponchos , long spurs , and dogs , presented a motley a-nd wild appearance . The postmistress , to whom Don Antonio had given a glowing description of Strain 's rank and importance , took the latter into a garden and regaled him with fruit and flowers . After he had returned to the house , in passing through one of the rooms to get a light for his cigar , he saw two pretty sefioritas , and learned from them that there was to be a fandango in the evening . He resolved to be present ; and , by way of preparation , wrapped himself in his serape , and lay down on the piazza for a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voices of the fair sefioritas , but by the rough call of Don Antonio , who informed him that it was after midnight-that the moon was up , and the horses saddled and ready to start . Strain , whom this first fierce day 's ride on the top of a sleepless night had shaken up badly , and who would have given a year of life for every hour of sleep he could have had between that and morning , roused himself *rith difficulty , and looked out-upon the still moonlight , half repenting that lie had undertaken such a fatiguing journey . - He had lost both his supper and his fandango , neither the music nor the dancing being able to disturb his profound slumber . Mounting fresh horses , and striking into a gallop , they soon left the sleeping village behind them , and swept on through the open country , the steady stroke of their horses ' hoofs being the only sound that broke the stillness of the night . By daylight they had made nearly forty miles . Stopping at . Santa Rosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate and a cigar , while the peons were bringing round fresh horses . The one selected for Strain was a noble animal , and in fine condition . Prancing up to the door , he stood stamping and neighing , as if impatient of the bridle and spur , to which he evidently had not been long accustomed . It took two men to hold him while Strain mounted ; and when , at Don Antonio 's shout , " Fire the plain ! " they gave him the rein , he dashed off like a bolt from the string . He was unused to the spur , and so keenly sensitive to the indignity of the whip , that if Strain but lifted his hand to tighten his hat upon his head , he would give a sudden bound that nearly unhorsed his rider . Generous , full of courage , and with the endurance of an Arab steed of the desert , he flew over the plain , carrying his rider at a bounding gallop forty miles without being touched with whip or spur , without a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . It seems almost incredible that a horse could possess such endurance , but some of these pampa horses have the bottom of a full-blooded Arabian . Strain , who had never seen a horse with such speed , endurance , and withal easiness of gait , felt a warm attachment for him , and would have brought him home had it been possible , if for no other ptirpose than to save him from the ignoble life to which he was destined , it seemed cruel to permit so generous and noble a spirit to be broken down with overtasking and with the whip and spur . Four dollars would have purchased him , but the attempt to bring him off would have been preposterous . Arriving at Dormida , they intended to take fresh horses and push on without breakfasting , but were prevented by the arrival of another party from the opposite direction . It was composed of two men , one a German and the other a Yankee . To the latter , Strain , without informing him of his own nationality , addressed a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replying as well as he could in his broken Spanish . His surprise was unbounded when Strain told him that he was an American and an officer in the navy . Of course they fraternized at once , and having determined to breakfast together , sat down to a cigar and entered into a lively conversation . Strain , who supposed his countryman must of course be some devoted man of science , exploring this almost terra incognita , or an enterprising traveler in search of adventure , was astonished beyond measure when the latter told him that he was a traveling agent for Brandreth 's pills . He felt for a moment as if he had taken a dose himself , and internally consigned both Brandreth and his pills to a very uncomfortable locality . Once in 1843 and 1844 , in Brazil , he had , with immense labor and fatigue , in imminent peril of his life , penetrated the wilderness of Saint Paul far beyond all fi*rmer travelers and all civilization , and returned to the settlements with the complacency of a man who had performed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pushed only one hundred and fifty miles beyond Brandreth 's pills . And now to find , not merely the pills , but a live agent in the interior of Mendoza , was too sad a disappointment . With fear and trembling he modestly inquired if he knew any country where those pills had not gone , intending to mark it down for his next explorations , but could obtain no satisfactory reply . Notwithstanding the sudden fall to Strain 's expectations they passed a pleasant hour together . To his great regret he saw that - the agent was to ride back the noble horse which had carried him so gloriously over the plain , and that , too , in the middle of the day . This // is one of the advantages of traveling with the courier - he is always furnished with fresh horses . The country through which they rode to-day was covered with low bushes , more broken , and intersected here and there with ravines , which , with the heat of the day , made their progress slower . Still by three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cero Costo , where they concluded to stop for the night , consisted of three houses built of adobe with clay floors . After supper they made their beds in the cool air of the court-yard , using their saddles for pillows . At half past two , however , the apparently never tired Don Antonio roused Strain with the announcement that the moon was rising . In half an hour they were in the saddle and galloping over the broken country , which had now become sterile and stony , looking as if it might have been the ancient-bed of a sea . The morning ride was monotonous and stupid , broken only by the sudden whirr of a pheasant or the rush of an ostrich from his cover , and it was with feelings of relief Strain saw the light of dawn streaking the eastern edge of the plain . At sunrise they crossed the River Disaguadero , the boundary line between San Luis and Mendoza . This stream is narrow but deep , and being the outlet to one of the salt lakes of the interior , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they reached the post-house , which was nothing but a miserable hovel built of twigs and covered with clay and roofed with long grass . It contained but one room , and had so many openings to the outer air that all privacy was out of the question . The inmateS consisted of an old woman , a ragged , dirty peon , who was to act as postillion the next stage , and a nut-brown girl of some sixteen summers . The latter was one of those examples of the prodigality of nature in lavishing beauty where it is worthless . This young creature , just budding into womanhood , possessed analmost faultless form . The whole contour of . person and features was superb . She wore nothing but a sort of chemise which covered scarcely a third of her person . With her brunette complexion , set off by large lustrous eyes , over which drooped long lashes , her regular arched brows , wealth of hair , and perfect teeth , she was very beautiful notwithstanding her ragged , dirty garment and dirtier person . Transplant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and before long she would be a reigning belle in any city . The matchless form and beauty for which others would give a fortune - is as useles5 to her as the shoes she discards . Notwithstanding the poverty-stricken aspect of the place , the courier said the family owned some five thousand head of cattle and eight hundred brood mares . The breakfast was in keeping with the house , and even the water , to complete the whole establishment and system , was so brackish as to be hardly drinkable . The horses , too , which were brought out for the next stage , did not disgrace the hovel and fixtures , for they presented a most forlorn and half-starved appearance . Strain 's spirits fell at the sorry spectacle , but the courier evidently expected it , and without saying a word commenced to saddle up , simply indicating what his feelings were by a prolonged and melancholy whistle . As these animals were scarcely able to carry the riders a spare one was obtained for the mail-bag . They did not start off as usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire to the plain 1 " was not heard from Don Antonio . The wind blew in gusts over the sterile plain , and the whole aspect of the region was desolate and dreary . The only relief to the eye was the blue mountain of San Luis , which was now just above the horizon , and which was to be the terminus of the day 's journey . They had traversed only some twelve miles of this barren , inhospitable count.ry when the heat became intense , while neither whip nor spur could goad Strain 's horse into a gallop . A little farther on and the horse carrying the mail-bag broke down , and was abandoned . During the fore part of the journey occasional habitations were passed , where brackish water , taken from stagnant pools and filled with animalcuhe , could be obtained . But for twelve miles toward the latter end it was an arid desert . The sun came down with scorching power at mid-day , and , between the intense heat , the constant use of his spur and whip , Strain became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun seemed , as they viewed it from a gentle swell , like a vast expanse of water . For the first and only time they rode into post on a slow trot , the whole party , men and animals , being dead beat  --  the poor horses especiallyand looking-as if they would never post another traveler . San Luis being only thirty miles distant , with the prospect of good horses the balance of the journey , they , after eating their fill of peaches , indulged in a siesta by stretching themselves on the floor in the midst of a dozen lazy , dirty , reckless , * gentlemanly- guachos . The reader need not smile at the strange association of the word " qentlemanly " here , for there is under all the rough exterior , ignorance of book learning , and - of the refined customs of society , a natural politeness , ease , and unassuming independence in these wild herdsmen of the plain that entitle them to the appellation . Darwin , the learned geologist , when in this region , noticed this peculiarity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , though a guacho may rob you or cut your throat , he always appears to be  --  a gentleman . It must not be inferred from this , however , that they are robbers and cutthroats , for theyare neither . In battle they are - ferocious , and- their cruelty to animals is proverbial , but they are not banditti : on the contrary , life and property are both as safe in their hands - as in that of any other class of men . Personal quarrels they always settle with knives , never with the fist . Sir Thomas Head said // he invariably cocked his pistol when he met a guacho ; Strain , on the other hand , always unslung his ch*fre , gave him a drink , and chatted on the products and condition of the country . The number of guachos on the plains is comparatively small , and they are scattered far apart . Nothing can be more independent and wild than the life they lead . Many of them are descended from the noblest families of Spain , and still , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Castilian blood . Their dwellings , however , are mere mud-hovels , which they inhabit , generation after generation , without even thinking of adding any improvement . There is but one room in the guacho 's house , which the parents , grown-np young men , and daughters , and children , and dogs , occupy together . There is no such thing as privacy . Being built of mud , low , and thatched with the long yellow grass of the plain , one can distinguish them but a short distance . These are so filled with fleas and bugs that , in the summer , the whole family sleep out of doors . If a traveler arrives at night he unsaddles his horse , and , taking the saddle under his arm , walks among the sleeping forms and stretches himself beside the one he prefers , whether it be an old man , old woman , or a fair young seiiorita . He can ascertain , however , the sex and age only by their feet and ankles  --  the rest of the body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover them . For chairs they use the skeleton of a horse 's head , though these are mostly kept for guests , the inmates themselves preferring the mud floor on which , in winter , they lie rolled up in their blankets , looking like so many dark bundles scattered round . The wild life of the guacho begins with his birth . For the first year he is kept entirely naked , and crawls around in the dirt , or hangs , swung to the roof of the hovel , in a bullock 's hide . As soon as he can walk he has a little lasso made of twine , with which he toddles around after the chickens and dogs . By the time he is four years of age he is put on horseback , and makes himself useful in driving the cattle home . As he grows older , he hunts the ostrich , the lion , and the tiger , being often absent several days alone . Living on beef and water , and in the open air , he acquires a constitution tough as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wild and free as the ostrich he pursues . He never , except by chance , sees a doctor , and a broken bone and an ugly wound has to cure itself as it best may . He regards the back of a horse as the ' legitimate place of man , and to walk voluntarily any distance degrading . His wants are few and easily supplied , and yet he is not indolent . He is always hospitable , exceedingly polite and courteous to his guest , rising as he enters and offering him the skeleton of a horse 's head with the grace , and ease , and empressement that he would a throne . They never fail , when entering each other 's forlorn hovels , to take off their hats with as much formality as if entering a saloon filled with ladies . The women , on the contrary , are indolent , and they can not be otherwise . They have no house and furniture to take care of , but few garments THE TIRED HORSES . // to make ; in short , literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducement to walk , while the men do all the riding . They all of them have families whether they are married or not , and often , when the traveler innocently inquires of a young sei*orita , who is the father of the child she is carrying in her arms , he will receive the naive reply , " Who knows ? " At three o'clock , with fresh horses , they started off to the old shout , " Set fire to the plains ! " The peak of San Luis , thirty miles distant , was their landmark as they galloped over the sterile plain . The country was generally covered with bushes , and the soil sandy and barren . They saw hut two dwellings the whole distance , and these squalid and miserable in the extreme . At one o'clock they stopped and asked for some water , which was handed them , by a young girl , in a cocoa-nut shell : she was extremely beautiful , like the one they had seen in the morning , and like her also , was clad in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pity that so much natural beauty should not be joined to cultivation and refinement . Just as the sun was setting his rays flashed on the spire of a church of San Luis : it was , however , still some miles distant , and darkness was shrouding the landscape when they galloped through the streets to the fonda , having made in all one hundred and five miles . The keeper of the fonda was a Frenchman ; and there was an air of neatness and cleanliness about it which furnished a delightful contrast to Strain 's experience of the last two weeks . The water , too , was sweet and clear as if drawn from a mountain stream , and was doubly grateful to them from having subsisted so long on brackish or stagnant water . After a supper of beef and chicken , Strain retired to his room to have a quiet time over his cigar . But he had hardly seated himself before he was interrupted by half a dozen visitors , who , hearing that a traveler had arrived by post , called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an Italian , and a Spanish Basque . The German was the chief spokesman , and informed him that he had come out from Europe to superintend glass-works which were to be established in Santiago , but fell through for the want of action on the part of the Chilian Government . He stated also that he had recently visited California , and , not suspecting that Strain had just arrived from there , answered his questions unsuspiciously , giving elaborate descriptions of places which had no existence except in his own imagination . He and the Basque were about to visit Buenos Ayres on the horses of the latter , from whence he had promised to obtain funds to take them both to the land of gold . The next time Strain saw him-some weeks later-he was flying from that same Basque , whom he had cheated of his horses and robbed of his money . Here they were detained three days by the Governor , who was making up dispatches for the Government of Buenos Ayres . The first day being excessively warm , Strain did not venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed most of the people sitting at their doors enjoying the cool air of the evening . The city is regularly laid out in squares , most of the houses , like those of Mendoza , having a garden attachSAN LUI5. - *ETUUN OF TH* vIDETTEs. // ed to them surrounded by a sombre gray wall . They are of one story , in some cases tiled and whitewashed , but by far the greater part are thatched , and retain the natural color of the adobe . The floors are of pounded dirt or halfburned tile , which , though cool , are always dirty . The inhabitants number about one thousand , but there is not a doctor among them . They live in the middle of this vast plain almost as secluded as those of Mendoza at the foot of the Andes . Scarcely a person in it has any definite idea of the United States ; indeed , the body of the people here in the interior of South America are not aware of the existence of the " model Republic , ' which , by its example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sway and rendered them free . The few American travelers they see they call English-Americans . A Cordovesian. shop-keeper , whose acquaintance Strain made the day after his arrival , called in the evening to introduce him to some of the kant ton of San Luis , which are composed entirely of merchants and shop-keepers . The house which they first visited , though occupied by a leading family , was not even comfortably furnished . They were nshered into a large room , with bare walls , the furniture of which consisted of a few dilapidated looking chairs , a small table , with two tallow candles upon it , whose feeble light served scarcely more than to make the darkness visible . Soon after two ladies entered , sisters , who were well dressed , showy , and good-looking . After some little conversation , they and the husband of one of them kindly proposed to call on some other families . At the first house they visited were a recently-married couple on their way from Achiras to Mendoza . In conversing with the bridegroom Strain , to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with that recklessness characteristic of the nation , had strayed off into this remote , almost unknown , region . He was a printer by trade , and went in one of our sloops-of-war to the coast of Peru . Leaving the ship , he established a small printingpress . He prospered for a time , but losing his money , eventually drifted over the Andes to Mendoza . Here he adopted that last resort of the Yankee when every thing else fails , and turned schoolmaster . In progress of time , having made himself useful to the authorities as a printer , he again got " ahead , " and sent home for some inferior printing-presses , , which he disposed of advantageously to the provincial Governments , and was now sufficiently wealthy to indulge in the luxury of a wife . In the next house they visited were two young ladies who sangfor them , accompanying themselves on the guitar . Strain jots down : " The songs were all national , and so peculiarly plaintive that I could almost imagine it a dirge over their unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no Italian music .. Refinement , in that respect as well as some others , has marched through San Luis , on its way to Mendoza , without halting . The standard cause of complaint among the ladies here , as elsewhere in the Argentine provinces , is want of beaux ; war and its attendant proscription , and emigration , having thinned off the young men . On this subject I obtained from my lady friends statistics upon which the reader may confidently rely . In the city of San Luis , containing one thousand inhabitants , there are only tea eligible young men ! And ladies Oh Dios ay mac/ins ! ' which would certainly make it a somewhat desirable place to hang up one 's hat , as political economy teaches that commodities are valued less in proportion to their intrinsic value than their scarcity . At a late hour we returned whence we had started with our lady friends , and , after hearing from them a song or two , I retired to my/bnda with the pleasing consciousness of being able to number among my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The next evening his friend called with an invitation from the ladies they had last visited the evening before , , to a tertulia . The house was a short distance out of town , and upon their arrival they found some thirty ladies and about half as many men assembled , who , as well as the host and hostess , welcomed them with a cordiality quite refreshing in these days of stiff ceremony . Most of the young men belonged to the National Guard , and were dressed in red jackets and white trowsers , which gave a lively appearance to the room . The women , on the other hand , seemed to have studied how they could dress most unbecomingly and out of all taste . They exhibited the extremuly short waists of our grandmothers , with still longer skirts . They also , like more cultivated ladies , had made use of ingenious mechanical contrivances to obtain the precise shape in which they considered nature should have formed them , but evidently had not selected a Venus de Medici for a model . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had with great effort become round-shouldered , and tortured themselves to obtain flat chests , which gave them the appearance of troopers in disguise as they moved about in the dance . Although such an uncouth costume would test any ordinary beauty , they , independent of this , as a body , were exceedingly plain , there being no beauties , and only a few good looking . They were , however , frank , kind , and amiable , and made Strainthe lion of the evening ; while the men , individually and collectively , insisted on taking cana , or Brazilian rum* with him . The music was a guitar , sometimes accompanied by the voice , while the dancers frequently imitated the castanet with their fingers . Between each dance the men took a little rum , which they good-naturedly shared with the outsiders who were assembled to look Oil ; The rum exhilarated them , and late in the evening the men proposed the dance of the viejas ( the old women ) , and with a shout each man jumped forward and seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although some , especially those that were fat , resisted stoutly for a // while , eventually all were compelled to yield , and amidst peals of laughter the music was called for . Up struck the guitar , and instantaneously all the male voices joined in with a wild " tra la rn , ' 7 and off went the old ladies , whirled and swung around the room , laughing with the merriest at each other 's strange antics . The apartment rung and echoed with the uproarious shouts and almost hysterical mirth of the spectators . This dance , with the jokes that followed , finished the evening 's amusements , and the party broke up , the gentlemen accompanying the ladies in a mass to their homes . The next day , March 20 , being still delayed by the Governor , Strain kept in his hotel ; the ordinary routine of which was broken at dusk by the arrival of a traveler . Curious to know who he might be , he sent for the major-domo , who proved as ignorant as himself ; but said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little baggage , and common mules not much larger than rats . The next morning he learned that the newcomer was a Pole , and , moreover , afire king , who had come to San Luis for the purpose of giving a performance in that line as well as to exhibit feats of strength . Learning that he spoke English , Strain called on him , and found him like most other adventurers , but felt his heart warm toward him when he ascertained that he had not only passed several years in the United States but had spent some days in his own little town of Springfield , Ohio . They had not been acquainted an hour when the Pole informed Strain that his finances were at dead low water-mark ; in fact , that he had not a single ycal in the VOL XVJL-No. 102. -3 C world , while he owed an ounce to the peon who had brought him and his baggage from San Juan . Strain furnished him with some money , when he went out to make preparations for his performance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter said that , after making very accurate calculations , he had come to the conclusion that the population of San Luis would not pay the necessary expenses of getting up a performance and leave any thing for himself . Strain then asked him if he was a good rider , and could endure fatigue . He assured him he could ride like a Bedonin , and was as hardy as a guacho . Strain then offered to cancel all his liabilities , and take him at his own expense to Buenos Ayres . lie was overflowing in his acknowledgments - said that a single performance there would enable him to return the money ; in short , he could easily get an advance from the manager of the theatre . Stopping short his protestations of gratitude , Strain took him to the Governor , and asked the latter as a favor to make out hispassport for the morning . After some abortive attempts at a joke at the profession of his protege , he ordered the secretary to make it out . He next visited Don Antonio , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose food and horse-hire he would pay for . The latter yielded with a bad grace and with many significant shrugs and shakes of the head , declaring that he was too kind-hearted and would certainly be imposed upon . His consent , when finally given , was under a formal protest . On settling his bill with the keeper of thefonda , Strain found that he latLr had charged him a quarter of a dolDANCE OF THE vIEJAs. // qwq his determinations so eloquently that the courier agreed to stand by him-they would run first , but if overtaken , fight to the last . This compact being made , Antonio , while on a full gallop , stretched out his hand to ratify it . It was not worth while to bring in the postillion , as he would leave them at the next stage . It was then proposed to include the Pole in the arrangement , but on consultation they concluded no dependence could be placed in him , and he was left out . Scrutinizing every moving object they could descry in the distance , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut out every thing from view . They were still some nine or ten miles from San Josi de Moro , where they were to stop for the night , and as the darkness increased they became still more anxious , and listened for every sound . Plying whip and spur they passe4 over the ground rapidly , and about an hour after dark dashed into the town , which was garrisoned by some two hundred soldiers . The Pole had stood the day 's ride better than they expected ; and satifying their hunger on some beef hastily roasted on the embers , they spread their beds outside the door , and soon forgot both the Indians and their fatigue in the deep sleep of the weary man . At an early hour the next morning Antonio roused them from slumber , but still delayed setting out , as he wished to wait until the night patrol of cavalry returned , to ascertain if the Indians were about . Strain , however , prevailed on him to saddle up , and at early daylight , before the bugles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gates of the town . The air was cool , the horses fresh , and they pushed on at a furious pace , meeting no one except occasionally a lancer slowly returning from his post which he had occupied as vidette during the night . It was still comparatively early in the morning when they reached Portozuelo , twenty-one miles distant . A short distance of stony road , and then they crossed the boundary line of the province , and passed into Cordova , and fifteen miles farther on entered the little mud town of Achieas , where they breakfasted . It was here the American printer whom Strain had met at San Luis married his wife . The latter had the curiosity to visit the house , and as he sat on a seat in one corner of the room , and gazed round on the naked mud walls , mud floor , and dirty , scanty furniture , he could not but think what his Knickerbocker mother would say if she could see the hovel from which her son took his wife . During this afternoon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving out . He leaned over his horse 's neck , groaning and swearing by turns , and at last , when they reached Rio Quarto at nine o'clock in the evening , having made a hundred miles , he was so completely knocked up that he could not dismount , and was lifted by Strain and the courier from the saddle . Flinging himself on the floor of the post-house , he gave a groan that sounded like the last effort of a dying man . Such was not his case , however , by any means , for the next DI5MOTJNTzI ) . // moment he fell to cursing and swearing in nil the modern dialects of Europe . After he had exhausted his own and the French and other languages of expletives , he tried the English , fetching in , whenever it appeared to give force to his denunciations , a Polish word . He told the dcvii , over and over again , that he was perfectly welcome to fly away with him to his own dominions if he ever caught him riding post again with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom had the fear of God or a proper respect for the comfort and safety of their own limbs before their eyes . He kept it up all night , muttering and groaning by turns . Strain and the courier were quite willing to part company with him , and in the morning , the former having obtained a passage for him in an ox-cart to Cordova , where he might turn his accomplishments to some account , and giving him some money to pay his expenses on the way , bade him adieu . The needy adventurer , however , would insist on Strain taking a receipt of the money he had loaned him . Here they met the Basque whom the German had cheated out of his money and horses , and who , by some private arrangement with Antonio , was to be one of the party during the rest of the journey to Buenos Ayres . During the day they met the Government courier going west , who informed them that a post-carriage was following after , containing a Brazilian and Frenchman . The name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Strain had an intimate friend , also an acquaintance , by that name near Rio Janciro , he thought this gentleman might be one of them . Putting spurs to their horses , they broke from the steady gallop into a run , and at length , far away in the distance , discerned a cloud of dust , the sure precursor of the post-coach , with its four galloping horses . Before they met , however , Strain caught a fall . His horse , stumbling in a hole , made such a desperate leap in recovering himself to escape the cruel rowels which always follow a mishap of this kind , as to leave him behind with his back to the earth . His companions never slackened their speed , nor apparently noticed the accident . Luckily Strain retained the long plaited thong of the bridlc in his hand , and thus secured his horse . Not being hurt , and hoping . Antonio had not noticed his sudden dismounting , he attempted to remount , but found the saddle was turned . By the time he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it required severe riding to overtake them . A knowing smile from Antonio , and a sly remark upon his dirty apparel , showed that Strain was discovered . To be thrown from a horse on these plains is to confess to a neglected education . The cloud of dust which , when first seen , was many miles distant , now approached . M. Guimares proved to be neither of Strain 's friends , but they soon found they had many acquaintances in common . M. Guimares told him that his friends had been very apprehensive for his safety on account of the Indians , and giving THE TAMPA ( JOACIL. // him an address , requested him to call and say that he had met him beyond the point of greatest danger . The pampa coach is a curiosity in its way . It is a perfect nondescript , and looks as if it might have been Noah 's family carriage . The four horses which drew it were attached to it by large straps of green hide fastened in the saddle of the postillion . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridden by a postillion at a full gallop , which whirled the lumbering vehicle along with t*tonishing rapidity . This mode of traveling allows one to take along many comforts he can not carry on horseback ; but it is not quite so rapid , and much more dangerous on account *f the Indians , for the dust it raises can be seen for many miles , revealing its whereabouts . Travelers on horseback , when in the vicinity ofIndians , avoid the dusty portions of the road , reining out on the plaina . Besides it is far more expensive , for four postillions are required instead of one . After exchanging messages to friends , and taking a kindly leave , each started on his way . To the " Set fire to the plain ! " of Antonio , Strain and his companions broke into a gallop , and were nearly a mile distant before the heavy postcoach was fairly under way . The uncoupled horses could not pull together , but each jumped as he was spurred by the postillion , expending his strength in every direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered on the way now became more frequent , and often from a slight swell on the plain the eye could see nothing but swarms of cattle , till they seemed mere specks in the distance . Mile after mile they rode through these herds of cattle and horses , till they seemed innumerable . A Buenos Ayrean once told Strain that ten millions of hides had been exported from Buenos Ayres in one year . Knowing that the census of 1840 gave but fifteen millions in the whole United States , this statement seemed incredible ; but after several days ' experience in the provinces of Santa F6 and Buenos Ayres , and reflecting that the millions on millions he saw from the road were but a fraction of the vast number scattered over those immense pastures , he could easily believe it . In passing through this province they had to be more cautious , for it was the favorite roving ground of the Indians . At every point that gave an extended view the plain was scanned with an anxious eye to detect , if possible , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mounted men . At night they slept in a fortified house . This , like all the rest , was in the centre of a square , and surrounded by a ditch , along the inside of which was planted one , two , and sometimes three rows of cactus , whose thorny , thick leaves will turn a charge of horse like a line of bayonets . With axes and knives the Indians might make an opening through these , but they never dismount to remove any great obstacle . Their home is the back of a horse , and they do not long feel easy on the ground , especially when in the presence of an enemy . The square is approached by a drawbridge , while the house is pierced with loopholes , // from which the inmates can fire on their assailants . The remaining two days were passed without incident . The ox-teams , the ships of the pampas , became more numerous . These , especially those going west , are the especial objects of the Indians ' attack , as they are then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The carts are constructed after the same general fashion as ours , except they are very rude , with little or no iron about them ; the bands and tires being made of green hide , which , being put on wet , contracts , and becomes almost as hard and firm as iron . The roof is commonly made of straw or green hide , though sometimes of canvas . Six pairs are attached to each cart , the yokes all being fastened to tbe heads and horns . A long pole projects from the roof of the cart , at the end of which is a spike , to goad on the leading team , and a second , farther back , for the next team ; while , with a hand goad , the driver urges on those nearer him . Twelve teams make a troop ; and when it is remembered the drivers never grease their axles , one can imagine the deafening noise they make when in motion . The creaking may be heard for miles , and serves often as a guide to the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the province of Buenos Ayres differs from the rest of the pampas in the natural product of the soil . In Mendoza low trees , shrubs , and a long coarse grass cover the plain . San Luis , Cordova , Santa F* , and a portion of Buenos Ayres , produce a high grass bet ter adapted for pmture ; while the most eastern portion yields clover and thistles . In the former provinces the aspect of the plain changes very little with the different seasons of the year , as the trees seldom lose their leaves , and the grass always preserves a dingy green ; but here the changes are marvelous . No better description can be given of it than the following , by Sir Francis Head : " The first region , or that lying nearest the Atlantic , " says Head , " varies with the four seasons of the year in a most remarkable manner . In winter the leaves of the thistles are large and luxuriant , and the whole surface of the country has the rough appearance of a turnip field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the sight of the wild cattle grazing in full liberty on such pasture is very beautiful . In spring the clover has vanished , the leaves of the thistles have extended along the ground , and the country still looks like a rough crop of turnips . In less than a month the change is most extraordinary ; the whole region becomes a luxuriant wood of enormous thistles , which have suddenly shot up to the height of ten or eleven feet , and are all in full bloom . The road , or path , is hemmed in on both sides ; the view is completely obstructed ; not an animal is to be seen ; and the stems of the thistles are so close to each other , and so strong , that , independent of the prickles with which they are armed , they form an impenetrable barrier . The sudden growth of these plants is quite astonishing ; and though it would be PAMPA OX-CART. // an unusual misfortune in military history , yet it is rually possible that an invading army , unacquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had time to escape from them . The summer is not over before the scene undergoes another rapid change . The thistles suddenly lose their sap and verdure , their heads droop , the leaves shrink and fade , the stems become black and dead , and they remain rattling with the breeze one against another until the violence of the pampero , or hurricane , levels them to the ground , whence they rapidly decompose and disappear ; the clover rushes up , and the scene is again verdant . " The Indians of the pampas are a singular race , and rove these vast plains as the pirate does the sea . They are exceedingly handsome and finely formed . They wear no covering for either theirheads or bodies . Entirely naked they scour the plains by day , and sleep unprotected on the earth by night . When they make a successful descent on a neighborhood , they immediately butcher all the men and old and ugly women . The young and pretty women are placed on horseback , and are compelled to travel with great speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until they reach the remote and secluded home of their captors , who immediately marry them . Handsome and kind , they soon win the attachment of their stolen brides , who , in the few instances where they have had an opportunity to escape , preferred to remain with their husbands and children . These Indians believe in a future state of happiness , where they will be always drunk and always hunting . Their marriage ceremony is a very simple one . The groom and bride , as soon as the sun sets , are made to lie down together with their heads toward the west ; they are then covered with the skin of a horse , and left for the night . As soon as the sun rises at their feet they are considered married .
