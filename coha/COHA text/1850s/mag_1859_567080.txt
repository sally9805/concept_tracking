ARTICLE 11. - CHICAGO THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY. * Proceedings of the Triennial Convention of Alinisters and Delegates of the Congregational Churches in the Northwest , held in connection with the 6'hicago Theological Seminary , at Chicago , Oct. 20th and 21st , 1858 ; with the inaugural Addresses of Frofs . Haven and Bartlett . Chicago . 1858 . THE reading public have not been unadvised of the movement which has been in progress during the last few years , under the direction of Congregationalists , for the establishment of a Theological Seminary at the West . The pamphlet before us , issued by its directors and giving , among other things of importance , the inaugural addresses of two of its professors at the recent opening of the institution , warrants us in calling the attention of our readers more distinctly to this new school of Christian learning . This we shall do chiefly in the way of a brief historic sketch of the proceedings connected with it , rather than by undertaking , to any gre at extent , the discussion of principles and polities involved . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminary at Chicago was made in the year 1853 , although some scheme of theological education had been embraced in their plans , from the first , by the founders of many of the western colleges . This was almost a matter of course , as it was in the case of the founders of most , if not all of the colleges of New England . Founded as these institutions , both at the East and the West , were , on the best impulses of a true and living Christianity , those who were instrumental in their organization could hardly have stopped short , in their * The best method of organizing theological institutions in this country is still an important subject of inquiry . We submit , in this Article , without comment , the views entertained by the friends of the new seminary at Chicago . These views , we doubt not , will be read with interest , notwithstanding the diversity of opinion which there will be in respect to what is said with regard to the deficiencies in the organization of the older theological instit*ations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establisbed. - En . NEW ENGLANDER. // measures of education , of such a plan as would find its crown in the eqnipment of their students for the calling of the ministry . Yale College was , in fact , at the outset , more a Theological Seminary than a College , as the latter term has come now to be understood . Subsequently the revival of its somewhat lost character in this respect led to the formal creation of a theological department in its university equipment . Our western colleges have not yet developed a distinct theological organization , except , we believe , in the case of that at Oberlin , though many of them have had the theological idea in them , and this has more or less distinctly appeared , at times , in the title of their professorships , as , for instance , in Illinois College , where a professorship of theology has lain dormant these many years . The Christian mcii , both those who had looked out upon the growing West from a distance with solicitous eye , anxious that it should be built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who had gone thither to do what they might as wise builders for Christ , could not fail , with any tolerable conception of the magnitude and importance of the field , and its relations to the future of the country and of the world , to embrace in their schemes of education the requisite means for the training up , sooner or later , the ministry there to be needed . But , as we have said , it was not until so late as the year 1853 that the thoughts and feelings of those who were exercised in this direction began to take visible and effective shape . Lip to that time they had borne with the necessity of relying upon theological institutions already estal ) lished at the East for the supply of those ueeded for the preaching and pastoral office in the newer portions of the land . Now , however , the inadequacy of this source had become so manifest that it was felt to be a duty to supply its deficiency . And this deficiency was two-fold ; not only in men but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its churches men enough to supply its own wants and those of the missionary service abroad , much less to meet the added demands of the fast-peopling traus-alleghanic region . And it was , at the same time , a difficult matter to draw young men a thousand miles from home to be educated for a work to be done finally at home . There was too great expense involved , // to say nothing of the fact that institutions so remote did not appeal to the western churches with the force needed in order to inspire their young men with desire to furnish themselves for the work of the ministry . Ten thousand avenues , not only of o'ain but of usefulness also , opened their gates between b them and those far-off schools of sacred learning rendered almost mythical by their distance . But then , if these difficulties had not belonged to the existing state of things , there was another , greater and more nearly insuperable . It was the system of training established in all the older theological institutions of the land . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline furnished by our colleges and seminaries , there is yet a lack of practicalness and of practical acquaintance with the plans and proper pursuits of life , on the part of those sent forth from them , which puts those thus trained at a great disadvantage oftentimes , in comparison with others who have not had the benefit of the more complete and classical tuition . There is too much of truth in the remark made by one of our most distinguished living men , himself also a graduate of one of our foremost colleges , that " the first thing one has to do when he has left the college is to unlearn what he has there learned . " We do not intend to discuss the best methods of education , and shall , therefore , only advert to the fact that our cloistered system of training does , in some sense , educate us away from the masses around us , with whom , nevertheless , most of us must live in after life in bonds of closest contact . And nowhere is this evil effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are training for the sacred ministry . In the professions of law and medicine , the system of education in the professional schools themselves is such as to counteract largely the scholastic tendencies . The student at law , however closely engaged with his books , is all the while , whether in the professional school or the office of the practising attorney , brought into daily contact with men , and is directly conversant with their modes and habits of thought and action , their individualities of character . The same is true of the student of medicine . Along with his training in the Medical College , or perhaps without its benefits , he puts himself in the way of seeing , by daily companionship // with some actively employed physician , how the theories of the healing art are applied in practice . In theology alone we have kept up the monastic system of training . And what wonder is it , when we have practically shut a man away from the world for the space of seven , perhaps ten or twelve years , including the academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to medicate its spiritual disorders , his diagnosis is so much at fault that the first years of his ministry are comparatively worthless , if the whole is not greatly impaired . The old system of educating students for the ministry , under the training only of some pastor , was often defective in respect to a rigid and thorongh discipline of mind , as well as in the biblical knowledge imparted . Small training of an intellectual sort did some get in this way . But whatever disadvantages there were in this respect , there was a practical knowledge gained , an ability to make the most of one 's self in the daily work of his profession , and from the very beginning of it , which our seminaries , in their laudable desire to reach a better intellectual culture , have too often lost . In expressing these views , we only give utterance to what is felt by multitudes , and reiterate what has been said before in the pages of this Quarterly . Some may remember the passage which we here reprint . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education in the seminary , tends to make the ministry less practical and adapted to the actual and infinitely varied circumstances of real life than it otherwise would be , or certainly might be . As the matter now is , we take a young man who has been shut up in the academy and college seven years , and shutting him up for three years more in the class rooms of the seminary , then send him out into the world to preach the gospel . There could hardly be a more sudden or complete change of one 's condition than is thus occasioned . From an almost total seclusion from the actual world , he is cast at once into its great seething caldron of activities and passions . From the companionship of books , or a select few , whose feelings , tastes , and pursuits are akin to his own , he is thrust at once into the company of those most unlike in habits and occupation . From the quiet of the school he is ushered into the din and whirl of the world 's marts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and its evil of every sort and of every grade . Such a transition can not but give a shock to the whole nature of the young minister of the word . It is like throwing one suddenly into the water , who , though be may have read many treatises upon the art of swimming , and may have settled most accurately the philosophy of human flotation , has never in practice struck out a hand or a foot in the water , or ventured where he could // Chicago Theological Seminary . not touch bottom . Figure aside , nothiug would seem more likely than that the young man , who , on taking his parish charge , is thus confronted with sin in real life , rather than with sin in the books , and in place of cool theories of virtue and vice , of motive and conduct , meets the beating hearts of his fellow-men with the living tides of feeling and purpose coursing through them , should be appalled and disconcerted , and in his bewilderment and ignorance , should pattern his conduct after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his theology in the rut which he has made for him . The chance is , that for years such a man will be worth little to his parish , except barely to keep alive in them the comfortable knowledge that they have some one regularly in their pulpit , and as the phrase is , are enjoying the means of grace . ' The chance , the probability , is , too , that such a person , if he ever recover himself and is able to stand on his own feet , will carry not a few of the habits of his rawness and inexperience with him through life . " But if , instead of being thus plunged suddenly into the unknown , untried realities of life , he had been introduced to them gradually , he would very likely have met them wisely , and from the outset would have been a better minister ot the gospel . The old plan of educating candidates for the sacred office in the study of some settled pastor , instead of in a herd , crowded in the class room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect at least , over the arrangement now prevailing . It took the student day by day from his books to the practical work of the pastor . He rode with his teacher to visit the sick and the dying , and he practised the preaching art under the eye of the dominie , at the village school-house of an evening , or in the best room of some godly old farmer , when it was opened for the Saturday night meeting for prayer and conference . Thus he was from the outset a kind of colleague pastor , and it was a comparatively slight transition from such a position to that of the sole charge of a parish . The thousand questions of the practical application of the gospel to actual life and conduct , which everywhere arise , had already come up , and in some mode had been solved . " ( New Englander , Vol . XI , pp. 131 , 132 . ) In fact , the best friends of our older theologleal institutions feel the difficulties to which we have adverted , as sensibly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But nowhere has the defect in our prevalent system of theological education been felt as a practical difficulty , so much as in the more recently settled portions of our country . If anything characterizes the people of our western states , it is their intense and universal practicalness . They wish to come right at the matter in hand , whatever it is . If good , they desire to know in what its goodness consists , and care little for the outward dress it wears . So , too , if they engage in wrong doing , they take little trouble to cloak the wrong under any garb of conventionalism or propriety . What in // some other regions would be spoken of , for instance , as a " shrewd piece of financiering , " they call simply " a steal , " and have done with it . In that rapidly forming society , life is too busy to leave time for much attention to the mere circumstances of things . If a man prays , he does not deem it necessary to begin with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sin , *nd come down thence through patriarchs and prophets , in order to get to Christ . Nor , if he is a Universalist , or an Infidel , will he be likely to take pains to conceal the fact on account of any supposed requisitions of respectability . Being thus eminently a practical , matter-of-fact people , the dwellers at the West need a ministry of correspondent character , educated in a method that shall make them as practical as their hearers . They will not listen to merely elegant essays . They feel that they can not afford the time to be tickled with rhetoric , while yet they are by no means insensible to the power and charm of appropriate rhetoric . They take nothing upon trust , though a late able writer , not resident among them , has characterized them as being so religions , after the manner of the Athenians in the time of Paul , as to be ready to adopt almost any schenie of religion as soon as propounded . Nor do they prize a truth or system overmuch because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how to deal with their reason and their conscience in the same downright way in which they themselves deal with them , they will respect him and listen to him , and the more willingly in proportion as he is able thus to convict them of their sinfulness ; otherwise they will turn away . What they want is , not less training in their ministers than others want , but a more practical training . There is no part of our country that so much needs for its ministry men thoroughly furnished with all the knowledge and intellectual culture and dialectic skill which our best colleges and seminaries can give . On this point Dr. Kitchel speaks well , and not without ample knowledge , in his charge to Prof. Haven . He says , speaking of the wants of the western churches : " Among these churches is every variety in respect to condition and // culture . They run through even a wider scale of variety than the churches in older regions . And every variety of ininisterial qualities and gifts is demanded among them . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind or force of character that will not find fit field among us . If anywhere on earth the choicest endowments of nature and training are needed , it is in the ministry whom God is calling here to shape the infancy of vast Christian communities , and to lay the foundations of a future such as rushes upon us l:ere. " -. - ( Proceedings , &amp;c. , p. 37 . ) There is no part of our country or of the world , where the Christian ministry more need a thorough acquaintance with the history of the church in all ages , the history of doctrines , and the best training in biblical scholarship . It used to be thonbht , to a considerable extent , that if a man was unable to sustain himself in the ministry at the East , all he had to do , in order to find a high place and to be caught at eagerly , was to migrate to the West . We believe that time and that notion are both in the past . On that great field of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be found all the elements of human character from all parts of the world , and all philosophies , and vagaries , and false religions there have open field in which to work . What is wanted for its nAnsters , for their right instruction in things of highest moment , s the most thorough furnishing which stu ( ly and scholarship can give ; but along with this , the ability by means of a practical knowledge of mankind , their ways and wants , to apply all the f*urniture of the mind to the daily life of man , and to apply it from the very outset of their ministry . There is too much time consumed , often , by the stud6nts of our seminaries , as hitherto constituted , in learning the use of their tools after they are sent out into the world and are supposed to be masters of their divine craft . Souls perish while they are learning how to save souls , uot by the theoretic methods of the lecture room , but by the practical work of the ministry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was felt by those most nearly concerned , that there was not only wanted for the West a larger supply of // the ministry of the word , but the supply of a different and a better ministry , in some respects , than they were getting or could get by the existing system of training . This feeling finally took shape in one of the northwestern states , about five years since . The project of a Theological Seminary , with some new and peculiar features , was preseiited at that time to the Association of Michigan . The subject was discussed and referred to a committee , which was ordered to report upon the matter at the next annual meeting . The committee , at the time appointed , reported favorably . Their report was adopted , and measures were taken to secure a conference with those concerned in other portions of the Northwest . It was soon found that the matter had been up for consideration almost at the same time , in four different states . These various movements led to the assembling of a convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at which , these states were duly represented . The discussions which arose at this convention strengthened the general conviction that the time had arrived for a definite and decisive movement for the purpose of training up , on its own field and according to its peculiar wants , a minis try for the West , and as for the West , so for the world . Such was the feeling at this meeting , that a committee was appointed to digest a plan for a Theological Seminary , this plan to be laid before a larger convention to be assembled in the ensuing autumn , and the 11ev . Stephen Peet , so long and widely known in the West , was secured to act as agent of the seminary that was so clearly to be . The second convention met at Chicago in September following , arid was largely attended by ministers and delegates from the churches of six states . The plan reported to it was , adopted , with some unessential modifications . The seminary was fully and finally resolved upon . Boards of directors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charter from the legislature of Illinois , Chicago having been already chosen as the location of the seminary . The directors , having secured the desired charter , met in March of the following year , appointed an executive committee , and a general agent in place of Mr. Feet , who had been removed by death , and thus set themselves // at work to realize , as soon as might be , the expectations of the churches . After great and unforeseen difficulties , these expectations have been so far realized that , early in October last , the new seminary opened its doors , and received for instruction thirty students . Two professors were at that time inaugurated , and another has just taken his place in the corps of instruction . Other* are being sought for , and will , doubtless , be found within a reasonable period of time . The fit men for such places are riot to be found without much search . We have spoken in part of the circumstances which occasioned the movement resulting in the founding of this new in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement itself , until the seminary came to have an actual existence . The plan of the seminary , as it exists , demands some notice . That plan aims to secure , in the largest measure , and to make most largely available , the talent and capacity by which the seminary is surrounded , and which it , in some sense , represents . It aims , so to speak , to economize the raw material of the ministry . To this end it is , in the first place , most intimately connected with the churches . It is the creature of no profession , of no school , of no class in the churches , but of the churches themselves . Its management is in the hands of no close corporation , or self-perpetuating board** but it rests with the Christian brethren as a whole , acting through the intervention of a body of directors chosen at frequent intervals . The seminary came into being not as the happy suggestion of a few , but in answer to the spontaneous feeling and simultaneous desire of a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and intelligent forecastings of the future of the magnificent region placed by Divine Providence in their hands , lQd , under the same Providence , to the design and the actual creation of an institution which has drawn to itself , from the beginning , the confidence of time Christian public in a remarkable degree . Springing thus from the very bosom of the churches , its constitution also provides that it shall , at frequent intervals , give account of itself to the // 344 Cldctgo Tkeologiccd S*mirnzry. body whose prop3rty and creature it is . This is done by means of a convention , assembling triennially , and composed of ministers and delegates from all the churches of the Northwest belonging to the Congregational denomination . To this convention the directors of the seminary make report of their proceedings , and by vote of the convention they are reélected to office , or others are chosen in their stead , as may seem most conducive to the well-working of the institution . A board of VisitOr8 is also chosen by the convention , whose business it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , report any irregularities or defects , and make such suggestions as shall seem for its advantage . It will be seen , therefore , that this new institution has a very close relation to the churches , those especially among whom it is located , and in this has a certain advantage over other seminaries whose bond of connection with the churches is not so direct and close as its own . Not but that they are very *dear , and rightfully so , to the various Christian organizations . But none of them have sprung so palpably out of the very bosoni of the churches , nor are they so palpably and constantly held upon that bosom . The life of this seminary is , in a peculiar sense , the life of the surrounding churches . It does not depend for its existence and continuance upon the care of the ministry near at hand , nor upon the attractive power of those who occupy its chairs of instruction , though these , of course , will be important elements of its vitality and nsefulness ; but it depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiarity which distinguishes this institution , and which on this account , ought to be mentioned , that the laity have had a large share in the whole shaping and organization of this new school of the prophets . And so it is felt to be the child and property of the churches . From St. Paul to the Ohio , and from the Lake region to the great sweeps beyond the Mississippi , they feel a yearmng interest in its welfare . They watch its every step . They feel that it is of them , as well as for them . Their prayers go up for it as prayer goes up from the household altar for a beloved child . Here is its strength . It may ever fall // back upon the entire Christian brotherhood with the assurance of support . It is a reasonable expectation that a seminary thus founded , thus closely linked to the great body of the churches , should have some advantages over others not so constituted . One ground of such an expectation will be found in its very dependence upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be such as will make it answer more closely and exactly to the wants of the churches , and therein to the wants of the world , than would otherwise be the fact . Take the case , for instance , of a seminary under the management of a self-perpetuating board , and there will always be the danger that such an institution will have the wants of the churches as a secondary consideration in its working . Not designedly , of course . But it will not be so much their direct and manifest want , after all , as it will be the directors ' notion of that want , or their notion of what that want ought to be , which will be likely to govern and guide in its practical management . Or take the case where the control of such an institution is wholly or largely in the hands of a particular class , say of the ministry . Some might think that such a body of men would best manage an institution for the training of those who are to become ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it is undoubtedly true that , in some respects , none have so just a conception of their calling as ministers themselves . But then , again , who does not know the danger that a certain class-feeling is likely to grow up in any profession , association , or guild , which , in more ways than one , will interfere with its highest usefulness . The ministry are no more exempt from this danger than are other classes and professions . There is many a narrow sentiment or prejudice , against which those in and out of the churches are revolting , which has been bred , and is kept alive and in place , by this class-feeling among the clergy . There is many a man in the pews who could often indoctrinate the one in the pulpit , in some important respects , as to what is needed to make up the sum total of the most effective preacher of the gospel . There is many a one in the pews who sees de // fects in the preacher , of which the latter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , might help him to become a xvorkrnan needing not to be ashamed . And here , just while we are writing , comes the wayward Autocrat of his own table , and touches this very subject in the main so truly , that we are tempted to quote a little : " A sermon by a lay-preacher may be worth listening to ,  - -  I replied , calmly . It gives the parallax of thought and feeling as they appear to the observers from two very different points of view . If you wish to get the distance of a heavenly body , you know that you must take two observations from distant points of the earth 's orbit ,  --  in midsummer and midwinter , for instance . To get the parallax of heavenly truths , you must take an observation from the position of the laity as well as of the clergy . Teachers and students of theology ( the same , with a difference , he might have said of his own and of other professions ) get a certain look , certain conventional tones of voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits of mind as professional as their externals. " - ( Atlantic Monthly , Jan. , 1859 , p. 88 . ) We count it , therefore , as a pledge that the system of training in this new seminary will be , in somue respects , more complete and adequate than that which we have been accustomed to , in that this institution is so largely in the hands of the laymen of the churches . It will not be apt to make ministers so much by the pattern of theory as it will shape them according to the practical pressing want of the world around it . This want will be all the while expressed . Every year and every week it will be manifesting itself in some way and bringing itself to the notice of the seminary , to the notice of its teachers and students . And , at furthest , every three years this want will be embodied in the knowledge of a convention assembled from all parts of that great region of power and promise , and thins be impressed upon the plastic body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A seminary for the training - of ministers ought to make them fitted for the particular wants of their time and place . It should not give us stuffed skins of doctrine or dry theories of practice merely , modeled after however // worthy saints or doctors or councils or schools , but living men , knowing and feeling the shape and needs of the place to which God , in his providence , would fit them and ( he peculiarities of life and action which they are to meet and sanctify . And this is likely to be secured , again , in good measure , by another feature or peculiarity of the new school at Chicago . That peculiarity relates to the method of training as being two-fold , partly in the seminary proper , that is under the eye of the professor , and partly away from the seminary under the charge of sundry pastors of churches . The term of study in this , as in other seminaries , reaches through three years , except with those taking the special course . But of each year about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder , with the exception of the needful vacation , is engaged with some pastor , under whose supervision the student pursues an appointed course of reading , and at the same time learns the practical working of the ministry . This plan undertakes thus to combine what of good , in the way of intellectual discipline , and knowledge , the ordinary seminaries afford , with that practical culture which was obtained under the scheme , formerly prevalent , of studying with the settled pastor . Most persons , we presume , will be favorably impressed by this arrangement . Those most scholastic in their habits will , perhaps , fear a letting down of the rigid exactions of a thorough course of training in ' the lecture-room . But to such it may be suggested that , as the student comes back from year to year , from his experience in the parish life , he will be likely to come with such an intelligent and discriminating knowledge of his wants , and with such a sharpened relish for the most scholastic studies , that he will really make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise would of the accustomed forty . We , at least , shall wait with interest the working of this new feature in the enterprise , because it accords so well with some suggestions heretofore made in our own columns . Six years ago , in discussing the subject of the church and its ministry , and after adverting to the old method of ministerial education under the eye of the settled pastor , we said , // For ourselves , therefore , while we do not think our present course of instruction furnishes by any means a superfluity of doctrinal and historical equipment for the ministry , we should like to see that old parish training grafted upon it , and rather than not have it we would be willing to exchange one of the three years of the seminary course , for a year of practical instruction with some acting pastor . And we will suggest that this practical equipment might now be attained without lengthening the present term of study , by a somewhat different arrangement of it . Let the study of books as such , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , and then let the student be required to spend the three or four warm months of each of his three seminary years in the company of some settled pastor . This would divide the year in the manner most congenial to the purposes of the student , and would give him relaxation , for it would be such , at the season of the year when there is least inclination for systematic appliance to books , and least profit in it , while it would occupy that season in a manner no less profitable than any other of the year . If need be too , one might support himself pecuniarily during his short terms in the country , by teaching the district school while receiving his pastoral education , though many a pastor would be ready to receive a well behaved student as a member of his household gratuitously , in consideration of his society , and the nameless assistances which he might render him , especially if students were to be licensed to preach , at the discretion of the pastors under whose charge they might for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is now the case , until just as they are expected to become full blown pastors . " - ( New Englander , VoL XI , pp. 132-3 . ) The new seminary , it will be seen , could hardly have been modeled , in this respect , more to our mind had it sprung up under our sole direction . Another feature of this institution remains to be noticed . It is its provision for a special class of students who , for some good reason , are not able to pursue the regular course of instruction . We have said that this seminary aims to economize the raw material of the ministi-y . In other words , it aims to supply as largely as possible the world wide want of the ministry of tile word of life , the gospel of salvation by a Redeemer . No one can familiarize his mind with the actual state of the case without feeling that there is a severe application to our times of that declaration of the Saviour , " The harvest truly is plenteous , but the laborers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our more customary and scholastic methods of training , is tile pertinency of that declaration likely soon to be less manifest . Saying nothing of the demands constantly arising from tile fields immediately surrounding and dependent upon our New England seminaries and the drafts made upon them // by the progress of the work of missions to the heathen , what a want opens its crying mouth at the West ! The latest exhibit of our Home Missionary Society , * gives us such statements as these : " What Iowa wants is an addition of more than one hundred men to our ministerial force within her bounds . " - ( p. 50 . ) " The destitutions of this field ( Central and Western Ohio ) are very great . There are seventeen counties , containing two hundred and fifty-four townships and six hundred and sixteen thousand three hundred and forty-five inhabitants , with only fifty four ministers of the denominations cooperating with the American Home Missionary Society ; making an average of more than eleven thousand inhabitants to one minister . Six other counties contain ninety-two townships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and but twelve churches and ten ministers ; making an average of sixteen thousand six hundred and eighteen in habitants to one minister . Eight other counties , as large and populous , have but one church and one minister each ; which gives an average of more than twenty-four thousand inhabitants to the charge of one minister of our order . Besides the above , there are twenty entire counties , containing more than a third of a million of inhabitants , without a single minister or a single church of our denominations-as if we had not a minister nor a church in the whole state of Connecticut . " * * * * " To place one minister in each of our seven hundred and forty-four townships would require an immediate supply of six hundred and seventy-three ministers more than are now in the work . " - ( pp. 51 , 52 . ) Of Indiana it is said " more than half the countie8 have no resident Presbyterian or Congregational minister ; and almost half of them have no church connected with these denorninations .

The work of the society in this state is but just begun . " ( p. 53 . ) Of northern Illinois , by far the most evangelized portion of the state , we get this report . " Take , for example , the county of which Galena is the seat , ' and it is found that we furnish only five ministers and seveu churches towards supplying a population of twenty-five thousand . Taking twenty-four counties together , we find one church to every three thousand five hundred of the inhabitants ; and one minister to every five thousand .

Upon this basis , there is but one minister , belonging to the co*iperating denominations , and actively engaged in the duties of his office , to every five thousand two hundred inhabitants . * * Nearly all the churches and ministers now in the state are found in that portion of it which is south of the line of the Detroit and Milwaukie railroad ; thus leaving more than half its territory almost wholly destitute . North of this line , only a single county has a minister of our connection . " - ( pp. 54 , 55 . ) And if such things are true of the older of the western states , if such are true of Illinois-under the approaching census to take her place as the fourth state of the Union in population-what shall we say of the " regions beyond , " the newer states , Wisconsin and Minnesota ? And what of the states about-to-be ; of IKauzas , Nebraska , Ontanagon , Dakota , Arizona , Nevada , Washington , and others as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lagging tables of statistics , but whose wants even now exist and are to increase rapidly , as the waves of immigration pour their living hosts over the rich fields between the Mississippi and the Pacific ? There is danger that those who dwell in the older portions of our land , densely populated , with no more room for expansion , and furnished with the many appliances of a cultured civilization , with colleges and seniinaries within easy // reach of every one , and supernumerary ministers not very nnfreqnently visible , will fail to appreciate the fast increasing demands for a proper ministry in the occidental regions of the country . But whoever does appreciate it , will feel that we must not , can not wait , until we can give all our sons the protracted discipline and furnishing of academy , college and seminary , but that , while striving for that as largely as may be , we must lay hold of and subsidize another element of power and consecrate it to the work of Christ . In other words , we must not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become accomplished theologians , desirable as it may be that every preacher of the gospel were such , but we must take those whom God has called to himself later in life and not in the gristle of youth , the newly converted merchant , or farmer , or lawyer , or speculator , and qualifying their practical talent , already acquired in other callings , with what teaching of doctrines in their harmony we may be able to give , send them forth , as the early disciples and apostles went , to tell the story of redemption with hearts burning with love to Christ and to souls . There is a pioneer work , if no other , to be done by such , and which , if so done , is done most effectively and with great economy of resources . They are the light-armed troops who go before the heavy and slower infantry and have a place as important as theirs . The new seminary has openly undertaken to train such for their work , by what is termed its Special Course , and in so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , if they have had a standing as such in our older communities and under the shadow of our colleges and seminaries , have had it for the most part by courtesy or constraint . Far be it from us to do or say aught that should imply any undervaluing of the severest training of the college and the theological school as the means of making the most effective ministry . The new seminary does not propose to lower at all the standard of scholarship held up as the normal condition of a proper qualification for the office of the ministry . The delay of more than a year in opening , which it has submitted to rather than take any second rate men for its chairs of instruction , the // inaugural addresses of two of its professors , just published in connection with the proceedings of the late convention , and the names of well known presidents and professors of various colleges , embraced in its lists of lecturers or professors-extraordinary , names honored for their learning , at the East as well as at the West , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren , in planning a new institution for the training of the Christian ministry , have not forgotten the place which belongs to a true and high-toned scholarship , nor failed to provide for its maintenance . At the same time they have not allowed themselves to be so eaten up with zeal of mere scholasticisin as to forget that where there is a proper leaven of true learning God will make it the means of leavening the whole lump , and that he has a work to be done , in the salvation of the world , by others than the technical scholar . We heard the remark attributed , though we believe erroneously , to one of our honored scholars , and at the same time most effective preachers , that " Spurgeonisin and the Chicago Seminary would be the death of us . " That was in the early days both of Spurgeon and the seminary , and although glad that the remark was not made by the one upon whom it was charged , we doubt if any one of respectable judgment will now be found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however much there may be about it to offend our more delicate sensibilities , nor do we think the experience of coming years is likely to prove that the effectiveness of the ministry of the gospel has been lessened by the Chicago Theological Seminary . Such an institution has just gone into operation , drawing to its classes at the very outset , a larger number of students than are to be found in some of our older and most honored seminaries , and gathering around it at its inauguration an assembly of patrons honorable to any community and to any cause ; a company , too , whose highest praise it is , that their zeal for Christ and the spread of the kndwledge of his gospel so dominated over all class or denominational feeling , that during the two days ' sessions and debates of the convention , hardly a word fell from any lip , which betrayed the sectarian or denomina // tional relationship of the speaker . It was " Christo et Eccleshe ; " the Christ and the Church , too , of the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin or Robinson . And when we speak thus , we are reminded that some will be anxious , perhaps , to know the doctrinal basis upon which this new institution of Christian learning is built , or to be built . Our space obliges us to be brief in what remains to be said , and yet , what is needed may be said briefly . The new seminary does not ignore or undervalue a proper creed , as embodying or indicating its interpretation of biblical doctrine . On the contrary , such a creed-form was carefully drawn np among the first things done by the directors of the seminary , and this the constitution obliges every professor elect to give public assent to , as a condition precedent to his induction into office . That " form of sound words " is one that squares with our most orthodox and universally accepted symbols . And yet this symbol is held with true Christian charity and liberality . A few words from the charge of Dr. Kitchel , president of the board of directors , to the professor of theology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new institution in regard to this particular matter : " You accept with us this declaration of faith ; but we do not conclude you in these , or any human formularies . You accept it with us , a declaratory act , and as we do not accept it for ourselves , so neither do we impose it upon you a fetter of thought , or a finality of faith . We hold you to no school in theology or philosophy . We have come to this faith by way of Geneva and New England , and this way we love well . But we hold you not to Calvin , or even to New England . We too , have the word which alone is sure , and to us , also , the inspiration of the Almighty will give wisdom . Have open ear and heart then , and beyond all creeds , and through all voices , listen for the voice of the Lord . " - ( Proceedings , &amp;c. , p. 36 . ) Had we space , we should be glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professors , as indicating the feeling with which they gave assent to the creed-statement of the school just placed in their charge . Suffice it , therefore , to say that both magnify the word of God as they ought , setting it in // its own rightful authority , high above all human expositions of it , and*enjoini1 ) g it as the duty and the privilege of every one to interpret it for himself , unawed and unconstrained by any . We will , however , make a single quotation from the address of Professor Haven , premising that there is a beautiful harmony between the addresses of the two professors , brought together for the first time , from the distance of a thousand miles , within the walls of this seminary : " It is the cardinal doctrine of Protestantism that no doctrines of men are binding on the conscience in matters of religion . Whether they be decisions of popes , or councils , or synods , or assemblies of divines , it matters not ; whether they be decrees , or catechisms , or creeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , be they what they may , is binding on the conscience of any man , be he who he may ; but only the pure word of God , and every man his own judge of what that word contains . This is THE root , the foundation , and very ground work of Protestant faith . Giv&amp; it up , and you give up the very fortress and citadel of Protestantism . " On the other hand , they are not wise who cry out against all creeds and formulanes of Christian doctrine as useless , and worse than useless . It does not follow that because these things are not of binding authority , they are therefore of no avaiL As guides of judgment , as landmarks to show where the old paths went , and in what way the ancient worthies trod , as helps to a correct decision in mat. ters of doubtful moment , they are of high value . I will not , indeed , receive them as authority , and concede to them my own right of individual judgment ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good men , and , as such , deserving of respect . I will not ask what Athanasius , or Augustine , what Luther or Calvin believed , in order that I may believe the same , and that lccause they believed it ; but I will ask what these men and others believed and taught , that I may avail myself of their wisdom , and get what light I can upon the meaning of the sacred oracles , upon the hights , and depths , and difficult mountain passes of the Christian faith . If their doctrine seems to accord with the inspired word , rationally interpreted and intelligently weighed , I will gladly receive it ; and all the more gladly that it is the belief of such men . If it differs from what , in my best judgment , God 's word means and teaches , then in so far will I differ from them , and no man shall deprive me of this liberty . " - ( Proceedings , &amp;c. , pp. 54-55 . ) Having alluded thus to the inaugural addresses embodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which it was no part of our purpose to review , we will simply say that they are such as to command the respect and confidence of all who properly appreciate the needs of a right theologic culture , and to give good augury of success to the // institution which has secured such men as their authors show themselves to be , to fill its chairs of instruction . The report of the treasurer , also embodied in the proceedings of the convention , exhibits the interest felt in the seminary by its immediate constituency , in a manner not to be gainsayed . It shows a balance of property to the credit of the seminary , after all liabilities are met , amounting to $150,000 . This manifests a degree of* interest and of pecuniary liberality on the part of the western churches , which is very creditable to their character , especially when the fact is taken into consideration , that the wealth of the West is so largely in the hands of non-residents , or of persons destitute of saving religious character . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised at the West . We remember that the announcement of the projected seminary had hardly been made , before our western brethren had a very significant intimation , through one of our religious journals of wide circulation , that they must not come to the East for funds for its endowment . This warning it seems , however , is not to have the credit even of having provoked the West to good works ; for , before it was uttered , the directors of the seminary had deliberately voted that , in seeking its endowment , they would restrict their efforts to the home field of the seminary itself . The result has proved that their confidence in the ability and disposition of the churches around them , was not misplaced . Nobly have those churches responded to the appeals which have been made to them , and there is every reason to believe that the sum necessary to complete the endowment of the seminary will be raised without difficulty from the same source . We are happy , therefore , on all accounts , in welcoming this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is room for it . There was a call for it . And we are glad that the opportunity is to be given for testing the value of some of its peculiar features , and confident that it will be found , imm some impcrtant respects , an advance in the system of theological education . Nor can we close without suggesting that , in the establishmont // of this new school of the prophets , we have a new proof of the value of the work of home Missions . Who have established this seminary , already so vigorous and promising ? Who , but the churches gathered and nourished l ) y our noble Home Missionary Society ? Those great states which have now undertaken , of their own accord , the establishment and support of this seminary , what were they , within the memory of most of us , but one great missionary field , dependent upon the contributions and efforts of Christians at the East for every preacher of the gospel , almost , whose voice broke the stillness of those giant solitudes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what are they even now , for the most part , but a missionary field ? That report , which we have already quoted , in regard to Ohio , which has already begun to be reckoned as one of the eastern rather than one of the western states , how dependent does it show even that still to l ) e upon that beneficent organization into whose treasury the Christian liberality of Massachusetts and Connecticut , and other eastern states , has , for more than a generation , poured its ample contributions . It is the very spirit of missions , inoculated into those western churches and inspiring them , which has given origin to this school of Christian training , which now lifts itself up on those far off prairies and proposes to do a work second to none other in importance . And as its students go out among the fast gathering churches of those newer regions , as they keep pace with the advancing wave of our impatient civilization , as it seeks the ever-retreating frontier , as they , some , find their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paganism , or , it may be , come back upon our older territory of New England , showing us , in an unimpaired scholarship , combined with the outspoken frankness and practical earnestness of the West , the type of a more effective ministry than we have been accustomed to , who xviii not rejoice in whatever he may have done , through the agency of that great home Missionary organization , for the accomplishment of so gi'and a consummation ?
