Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : PROEM. from The bells ( 1855 ) I. THE CHRISTENING . I 've christened these , my poesies , THE BELLS , Because there is , or should be , in all rhymes , A music soft and silv'ry as the chimes That float at evening through the twilight dells , Born in the belfry of some village church , Hid by the ivy clamb'ring from its porch . Because some verses have a solemn roll , Sweetly sad , a melancholy swelling , Like the deep bells of a cathedral , telling The sad departure of another Soul For the Eternal City ! that far shore , Where , like a sea , Time breaketh evermore ! Because in Bells there something is to me Of rhythms and the poets of gone years  --  A sad reverberation , breeding tears , Touching the finer chords of memory ! Bells be the name ! may their vibrations clear , Fall in mild cadences upon thine ear ! II . TO MY FRIENDS . Ye friends that gild my humbler way ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hearts are with him here Who seeks to tread a wider sphere ; I know the words that ye would say . And thou , O friend ! I have not seen ! Whose hand has never grasped my own , Whose ear has never caught a tone From lips of mine , to whom I 'm known In thoughts , and not by form or mien ; May I not hope some passing tone May start thy sleeping memory , May bring some clouded joy to thee ? ' T were sweet to know , though strangers we , Thy heart is chiming with my own ! THE BELLS . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : PRELUDE TO THE STEEPLE OF ST . AYNE. from The bells ( 1855 ) The snow was on the house-top , And on the poplars tall ; And the fire-light 's hand was tracing Weird pictures on the wall ; And nearer to the embers I drew my little chair , And gazing on the winking logs I saw wild figures there . Sometimes it was a castle With turrets all a-gleam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molten stream ; Gonfalons , and warriors Encased in armor red ; And all the legends I had heard , Came trooping thro ' my head . I thought of ruins hoary Beside the Danube 's wave , Of Vogelweid whose treasures fed The birds around his grave . I thought of shadows sleeping Around the Rodenstein ; And tales that hover bird-like o'er The silver river Rhine . And melody stole on me Like a sweet midnight chime ; And ' mong the branches of my brain I found this nest of rhyme . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : THE STEEPLE OF ST . AYNE. from The bells ( 1855 ) You 'll see it through the hemlock boughs , As down the moorland road you pass , Standing ghostly , brown and still In the shadow of a hill . There is not a pane of glass In any of the carven sashes ; But thick around them , like eye-lashes , Hang the cobwebs old and gray ! In and out those glassless sockets , Floats the lazy sun all day . I have often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know not if it be so ; But upon the belfry 's crown , Mosses of a dappled brown And many curious colors grow ! In the steeple , where the swallows Dart , like lightning , to and fro , Swings the ponderous bell , which monks In that tower long ago , Hung with many pater nosters , Chanted hymns and litanies ! Praying when , at eve , it swung Between its lips its iron tongue , What it said might reach far cities And their sinful inmates save ; Telling with its solemn tolling Time was ever , ever knolling Mortals to the cold , damp grave ! As I stand , the twilight with me , In the Steeple of St. Ayne , Far I wander in the regions Of the misty Land of Legends , Painting pictures on my brain . Olden scenes came back to me ; The past throws off its dusty shroud .  --  The Abbot and the monkish train In the old cathedral crowd , Filling aisles and niches dim With their pious murmuring ; And , as silver censers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gorgeous frescoed dome  --  Paintings , brought from holy Rome  --  Floats in clouds the soft perfume ; While the pensive evening gloom , With a foot that seems to falter , Mounts the carved steps of the altar , Standing silently beside An image of the Crucified ! Now the solemn chant of souls Through gallery and cloister rolls ! While , as if with sudden pain , Dolorous the Curfew tolls In the Steeple of St. Ayne . Now I see a marriage cortge , Mailed knights and cavaliers ; Reeling plumes and glist'ning lances ; Maidens with their stolen glances ; Dames in kirtles of brocade  --  All the pomp of other years . Then the bride in white arrayed , Milky roses on her brow , White and beautiful as snow , While her deep and blond eyes glisten As the beams from Dian 's bow . On her bosom , budding forth Like lilies from the pregnant earth , Gems , as rich as those of Ind , From the caverns of the East , Rise and fall at every breath As she gives her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epithalamium ! All the gaudy train is gone , Priest , choragus ; and deep Silence Sits within the pews alone ! And , now through the open door Streams the sunshine on the floor , Throwing sparkles where the dismal , Breathless shadows moped before . By the marble urn baptismal , Standeth two to whom is given A revelation late from heaven ! A piece of clay ! a little breath ! A form to toil and bear its cross Like the Christ of Nazareth ! Now I see a funeral train , Passing sorrowful and slow Through the chiseled portico , Where are shadows sad and solemn Cast by many a fluted column . To the altar 's front they bear Their lifeless charge and leave it there . At the feet and at the head Of the shrived and shrouded dead , Candles burn . The sunlight 's fingers , Dipped in the window 's hues , Throw an iridescent light On the coffin , and it lingers Till the gibbous moon at night , Looking through that painted window , Throws her lovelier tints below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Passes thro ' the porch again , While the bell within the steeple , Throbbeth like a heart in wo ! ' T is gone ! ' t is gone ! I am alone , With the calm , starry night alone , In the old Steeple of St. Ayne ! The chanting , hooded monks are gone ; The marriage train has sought the regions Of the misty Land of Legends ; And the sunshine through the door Sleepeth not upon the floor ; And the dead one , borne so slow Through the friezed portico , Has come back again To the charnel of my brain ! O'er these shadows  --  shadows all  --  Reality has thrown a pall . Yet the steeple loometh still In the shadow of the hill ; Standing , shattered , yet sublime  --  A tombstone to departed Time ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : CHATTERTON. from The bells ( 1855 ) I. This eve my heart is floating upon tears , A fallen rose-leaf floating on a stream . In the dim shadow of departed years I have been lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Chatterton ! That soul which , like the thousand-lanced sun , Ate itself into night ! that monarch soul ! Which foamed and muttered like the sobbing sea , And broke a heart that it could not control . Poor Chatterton ! who does not weep for thee ? What bosom melts not at the mournful tale Of thy short , fevered life ? Thou diedst in scorn , Like the proud moon that doth majestic sail The ebon night , and sinks before the dawn . II . As the soft snow comes down And fills each secret nook , Robing the ice-stilled brook And the house-tops of the town , And the chimneys as they look , With open mouths , to all The flakes , till in a pall Of white the earth is hid ; So did Ambition creep Upon the child unbid . Each grotto of his heart It filled , each crevice deep , E'en as the eye its lid . ' T was of his soul a part . III . ' T was twilight ebb , and the boy was sitting In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across his heart were flitting , Wild as the tracery upon the wall . Upon a stair of stars the Night came down , With footfalls noiseless as the stealthy air , And like a mantle wrapped the shouldered town ; And still the child sat dreaming , brooding there . The moon sleeked " anciente " Bristol with her beams , And from St. Mary 's swelled the midnight chime ; Still sat the boy , his hot brain moulding dreams Which cluster , star-like , on the sky of Time ! ..... ..... V. Morn broke on restless London , like a sea , In rippling waves of light ; the sun sent all The sleepy stars to bed . The great city Was awakened to wrangle in its thrall Of crime and servitude ; and in its streets , Through which the pulse of greedy Traffic beats , The crier 's voice mixed with the rattling wheel ; And all the vast machinery din Went on as if from out that place of sin In the cold night , a spirit did not steal , Winging its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on th ' eternal shore . Morn broke on London , crowning all its spires With gold  --  but Chatterton ! he was no more . VI . In coffin roughly nailed , They placed his boyish form While yet his blood was warm , His forehead scarcely paled ; And bore him quick along Amid the heedless throng . Ah ! cruel hands that laid That little weary frame Within the grave they made , Footnote : 1Kb With nought to tell his name ; It should not have been so ; No pauper ground should own That shattered casket , tho ' The gem itself is gone ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : H. W. L. from The bells ( 1855 ) Like him of old , whose touch divine Drew water from the senseless stone , Thy words have drawn a silver tone Of music from this heart of mine . O Poet-soul ! O gentle one ! Thy thought has made my darkness light ; The solemn Voices of the Night Have filled me with an inner tone . Their echoes linger on my ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long entry to my room ; I almost fancy that I hear A low , sweet breathing at the door , And do not dare to move , for I Would not dispel the fantasy That grows upon me more and more . To gain that near , that far off shore We only cross a bridge of Sleep ; That bridge sinks not into the deep , When we have passed , for evermore . The unfleshed dead can cross again Unto this sphere . O ! I am sure They 're near us , when high thoughts and pure , Like monarchs , pace our chamber 'd brain . O Bard of Shadows ! thine the art To lead us through the realm of dreams . Robing the Real until it seems Of the fair Ideal a part . I 'll drink thy praise in olden wine , And in the cloak of fine conceite I 'll tell thee how my pulses beat , How half my being runs to thine . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : CRESCENT CITY AT NIGHT . SEEN FROM THE FRENCH CATHEDRAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand to sit in this old steeple high , And view the city with its veins of streets ! A muffled sound , like troubled winds that die , Mounts to the house-tops and in space retreats . The soot-faced chimneys whisper far beneath With heads half hidden in their smoky breath ! Now , as Night draws her counterpane of black , And tucks it closely round the horizon , The lamp-fringed streets are lighted one by one  --  Each seems a serpent with a glossy back ! With spectral fingers quiv'ring in the air , The churches point to where " our Father " dwells ; Ava Maria from the tongues of bells Floats to the zenith and the angels there , Who , crowned with asphodel and twilight dim , Are messengers between this world and Him ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : SONG OF A HEART . from The bells ( 1855 ) Ye who love Nature , and in Nature , God , Listen to one whose heart is full of song And gratitude unto his very lips . His music is not art-born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring , Or brooks that babble of their own free will . In the sweet faces of the buds I see The God that swings this flower-scented sphere , Like a great censer , in the purple void ! I have a sense within me that perceives His Presence in the blowing wind , and in The footsteps of the crystal-footed Rain ! To him that holdeth Nature near his heart , The brooks are hymning praises , and the sea Is ever rolling some grand authem forth ! The grass that comes in April to the mounds In grave-yards , and the vines that creep along The humble porch of village churches , are So many fingers pointing up to God ! So many holy monitors that tell His majesty in silent eloquence ! O , Pilgrim to the Unseen Land ! if thou Art thirsty for the Living Waters ; if Thy lips do hunger for the Bread of Life , And yet thou fearest " the cold feel of death , " The grave  --  that gate-way to eternity And Paradise  --  love Nature , for ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : THE ANGEL . from The bells ( 1855 ) O ! memory , the painter ! Limns upon my brain The faces of beloved ones I 'll never see again ! There is one sainted picture  --  O , fancy keep it near !  --  ' Mid golden hair , Madonna eyes , Serene , and deep , and clear . We knew she was an Angel , We knew she could not stay ! And long we waited tearfully To see her fly away ! We knew that she was passing Thro ' life untouched , serene , As far from earth 's impurities As Christ from Magdalene . The Angels wearied for her , And so from Paradise Death came , and kissed her tenderly , His hand upon her eyes ! And as a flower at evening Folds its leaves to rest , She meekly crossed her whitened hands Upon her peaceful breast : Laid so white and beautiful , So full of holy trust , It seemed a shame to lay so pure A flower in the dust . We saw no seraph 's pinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts we felt An Angel 's rustling wings ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : FANNIE. from The bells ( 1855 ) Fannie has the sweetest foot Ever in a gaiter boot ! And the hoyden knows it , And , of course , she shows it ,  --  Not the knowledge , but the foot ,  --  Yet with such a modest grace , Never seems it out of place , Ah , there are not many Half so sly , or sad , or mad , Or wickeder than Fannie . Fannie has the blackest hair Of any of the village girls ; It does not shower on her neck In silken or coquettish curls . It droops in folds around her brow , As clouds , at night , around the moon , Looped with lilies here and there , In many a dangerous festoon . And Fannie wears a gipsy hat , Saucily  --  yes , all of that ! Ah , there are not many Half so sly , or sad , or mad , Or wickeder than Fannie . Fannie wears an open dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half revealing Something far more charming yet . Fannie drapes her breast with lace , As one would drape a costly vase To keep away mischievous flies ; But lace ca n't keep away one 's eyes , For every time her bosom heaves , Ah , it peepeth through it ; Yet Fannie looks the while as if Never once she knew it . Ah , there are not many Half so sly , or sad , or mad , Or innocent as Fannie . Fannie lays her hand in mine ; Fannie speaks with navet , Fannie kisses me , she does ! In her own coquettish way . Then softly speaks and deeply sighs , With angels nestled in her eyes . In the merrie month of May , Fannie swears sincerely She will be my own , my wife , And love me dearly , dearly Ever after all her life . Ah , there are not many Half so sly , or sad , or mad , As my true-hearted Fannie . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : MAUD OF ALLINGGALE. from The bells ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair , As on the turret top she stood ; Her gaze was on the bending wood , And in her eyes a dim despair . Moaning Oenone , sad and pale , Sweet Psyche when her love had gone Were not more tearful or forlorn Than Maud of Allinggale . II . And " Ah , " she said , " he will not come ! And I have waited all the day . " Afar she saw the ocean spray , Like lances glimmer in the gloom . And then the moon came sideling up Deep set within a milky girth : And at the zenith turned on earth Like an inverted cup . III . Two moons o'er sleeping earth had bent , Then stately through the heavens strode , Since Walter from the castle rode Armed cap -- pie for tournament : " O Maud of Allinggale ! " he said , " A little while and I will come , " And fondly o'er her drooped the plume That floated from his head . IV . She heard his footsteps on the floor , She saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his greaves ; And he was gone  --  for ever more ; For in the heart of that green wood , Unknown , unseen by mortal eyes , The Castle of a Thousand Dyes Of fairy Monok stood . V. This queen immortal loved the knight , And so she sent an airling brood To lead him thro ' the bosky wood Until he knew no left nor right ; And as he paused upon a steep That rose from out a fountain place , They sprinkled dew-drops on his face , And so he fell asleep . VI . And two white-breasted wood-nymphs took The dreaming youth in their soft arms , And bore him where a row of Palms Shaddowed a draw-bridge on the brook ; And ' tween two cedars , old and gaunt , Their summits tinged with yellow light , They passed , and bore the sleeping knight Into the fairy haunt . VII . They took the helmet from his brow , Unlaced his breast-plate , white as milk , And draped him with a robe of silk Glittering like a frozen snow ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Walter 's made , And laid it in the forest glade As though that he were dead . PART II . I. When Walter woke his dream-filled eyes Were dazzled with the rainbow light ; " St. George ! " he cried , " I 'm lost to sight And sense , be this not Paradise ! " He heard the trembles of a lute , He saw the fountains leap in air , And spread around him everywhere The most delicious fruit . II . And chalices ambrosial brimmed , Flagons of the costliest wine Fresh from the vineyards of the Rhine , And honey from the richest skimmed ; Rich cordials full of golden eyes ; And delicacies of all isles , Scattered around him , in huge piles Lay like wrecked argosies . III . The trilling of a thousand birds Burst on him with canorous swells , And the faint tinkling of far bells Came rustling through his sense 's chords . The walls were rough with priceless stones , The window niches diamond-laid , And the long fluted colonnade Was girt with wealth of zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep The eye could scarcely reach half through ; E'en music 's echo weary grew , And tripping through them fell asleep ! Upon his raptured senses stole The rarest perfume of the spheres Rich with the crystal , star-born tears Found in the rose 's bowl . V. " What mystic things will fancy do ! " He said , and , as he spoke , white hands Undid the glitt'ring silver bands That held a gorgeous curtain to , And drawing back the silken screen His eyes beheld , on throne of gold , Like Egypt 's courtesan of old , Monok , the fairy Queen . VI . " O ! thou that sittest goddess like ! " He , kneeling , cried before the throne , " Tell me if all my brain be gone ! And what these wondrous scenes that strike My fancy captive ? Whence thou art ? And whence this dulcet melody ? These nectar-laden gales , and why This rustling in my heart ? " VII . Then rich she made him with a smile , And sweeping from her throne with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Half laughing at him all the while ; And to his ear bent down her head , With voice that had a cymbal 's ring " Sir Knight of Ainsworth thou art king Of this domain ! " she said . VIII . She led him to the ' nameled throne , And placed a crown upon his brow , And kneeling at his footstool low , " Sir Knight , " she said , " I am thine own ! " Her breath , like a soft summer gale Nursed in the heart of some sweet grot , Was on his cheek , and he forgot His Maud of Allinggale ! PART III . I. As Lady Maud , heart-sick and pale , From Ainsworth 's tower watched that night , She saw a strange and flick'ring light Moving across the darkened vale ; And nearer , nearer still it came , Until she saw amid the gloom The floating of a snowy plume . Her lips half breathed a name . II . And down the spiral stair she sped , And in the long torch-lighted hall She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . O ! wild and mournful was her wail ! Pale Venus when Adonis died Had not a sorrow wilder-eyed , Than Maud of Allinggale . III . " Whose hand did this ? " and then a flood Of tears o'er her eyelids broke ; And thus the knight of Lydwick spoke : " We found him slain in yonder wood , His red blood mingling with the brook , And his large thoughtful , staring eyes Fixed on a cloudlet in the skies With melancholy look . IV . " We know not how Sir Walter fell ; But if ' t was in concerted fight , We know he fell like a true knight . Who struck the blow , it were not well That he a knight of Ainsworth meet ; We ' d teach him that our Walter 's death Has made ten swords in each sheath , And he should kiss our feet ! " V. Then Lady Maud bent down her head Upon the image 's cold breast , Like one that lieth down to rest ; They spoke to her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale ? In Ainsworth chapel , side by side , Lies Walter 's armor and his bride , Sweet Maud of Allinggale . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : TO MARIE . from The bells ( 1855 ) As sea-shells whisper of the sleepless sea , Memory whispers of the past and you , Charming my bosom with its melody . Those summer nights , which all too quickly flew , Like singing birds upon their noiseless wings , Ghost-like rise up before me , and I turn To sip the chalice pleasing mem'ry brings . There is one eve I cherish in my breast Like holy water in a marble urn : The sun was treading to the yawning West  --  To that great grave-yard of the buried Days ! And at our feet a devious river rolled , Squirming and gliding in the sunset 's blaze , Like a great serpent with a skin of gold ! We had been reading a young Bard , who 'd stemmed The sea of criticism , and unfurled His daring colors to a charmed world ; In his rich heart our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears , and there stood Two , trembling , on the threshold of your eyes . O ! much , my friend , I envied him who could Lure two such angels out of paradise . You bent above me , and your nighty hair , Like dusk and sunset mixing , mixed with mine ; I felt a kiss , or ' t was a passing air That had been loitering on lips divine . Then you drew back , and with a crimson look Gazed at the pebbles in the talking brook . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : THE KNIGHT OF POESY. from The bells ( 1855 ) Another Minstrel , panting for a name , Enters the lists of Rhyme To run a tilt with Time , And bring , low kneeling at his feet , great Fame . With wizard down , he comes as one in mask , Like some adventurer of old Who , till he won the Spurs of Gold , Laid not aside his hauberk or his casque ; He comes , his name and prowess all untold . Unknown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Seeketh the Tournament of Poesy , Full of the hope of glorious deed ; And dares in deadly fight  --  Invoking first his patron Muse  --  All knights that speak maliciously ; All that discourteously refuse To press their goblet 's mouth of wine , When he shall give as toast divine , His Ladye-love , the loveliest of the Nine  --  Dark-veiled Melpomene ! For Beauty  --  be it in A blue-bell 's or a woman 's eyes , A rose 's or a maiden 's lips in bloom , A forest , waving like a helmet plume , Or the soft tintings of the sunset skies  --  He has a soul that claims the chance To blunt a sword or to break a lance . Beauty 's champion , he is Virtue 's too ; For are not grace and goodness sisters twin ? Virtue is a beauty that within Sheds radiance without , as does a light Through the windows of a room at night , Or flowers , breathing from a vase , Or jewels from their case . He loves all forms of loveliness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with magic tenderness . The air-winged birds that dart Up the blue stair-case of the porphyry clouds ; The Autumn-fingered foliage that shrouds A sleeping church-yard , or the evening dim , Stalking majestically down Upon the noisy and mast-fringd town , Or the winged and ever restless ships , Or the murmuring of Ocean 's lips , Are everlasting joys to him ; For he is one whose bosom doubted never " A thing of beauty " is " a joy forever . " His war-cry shall be heard ; It is that mystic word Which , on a banner in the twilight brown , A youth once carried thro ' an Alpine town  --  Excelsior ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : A CHRISTMAS CHIME . THE GUESTS , AND WHAT THE STRANGE OLD MAN DOES IN THE OLD HOUSE EVERY CHRISTMAS NIGHT . from The bells ( 1855 ) " All houses wherein men have lived and died , Are haunted houses . "  --  Longfellow . The angels bend in heaven 's arch to-night , And sprinkle snowflakes on the city 's streets ; The wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one it meets . The lamps that stud the white and pearld way , Glare like mad demons thro ' the blinding storm ; Shop-windows watch the snow sprites as they play , Or throw their rays upon each passing form . ' T is Christmas night ; and while from street to street , The echo hurries , like a startled mouse , And phantom laughs are mingling with the sleet , An Old Man sits within an olden house . The house is quaint , odd-fashioned , and antique ; Grim Time has passed his palm across the roof And left it wrinkled ! ' T is so dark and bleak At twilight play the children keep aloof . There 's not a sound in all its sombre halls , And brooding silence sits upon the stair ; One can most see the " quiet as it crawls " Along the entry through the biting air . Why sits the Old Man in the big old room , Watching the hearth-light o'er the mouldings climb ? The man and chamber in its ghostly gloom Seem things forgotten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wide-mouthed hearth ? Does he call up sweet forms that , like the leaves , Have mixed with flowers in the wombed earth ? Or does he hear the hail upon the eaves ? The jingling sleigh-bells in the street below , The goblin sleet that droppeth down the flue , The huntsman wind that whistles to the snow  --  Are these the noises that he listens to ? Or does he catch the echoes of the Past , Like fine vibrations of a distant bell ? Do memories fall on him thick and fast As hail without upon the snowy swell ? I wot not either ; but the Old Man seems A link between this mortal life and death  --  A dreamy pilgrim to the Land of Dreams , His life , a feather balanced on a breath . He bends his head ; he hears the panels creak ; Then by the chimney leaves his cushioned chair ; And , with a joy his moistened eyelids speak , He draws three seats beside his own with care . He holds his old hands out , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sighs ; Now stands as if within some loving clasp  --  His eyes intently gaze in other eyes ! And now he points his phantom guests their seats . He heaps fresh fuel upon the fire-place ; And all is still , save one quick heart that beats In yonder clock , within its coffin case . O , what a queer Old Man ! And does he see Ethereal spirits seated in those chairs ? Do souls come back from God 's eternity To mingle with us and our daily cares ? I do believe it ! and ' t is grand to feel That , when the breezes lift our fevered hair , Some friend 's hand does it , and at ev'ry meal The loved are near us , round us like the air ! I do believe they 're with us all the day , And o'er our holier hours vigils keep ; That they kneel with us when we kneel to pray , And bend above us when we fall asleep . But see , he smiles ! O sure some airy one Has twined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , a voice for him alone  --  We hear it not , nor see the ghost that trips Around the arm-chair of the dreamy man . A lip intangible his own lip nears ; It falls so kindly on his thin cheek wan , The Old Man weeps , and slumbers in his tears . And every year when holy Christmas comes , He draws those chairs within the hearth-stone gleams , And fondly all his viewless household sums , Then falls asleep ' mid kisses , tears , and dreams . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : EUDELE. from The bells ( 1855 ) The soft wind moved the curtain 's fold , And rippled her gold waves of hair , While like some voiceless lily 's lip , Touched by a gentle whiff of air , Moved as by inward melody , Her lips were trembling with a prayer , Which lark-like soared from out this world of sin . " To-morrow , " and she raised her eyes , " I 'll walk with Christ in Paradise . " And thro ' the window came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fold , And cooled her cheek with kisses faint ; And as she lay upon the bed , The curls that clustered o'er her head Were like the halo of a saint . A light was breaking on her lips , Like that which tinges mountain tips At death of August days ; While with her on the pillow lay The golden parasites of day  --  The sunset 's amber rays . The flowers closed their eyelids up ; The harebell and the butter-cup , The tulip and the sun-struck jessamine . With whispered sighs and dainty feet , The evening zephyrs tripped about ; Then , as a flower yields its sweet , A pure spirit flitted out , And thro ' the window came the Twilight in . We hid her in a green retreat , With daisies at her heart and feet , To guard her with sweet eyes ; And when we weep Eudele as dead , We smile to think of what she said Of " Christ " and " Paradise "  --  Of that far sphere where neither sin Nor sombre Twilight enter in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DRIP . A RAINY DAY LYRIC . from The bells ( 1855 ) All through that dreariest day , Out of the window pane We gazed , but our eyes could see The rain ,  --  nothing but rain . Drip , drip , drip , It said to the sullen eaves ; Drip , drip , drip , And danced upon the leaves . The flowers that clomb the porch , Violets like the skies , Grew as dreamy and dim as A tearful maiden 's eyes . Drip , drip , drip , It said to the sullen eaves ; Drip , drip , drip , And trembled on the leaves . A thrill , like a thrill of joy , Ran through the fields of grain ; And they bowed their heads beneath The blessing of the rain ! Drip , drip , drip , It said to the sullen eaves ; Drip , drip , drip , And danced upon the leaves . The barn grew solemn and brown , The white-washed fence and wall ; And the " poplars " at the gate Looked odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drip , It said to the sullen eaves ; Drip , drip , drip , And trembled on the leaves . When seated around the hearth  --  The evening meal was through  --  We could hear the cunning rain Come singing down the flue . Drip , drip , drip , It said to the sullen eaves ; Drip , drip , drip , And danced upon the leaves . And when we went to our beds , Still we could hear the rain ; It tried the kitchen door , and Spit on the window pane ! Drip , drip , drip , It said to the sullen eaves ; Drip , drip , drip , And trembled on the leaves . Still does it haunt our dreams , that Weariest , dreary rain , That came from the mouths of clouds , To bless the golden grain ! Drip , drip , drip , It says to the sullen eaves ; Drip , drip , drip , And trembles on the leaves . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : TOUSOULIA . A LEGEND OF THE MOHEGAN. from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , And like a fallen giant lay the sun Aslant the silent trees . Tousoulia Was sad . The maiden had been waiting through Three crescent moons ; had marked them orb and go , Like dreamy Houris , down the stairs of night To bathe in mists behind the purple hills ; And yet her Indian warrior came Not back . Thus to the stream that wandered by , Thus to the shadows of the coming night Tousoulia made her moan : " The autumn has been breathing on the leaves , And burnt them into redness with her lips ; And I am sadder than the Whip-po-will . " The summer birds have floated to the south ; My lonely heart is vacant as their nests  --  It shall be empty till my Chief comes home ! " There are no footfalls that can make me glad , There are no warblings of the lover 's lute , At eventide , outside the wigwam door . " No tender hands caress me as they used ; Only the lips of moonbeams kiss my breast ; And I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and is the trail so long , Three moons must stalk between thee and thy bride ? She waits for thee as eagerly , Lenape , " As Earth for Spring to kiss it into buds ! The Bending Lily yearns for him who will Made her as happy as a humming bird ! " And softly with her foot she stirred A clump of water-lilies , and then grew as mute As moulting robins . Like a lark that skims The outer surface of cerulean Clouds , shot a canoe from out the shadow Of the trailing trees ; and , like a blood-hound On its mistress ' knee , it placed its long head On the beach . Another and another , And a third ; while from them leaped a score of Painted braves . So softly came they , the Mohegan girl Perceived them not till some dry branches cracked Beneath their feet ; then , springing up , she threw Her arms around the neck of one who stalked Majestically as a king  --  ' t was not Lenape . All rich with blushes she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into The Indian village . The Council fire Leaped high that night ; a scalping party that Had been three moons away , came opulent In deeds and trophies back . And there were Praises and welcomings for the returned , Wailings and wild sorrowing for the dead . The hungry fire was fed with brushwood ; high Into the night its flaming arms were stretched Like one in prayer . Without the reaches of Its radiancy stood Tousoulia , With heart as full of tears as a cloud in April time . Each warrior told his Own exploits with a wild eloquence ; then As the calm of stagnant winds before the Lightning , with its fiery finger , pricks The swollen cloud , and deluges the earth With most delicious tears , a silence fell Upon the plumed and dusky throng . Then , like The moanings of a distant ocean , broke Upon a hundred swarthy lips the name Of all names that Tousoulia loved . War Eagle rose ; the hair had fallen from His aged head as leaves from the grand oak In autumn winds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Father scalps the forest trees , And we have laid our store of bear-meat in , Our young men must take panther skins and corn To Nemhaw 's wigwam , for he hath no son ! " The speaker paused , and thro ' the stillness trilled A laugh so fearful that the couchant braves Sprang to their feet ; the sleepy watch curs howled , And frighted squaws drew nearer to the fire . Tousoulia pressing through the wildered Throng , stood by the crackling fire scornfully . " The great Mohegan is not dead ! " she cried . " I hear the paddles of his bark canoe Afar , afar ! " she paused like one that hears A sound i ' the distance . " He will come . I 'll wait For him . He pants beneath the weight of scalps ! The great Mohegan is not dead ! " Alas ! in the too sudden shock of wo , her brain Had lost its equipoise , and her mind went Wandering , like a bird whose nest has been Destroyed . Through weary length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet , the live long day , among The globes of water-lilies , and ' t was thus She made her moan unto the listening wood , And to the mouthing wind , and to the stream Whose voice was like the music of her own : " When wilt thou come ? and is the trail so long , Three moons must stalk between thee and thy bride , Whose heart is empty as a last year 's nest ? " And to this day the spot is pointed out Where sat the maniac girl , and saw three Summers drop in leafy graves , waiting for Him who never , never came to make her " Happy as a humming bird .

And thoughts with eager footsteps , Dim thoughts of joy and pain , Filled the streets and by-ways of The city in my brain . A passing light and holy Like that which softly falls Through open gates in cloudlets Upon cathedral walls , Fell upon the towers of The city in my mind ; My inward sight grew clearer My outward vision blind . Forgotten was the window ; There seemed no street below , I did not see them passing , The shadows , to and fro .

To-night , before the supper lamps were lit , The poor wind whistled such a doleful tune My eyelids swelled like rain-fed clouds in June ; I drew my arm-chair near the hearth , to sit And form the embers into figures quaint ; I fancied Vikings , bridges , castles drear ; But ah ! that Wind , now growing loud , now faint , Hung like a guilty conscience on my ear . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : IMORE . A LEGEND OF THE MINSTREL TIMES . from The bells ( 1855 ) One day while sitting in the dim old woods , Charmed with the braided notes of brooks and birds , Sleep stole upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon violets , And lilies stood on tip-toe to his lips . As thus he slept , an angel dropped among The flowerets , the Lady Volant and The Earl went by and saw him slumbering ; And ever after in the maiden 's dream , Was Imore sleeping by the rivulet . Ah , he beheld her on that summer day Through the sly openings of his roguish eyes ; And she was queenly as a budded moon ! Peerless as she whose nectared kisses cost Mark Antony a kingdom ! And he turned From gay to sad , and haunted the old wood ; His cheeks grew pale as lilies in a rill ; He sang no longer like a morning lark , But hummed around the lindens like a bee . Once Lady Volant loved to sit and watch From Odenwald 's high tower , the red sun Folding his purple pinions for the eve , And the clear stars that cluster thick upon The arch of night , like watery diamonds On a ring of jet . But now she strayed far In the leafy glens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunset gives , Came melancholy with the twilight home . One eve as she was roving thro ' the glade , She found the minstrel sleeping as before Upon a couch of violets  --  as once Diana found Endymion asleep , Loving him ever after  --  and from out His parted lips his breath came like the breath Of hyacinths . Then whispered Volant Softly to herself , " Methinks I could such Honied sweetness from those full lips draw , as Does a bee from the sweet honeysuckle . Now by the blood that circles in these veins And prompts me in this most delicious freak ! I 'll taste them , and if he awakes I 'll swear That ' t was some spirit kissed him in his dream , Not I ; that I 'm the daughter of an earl And would not stoop to press a common lip : Then I 'll sweep by , majestic as the Night . " Then , like a rain-bow , she bent over him , With all the hues of autumn on her cheeks . Raising the fringd curtains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck And punished her with kisses ! She drew back With angered orbs ; then blushed , then thro ' the wood Leaped the silvery echoes of her laugh . And then she called him " cruel , cruel boy , " And asked him if the blue-bells did not close Their eyes with envy , when he looked at them ; And then she laid her hand among his curls . The evening melted , and night found them there  --  Cupid and Psyche wooing in a wood ! " There is a clime , " he said , " a far off land Of orange-bowers and magnolia trees , With streams of gold fish gurgling ' mong the hills ; Where winter never throws a pall upon The sweet-lipped flowerets , and May and June Go , hand in hand , throughout the live-long year !

She went with blossoms in the spring , And shall I see her never ? Ah , yes ! for those who love , love on Forever and forever .

Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : II . PHOeBUS . from The bells ( 1855 ) Dew-dappled Phoebus , with half-shaded eye , Stalks through the portals of the eastern skies ; The stars that drop above the world on high , Beneath his gaze close their cloud-lidded eyes ; He taps the dreaming city till it wakes And hums and murmurs like an o'er turned hive ; With twit'ring birds the forest is alive , And bends to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft zephyr breaks , Bearing the perfume from the gummy pines ; Flowers , the drinking-cups of the god-sun , Are brimmed with dew .

THE NIGHT RAIN . from The bells ( 1855 ) Piteous Rain ! O how it sobs without ! Driven from Heaven like a sinning child , Thrust from the Gates by scolding winds and wild , It wanders weary , drearily about . At me it peereth through the window panes , And almost asks if I would let it in  --  I 'm not proclivous , weeping child of sin . Then off it speeds and curses and complains ; Its footfalls sound with quick and nervous beat On dismal miles of dimly-lighted street . It pauses oft , as if its tim'rous ear Had caught a sound  --  ' t was only sighing leaves  --  Then rushes onward with a trembling fear , And seeks to hide beneath protruding eaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THANATOPSIS.

Yet I do know of a sublimer joy Possessing which I would not envy him  --  O faith ! the alchemist that turns th ' alloy Of death to golden calm .

He wrestled nobly with his fate , And strove to mask his soul 's distress ; He passed , a spectre , through the gate Of death alone and shadowless . He was to me most like a stream Which , in some darkened vein of earth Flows thro ' its rocky bowels , but To daylight never bubbles forth .

The Lighthouse with its eye of fire looked o'er the breakers swell , Standing all calm and solemn , like some watchful sentinel ; And o'er the undulating lands our stretching eyes would mark Old Portsmouth 's spires tapering up half-way to meet the dark . Low at our feet the ocean broke in long and frothy rolls , And like a gem upon its breast we saw the Isle of Shoals ! O ! dear to me the Fort , the town , the dimpled ocean 's moan , But dearer was the gentle hand I held within my own ! Like a lion that is wounded , but in scorn disdains to groan , Creeps to some secretest cavern there to bleed and die alone , The sun in sullen majesty was creeping to his lair , His jagged sides a-panting and his red eye-balls a-glare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeweled sea , And laid her lily hand upon the Light-house on the lee ; And touched the rocky bastion and the ramparts of the Fort , And ran along the sleepy guns that gaped from ev'ry port . It was a moon that might have lured the Mermaids from their caves , From out the glaucous grottoes of their realms beneath the waves , To sit upon the sloping strand and comb from out their hair The sea-weed , and to have a chat with loving Mermen there . O ! dear to me the Fort and town asleep in light divine ; But dearer than the landscape was the hand I held in mine ! In brilliant , starry necklaces and bridal sheen arrayed , The Moon stood out in heaven like a pale unwilling maid ; She loved the dewy Morning with his yellow curls of light ; She 's doomed to wed another and to be the bride of Night . I whispered this to Lillie as she turned her eyes above ; " ' T is sad , " she said , " ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The hand I pressed too ardently was drawn away from mine , And eyes were turned toward me all bewitchingly divine ; I dared to take that hand again and soothe it in my own ; I dared to steal my arm around a half reluctant zone ; I told her how the waters kissed the islands in their sport , And  --  we neither saw the Lighthouse , the islands , nor the Fort !

( PRELUDE AFTER TENNYSON. ) from The bells ( 1855 ) It happened on a summer day that Hall And Walter Everland , a young poet , And Arthur Thornburn and my humble self , Were in a church-yard near th ' Academy , Reading odd epitaphs . And tired out , We stretched ourselves beneath the wedded boughs , Of some tall lindens by the river side , Cheating the laggard moments of their prey Of weariness in drawing similes From clouds , and trees , and rocks . Each one in turn , Putting some question to the other three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is this grave-yard like ? " Then Hall replied , " ' T is like a bee-hive with the bees Dead in their cells !

" And Walter said , " A flower garden where are sown By Christ the seeds of many flowerets , To blossom Resurrection Morn ! " And then we smiled , and placed upon his head With loving hands a daisy wreath . Who looks in the mild eyes of Faith , can draw Sweet fancies from the realm of Death .

That ancient House might tell a startling tale Could its cracked wainscots and dark closets speak ; A tale to make the laughing lip turn pale And send the heart 's blood bubbling to the cheek . Ere I was born , when my grandsire was young , A legend curious , rather wild withall , Around that lonely mansion hung ; And at some future time , Should I possess the quantity of rhyme , That legend shall be sung . Those chambers drear , deserted save by storms , Shall hear again the pleading Lover 's sigh ; I 'll clutch the Past ! bring back its phantom forms , And light with passion many an orbless eye . From disused graveyards of this dear old town , I 'll drag the helpless and long slumbering dead ; With plumes I 'll deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a fleshless heel ; Marshall the dead in some undying fight , Robe them in silks as if for banquet night  --  The flippant Fop , the Warrior in his steel ! ..... O , let me tell thee one thing , trembling House ! That in thy days of former pomp gone by , When light feet danced where crawls secure the mouse , And thy bare walls were hung with drapery  --  I tell thee truly  --  when thy haunted halls Were scenes of Bridal , Birth , and Revelry , And Funeral wails resounded in thy walls , None in those hours of pain and joy gone by Could love thee then more fondly now than I. Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : MY HIGHLAND MARY . from The bells ( 1855 ) How sweetly comes the picture now !  --  The breathless wood , that August noon , When ' mong the panting leaves you sang " Ye banks and braes o ' bonnie Doon !

" The very streamlets , gurgling low , On happy ways did tarry , And whispering zephyrs ceased their sighs To hear my Highland Mary ! Was ever moon more milky white , Did ever stream have softer swells , Than when at Sagamore I heard The music of " Those Evening Bells ! " Ah , memory calls each cadence back And trembles with a dim delight ; And Fancy listens till it hears The warblings of that " Stilly Night ! " The very streamlets , gurgling low , On happy ways did tarry , And whispering zephyrs ceased their sighs To hear my Highland Mary ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : TWILIGHT IDYL. from The bells ( 1855 ) I. How softly comes the Evening down And weds the vapors of the town ! Bending o'er its tumult wild As above her restless child Bends the mother , singing lowly Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour Have a deep , a touching power ; Distant sounds seem clearer , nearer , And the Dead are nearer , dearer ! Forms and faces seem to wear Touches of diviner air . III . ' Neath the glimpses of the moon , Flowers pale , and droop , and swoon , Truant streams steal out of glens , Over violet-scented fens , Through the tall grass of the meadow , Throwing back Diana 's shadow . IV . The phantom fingers of the Breeze Play upon the slumberous trees Their wondrous , untaught minstrelsy ! Making every leaf a key ! Every twig a flat or sharp ! Every sycamore a harp ! V. The music voice of distant rills Humming in the hearts of hills Steals upon me like a stream Of music thro ' a saddened dream , Or , as with a murmuring breath Thoughtful memory whispereth . VI . And , more charming than the chimes Floating through a poet 's rhymes , From the hill-brows and the dells Comes a tinkling tongue that tells Of grazing herd , while from the hill Pipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly down Upon my heart as on the town ; Bends above its tumult wild As above her restless child Bends the mother , singing lowly Some refrain of melancholy . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : THE GOLDEN ISLAND . from The bells ( 1855 ) I. I know an Island sitting in the sea , As stately as a God ! With great blue waves forever at its feet Cringing like worshipers ! And when the crowned sun Urges his hot steeds thro ' the gates of day , A golden shower falls on it the while . Queen Cleopatra never bore A brighter jewel on her bosom 's swell Than seems this Island sitting in the sea . II . And when the coy young Moon Becomes enamored of her beauty in the wave , As did Narcissos in the minstrel 's rhyme  --  That sea-kist isle is flushed with silver light , And Beauty like a spirit haunteth it . O ! it was grand of April nights to hear That strange old ocean talking to himself ! Though Autumn blasts have filled them since , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all summer haunt That Golden Island sitting in the sea . III . I 've but to close my eyes , and I behold Those curving wavelets in the cold moonlight , Tumbling above each other on the shore , Showing the stars their red phosphoric veins ! O sprite of Thought ! thy dainty fingers wipe The city 's dust from out my blinded eyes . Like Him that called dead Lazarus from the tomb , Thou call'st " Come forth ! " and lo ! The buried Past lifts up its coffin lid , And stalketh forth with dust upon his brow ! Twelve of the eighteen Summers of my life , Like Twelve white Maidens tending on a Queen , Stand , flower-decked , round Memory ! O , thou fine sprite ! what treasures thou hast piled In the mind 's store-house ! Memory unlocks The tomb of the departed Years , and shows Them in their royalty stretched out like Kings ! O ! sweet the pictures that she brings to me  --  Dim woods with pulses of a scented wind , And twilight shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms and faces that in soul-land move ; But dearer than the first of these , That Golden Island setting in the sea . IV . olus is a king there , And his rough-tuned lips Voice sea-born melodies for Neptune 's ear ! And Echo 's hoyden daughters sit Upon the rocks , and mimic ocean , Who moans all the while , like an old man Whose years have led him to the gate of Death . The sea-gulls screech around it , And the lark above Hangs a sweet drop of music in the air ! O ! ' t is a spot fit for a Deity , Grand as the isles of the Hesperides , That Golden Island sitting in the sea . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : THE BARD . from The bells ( 1855 ) Quaint-thoughted Rumor whispered of a Name , And said that Fame had set another star Within the glorious galaxy that brows Old England 's forehead ! and that she had paused , And had been listening to a Titan bard Attentively as Summer to the Wren ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose veins ran red blood as beautiful As pulses of the purple wine ; his song As the full gushes of a ripening soul  --  Rare music drops wrung out by anguish from A heart sphered with humanity , a-flush With inward Spring , and drunk with love of this Dear World . One that made Fate a menial , And with a holy purpose in his soul , Rose from obscurity above his peers Like a full moon that leaves a dismal swamp And sits in heaven ' mong the stars and night ! Not long I waited for the winds to waft This freighted soul o'er the Atlantic wave ; For soon the Western Hemisphere bursts forth In murmurs , like a Memnon touched at morn . And well I knew that proud Columbia hailed Another son of song , and stretched her hands To laurel him . His Book came ; and I felt The Passion that ran through it like a vein , Was born of Genius , and that the skill Which flung his fevered being into song , Would write his name upon the hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I read and read until my heart was flushed With a new pleasure ; a diviner Light Came on me , and its golden-fingers touched My being into tears , as the lightning Breaks a cloud and ravishes its wealth of Rain . I read and read , and tho ' my eyes grew Dim with weariness , my soul still thirsted For those draughts of thought inspiring as Wine ! And all one summer day I bent above His book , like a pale lily o'er a stream , And saw my own heart-fancies mirrored on His page with wilder beauty . . . . I read and read until the day and dusk In married colors flooded through the blinds , And darkness laid his black hand on the page . And with the taper burning at my side , The Midnight came upon me ere I 'd done With stars like drops of fire upon her breast ! I turned to look at them and wondered why Such God-like beauty doomed the sinful world . I thought of those great souls that , dying , leave Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives with some great Wrong , As Jacob did with the mysterious Angel one long still night at Penuel . Dear God ! when will Contention come and sleep In the soft lap of Peace ? And when shall Right Throw off its galling chains , as in the spring The brooks leap from their icy manacles With an exuberance of joy ? Dear God ! When this is so , shall not the Sun go down Upon the world with a great flushing light , And rise amid a chorus of the stars In Paradise ? Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : HOPE . AN EXCERPT FROM AN ANCIENTE RIME. from The bells ( 1855 ) When from darke chaos was create ye earthe , When first ye sun glowed from its heighte , When Nature gave ye pond'rous mountains birthe , And stretched from pole to pole . ' T was then that Hope with calm cerulean eye , Ne decked in statelie robes of Pride , Descended from her throne on highe And sought alike ye rich and poor man 's side , To soothe his woe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a brighter garbe . She woke ye slumbering Genius , bade him rise ; From Sorrow 's eye she wiped ye falling tear , Smiled sweetlie on Ambition 's soaring eyes , And hovered even o'er Death 's gloomy bier . Who ceased to smile she bade them smile agayne And in anticipation , banished present payne ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : LILLYAN. from The bells ( 1855 ) O , dreamy-eyd maiden ! With Peri beauty laden , Lillyan ! did thy southern skies Blend those sea-shell dyes On thy soft cheeks , Lillyan ? Lillyan sits through April noons In the shadow of the eaves Twining flowerets in her hair : I would be the crumpled leaves On the breast of Lillyan ! Dainty Lady Lillyan . Her sweet face haunts me where I rove , Her sunny glances bless me , Her gentler smiles caress me , And , O ! my soul 's a-flush with love Of that sad gipsy , Lillyan . Lillyan in a place of flowers Slept one summer day ; Lillyan did not hear my footsteps As I passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long nectared kiss Upon the lips of Lillyan , The rare-ripe lips of Lillyan ! And she oped her frighted eyes With a glance of scorn , For the proudest little Lady That was ever born Is this self-same Lillyan , This dainty darling Lillyan . Like a shattered April rainbow Up the skies , I saw the blood go Through the cheeks of Lillyan ; And then kneeling at her feet , " Did the kiss I gave thee , Sweet , Fall on those red lips with such pain ? " She said " Yes ! take it back again . "  --  O ! that roguish Lillyan . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : IV . SCENE OF BLANCHETTE. from The bells ( 1855 ) Scene IV . A road by the church-yard of Eld ; the town and the Castles of Craige and Edenwold seen in the distance .  --  Blanchette and Ivan sitting near the gate . BLANCHETTE . Wilt thou not Finish , Ivan , the sad tale that thou wert Telling me last eve ? I feel my path Has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IVAN . Where left I off ? BLANCHETTE . ' T was where they dragged thee in a noisome cave After the battle , faint with heavy chains , And streaked with thine own blood . IVAN . O , let the Past Sleep in a shroud ! Why should we ever strew The thorns of olden sorrows on our way  --  The memory of wilted hopes  --  when joys Of present blossoming , like roses , wait For plucking ? BLANCHETTE . It is these sombre phases Of our lives that make the bright seem brighter . In the soft blending of the light and shade All of the limner 's cunning lies . We find No joy till we have had a twilight on The heart . We can not see the sun , ' less It is partly dimmed with clouds , for it would Dazzle us . And if bliss should , like rivers , Ever through our beings leap , we would grow Surfeited and sick , like pet canaries Fed on lucious sweets . Is it not so ? IVAN . O , thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! To thee , whose spirit wears on earth A pure touch of heaven 's divinity , Those things are plain , that unto coarser souls Seem swathed in darkness . O my better heart ! My soul-philosopher ! teach me thy faith , Thy subtle faith , that sees in every wo An Angel masking or a Joy disguised ! BLANCHETTE . Wilt thou not tell the tale ? ' T is such a one As should be told at sunset , when the clouds Turn their flushed faces on departing day , And then grow sad and sadder by degrees , As the great orb hides underneath the earth ! Tell me it quickly ! or the dusk will set Its signet on the zenith , and the night Will cap it with a moon . IVAN . ' T was a great cave Where sunbeams never were , and night and day Were one ; full of dark precipices , Yawning and moaning ever , and deep streams Writhing and squirming , like black serpents , ' mong Stalagmites centuries old . Echo roamed Through all the caverns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadences . In the unearthly light of burning brands , Forms , more horrible than those of Comus And his crew , dug in the rocky-veind ribs And in the bowels of their prison house , Bringing forth precious jewels . Men were there Who never saw the sun , nor felt the breath Of evening on their cheeks . Born in that realm Of Cerberus , at tales of planates poised In viewless air ; earth 's ragged cloak of snow ; The Sister Months , and crystal tides , and ships They 'd ope their eyes with wonderment ; and birds With hearts of melody were myths to them . Here did I dwell the long and lonely years ; The hours went by as slow and sombrely As funeral trains  --  each bore a dead hope With it . Even now , in this rich moment Of serenest bliss , the thoughts of that drear Cave , fall on my heart like clouds , darkening it . I 'll not let these cold and clammy mem'ries Finger the gilt from off this golden hour ! No more ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Of this dark episode in my heart 's Life ! BLANCHETTE . What ! leave it all unfinished like a strain Of music broken by the wind ? Oh , no ! Tell what kind angel took thee by the hand And through those palaces , stalactite hung , Led thee to rosy daylight and to me . IVAN . An angel ! Ah , thou sayest rightly , for It was . If ever God sent angel to This earth , Madene was one . A miner 's child , Born in the rocky navel of that cave , She grew up with strange thoughts , wild joys , and tears Ran thro ' her being like rare music thro ' A dream . Her soul lay in her hazel eyes Like a white lily in a brook . There was An atmosphere of purity around Her , and of love , a tenderness , a grace That loving nature robed her with , not art . She was a star in that dark spot , a light Gilding the darkness . BLANCHETTE . And you loved her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness With the gentlest care , and sang low songs And soothed me like a child . ' T is not ' mid thrones And palaces we find the noblest hearts . Costlier diamonds are hid in the earth Than ever yet have decked a coronal . In the lone paths and by-ways of this world , Souls , rich in their own wealth , spring up and die Like flowerets unnoticed . She was one That shall make heaven beautiful , and earth Is lovelier while she lives . Through weary , Weary nights and days o ' pain she tended me . When strength returned , my grateful lips were filled With language ; but how beggared ' t was to clothe The promptings of my soul . I spoke to her Of " home "  --  " dear home " framed like a picture in My thought ; of one that waited for me , with Heart-trembles and most anxious eyes ; and she Would drink my words in with a thirsty ear . When thro ' the toil of day , I 'd sit me down Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dull deaf caves , She 'd find me ever , and sit at my feet . Once , as I told her of thee , Blanch , starting From out a seeming reverie , she cried , " Tell me no more of this dark-tressd one ! I love thee , stranger of the outer world ! Have loved since first our glances met ; my mouth Has burned upon thy forehead in thy sleep ; Mine eyes have fed on thee while wrapped in dreams ! " " O , say not so , " I whispered , " say not so ! Thou art much dearer to me than my life ; ' T were thine could it but serve thee ;  --  but my love  --  I beg thee do not ask it . " Her hand fell Coldly on my own . " ' T was a wild , wild dream , " She said , " but over now . We will no more Of it . From this time forward I have one Great aim in life  --  thy liberty ; for she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have worshiped her , so full of holiness She seemed , so full of paradise . Blanchette , I do believe this world is linked to that Next better world by souls like her 's . BLANCHETTE . And I. She must have fallen through the fingers of The angels , ( never meant for earth ) into That cave ; and they , mayhap , have ever since Been searching for her . I am listening . IVAN . ' T was two years after this she came one night And drew me from a labyrinth of dreams . " Come , " she spoke wildly , " I have seen a light , Not like the torches that we use , but soft And clear and lovely as an eye . " We went . It was a star she saw glimmering through A rupture in the rock , half hidden by A fallen tree , and creeping vines , and leaves Of many summer times . My heart was full . I felt olus ' lips upon my brow , And I could hear , among the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bless Her  --  she was gone . Men hurried to and fro In the rotunda of the cave with lights . My absence was discovered ; at a bound I gained the opening , and thrust back the leaves , And stood out in the night  --  glorious night ! Peopled with planate worlds ! The river crossed , I hid me in the woods , and cooled my lips With mangos , sweetest fruit Pomona hangs Upon the trees . I slept in shady glens By day , and traveled under covert of The night . The war had broken out afresh . I joined my comrades on a battle eve ; Once more I led them in victorious Charge . The fame , the wealth , the rank I won , I lay them at thy feet !  --  ( An hour later , sunset ; a mist seen on the mountains . ) BLANCHETTE . The birds are mute , and all the winding streams , With pebbly eyes , flow on subdued . The woods Are spotted o'er with carmine , ribbed with gold , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Twilight , like some dark Egyptian Queen , Stalks down the mountain side ! BLANCHETTE . Soon Night will come , Cloud-capped and starry-eyed , with Saturn , Mars And Venus in her train ! IVAN . How like a dream It is ! The town below us slumbering In the dusk , and the faint throbbing of its Many hearts ; the mournful curfew stealing On the night , and the sweet bulbul singing To the rose ; and thou , my love , thou seemest The most unreal of all . BLANCHETTE . There is a sad , Dim beauty in the scene that touches me . Morn walking o'er the coral-grottoed deep , Is not so ' witching as the dreamy haze That cloaks this landscape ; and I would not match One scintillation of mild Hesperus ' Gainst all his amber beams . The village lamps Are lighted ; darkness screens the chimney-tops , The carven gables ; nought is visible Save twinkling lamps , except when some gude-wife The window curtain lifts , and watches for Her husband ; then a gleam of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! IVAN . And Castle Craige , looms ' mid the shadows up , With window eyes of fire ; but Edenwold Is bleak and gloomy as a blasted tree . Come , love , let 's leave these quiet , quiet graves ; A church-yard is a dismal place at night , And we should not be sad . Ere Evening sweeps In purple robes again across the sky . The sweet-lipped bell that silent , drowsy hangs In yon old belfry of the ivied church , Shall tune its tongue and chime our marriage morn . To-morrow , love ! to-morrow ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : NIGHT SCENE . from The bells ( 1855 ) One cloud was gabled like a country house With latticed windows , vine hid , through which looked The melting eyes of stars . From out one side Was hung the moon like a great lantern in The crowded porch of some quaint village inn ! ..... The far dim woods Were tipped with amethyst ; beneath me stretched The town of Eld bespangled with its lights ; Above me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , like one in trance , the feet Of cascades tripping musically down Emerald hills , while ever and anon The Nightingale sent trembles thro ' the night .
