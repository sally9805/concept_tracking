It was a lovely Sabbath morning in May , 1828 , when two lads , the elder of whom was about sixteen years old , and the younger about fourteen , were wandering along the banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the immediate vicinity of the city of Albany , N. Y. Though there is no poetry in the name of this little stream , there is sweet music made by its rippling waters , as they rush rapidly along the shallow channel , fretting at the rocks that obstruct its course , and racing toward a precipice , down which it plunges , some thirty or forty feet , forming a light , feathery cascade ; and then , as if exhausted by the leap , creeping sluggishly its little distance toward the broad Hudson . The white spray , churned out by the friction against the air , and flung perpetually upwards , suggested to our sires a name for this miniature Niagara ; and , without any regard for romance or euphony , they called it Buttermilk Falls . It was a charming spot , notwithstanding its homely name , before the speculative spirit of progress -- stern foe of Nature 's beauties -- had pushed the borders of the city close upon the tiny cataract , hewed down the pines upon its banks , and opened quarries among its rocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness , that the lads whom we have mentioned were strolling , in holy time , upon the banks of the little stream , above the falls . " Rodney , " said the elder of the boys , " suppose your mother finds out that you have run away from Sunday-school , this morning ; what will she say to you ? " " Why , she will be very likely to punish me , " said Rodney ; " but you know I am used to it ; and , though decidedly unpleasant , it does not grate on my nerves as it did a year or two ago . Van Dyke , my teacher , says I am hardened . But I would rather have a stroll here , and a flogging after it , than be shut up in school and church all day to escape it . I wish , Will , that mother was like your grandfather , and would let me do as I please on Sunday . " " Now that I am an apprentice , " replied Will Manton , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be rather hard to prevent my having a little sport on Sunday . I think it is necessary to swallow a little fresh air on Sunday , to blow the sawdust out of my throat ; and to have a game of ball occasionally , to keep my joints limber , for they get stiff leaning over the work-bench , shoving the jack-plane , and chiseling out mortices all the week . " " Well , Will , I , too , get very sick of work , " replied the younger boy . " I do not think I ever shall like it . When I am roused up early in the morning , and go into the shop , and look at the tools , and think that , all day long , I must stand and pull leather strands , while other boys can go free , and take their sport , and swim , or fish , or hunt , or play , just as they please , it makes me feel like running away . Now , here am I , a little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dirty shop , with the prospect of hard work all my life ? It makes my heart sick to think of it . " The boys threw themselves upon the ground , under the shade of a large pine , and , reclining against its trunk , remained some minutes without uttering a word . At length , William Manton , whose thoughts had evidently been running in the channel opened by the last remarks of Rodney , said , " I have often thought of it . " " Thought of what , Will ? " " Of running away . " " Where could you go ? What could you do ? How could you live ? " were the quick , eager inquiries of Rodney . " Three questions at once is worse than the catechism , " was the laughing response ; " but , though I never learned the answers out of a book , yet I have them by heart . I will tell you what I have thought about the matter . You know Captain Ryan ?  - -  he was in our shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a sailor . He said that his uncle , with whom he lived when he was a boy , promised him a beating , one day , for some mischief he had done ; and , as he had often felt before that his lashes were not light , he ran off , went on board a ship as a cabin-boy , learned to handle sails and ropes , and , after five or six voyages , was made mate of a ship ; and now he is a captain . I have been thinking about it ever since . Now , if I could get a place in a ship , I would go in a minute . I am sure travelling over the world must be pleasanter than spending a life in one place ; and pulling a rope is easier work than pushing a plane . " Rodney sprang up from his reclining posture , looked straight in his companion 's face for a moment , and exclaimed , " That would be glorious ! How I should like to go to London , to Canton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  - -  to travel all over the world ! But , "  - -  and he leaned back against the tree again as he spoke ,  --  " but it is of no use to think about it ; mother would not consent , and nobody would help me ; no ship would take me . I suppose I must pull away at the leather all my life . " He spoke bitterly , and leaned his face upon his hands ; and , between his fingers , the tears were seen slowly trickling . In truth , he had no taste or inclination for the trade to which he was forced . If the bias of his own mind had been consulted , he might have been contented in some employment adapted to his nature . " Bah , Rodney , do n't be a baby ! " was the jeering expostulation of Will Manton , when he saw the tears ; " crying never got a fellow out of a scrape . I believe it is easy enough done . If we could only get off to New York , they say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captains take them without asking many questions . " " Do you think so ? " " Do n't you think it is worth a trial ? " " But I should have to leave my mother , and grandmother , and sister , and all . " " Of course ; you would not want to take them with you , would you ? " " But I could not tell them I was going . I should have to steal away without their knowledge . " " You could write to them when you started . " " I might never see them again . " " You are as likely to live and come back as Captain Ryan was . " " But they would feel so much hurt , if I should run away . " Will Manton curled his lip into a sneer , and said , scornfully , " Why , Rodney , I did n't think you was so much of a baby . You are a more faint-hearted chicken than I thought you . " " Well , Will , the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good grandmother ; and , though they make me learn a trade I hate , yet I do not think I should dare to run away . " " Well , you poor mouse-heart , stay at home , then , and tie yourself to your mamma 's apron-strings ! " was the reply . " Do as you please ; but , I tell you ,  - -  and I trust the secret to you , and hope you wo n't blow it ,  - -  I have made up my mind to go to sea . " " Will you run away ? " " Indeed I will . " " When ? " " Why should I tell you , if you will not go with me ? " " Well , I want to be off with you , but how can I ? " " Easy enough . But I will see you to-morrow night , and we will talk it over . It is time to go home . " " I must see Dick Vanderpool , and find out where the text was , so that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REVOLVING AND RESOLVING . Conversations similar to those recorded in the last chapter , were frequently held between the two lads , during the next month . Will Manton 's determination was fixed , and he was making secret preparations to start upon his wild journey . Rodney , though equally desirous to escape the restraints of home , could not yet make up his mind to risk the adventure . He regarded his comrade as a sort of young hero ; and he wished he had the courage to be like him . One Monday morning , in June , as he was returning from his work , he saw Will Manton 's old grandfather standing before the door , looking up and down the street ; and he noticed that he seemed very uneasy , and much distressed . When he came opposite the house , on the other side of the street , the old gentleman called him over , and asked him , " Rodney , do you know where Will is ? " The boy 's heart beat wildly , and his cheek turned pale ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his purpose . He stammered out , in reply , " I have not seen him since last Friday night . " " It is very strange , " said the old man . " He has not been at home since last Sunday , at dinner-time . What has become of him ? " Will Manton was gone ! To the anxious inquiries that were made , his friends discovered that he had left Albany in the evening boat , on Tuesday , for New York . Though a messenger was immediately sent after him , no trace of him could be discovered . A few months after , they received a letter from him , written from Liverpool , where he had gone in a merchant-ship , as a cabin-boy . His friends were very much grieved and distressed , but hoped that he would soon grow weary of a hard and roving life , and return to his home . There was a romantic interest in all this for young Rodney . In his imagination , Will Manton was a hero . He was scarcely ever out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bounding over the broad sea , with all the sails of the majestic ship swelling in the favoring breeze , now touching at some island , and looking at the strange dresses and customs of a barbarous people ; now meeting a homeward-bound vessel , and exchanging joyful greetings ; and now lying to in a calm , and spearing dolphins and harpooning whales . When the storm raged , he almost trembled lest he might be wrecked ; but , when it was over , he fancied the noble ship , having weathered the storm , stemming safely the high waves , and careering gracefully on her course . Or , if he was wrecked , he imagined that he must be cast upon some shore where the hospitable inhabitants hurried down to the beach to the relief of the crew , bore them safely through the breakers , and pressed upon them the comforts of their homes . His wild imagination followed him to other lands , and roved with him along the streets of European cities , among the ruins of Grecian temples , over the gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagodas of India , and the narrow streets of Calcutta and Canton . " O , " thought he , " how delightful must be such a life ! How pleasant to be roaming amid scenes that are always new ! And how wretched to be tied to such a life as I lead , following the same weary round of miserable drudgery every day ! " But it was Rodney 's own fancy that painted this enjoyment of a sailor-boy 's life . Will Manton did not find it so pleasant in reality . There was more menial drudgery to the poor cabin-boy on ship-board , than he had ever known in the carpenter 's shop . He was sworn at , and thumped , and kicked , and driven from one thing to another , by the captain , and mates , and steward , and crew , all day long . And many a night , when , weary and sore , he crept to his hard , narrow bunk , he lay and cried himself to sleep , thinking of his kind and pleasant home . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she divests them of all the rough realities which a nearer view and a tried experience find in them . The mountain-side looks smooth and pleasant from a distance , but we find it rugged and wearisome when we attempt to climb it . One idea had now gained almost sole possession of poor Rodney 's mind . He must go to sea ! He thought of it all day , and dreamed of it at night . He did not dare to speak about it to his mother , for he knew that she would refuse her consent . He must run away ! He formed a hundred different plans , and was forced to abandon them . Now Will Manton was gone , there was no one with whom he could consult . He was afraid to speak of it , lest it should reach the ears of his mother . Alone he nursed his resolution , and formed his plans . He was very unhappy , because he knew that he was purposing wrong . He could not be contented with his employment , and he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , if he should persist in his design . Yet , when he pictured to himself the freedom from restraint , the pleasure of roaming from place to place over the world , and the thousand exciting scenes and adventures which he should meet by becoming a sailor , he determined , at all hazards , to make the attempt . Unhappy boy ! He was sowing , for his own reaping , the seeds of a bitter harvest of wretchedness and remorse . CHAPTER III . RODNEY IN NEW YORK . On a beautiful Sabbath morning in July , Rodney stood in the hall of the old Dutch house in which successive generations of the family had been born , and paused to look the last farewell , he dare not speak , upon those who loved him , and whom , notwithstanding his waywardness , he also loved . There sat his pious and venerable grandmother , with the little round stand before her , upon which lay the old family Bible , over which she was intently bending , reading and commenting to herself , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood behind her , and listened , unobserved , as she read verse after verse , and paused after each , to testify of its truth , or piously apply it to herself and others . And now he thought that , in all probability , he would never see her again , and he half repented his determination . But his preparations were all made , and he could not now hesitate , lest his purpose should be discovered . He looked at his mother , as she was arranging the dress of a younger and only brother , for the Sabbath-school . As she leaned over him , and smoothed down the collar she had just fastened round his neck , Rodney , with heart and eye , bade farewell to both . He stood and gazed for a moment upon his only sister , who sat with her baby in her arms , answering the little laughing prattler in a language that sounded like its own , and which certainly none but the two could understand . Some might doubt whether they understood it themselves ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That dear sister , amiable and loving , is long since dead . She greeted death with a cheerful welcome , for the messenger released her from a life of domestic unhappiness , and introduced her into that blessed heaven " where the wicked cease from troubling , and the weary are at rest . " And that prattling infant has become , in his turn , a runaway sailor-boy , flying from an unhappy home to a more wretched destiny , of whose wanderings or existence nothing has been heard for many years . It was one hasty , intense glance which Rodney cast over these groups , and each beloved figure , as it then appeared , was fixed in his memory forever . He has never forgotten -- he never can forget -- that moment , or the emotions that thrilled his heart as he turned away from them . He had hidden a little trunk , containing his clothing , in the stable , and thither he hastened ; and , throwing his trunk upon his shoulder , he stole out of the back gate , and took his course through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board a steamboat , and in half an hour was sailing down the Hudson towards New York . He had no money with which to pay his passage . He had left home without a single sixpence . When the captain came to collect the passengers ' fare , he told him a wicked , premeditated lie . He said that , in taking his handkerchief from his pocket , he had accidentally drawn out his pocket-book with it , and that it had fallen overboard . Thus one sin prepares the way to the commission of another . He offered to leave his trunk in pledge for the payment of the passage ; and the captain , after finding it full of clothing , ordered it to be locked up until the money was paid . Rodney expected to be able to get a situation in some ship immediately , and to receive a part of his wages in advance , with which he could redeem his clothing . He slept on board the steamboat , and on Monday morning started in search of a ship that would take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid to speak to any one , lest he should be questioned and sent home . At last he made up his mind to ask a sailor , whom he saw sauntering on the dock , if he knew where he could get a place on board a ship . The sailor looked at him a moment , turned his huge tobacco quid over in his mouth , hitched up his trowsers , and said : " Why , you young runaway , do you want to go to sea ? What can such a chap as you do on a ship ? Go home , and stick by your mammy for five years more , and then you 'll have no trouble in shipping . " Rodney was a good deal frightened at such a reply , and walked on for some time , not venturing to ask again . Toward noon he went on board a large vessel , and seeing a man , whom he took for the captain of the ship , asked him if he could give him a place . " No , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail for three weeks , and we never ship a crew before the time . " All day he wandered about the wharves , and to all his questions received repelling replies , mingled oftentimes with oaths , jeers , and insults . No one seemed to feel the least interest for him . CHAPTER IV . RODNEY FINDS A PATRON . Late in the afternoon Rodney strolled up the East River wharves . He was hungry , for he had eaten nothing all day . He was very sad , and sat down on a cotton bale , and cried . In what a position had a single day placed him ! He had no place where he could lay his head for the night , no bread to eat , and he knew nobody whom he dared to ask for a meal ; and so , with a sorrowful heart , he sat down and wept . He buried his face in his hands , and for a long time sat there motionless . He did not know that a man was standing before him , watching him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my boy , what is the matter with you ? " He looked up , and saw a tall man in a sailor 's dress standing near him . " I want to get a place on a ship , sir , to go to sea , " replied Rodney ; " I ca n't find any place , and I have no money and no friends here . " The man sat down beside him , and asked him , " Where are your friends ? " " In Albany , sir . " " What did you leave them for ? " " Because I wanted to go to sea . " They talked some time together , and Rodney told him truly all about himself and his friends . The man seemed to pity him , and told him that he was a sailor , and had lately been discharged from a United States vessel , where he had served as a marine ,  - -  that he had spent almost all his money , and was looking for another ship . He told Rodney to go with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . They went into a sailors ' boarding-house , and got something to eat . Then the man ,  - -  who said his name was Bill Seegor , and that he must call him Bill , and not Mister , nor sir ,  - -  took him with himself into a ball-room . Here he saw a great many sailors and bad women , who danced together , and laughed , and shouted , and cursed , and drank , until long past midnight . Rodney had never witnessed such a scene . He had never heard such filthy and blasphemous language , nor seen such indecent behavior . " Come , my lad , " said a bluff sailor to him ; " if you mean to be a man , you must learn to toss off your glass . Your white face do n't look as if you ever tasted anything stronger than tea . Here is a glass of grog ,  - -  down with it ! " And Rodney , who wanted to be a man , drank it with a swaggering air , though it scorched his throat ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last he remembered was , that the sailors and the women all seemed to be swearing and fighting together . The next morning he was awaked by Bill Seegor , and found himself in a garret , on a miserable bed , with all his clothes on . How he had ever got there he could not tell . His head ached , and his limbs were stiff and pained him when he moved . His throat was parched and burning , and he felt so wretchedly , that , if he had dared , he would have begged permission to stay there on the bed . But Bill told him that it was time to start and look up a ship , for he had only money enough to last another day . After breakfast they started , and inquired at every place which Bill knew , but without success ; no men or boys were wanted . In the afternoon , Rodney was terribly frightened at seeing his brother-in-law walking along the wharves . He knew in a moment that he had come to New York to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alley , and hid himself behind some barrels , till he had passed by . He afterwards learned that his brother-in-law had been looking for him all day , and that he had found and taken his trunk , and had been several times at places which he had just left . O ! if he had then abandoned his foolish and wicked course , and gone home with his brother , how much misery he would have escaped ! But he contrived to keep out of his way . That evening Bill said to him , as they were eating their supper in a cellar --  " Rodney , to-morrow morning we must start for Philadelphia . " " But how shall we get there ? " " We shall have to tramp it . " " How far is it ? " " About a hundred miles . " " How long will it take ? " " Four or five days . " " But how shall we get anything to eat , or any place to sleep on the road ? " " Tell a good story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rodney began to find out that " the way of the transgressor is hard . " That night they went to the theatre . Bill had given Rodney a dirk , which he carried in his bosom . They went up into the third tier of boxes , which was filled with the most wicked and debased men and women . While the rest were laughing , and talking , and cursing , Rodney sat down on the front seat to see the play ; but they made so much confusion behind him that he could not hear , so he turned round , and said , rather angrily : " I wish you would n't make so much noise . " " Who are you talking to ? " shouted a rough , bully-looking man behind him , with a terrible oath ; " I 'll pitch you into the pit , if you open your head again . " He rushed towards him , but , quick as thought , Rodney snatched the dirk from his breast , drew his arm back over his head , and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in an instant the whole theatre was in confusion . The play on the stage ceased ; and there , in full view , leaning over the front of the box , stood the boy , with the weapon in his hand , gleaming in the eyes of the whole audience . Bill Seegor rushed to him , pulled him back toward the lobby , and took the dagger from his hand . The bully then aimed a tremendous blow at the boy 's face , which fortunately was warded off by one of the women . Just then a police-officer came up , and , taking Rodney by the collar , led him down stairs . Half a dozen men , who were Bill 's friends , followed ; and when they got into the street , they dashed against the officer , and broke his hold , when Bill caught Rodney by the arm and told him to run . They turned quickly through several streets , and escaped pursuit . Do you think that Rodney was happy amid such scenes ? Ah ! no ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that he was taking sudden and rapid strides in the path of debasement and vice . He thought of his home and its sweet influences . He knew how deep would be the grief of those who loved him , should they hear of his course . His conscience condemned him , and he thought of what he was becoming with horror . But he seemed to be drawn on by his wild desires , and felt scarcely a disposition to escape the meshes of the net that was winding around him . The sailors praised him , and patted him on the back ; told him that he was a brave fellow ,  - -  that he was beginning right , and that there was good stuff in him . And Rodney laughed , tickled by such praises , and drank what they offered , and tried to stifle his conscience and harden himself in sin . Yet often , when he was alone , did he shrink from himself , and writhe under the lashings of conscience ; and the remembrance of home , and thoughts of his conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHILADELPHIA . Young Rodney was prepared for an early start on the following morning ; and , in company with Bill Seegor , he crossed the ferry to Jersey City just as the sun rose , and together they commenced their journey to Philadelphia . They were soon beyond the pavements of the town , and in the open country . It was a lovely morning , and the bright summer developed its beauties , and dispensed its fragrance along their path . The birds sang sweetly , and darted on swift wing around them . The cattle roamed lazily over the fields , and the busy farmers were everywhere industriously toiling . All nature seemed joyously reflecting the serene smile of a benevolent God . Even the wicked hearts of the wanderers seemed lightened by the influence of the glorious morning , and cheerily , with many a jocund song and homely jest , they pressed on their way . Even guilt can sometimes forget its baseness , and enjoy the bounties of the kind Creator , for which it expresses no thankfulness and feels no gratitude . At noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the honest old man that they belonged to a ship which had sailed round to Philadelphia ; that it had left New York unexpectedly , without their knowledge , and taken their chests and clothes which had been placed on board ; and that , being without money , they were compelled to walk across to Philadelphia to meet it . The farmer believed the falsehood , and charitably gave them a good dinner . They walked on till after sunset , and then crossed over a field , and climbed up into a rack filled with hay , where they slept all night . In the morning they started forward very hungry , for they had eaten nothing , since the noon before , except a few green apples . They stopped at the first farm-house on the road , and , by telling the same falsehood that had procured them a meal the day before , excited the pity of the farmer and obtained a good breakfast . Thus did they go on , lying and begging their way along . On the third day there were heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were as thoroughly soaked as if they had been thrown into the river , and at night had to sleep on a haystack , in the open field , in their wet clothes . Rodney 's feet , too , had become very sore , and he walked in great and constant pain . In the afternoon of the fourth day they stopped on the banks of the Delaware , five or six miles from Philadelphia , to wash their clothes , which had become filthy in travelling through the dust and mud . As they had no clothing but what they wore , there was nothing else to be done but to strip , wash out their soiled garments , and lay them out on the bank to dry , while they swam about the river , or waited on the shore , with what patience they could summon . A little after sunset they reached the suburbs of the great city ; and now the sore feet and wearied limbs of the boy could scarcely sustain him over the hard pavements . Yet Bill urged him onward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kensington ,  - -  on , past the factories , and markets , and farmers ' taverns , and shops of the Northern Liberties ,  - -  on , through the crowded thoroughfares , and by the brilliant stores of the city ,  - -  on , into the most degraded section of Southwark , in Plumb-street , where Bill said a friend of his lived . This friend was an abandoned woman , who lived in a miserable frame cabin , crowded with wicked and degraded wretches , who seemed the well-known and fitting companions of Rodney 's patron . The woman for whom he inquired was at a dance in the neighborhood , and there Bill took the boy in search of her . They went up a dark alley , and were admitted into a large room filled with men and women , black and white , the dregs and outcasts of society . A few dripping candles , placed in tin sconces along the bare walls , threw a dim and sickly glare over the motley throng . A couple of negro men , sitting on barrels at the head of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patched , and greasy fiddles . And there were men , whose red and bloated faces gave faithful witness of their habitual intemperance ; and men , whose threadbare and ragged garments betokened sloth and poverty ; and men , whose vulgar and ostentatious display of showy clothing , and gaudy chains , and rings and breast-pins , which they did not know how to wear , indicated dishonest pursuits ; and men , whose blue jackets and bluff , brown faces showed them to be sailors ; and men , whose scowling brows and fiendlike countenances marked them as villains of the blackest and lowest type . And there were women , too , some old -- at least , they looked so -- and haggard ; some young , but with wretched-looking faces , and dressed in tawdry garments , yet generally faded , some torn and some patched , and all seeming to be brought from the pawnbroker 's dusty shop for the occasion . In a little filthy side-room was a bar covered with bottles and glasses , behind which stood a large , red-faced man , with a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinning like a satyr , now scowling like a demon , dealing out burning liquors to his miserable customers . A man fell beastly drunk from a bench upon the floor . " Take him up stairs , " said the man at the bar . Rodney followed the two men who carried him up , and looked into the sleeping apartment . The floor was covered with dirty straw , where lodgers were accommodated for three cents a night . Here the poor wretches were huddled together every night , to get what sleep they could in the only home they had on earth . Thus does vice humble , and degrade , and scourge those who are taken in its toils . From the threshold of the house of guilty pleasure there may issue the song and laugh of boisterous mirth ; but those who enter within shall find disgrace and infamy , woe and death . CHAPTER VI . THE PUNISHMENT BEGINS . Bill Seegor found the woman he sought , and soon they returned to her house . Here the bottle was brought out and passed round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straw bed was made up on the floor , and Rodney laid down . Before he went to sleep , he heard Bill tell the woman that he was entirely out of money , and beg her to lend him five dollars for a few days . After some hesitation she consented , and drew out from under the bed an old trunk , which she unlocked , and from which she took five dollars in silver and gave it to him . Bill , looking over her shoulder , saw that she took it from a little pile of silver that lay in the corner of the trunk . For a long time Rodney could not sleep . The scenes of the last eventful week were vividly recalled to his mind , and , in spite of his fatigue , kept him awake . He tried to make himself believe that it was a glorious life he had begun to lead ,  - -  that now he was free from restraint , and entering upon the flowery paths of independence and enjoyment . Though he had met with some difficulties at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , and that soon he should be upon the blue water , and in foreign countries , a happy sailor boy . But conscience would interpose its reproaches and warnings , and remind him of the horrible company into which he had been cast , of the scenes of sin which he had witnessed , and in which he had participated ; and he could not but shudder when he thought of the probable termination of such a life . But he felt that , having forsaken his home ,  - -  and he was not even yet sorry that he had done so ,  - -  he was now in the current , and that there was no way of reaching the shore , even had he been disposed to try ; and that he must continue to float along the stream , leaving his destination to be determined by circumstances . It is very easy to find the paths of sin . It is easy , and , for a season , may seem pleasant , to travel in them . The entrance is inviting , the way is broad , companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed traveller , terrified at the thought of its termination , seeks to escape , and hunts for the narrow path of virtue , he finds obstacles and entanglements which he can not climb over nor break . It requires an Omnipotent arm to help him then . Rodney fell asleep . How long he had slept he knew not ; but he was awakened by a violent shaking and by terrible oaths . The side-door leading into the yard was open , and three or four wretched-looking women were scolding and swearing angrily about him . He was confused , bewildered , but soon perceived that something unusual had happened ; and he became very much frightened as he at last learned the truth from the excited women . Bill Seegor was gone . He had got up quietly when all were asleep , and , drawing the woman 's trunk from under her bed , had carried it out into the yard , pried open the lock , stolen the money , and escaped . The woman was in a terrible passion , and her raving curses were fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He was indignant at his companion 's rascality , and offered to go with her and try to find him . It was two o'clock in the morning . He looked round for his hat , collar , and handkerchief ; but they were gone . The thief had taken them with him . Taking Bill 's old hat , he went out with the woman , and looked into the oyster-cellars and grog-shops , some of which they found still open ; but they could find no trace of Bill Seegor . The woman met a watchman , and made inquiries , and told him of the robbery . " And this boy came with the man last night , did he ? " inquired the watchman . " He did , " said the woman . " Do you know the boy ? " " I never saw him before . " " Well , I guess he knows where he is , or where he can be found to-morrow . " Rodney protested that he knew nothing about him , that his own hat , collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had nothing to do with the robbery . He even told him where he had met with Bill , and how he came to be in his company . " All very fine , my lad , " said the watchman ; " but you must go with me . This must be examined into to-morrow . " And he took Rodney by the arm , and led him to the watch-house . CHAPTER VII . THE WATCH-HOUSE . For poor Rodney there was no more sleep that night , even had they placed him on a bed of roses . But they locked him up in a little square room , with an iron-barred window , into which a dim light struggled from a lamp hung outside in the entry , showing a wooden bench , fastened against the wall . There were four men in the room . One , whose clothes looked fine and fashionable , but all covered with dirt , lay on the floor . A hat , that seemed new , but crushed out of all shape , was under his head for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was entirely stupefied , and Rodney saw at a glance that he was intoxicated . On the bench , stretched out at full length , was a short , stout negro , fast asleep . On another part of the bench lay a white man , who seemed about fifty years old , with a sneering , malicious face , and wrapped up in a shaggy black coat . The remaining occupant of the cell sat in one corner , with his head down on his knees , and his hat slouched over his face . Rodney stood for a few moments in the middle of the cell , and , in sickening dismay , looked round him . Here he was with felons and rioters , locked up in a dungeon ! True , he had committed no crime against the law ; but yet he felt that he deserved it all ; and the hot tears rolled from his eyes as he thought of his mother and his home . Hearing his sobs , the man in the corner raised his head , looked at him for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what have you been about ? Are you the pal of these cracksmen , or have you been on a lay on your own hook ? " Rodney did not know what he meant , and he said so . " I mean , " said the man , in the same low , thieves ' jargon , " have you been helping these fellows crack a crib ? " " Doing what ? " said Rodney . " Breaking into a house , you dumb-head . " Illustration The boy shuddered at the thought of being taken for an accomplice of house-breakers ; and told him he knew nothing about them . He had read that boys are sometimes employed by house-breakers to climb in through windows or broken pannels , to open the door on the inside ; and now he was thought to be such a one himself . It was a dismal night for him . Early in the morning the prisoners were all taken before a magistrate . The drunkard , who claimed to be a gentleman , and who had been taken to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fined five dollars , and dismissed . The negro and the old white man had been caught in the attempt to break into a house , and were sent to prison , to await their trial for burglary ; and the other white man was also sent to prison , until he could be tried , for stealing a pocket-book in an auction store . Rodney was then called forward . The watchman told how and why he had taken him ; and the boy was asked to give an account of himself . He told his story truthfully and tearfully , while the magistrate looked coldly at him . " A very good story , " said the magistrate ; " it seems to be well studied . I suspect you are an artful fellow , notwithstanding your innocent face . I shall bind you over for trial , my lad . I think such boys as you should be stopped in time ; and a few years in some penitentiary would do you good . " What could Rodney say ? What could he do ? He was among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his good character , or to become bail for him . And , if his friends had been near , he felt that he had rather die than that they should know of his disgrace . The magistrate gave an officer a paper -- a commitment -- and told him to take the boy to the Arch-street jail . The constable took him by the arm , and led him out . As they walked along the street , Rodney looked around him to see if there was no way of escape . If he could only get a chance to run ! As they came to the corner of a little alley , he asked the constable to let him tie his shoe , the string of which was loose . The man nodded , and Rodney placed his foot upon a door-step , sheering round beyond the reach of the officer 's hand , and towards the alley . Rodney , as he rose , made one spring , and in a moment was gone down the alley . The officer rushed after him , and shouted , " Stop thief ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be chased for a thief ! " groaned Rodney , clenching his teeth together , and running at his best speed . That terrible cry , " Stop thief ! " rung after him , and soon seemed to be echoed by a hundred voices , as the boy dashed along Ninth street and down Market street ; and , from behind him , and from doors and windows , and from the opposite side of the street , and at length from before him , the very welkin rung with the cries of " Stop thief ! stop thief ! " A hundred eyes were strained to catch a glimpse of the culprit ; but Rodney dashed on , the crowd never thinking that he was the hunted fox , but only one of the hounds in pursuit , eager to be " in at the death . " At the corner of Fifth and Market-streets , a porter was standing by his wheelbarrow . He saw the chase coming down , and truly scented the victim ; and , as Rodney neared the corner , he suddenly pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid it ; he stumbled , fell across it , and was captured . " You young scoundrel ! is this one of your tricks ? " said the constable , as he came up ; " I 'll teach you one of mine ; " and he struck him a blow on the side of the head , that knocked the poor boy senseless on the pavement . Those who stood by cried , " Shame ! shame ! " and the officer glared furiously around him ; but , seeing that the numbers were against him , he raised the boy from the ground . Rodney soon recovered ; and the constable , grasping him firmly by the wrist of his coat , and , drawing his arm tightly under his own , led him , followed by a crowd of hooting boys , up Fifth , and through Arch-street , toward the old jail . What a walk was that to poor Rodney ! The officer , stern and angry , held him with so firm a grip as to convince him of the uselessness of a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the race and the blow , he was compelled almost to run , to keep up with the long strides of the constable . A crowd of boys pressed around , to get a glimpse of his face . " What has he done ? " one would ask of another . " Broke open a trunk , and stole money , " would be the reply . Rodney pulled Bill Seegor 's old hat over his face , and hung his head , in bitter anguish of soul , as he heard himself denounced as a thief at every step ; and as he heard doors dashed open , and windows thrown up , similar questions and replies smote his heart . He knew that he was innocent of such a crime ; his soul scorned it ; he felt that he was incapable of theft ; but he felt that he had been too guilty , too disobedient and too ungrateful , to dare to hold up his head , or utter a word in his own defence . It seemed as though that long and terrible walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved when he reached the heavy door of the jail , amid two files of staring boys , who had ran before him , and arranged themselves by the gate , to watch him as he entered . He was rudely thrust in , the bolt shot back upon the closed door , and he was delivered over to the keeping of the jailer , with the assurance of the policeman , that " he was a sharp miscreant , and needed to be watched . " CHAPTER VIII . RODNEY IN JAIL . Such are the rewards which sin gives to its votaries ; full of soft words and tempting promises in the beginning , they find , in the end , that " it biteth like a serpent , and stingeth like an adder . " Thoughts like these passed through Rodney 's mind , as the jailer led him to a room in which were confined three other lads , all older than himself . At that time , the system of solitary confinement had not been adopted in Pennsylvania , and prisoners were allowed to associate together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from associating with older and more hardened culprits , whose conversation might still more corrupt them , and they were therefore confined together , apart from the mass of the criminals . At first Rodney suffered the most intense anguish . A sense of shame and degradation overwhelmed him . He staggered to a corner of the room , threw himself on the floor , and , for a long time , sobbed and wept as though his very heart would break . For a while the boys seemed to respect his grief , and left him in silence . At last one of them went to him , and said , " Come , there 's no use in this ; we are all here together , and we may as well make the best of it ! " Rodney sat up , and looked at them , as they gathered around him . They were ragged in dress , and pale from their confinement , and Rodney involuntarily shrank from the idea of associating with them , regarding them as criminals in jail . But he soon remembered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  - -  and he thought he would take their advice , and " make the best of it . " " Well , what did they squeeze you into this jug for , my covey ? " asked the eldest boy . Rodney told them his story , and protested that he was innocent of any crime . The boy put his thumb to the end of his nose , and twirled his fingers , saying , " You ca n't gammon us , my buck ; come , out with it , for we never peach on one another . " Rodney was very angry at this mode of treating his story . But , in spite of himself , he gradually became familiar with the companions thus forced upon him , and , in a day or two , began to engage with them in their various sports , to while away the weary hours . Sometimes they sat and told stories , to amuse one another ; and thus Rodney heard tales of wickedness and depredation and cunning , that almost led him to doubt whether there was any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbers , burglars and pirates , as if they were the models by which they meant to mould their own lives ; and , instead of detesting their crimes , Rodney began to admire the skill and success with which they were perpetrated . The excitement and freedom , and wild , frenzied enjoyment of such a life , as depicted by the young knaves , began to fascinate and charm his mind . Something seemed to whisper in his ear , " As you are now disgraced , without any fault of your own , why not carry it out , and make the most of it ? They have put you into jail , this time , for nothing ; if they ever do it again , let them have some reason for it . " Who knows what might have been the result of such temptations and influences , had these associations been long continued , and not counteracted by the interposition of God ? But then the instructions of childhood , the lessons of home and of the Sabbath-school , were brought back to his memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thief ! Make myself despised and hated by all good people ! Live a life of wickedness and dread , perhaps die in the penitentiary , and then , in all probability , lose my soul , and be cast into hell ! No , never ! I shall never dare to steal , or to break into houses ; and as for killing anybody for money , I shudder even at the thought ! " So did the bad and the good struggle together in the heart of the poor boy . How many there are who , at the first , feel and think about crime as he did , but who , in the end , become familiar with vice , lose their sense of fear and shame and guilt , become bold and reckless in sin , having their consciences seared as with a hot iron , and violating all laws , human and divine , without compunction , and without a thought save that of impunity and success ! All the elements of a life of crime were in the heart of this wayward boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his childhood , which counteracted these evil influences , and the providence and grace of God , which restrained him , he would have become a miserable outcast from society , leading a wretched life of shame and guilt . " I wish we had a pack of cards here , " said one of the boys , one weary afternoon . " Ca n't we make a pack ? " inquired another . And then the lads set their wits to work , and soon manufactured a substitute for a pack of cards . They had a couple of old newspapers , which they folded and cut into small , regular pieces , and marked each piece with the spots that are found on playing cards , making rude shapes of faces , and writing " Jack , " " King , " " Knave , " &c.,; under them . With these , they used to spend hours shuffling and dealing and playing , until Rodney understood the pernicious game as well as the rest . " Joe , " said Rodney , one day , to the oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " " Well , " said he , " I 'll tell you . Sam and I run with the Moyamensing Hose Company . Many a jolly time we have had of it , running to fires , and many a good drink of liquor we have had , too ; for when the people about the fires treated the firemen , we boys used to come in for our share of the treat . There was a standing quarrel between us and the ' Franklin ' boys , and we used to have a fight whenever we could get at them . I heard one of the men say , one day , that if there was only a fire down Twelfth or Thirteenth-street , and the ' Franklin ' should come up in that direction , we could get them foul , and give them a good drubbing . Well , there was a fire down Twelfth-street the next night ! I do n't mean to say who kindled it ; but a watchman saw Sam and me about the stable , and then running away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , and as we were going back to the fire with the machine , he nabbed us , and walked us off to the watch-house , and the next day we were stuck into this hole . " " But did you set fire to the stable ? " " What would you give to know ? I make no confessions ; and if you ever tell out of doors what I have said here , I 'll knock your teeth down your throat , if I ever catch you . " These two boys had actually been guilty of the dreadful crime of setting fire to a stable . It was used by two or three poor men for their horses and carts , which was the only means they had of making an honest living ; and yet these wicked boys had tried to burn it down , just for the fun of going to a fire , and getting up a fight ! There are other boys , in large cities , who will commit similar acts ; but such young villains are ripe for almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to some dreadful end . " Hank , " said Rodney to another boy , his real name was Henry , but Hank was his prison name ,  --  " tell us now what you have done . " " I 'll tell you nothing about it . " " What is your last name , Hank ? " inquired Sam , after a few moments ' pause . " Johnson , " said Hank . " Ah ! I know now what you did . I read it in the paper , just before I came in , and , somehow , I thought you was one of the larks as soon as I clapped eyes on you . " You see , Hank and some of his gang , watching about , saw a house in Arch-street , and noticed that it was empty . The family , I suppose , had all gone to the country , and it was shut up . So , one Sunday afternoon , four of them climbed over the back gate into the yard , pried open a window-shutter , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands on . After dark they sneaked out at the back gate with their plunder . One of them was caught , trying to sell some of the things , and he peached , and they jugged them all . Is n't that the fact , Hank ? " " Well , it 's no use lying ; it was pretty much so . " " What became of the other fellows , Hank ? " " Why , their fathers or friends bailed them out , and I have no father , or anybody who cares for me . But "  - -  and he swore a fearful oath --  " if ever I catch that white-livered Jim Hulsey , who was the ringleader in the whole scheme , and got me into the scrape , and then blowed me , to save himself , I 'll beat him to a mummy , I will . " And these were the companions with whom Rodney was compelled to associate ! Sometimes he shrank from them with loathing ; and sometimes he almost envied the hardihood with which they boasted of their crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can tell to what an extent he would have been contaminated , and how rapidly prepared for utter moral degradation and eternal ruin ? What afterwards became of them , Rodney never knew ; but they are probably either dead ,  - -  God having said , " The wicked shall not live out half their days , " or else preying upon society by the commission of more dreadful crimes , or perhaps spending long years of life in the penitentiary , confined to hard labor and prison fare . One day , after he had been about two weeks in jail , Rodney took the basin in which they had washed , and threw the water out of the window . The grated bars prevented his seeing whether there was any one below . He had often done so before . It had not been forbidden . He did not intend to do any wrong . But it happened that one of the keepers was walking under the window , and the water fell upon his head . He came to the door , in a great rage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once said that he had done it , but that he did not know that he had done any harm . The man took him roughly by the arm , and , telling him he must come with him , led him through a long corridor to another part of the prison , and thrust him into a small , dark dungeon . CHAPTER IX . THE DUNGEON . The room was very small ,  - -  a mere closet ,  - -  lighted only by a narrow window over the door , which admitted just light enough from the corridor to enable Rodney to see the walls . There was some scribbling on the walls , but there was not light enough , even after his eyes became accustomed to the place , to distinguish a letter . There was neither chair nor bench , not even a blanket , on which to lie . The bare walls and floor were unrelieved by a single article of comfort . Here , for four long days and nights , Rodney was confined . There was nothing by which he could relieve the dreadful wearisome time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jailer , once a day , bringing him a rough jug of water and half a loaf of black bread . He had no books with which to while away the long , tedious hours , nor was there light enough to read , had there been a whole library in the cell . The first emotions of the boy , when the door was locked upon him , were those of indignation and anger . " Why , " said he to himself , " am I treated in this way ? They are brutes ! I have done nothing to deserve this barbarity . I am no felon or thief , that I should be used in this way . I have broken no rule that was made known to me , since I have been in this place . The heartless wretch of a jailer thrust me into this hole , to gratify his own spite . He knows that I could n't have thrown water on him purposely , for I could n't see down into the yard . He never told me what I was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other place to throw it . He deserves being shut up in this den himself ! O , I wish I had him in my power for a week ! I would give him a lesson that he would remember as long as he lived . " Was there ever such an unlucky boy as I am ? Everything goes against me . There is no chance for me to do anything , or to enjoy anything , in this world . I wish I was dead ! " A bitter flood of tears burst from him , which seemed , as it were , to quench his anger , and gradually his heart became open to more salutary reflections . " Do you not deserve all this ? " whispered his conscience . " Have you not brought it upon yourself by your own wickedness and disobedience ? You had a good home and kind friends ; and if you had to work every day , it was no more than all have to do in one form or another . Blame yourself , then , for your own idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lot . You are only finding out the truth of the text you have often repeated ,  - -  'The way of the transgressor is hard . ' " He thought of his home , as he lay upon that hard floor . The forms of his pious old grandmother , and of his mother and sister , all seemed to stand before him , and to look down upon him reproachfully . He remembered now their kindness and good counsel . He groaned in bitterness , " O ! this would break their hearts , if they knew it ! I have disgraced myself , and I have disgraced them . " He had leisure for reflection , and his mind recalled , most painfully , the scenes of the past . He thought of the Sabbath-school , of his kind teacher , and of the instructions that had been so affectionately imparted . How much better for him would it have been , had he regarded those instructions ! And then he thought of God ! He remembered that His all-seeing eye had followed all his wanderings , and noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the bitterness of punishment had already overtaken him . The idea that God was angry with him , and that He was visiting his sins with the rod of chastisement , took possession of his soul . Now he ceased to blame others for his sufferings , and acknowledged to himself that all was deserved . Again he wept , but it was in terror at the thought of God 's anger , and in grief that he had sinned so ungratefully against his Maker . He tried to pray ; but the words of the prayers he had been taught in his childhood did not seem to be appropriate to his present condition . Those prayers were associated with days and scenes of comparative innocence and happiness . He now felt guilty and wretched , and felt deeply that other forms of petition were necessary for him . But he could not frame words into a prayer that would soothe and relieve his soul . " God will not hear me , " was his bitter thought . " I do not deserve to be heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deliver me from this trouble , I think I would try to serve and obey Him as long as I lived . " He kneeled down upon the hard floor , and raised his clasped hands and streaming eyes toward heaven ; but he could find no utterance for his emotions , save in sobs and tears . Prayer would not come in words . Again and again he tried to pray , but in vain ; he felt that he could not pray ; and , almost in despair , he paced the narrow cell , and was ready to believe that God 's favor was forever withdrawn from his soul ,  - -  that there was no ear to listen , and no arm to save , and that nothing was left for him in the future but a life of misery , a death of shame , and an eternity of woe ! On the third morning , he awoke from a troubled sleep , and , as he rose with aching bones from the bare planks , his limbs trembled and tottered beneath him . Finding that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dungeon , and leaned against the wall . His head was hot , and his throat parched , and the blood beat in throbs through his veins . A sort of delirious excitement began to creep over him , and his mind was filled with strange reveries . He saw , or fancied he saw , great spiders crawling over the wall , and serpents , lizards , and indescribable reptiles , creeping about on the floor ; and he shouted at them , and kicked at them , as they seemed to come near him . Soon they were viewed without dread or terror . He laughed at their motions , and thought he should have companions and pets in his loneliness ; still he did not wish them to come too near . Then there seemed to be other shapes in his cell . His old grandmother sat in one corner , reading , through her familiar spectacles , the well-worn family Bible . His sister sat there , playing with her baby , and his mother was singing as she sewed . And he laughed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Occasionally he felt a half-consciousness that it was all a delusion ,  - -  a mere vision of the brain ; and yet their fancied presence made him happy , and he laughed and talked incessantly , as if they heard him , and were wondering at his own strange emotions . And then the gruff voice of the jailer scared away his visions , and roused him for a moment from his reveries . " You are merry , my boy , and you make too much noise , " said the keeper . The interruption made his head swim , and he attempted to rise ; but he was very weak and faint , and fell back again . He turned to say , " I believe I am sick ; " but before the words found utterance , the man had set down his pitcher and bread , and was gone . There was an interval of dreary , blank darkness , and then there were other visions , too wild and strange to describe , and soon the darkness of annihilation settled upon his soul . How long a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not say ; but he was at length half-aroused by voices near him , and he was conscious that some hand was feeling for his pulse , and that men were carrying him out of the dungeon . He afterwards learned that it was the jailer and the physician . CHAPTER X. THE HOSPITAL . Upon a narrow cot , in the Hospital apartment of the jail , they laid Rodney , and immediately prepared the medicines suited to his case . The medicines were at length administered , and , with a pleasant consciousness of comfort and attention , he fell asleep . When he awoke , it was evening ; he was perfectly conscious , and felt better ; but it was a long time before he could recall his thoughts , and understand where he was , and how he had come thither . He looked around him , and saw a line of cots on each side of him . About a dozen of them were occupied by sick men . A large case of medicines , placed on a writing-desk , stood at one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted as nurses , were sitting near it , talking and laughing together . In another part of the room , by a grated window , looking out upon the pleasant sunset , were two of the convalescent prisoners , pale and thin , conversing softly and sadly . There was not a face he knew , none that seemed to feel the slightest interest for him ; and the wicked scenes of the past two months , and the unhappy circumstances of the present hour , flashed through his mind , and he hid his face in his pillow and wept . He heard steps softly approach his cot , and knew that some one was standing beside him . But he could not stifle his sobs , and he did not dare to look up . " I am glad to see that you are better , though I am sorry to see you so much troubled , my poor boy , " said a soft , kind voice . It was long since he had been spoken to in a kind tone , and he only wept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillow . Presently he felt an arm passed slowly under the pillow , which wound around his neck , and gently drew his head toward the stranger . " Come , come , " said the same soft voice , " do n't give way to such grief ; look up , and talk to me . Let me be a friend to you . " Rodney yielded to the encircling arm , and turned his tearful eyes to the man who spoke to him . He was a tall , slender man , pale from sickness , decently dressed , and with an intelligent , benevolent countenance . He was one of those whom Rodney had observed looking out of the window . " What is the matter ? " said he ; " what has brought you into this horrible place ? " The confidence of the boy was easily won . He had felt an inexpressible desire to talk to some one , and now he was ready to lay open his whole heart at the first intimation of sympathy . " I ran away from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they do not put boys in jail for running away ; you must have done something else . " " I was charged with something else ; but indeed , indeed , I am innocent ! " " That is very possible , " said he , with a sigh ; " but what did they charge you with doing ? " And Rodney moved closer to him , and leaned his head upon his breast , and told him all . There was such an evident sincerity , such consistency , such tones of truth in the simple narrative , that he saw he was believed , and the sympathizing words and looks of the listener inspired him with trust , as though he was talking to a well-known friend . For several days , they were constantly together ; the stranger waited upon Rodney , and gave him his medicine , and helped him from his cot , talked with him , and manifested for him the kindness of a brother . From several conversations , Rodney gleaned from him the following history . Lewis Warren ,  - -  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his true name ) ,  - -  was born and had lived most of his life in a New England village . He was the son of a farmer ; a pious man , and deacon of a church , by whose help he received a liberal education . Soon after he had graduated at  - -   - -   College , he came on to Philadelphia , with the expectation of getting into some business . At the hotel where he stopped , he became acquainted with a man of very gentlemanly appearance and address , who said that he , too , was a stranger in the city , and proposed to accompany him to some places of amusement . Warren went with him to the theatre , and , on succeeding evenings , to various places of amusement . As they were one evening strolling up Chestnut-street , this friend , Mr. Sharpe , stopped at the well-lighted vestibule of a stately building , that had the air of a private house , although it was thrown open , and proposed that they should go in , and see what was going on there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second floor , and passing through a hall , they entered a large , brilliantly-lighted billiard saloon . Around several tables were gathered gentlemanly-looking men , knocking about little ivory balls , with long , slender wands or cues , and seeming , evidently , engrossed in their respective games . After looking around for a while , Sharpe proposed going up stairs into the third story . They ascended to the upper rooms . In the upper passage stood a stout , short negro-man , who glanced at Sharpe , stepped one side , and permitted them to pass unquestioned . They entered another smaller room , for the third story was divided into several rooms ,  - -  and found other games than those exhibited below . After walking through some of the rooms , and observing the different games , most of which were new to Warren , his companion said to him : " Do you understand anything about cards ? " " Not a great deal ; I have occasionally played a game of whist or sledge . " " Well , that is about the sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these vacant tables . " Warren consented , and they sat down . After playing a game or two , Sharpe proposed having a bottle of wine , and , said he , laughingly , " Whoever loses the next game , shall pay for it . " " Agreed , " said Warren ; and the wine was brought , and he won the game . " Well , that is your good luck ; but I 'll bet you the price of another bottle you ca n't do it again . " Warren won again . They tried a third , and that Sharpe won ; a fourth , and Warren rose the winner . The next evening found them , somehow , without much talk about it , at the same place . They played with varied success ; but when they left , Warren had lost ten dollars . He wanted to win it back , and himself proposed the visit for the third night . He became excited by the game , and lost seventy dollars . Still his eyes were not open ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a professed gambler , and , hoping to get back what he had lost , and what he felt he really could not spare from his small amount of funds , he went again . " There ! " said he , after they had been about an hour at the table , " there is my last fifty-dollar bill ; change that , and I 'll try once more . " " Well , " said Sharpe , " here is the change ; but the luck seems against you . We had better stop for to-night . " But Warren insisted upon continuing , and he won thirty dollars in addition to the fifty which Sharpe had changed for him . The gambler then rose , and told him that he would give him a chance to win all back another time , as fortune seemed to be again propitious to him . Warren never saw him after that night . The next morning he determined to seek a more private boarding house , and economize his remaining funds , and seek more assiduously some business situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing the clerk one of the notes he had received in change for his last fifty-dollar bill . The clerk examined it a moment , and passed it back , saying , " That is a counterfeit note , sir . " He took it back , amazed , and offered another . " This is worse still , " said the clerk . " I think we had better take care of you , sir . You will please go with me before a magistrate . " " But I did not know --  --  ! " " You can tell that to the squire . " " You have no right to take me , " said Warren ; " you have no warrant . " " No ; but I can keep you here till I send for one , which I shall certainly do , unless you consent to go willingly . " And Warren , conscious of his own innocence in this respect , and never thinking of the difficulty of proving it , went to a magistrate 's office with the clerk at once . The clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer of the notes , swore that he had seen him , for several days past , in the company of a notorious gambler . Warren was stunned , overwhelmed , by this declaration . No representation that he made was believed . His pockets were searched , and all the money he had , except some small change , was found to be counterfeit . A commitment was at once made out against him , and he was sent to jail , to await his trial on the charge of passing counterfeit money . This is one of the methods by which professional gamblers " pluck young pigeons . " No young man is safe who allows himself to play with cards , or to handle dice . Rodney believed that Warren had told him the truth , and fellowship in misfortune drew the hearts of the duped man and the wronged boy towards each other ; for though both had been very much to blame , yet duped and wronged they had been by knaves more cunning and wicked than themselves . They had many serious conversations together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seemed truly penitent for his wanderings , as he sat by the bed-side of the sick boy , encouraged him in his resolutions to lead a different life , to seek the forgiveness and grace of God through a merciful Redeemer . Seldom has a poor prisoner received sweeter sympathy , or more salutary counsel , than was given to Rodney within the walls of that old Arch-street jail , by his fellow-prisoner . Illustration " Rodney , " said Warren to him one day , it was the first day that he had left his cot ,  --  " I shall soon leave this place ; I have written to my father , and he will be here at the trial with such evidences in my favor , from the whole course of my life , as can not fail to secure me an acquittal . I feel no doubt that this stain upon my character will be wiped away . And I believe that I shall have reason to thank God , as long as I live , for having permitted this trouble . It is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutary one . Since I have been here , I have prayed earnestly to God for the pardon of my sins . I have resolved , in sincerity of soul , to consecrate my affections and my life to his service . I have had a severe struggle ; but I believe , I feel , that God has heard my prayers , forgiven my iniquities , and the last few days in this jail have been the happiest of my life . I feel that I hate the sins of which my heart has been so full , and that I love God even for the severe providences that have checked my course of impenitence . I feel like a new man ; and if I am not deceiving myself ,  - -  and I pray that I may not be ,  - -  I have experienced that regeneration of heart of which I have so often heard , but which I could never before comprehend . " I hope that you , too , will try and seek the Saviour , pray to him for forgiveness , and beg the guidance of His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this sincerely , we shall have reason forever to bless God for the way in which he has led us . " " Pray for me , " said Rodney ; while tears rolled down his pale cheeks . " I want to be a Christian , and I hope that God will have mercy upon me , and guide me , for the future , in the right path . " A few days after , Warren was called into court to take his trial ; and , to Rodney 's great delight , for he had learned to love him like a brother ,  - -  he heard from one of the nurses that he had been honorably acquitted . During the same week , the case of Rodney was called up , and he was conducted by an officer to the court-house . CHAPTER XI . THE TRIAL . Justice was now to be administered , and Rodney was brought into the crowded court-room for trial . The officer led him to the prisoner 's narrow dock , an enclosed bench , at each end of which sat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were five or six other prisoners sitting in the dock with him . Next to him was a woman , her garments ragged , her hair matted , and her face red and bloated . Next to her sat a squalid negro , who seemed totally indifferent to the scenes that were passing around him . On the other side of him was a young man , apparently about twenty years old , of thin , spare form , with a red flush at intervals coloring his cheek , and a hollow cough that sounded like an echo from the grave . He was evidently in a deep consumption , and had been already several months in prison . And he leaned his head upon the railing , as though he would hide himself from every eye . He had been tried a few days before , for having been associated with others in a burglary , and found guilty , and he was now present to hear his sentence . After the formal opening of the court , this young man was the first called upon , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the judge . After some remarks upon the enormity of his crime , and the clear evidence upon which he had been convicted , the judge sentenced him to five years ' imprisonment in the penitentiary . When those words , five years , reached him , he dropped back upon the seat , as if struck with a bullet , and then raising his face to the judge , with an expression of profound anguish , said , " Half the time would be more than enough , your honor ; I shall be in the grave before one year is past . " The case of the negro-man was immediately called up , but Rodney heard nothing of it . He hid his face in his hands , and wept . A sense of his terrible position flashed upon him , and he could not keep back his tears , or stifle his sobs . He wept aloud , and felt , though he might not see , that all eyes were turned upon him . His whole frame shook with the anguish of his soul . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bent over the bar near him , and a voice addressed him kindly : " Be calm , my boy ; there is no good in crying ; who is your counsel ? " Rodney looked up , and saw a young man , well dressed , and with an affable and winning countenance , standing before him . His face looked kind and benevolent , at least in Rodney 's eyes , for he had spoken to him gently and encouragingly . He replied to his question , " I have no counsel , sir ; I have no money . " " Well , I will try what I can do for you , " said the young lawyer . " Come out here , and sit by me , and tell me what you are here for . " He led him out of the disgraceful dock , gave him a seat directly in front of the jury , sat down beside him , and asked him to tell him the truth about all the circumstances that led to his imprisonment and trial . Rodney told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to his arrest . He told him , too , who he was , and who were his relatives in the neighborhood of Philadelphia . He had never spoken of these before . " Well , " said the lawyer , " I do n't see that they can bring anything out to hurt you , if that is the true statement of the case . And now , my boy , you may cry as much as you wish . " Rodney looked up , surprised , wondering what on earth he wanted him to cry for . He thought afterwards that the advice was probably given that his weeping might affect the sympathies of the jury , before whose eyes he was sitting . But he could scarcely have shed a tear then if his liberty had depended upon it . He felt as though he had a friend , and his consciousness of innocence of any violation of human law , and his confidence that his new friend could show that he was guiltless , set his perturbed heart at rest , and he felt sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyer took out a card , and , giving it to Rodney , said , " If your case should be called up before I get here this afternoon , just tell them that I am your counsel , and they will put it off till I come . Here is my name . " There was but one word on the card , and Rodney kept it long as a grateful memento of the disinterested kindness that had been shown him in the hour of his bitter trial . The name on the card was **25;2802;TOOLONG WATMOUGH . A **25;2829;TOOLONG A This is not a fictitious but the real name of the gentleman whose kindness it commemorates . That young lawyer never knew the gratitude with which his name was remembered for long , long years , and the thrill of emotion which its utterance always excited in the heart of that befriended boy . An act of kindness is never lost , and many a one which the benefactor may have forgotten , has won for him the prayers and blessings of a grateful heart . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walnut-street prison . He ate his scanty prison dinner that day with a light and hopeful heart ; and though he trembled at the idea of the coming trial , yet he did not for a moment doubt that the result must be his acquittal . He believed that the law was framed to punish the guilty , and to do justice to the innocent ; and he could scarcely conceive that the guiltless could be made to suffer by its administration . Immediately after the opening of the court , in the afternoon , the case was called up . The woman in whose house the robbery was committed , and one other , were witnesses ; but not one word was said by either , in any way implicating Rodney in the robbery , beyond the fact that he had come to the house in company with the robber . His friend made a very brief speech , demanding his acquittal ; the judge said a few words to the jury , who consulted together for a moment , when the foreman arose , and pronounced the happy words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again rained down the cheeks of Rodney , as he came out of the infamous dock ,  - -  but they were tears of joy . A few kind questions were asked him by the judge ; and a small sum of money , contributed by him and by several of the members of the bar , furnished Rodney the means of returning to his friends . CHAPTER XII . CONCLUSION . Hastening to the end of our narrative , we pass by several intervening months , and witness again another Sabbath morning in May . Some twenty miles from the city of Philadelphia , a sparkling little brook passes through the meadow of a beautiful farm , losing itself in a thick wood that divides the contiguous estates . On that lovely May morning ,  - -  that serene Sabbath ,  - -  there might have been seen ,  - -  there was seen by the Omniscient eye ,  - -  a lad , some fifteen years old , walking thoughtfully along the margin of that little stream , and penetrating into the thickest part of the wood . He carried a book in his hand , and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old beech tree . And as he read , the tears streamed from his eyes , and his sighs indicated a burdened spirit . Indeed , his heart was very sad . He was oppressed by the consciousness of the great sinfulness of his life and heart against the holy and benevolent God . He remembered the early instructions he had received at home and in the Sabbath-school . He recalled the precious privileges he had enjoyed , and he remembered , with anguish and shame , how wickedly he had disregarded all these instructions , abused all these privileges , and sinned against his own knowledge of right , against his conscience and his God . He had long been burdened with these distressing emotions ; he had often prayed , but had found little relief of his anguish , even in prayer . And now , even on this calm and beautiful Sabbath morning , there seemed to his heart a gloom in the landscape . There was a smile , he knew , upon the face of nature , but he felt that it beamed not for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; but the music saddened his heart yet more , for there was no inward response of gratitude and joy . The bright green of the Spring foliage and of the waving grass seemed dark and gloomy , as he gazed upon it through tearful eyes . His mourning spirit gave its own sombre interpretation to all the lovely scenes of nature . He deeply felt that he was a wretched sinner against God , and he could not see how God could be merciful to one who had so grievously transgressed . He scarcely dared to hope for the pardon of his iniquities , and was in almost utter despair of ever obtaining mercy . The book he had taken with him in his morning walk , was " Doddridge 's Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul . " He read , carefully , the twelfth chapter in that excellent work , entitled , " The invitation to Christ of the sinner overwhelmed with a sense of the greatness of his sins . " He was convinced that Jesus Christ was able to save even him ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " even to the uttermost , " furnished in the promises of the gospel , began to dawn upon his mind as he read what seemed like a new revelation to his soul . When he read these words of Jesus , " Come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest , "  --  " Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out , "  - -  though he had read , or heard them read , a thousand times before , it seemed now as though they had been written expressly for him . There seemed a freshness , a force , a glorious personal adaptation in them which he had never seen before . He turned over the leaves of the book , and the chapter on " Self Dedication " caught his eye . He read it ; and when he came to the prayer with which that chapter closes , he kneeled down , with the book open before him , and solemnly , and with his whole heart , repeated that fervent prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express his emotions and desires . When he had concluded , he closed the book , and remained still upon his knees , and tried , in his own language , to repeat the sentiments of that solemn act of Dedication . Never was a boy more sincere and earnest than he . How long he prayed he did not know ; but when he rose and looked round him , the sun had long passed its meridian , and the shadows of the trees were cast towards the east . There was a delicious , joyful calm in his soul . All doubts of God 's willingness to pardon and receive him had gone . A veil seemed to have been removed from the character of God . He thought of God as he had never thought before , not as a stern and unrelenting Judge , but as a forgiving , loving Father . He saw , as he had never seen before , how sinners could be adopted as children of God , for the sake of the sufferings and sacrifice of Jesus . His spirit was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly given himself to God , pleading the merits of Jesus as the reason for his acceptance , and he believed that God had received him , pardoned his transgressions , and accepted him as one of his own children . Again and again did he throw himself on the greensward , and pour out his soul in gratitude and in prayer . It was the happiest day his life had ever known . The whole aspect of nature seemed changed in his eyes . The gloomy shroud , that seemed to envelop it in the morning , had passed away . The smile of God seemed reflected from every sunbeam that played upon the green leaves and danced over the distant waving meadow . There was sweet melody now in the songs of the birds , in the rippling of the brook , in the hum of the bees , and in the sighing of the soft breeze . All seemed to sing of the goodness and grace of the adorable Creator . " Old things had passed away , behold all things had become new . " That lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change was wrought by the regenerating grace of God . It was the " peace of God , that passeth all understanding , " diffused through all his soul . Where " sin had abounded , grace did much more abound . " Rodney Roverton yet lives . He has been , for many years , a professed disciple of Jesus Christ , and an honored and successful minister of the Gospel .
