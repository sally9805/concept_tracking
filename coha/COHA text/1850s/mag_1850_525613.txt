Happy , happy people were they of old ; wretched , toilsome , the lot of us of modern days . ' Meanwhile , notwithstanding these lamentations and longings after the unrecoverable past , when it comes to a struggle for life between the two principles , Democracy invariably triumphs ; the people have it all their own way . What is called reaction , is never apparently a retrogression . The Bastile is not rebuilt : no thought of such a thing . Paris continues Democratic even u*xder a monarchy . Governments of the old form are re-established for an hour , for a day , for an age , only to be thrown down with redoubled violence . All appeals are to the people ,  --  the poorer class ,  --  they are the acknowledged sovereigns . It is theirs to choose between monarchy and democracy . In America the struggle is finished , and in all men 's minds , there is a settled feeling that laws should emanate from the people , or from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil wars ; here , a c2mmunity at peace with itself . There is outlet for ambition in the bloodless strife of party ; there is a love of order and a *sense of the dignity of manhood , and of the nature of public and private rights , which confers upon the body of the laws , and upon the general structure of society , a stability combined with a plasticity and flexibility suitable to the progressive and improving spirit of the age . Democracy in America is a solid and well established form of government , not because of any inherent stability and firmness in Democracy itself , but because of the unanimity and peaceful acquiescence of the people in its decrees . An aristocracy , a constitutional monarchy , or any other form , were it once agreed upon and adopted , and acquiesced in , as the great and final fact of the age ,  --  as very destiny itself- ( for in this light is republican democracy viewed in America , ) might stand as firmly ; - no thanks to the virtue of its founders or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds and hearts of a people is a permanent and indistructable form , or distructable only by new ideas and modern opinions , more attractive and amiable than the old : and on such a foundation rests American republican Democracy , that it reigns sole monarch in the pride and affection of the people ; the glory of the private man is that he too is no idle member of the State , but can effectually stretch out his hand against oppression , and cast a condemnatory vote , and fear no consequences ; or if such a fear crosses him , he will search out its cause , and will not rest till he has crushed it . In America the power of the individual citizen is absolutely unlimited : whatever of native strength and advantage he is crowned with , setting aside the ordinary chances which befal human endeavor , and that medium of good and evil chance , which it has pleased God to mingle in the affairs of men , his success and his honor and his influence will be duly proportioned to the ability and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . If these things are true , the glory and the power of the nation must become commensurate with its native valor and strength , and more than that , the consummation sighed for by all philosophers , ' a government by nature 's aristocracy , a government of the best and strongest , must finally be here established ; and that too , will be a government by law , since the best and the strongest are , under God , the defenders of law . This then is what we mean by a popular government , a government where those only are admitted to the control who can make the people elect them ; - who can force the people to elect them , by the admiration and the awe of their ability and 1850. 557 // their virtue , and their supernatural vigor and foresight . Strong men in the villages and low hamlets , strongest among the few that surround them , are chosen by their peers ; these elect others , better and more prominent than themselves , and thus the representative principle is carried oi*t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents of chance , lies one predominant and ever ruling principle , upon which rest laws , usages , and influences ; and that is the fear and veneration which we have for those who are , morally speaking , more powerful and far-sighted than ourselves . Governments , whether monarchic , aristocratic or republican , rest upon fear and veneration , whose form and exterior front , ceremonially expressed , we name religion ,  --  worship . Men adore and worship virtue and force , but more especially virtue conjoined with force , under its various names of Piety , Heroism , and Statesmanship ,  --  the three kings ,  --  intellectual sovereigns ,  --  which rule all human affairs , under God , whose representative on earth they are . What then is a form of government , if it is not some particular method of ascertaining , of sifting and choosing out among the rising spirits of the time , those powerful and aspiring intelligences who are marked by nature and shaped by education to become the recipients of authority ? T*e Constitution ascertains for us the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices and functions of authority , of its inferior servants and functionaries , necessary to the establishment of a State , and the preservation of peace and order . It assigns over to the people , ( as it must do in justice to them , seeing that it is only living men who can judge living men , ) the business of selecting and appointing those who shall fill and satisfy the duties of the State . Our ancestors ascertained the form and the places of the state , for they saw it at its birth , and they alone could cast its horoscope ; but they could not select the living representatives of power for ages to come : it was a part of their wisdom , enlightened by a religiousregard , that they did not do this , and even forbade it forever to be done , and would allow nothing hereditary to come into the constitution of their state . They believed only in the aristocracy of God and the choice of the people ; they left their government in the the hands of the two powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in the many . They founded their state for all futurity upon the veneration of the people , and the greatness and majesty of those few who alone are fit , ( for the day and for the hour , ) to be the people 's representatives . They left the State in the hands of their successors , to be increased as they had increased it in its three dimensions , of solidity , durability , and extension . In every dimension of excellence , they trusted it would increase . In solidity , or , in other words , in its internal organic strength . The people to be more thoroughly bound together , by ties moral and mechanical . By community of sentiments , interest , and language , by facilities of intercommunication , and of internal commerce and exchange . This process of progress and nationalization , by internal improvement , and the steady pacificative and protective influence of good laws , was intended , by them , to augment that first dimension of excellence internal depth , and solidity of organization . For the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , trusted to the affections and the veneration of the people , who would always look back with reverence to the maxims of the founders of the Republic : and , still more , to that invincible attachment which all men have to institutions , which secure them in the enjoyment of freedom . They provided , also , a constitution of government of which the parts are compensatory , and operate as so many natural checks and balances upon each other . For the third dimension of the greatness of the State . namely , its superficial extension , the founders of the Union left no settled maxims , nor any system of policy . They were too intently occupied with solidifying and conferring properties of duration upon our institutions , to anticipate the exigencies of territorial extension . It is not , however , at all difficult to conjecture what line of policy would have been indicated by them , had they chosen to advise their successors on this point . In the cession of all the State territories to the nation , in the treaty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across 558 Juue , // the continent , and in the purchase of Louisiana , and of Florida , we have a succession of acts illustrating the policy which actuated them . They were wise enough ' to accomplish , by negotiation and purchase , what a certain desperate and witless faction have lately undertaken to accomplish by seizure and invasion . It is said that we have no colonial policy , when , at this very time , the entire nation is agitated by a controversy regarding the admission of several colonies to the dignity of States and Territories . A more effectual , though unsystematic , colonization than ours , the world has never known . It surpasses that of all other nations , not only in its rapidity but in the spirit by which it is sustained , and in its effects upon the nation at large . To attain a correct understanding of our own colonial movements , it will be necessary to take a rapid survey of that of other nations , both ancient and modern . From a few centres the tribes*of the Hellenes spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promontories , and gradually the entire shores of the Mediterranean and Euxine seas . They had not a colonial system , but they colonized most effectually . Egypt , in the days of her military renown had a colonial system , strictly so called , and like that of England in our time , it was chiefly for commercial ends . This was at a time when Egyp* was the great power of the world ; the civilizer and the conqueror of East and West . There is reason to believe that with the early Pharaos the military colonial was a part of the general system of State policy . Before the building of Tyre and Sidon , while the Greeks were as yet an unknown tribe of Barbarians , before the Exodus of the Hebrews , before Rome had become even a village ; the military trading colonies established by a series of conquering Pharaos , had planted the germs of civilization along all the shores of Europe and Asia . By *er colonial system Egypt civilized and subdued the world , and made all nations tributary to her trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from export and the produce of land . The lines of Egyptian cOn ( luest were the lines of primeval commercial enterprise , stretching out in great radii to the Straits of Calpe , and the Capes of *Good Hope and Coromandel . To this first and most gigantic of all colonial systems , if we except that of England , may be traced the centralizatioa of ancient arts , arms , commerce and religion about the shores of the Mediteranean ; giving the early nations that preparation which they needed to receive in succeeding centuries the higher and more positive and ameliorating influences of Phcenician , Grecian , Roman , Saracenic , Gallic and English conquest . We find at the foundation of the political system , of the Egyptians , the principle of caste , by which the people were divided into many orders , the three principal orders being the Priesthood , the Military , and the Industrial classes . The military orders and the Priesthood depended for their subsistence upon the labors of the inferior castes their colonies , like the nation itself , were composed invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the priests converted and instructed , and the merchants traded with the people whom they subdued . We may suppose the Pharaos to have been impelled by a three fold motive in extending their conquests and detaching their colonies ; first , to increase their revenues and to enlarge the commerce of their merchants , by which they themselves also thrived ; second , to reap for themselves military renown , and third and lastly to make the worship of Egypt the common worship of all nations . Our limits forbid us here from entering far enough into the subject to show that commercial intercourse was the leading and most powerful motive with these primeval conquerors , and those who in after ages followed their example . That the colonial system of Egypt was not the best nor the most efficient , partaking in every particular of the weakness and corruption of their home economy and general policy , is evident from the rapidity and ease with which they were supplanted by the powers who succeeded them , and who brought other and more liberal systems of colonization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and superior in efficacy , follows the colonial system of the Phcenicians , whose lines of commercial enterprise were marked at intervals by the founding 1850. 559 // of powerful cities , but who also failed to perpetuate themselves , because of the incurable ferocity and selfishness of their institutions . Following fast upon the colonies of Phoenecia , came those of Hellenic origin ; the overflow of the cities of the Grecian Archipelago . These were of a peQplc essentially clannish and narrow , incapable of extending their patriotism beyond the liberty and glory of a state sovereignty . When the population of a little Grecian state became excessive , a portion moved off taking with them all that was necessary for the formation of a colony . It was their custom to seize upon such a portion of the earth 's surface as seemed convenient for themselves , expelling the original possessors by force and fraud . The shores of the Mediterranean were dotted with Grecian colonies ; which , soon after their planting , through the superior genius and martial prowess of their founders , were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough and no more than might serve them for agricultural purposes . They carried with them their domestic servants , freedmen and slaves , who were denied the use of arms . The aggregate population of the Grecian cities must have been many millions at the time of the commencement of the Roman conquests ; but from the clannish and democratic character of their policy , they were sever united in an Empire , even when their territories were contiguous . Grecian statesmanship extended only to the preservation , and if that could be added , to the domination of a little state or territory . Such was the colonial system of the Hdllenic tribes , powerful to extend itself , not only from the superior character of the Greeks themselves , as a people , but from the naturalness and the unforced freedom of their system ; their motive being the enjoyment only of their own lives and institutions , and not the extension of an Empire for the increase * royal revenues or of mercantile wealth . Notwithstanding the want of an organizing , or if we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , the power of their civilization , and superior liberality and in* telligence , made them effectually the masters and instructors of the world They accomplished nothing by any grand system of conquests . The empire of Alexander was an empire existing only during the life of its founder , and rested on the terror of his name . But this empire , to which so much more than its real glory and importance has been given by historians , was not strictly Grecian , and originated in a genius of which Alexander and his father , Philip , are the sole exemplars . The political genius of the Greeks developed and expended itself wherever it appeared in a conflict between two parties ; the philosophical or aristocratic , which represented the oriental element in the Greek character , and the popular or democratic , which as truly , represented the occidental or European . In the order of providence , we find the political energies of the Hellenic people concentrated and exhausted in the conflict between these two parties into which every Grecian city was divided . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece . The sovereignties differed from each other only by the greater or less appearance of the aristocratic or democratic parties . If democracy triumphed , the aristocrat was converted into a demagogue , and demagogy changed swiftly into tyranny ; and this is the summary of Grecian political history . The colonies sympathized , and sometimes formed alliances with each other ; there was a sympathy of Greek with Greek there was an alliance offensive and defensive among the older cities ; there was even a confederacy , with a council of States , the shadow of a nation , but no union ; there was never at any time , a Grecian Empire with a law recognized as Grecian . Rome follows next , and surpasses all her predecessors ; she , first and alone , cf ancient nations , began to form an Empire by the extension of a law that should be common to its members . Little as we know of the early history of Rome , we are yet well assured that it began with the union of many tribes in one city . Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political institutions , but not so far differing as to be incapable of asJiznilation , were blended together , by the superior moral power of some few among them , in a common state or sovereignty . Thus , at its very birth , we find the germs of those principles which afterward made that Power co-extensive 560 June , // almost with the human family . There were no obstructions of caste ; there was no exclusion through difference of religious sentiment . Foreigners were not reckoned impure , contemptible , or odious , because they were foreicrners . A neighboring tribe , inferior in forc* and intellig*nce , could be taken into the city , and allowed to shar* the priveleges and responsibilities of the common sovereignty . There was an aristocracy , but there was not , at the first , domestic slavery : Aristocracy was sustained by merit ; Democracy was protected and encouraged by the laws ; there was a conflict between the orders , but it was , comparatively , a humane conflict . Instead of massacres , there were concessions ; there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of policy we perceive the universality of Roman genius , and the ground of its capacity for empire . To govern all men , it is necessary first to recognize all as men . The colonial system of the Romans was origin ally forced upon them by the necessities of their position . Their colonies were in every instance established for the protection of a military frontier . A genius such as theirs , claiming , and justly too , to have no superior , but to be , by virtue of its higher principles , the governing power of the world , extending itself also by commerce , and rendering tributary the industry of surrounding nations , while itself maintained a armed and neutral attitude , must either overcome or be overcome : it could have no fixed boundary , but always a moveable , inclusive , and enlarging limit . About the military colonies , asabout cities of refuge , gathered all those who fled from the inequality and oppression of their own laws . Roman justice and authority carried with it an attractive power ; its genius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalizing and tolerant . Thus , by her colonial system , and not by occasionally traversing and desolating vast regions , Rome founded an enduring and ever extemding empire : she colonized all Europe and a part of Asia , and , colonizing , conquered it ; and conquering , governed arid auieliorated the condition of those she conquered . if a portion of the earth had become Grecian , almost the whole became Roman . Britain , Gallia , Spain , Greece , the shores of the Black Sea , the eastern shores of the Mediterraneam , the northern countries of Africa , Asia Minor , and even the shores of the Caspian were rather governed than subjugated by the wisdom and the valor of the universal people ; a people of all nations , but who , from their very ori* , in , had the art to draw to themselves and employ in their magnificent political system , the genius , and the talent , and the valor of almost the entire world ; extending over the nations the privileges and the immunities , the laws , customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and receiving , in turn , with equal liberality , all that might flow into them from other races and intelligences , and forms of civilization , to blend with and refine their own . Rome became the centre of the world : such was the liberality of her genius . The sceptre of her emperors passed to her Bishops ; and , as before with laws , so now with religions , she fused together the human family by the universality and grandeur of her Christian doctrine . And now , instead of military colonies , she began to send out missionaries , colonies of faith ; and thus she made a second conquest , more enduring than the first . The sceptre has again passed from her hands , but the lesson remains with us : we of the new empire of freedom have nil her universality , and her liberality , and her justice ; and we have more than that , * much more , and , doubtless , a career before us , more glorious and memorable . Among the nations of modern Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most important are Spain and England ; but in a general view it will be necessary to include the Netherlands , Russia , Portugal , and several of the States of Germany . The remote and almost desert regions of Siberia have been colonized by the removal of state prisoners eastward ; we find the city of Tobolsk in Siberia composed almost entirely of persons exiled for political offences : in addition to these Russia has established by the attractive power , or the direct influence of her policy , military colonies upon the Black Sea , which have become seats of commerce . The despotism of Russia , however , has not the universality necessary to the extension and formation of a solid empire she is able to subjugate , but not to 1850. 561 // govern and civilize in her own manner the surrounding nations upon whom she aggresses : her empire is an aggregate , bound about and held together by the iron tire of despotism , which expands itself during the heat of conquest , and contracts firmly upon the included masses in times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she increases in size , but , excepting at the centre , and with her proper people , neither in authority nor in respectability . The barbarians tributary to her , have been always tributary to some one of the great Eastern powers . It is a law of barbarian existence , in Asia and in Eastern Europe , that a tribe shall be the tributary of an empire , and always to that which is the nearest and most civilized ; and by this necessity , and not by any inherent or acquired superiority of policy or government , the broken masses which compose the Russian Empire , cohere at the edges , andfloat together . The Dutch people of the low countries , might be expected , from their occupation and their derivation , to discover a genius for colonization By their mercantile enterprises they have extended the lines of their trade slenderly around the surface of the globe , and we find them through a period of three centuries , founding merchant colonies in remote seas ; but in no part of the world have this people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with *i energy or rapidity sufficient to form a new nation . Estimating their genius for colonization we find them in the third rank , inferior to Spain or England inferior even to the Phoenicians , and much more to the Greeks : If they can be compared with any nation of antiquity in this respect , it is to the Phoenicians ; not only in the buccaneer character of their enterprises , but the hardness and isolation , and the deficiency of protecting and governing power , through which they have failed to control effectually , or to aSsimilate with , the nations among whofti they have alighted . In the second order , as to success in colonial enterprises , we have to place the people of Spain and Portugal , whose expeditions combined the spirit of a crusade , or of a Saracenic invasion with that of a merchant enterprise ; witness the conquests and settlements of the Por tuguese-on both the shores of the new continents , where , first among modern European nations , they succeeded in planting colonies , which should grow afterwards into States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in numbers and in civilization . The crusade is an enterprise of conquest sanctified by pretexts of religion ; it breaks the courage and destroys the nationality of the people , whom it subdues . The triumph of a colonial system , on the contrary , is to preserve that which the crusade destroys ; to convert and ameliorate , but not by violence ; and thus to raise and organise those whom it subjugates , leaving them free in their opinion and religion , until such time as interest and reason may prepare them for conversion and the triumph of a true conquest , after the Roman and English model , is , to confer upon the conquered people the freedom and the benefits of the empire . In both these respects the Spaniards and the Portuguese have signally failed : their colonies , established in the two Americas , have been marked , from their origin to the present time , with every species and grade of oppression and extortion , exercised not only upon the aborigines , whom they enslaved and exterminated , but each colony upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ill success , their ferocity at first , and their weakness and effeminacy now , are among the most familiar traits of history . South America and Mexico remain , as at first , after three centuries of occupation by Europeans , with their natural resources undeveloped , and their populations weak , ill governed and two thirds uncivilized . More fortunate in their methods , or rather in their spontaneity of colonization , have been the industrious , though narrowminded Chinese , whose populous empire is pouring annually its hundreds of thousands over all the shores and islands of the Asiatic seas . In them we discover no organization or clinging together of separate colonies Impelled by the simple instinct of self-preservation , they move off like emigrating rats or lemurs , floating from point to point , and from island to island , and every where clinging to the land . They carry neither governmen.t nor arms , but only industry , and the simplest arts of peace . It is supposed that they will eventually form the 562 June , // staple population of the Southern Asiatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colonization of the Germans , Danes and Swedes , that of Germany alone , among these , in the shape of emigration , having become of late a feature in history , we come to that of France , which seemed to have owed its existence more to her ambition and her jealousy of Spain and England , than to any other cause . If England did any thing , France would be doing the same ; and , therefore , France has her colonial history ; but it scarcely deserves a record , having been , so far , wholly unsuccessful ; at certain times it has become , or has seemed to become , necessary for the government of France to occupy the attention of her restless and ambitious people with planting colonies : She will send on a sudden , and seize upon some remote island , or territory , usually with a view to incommode or intimidate her great rival , England . But these enterprises of hers , begun in impolicy , and for sinister ends , have terminated with little credit to herself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her people ever succeeded in establishing themselves in a condition approaching independence of the mother country . A more wasteful and aimless colonization than the modern French occupation of Algiers , where , as in some vast Syrtis , " a-mies whole have sunk " with small results , has not its record in history . France indeed can not be said to have a colonial system : as we have already hinted , it seems necessary that France shodld imitate England in colonizing ; but she has not steadiness of hand to wield a policy so delicate and difficult , and like the imitator in the fable , wounds herself in the attempt . Last in order , but first in rank , and comparable only with that of Rome , follows colonization by the English , a people who control an empire of which the weightier half hangs beneath them at the antipodes . The English minister at the Court of St. James , with his working parliamentary majority , wields the destiny of the most civilized people of Asia , the Hindoos ; while at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iNortli America , and of the wealthiest islands of the West Indies ; commands ingress and egress to the Mediterranean , threatens all the shores of Africa and South America , opens by force the ports of China , manages the trade of the Red Sea and Mesopotamia , dispatches simultaneously northern and southern polar expeditions , carries on armed negotiations with the Arabs of the Persian Gulf , advances the civilization of Egypt , protects the Islands of the South Seas and the fisheries of Nootka Sound , plants colonies in New Zealand , and in the new continent of Australia ; where even now there is growing up a new nation of Anglo-Saxon origin and opinion , and speaking the language of England ; and more than this , the English Minister , who concentrates in his little person , or who should concentrate in it , the wisdom of all governments and of all exigencies , controls the . opinion , and through that the commercial policy of the free empire of America ; which he wields to his purposes , the purposes of his commerce , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself the dispenser of all benefits , and the arbiter of all fates . Let us , if possible , by fixing our eye steadily upon the general fact , and forgetting , for the time , as of necessity we must , the immensity of its details , detect the secret of such wonderful successes . The colonial policy of England emanates from her domestic system ; her domestic system represents the character of her people ; or , rather , of the governing classes of her people ; of the Norman conquerors of England , whom we are able to compare only with the Patricians of Rome to obtain a right idea of the power that lies in them , and the erectness and supremacy with which they were endowed by the Creator . The Englishman proper , since the days of William the Conqueror , is the master of polity ; he is a conqueror , like the Roman ; he overcomes every thing that is opposed to him , excepting his younger brother . Like the Roman , he is a conqueror , but not a devastator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wish to be the scourge hut the servant , of God ; there is nothing in him barbarous or cruel ; he delights in conferring benefits ; he prunes and subdues but he does not destroy ; he governs benignly though , most part , severely and heavily the nations are his gardens which he cultiyates ; he enjoys his control , as much as he does his profits ; he takes a pride in his 1850. 563 // empire , and wastes his revenue upon it , as he does upon his park and his stud of hunters ; Asia is his conservatory , which he protects , not only for the tropic elegancies which she yields him , but for the beauty of her submission . Such a conqueror is the Englishman , and such before him , though inferior , was the Roman . When we add to this peculiar genius for government which marks the English , as it did the Roman conqueror , that singular liberality of sentiment which accords to all freedom of opinion , which sedulously refrains from forcing the conscience or controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods ; and to this , urbanity in negotiation , a skill in touching the generosity and moving the affection of inferiors , we have , in great part , the secret of the superior success of England in extending and confirming her empire ; in rooting her colonies in the soil of foreign countries , and creating between the aborigines and their new masters satisfactory ties of dependence and amity . Here , doubtless , is at least the moral secret of her success , and it belongs to the character of the Englishman , as it does with equal or even greater force to his brother , the American . Thus these two have been the most successful colonizers and founders of states . Other advantages , however , it is necessary te take into consideration ,  --  the mechanical ingenuity and warlike skill of the Anglo-Norman , and the courage and indomitable firmness of purpose ,  --  the single , far-sighted , adventurous will ,  --  the placidity of temper and constitution , adapting itself readily to all climates and circumstances ,  --  the love of toil for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical fruits of toil ,  --  a certain reliance on good fortune , or rather upon Providence , and a conviction of being always on the side protected and f*ored by the Dispenser of all good. - To sum all up , we trace the successes of English and American colonization to those leading moral traits , generosity , statesman-like prudence , and veneration for rights and laws , which characterize the race . In all of these , too , the Roman though much inferior , may be compared with his modern representative ; for Rome was especially the originator of those na tional codes by which the civilized world is governed in modern times . Under the colonial system of England are embraced a great variety of policies : there is , for example , first , the treatment of her immediate dependencies . Ireland was originally colonized , and continues from time to time to be colonized directly from England ; and the government of that dependency has the faults and the imperfections which attend the entire system of English colonial government ; for while we claim for England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known , excepting our own , it is necessary also to admit that through a natural obstinacy or short-sightedness , she adheres too pertinaciously to that system of measures which were unquestionably necessary and salutary in their operation during the times immediately following a conquest . When her colonies have grown to the full stature and ability of a nation , England refuses to accord them their necessary liberties and interests and there ensues , between the dependency and the mother country , a series of revolutionary struggles . The English statesman insists that a colonist shall be always a colonist : and , in this respect , the governing classes of England compare disadvantageously with those of Rome in her best days . There is a systematic rigidity , a pertinacious adherence to the old system , a resolution not to admit the younger brother to the rights and honors of the elder . Rome , under her wisest Emperors , incorporated her provinces with the Empire , with such distinctions only , and precedences as the nature of the people themselves might render expedient ; and here the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , carries her aristocratic distinctions into the general system of the imperial government . It may be , nay , it certainly is a necessity arising out of the form of her government , which is representative , that she should do so ; for if one of her colonies ? reaches the dignity of an independent state by growth in numbers , wealth and civilization , there is no longer any reason why it should remain dependant . Discontents and rebellions follow , seemingly of course , and the result may be almost with certainty predicted . This result , however , is predictable only when the new state is composed 564 June , // in great part of colonists from the mother country , who carry with them the representative principle , with ideas of popular liberty . It is necessary to make due allowance for this peculiarity , in judging of the colonial system of England ; the spirit of defection goes out with the colonist and when he finds himself strong enough , he begins to claim the prescriptive right of representation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the West Indies , by the peculiarity of their situation , and the sparseness of their white population , governing inferior masses of enslaved barbarians , offer a second , and wholly different , instance ; they , of necessity , lean upon the mother country , because of their internal weakness . Wholly different from the preceding were the mercantile colonies of eastern Asia. - Conquests , in the strictest sense of the term , over a people accustomed to be conquered and governed , time out of mind , by invaders superior to themselves in military prowess and civil wisdom . The conquests in India , by the English , were not properly conquests over the Hindoos themselves , but over their Mahomedan masters , whose expulsion left India devoid of government . The English merchants and soldiers came naturally and properly in the place of those whom they expelled , and were immediately , and even cheerfully , recognised by the in*abitants as masters more humane , and governors more just and efficient than those who preceded them . Thus the colonization of England presents at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first of these forms being that which she has always found most difficult to exercise , namely , over a colonization exclusively by her own people , as in Ireland and North America ; second , over one like that of the West Indies , where a sparse population of her citizens required the constant protection and support of the mother country ,  --  and with these she has been more successful ; and , lastly , over a conquest , more suitable to the Anglo-Norman genius , when coming as an invader , she ejects other invaders , and governs a civilized people expecting and wishing to be governed by a race superior to themselves . These are the large and simple phases of English colonial domination : other forms , intermediate to the , of a mixed character , partake , more or less , of the nature of their types . Running through'all these lines of policy , and characterizing , almost without exception , every act of colonial legislation , we discover the motive of the home interest ; the motive which actuates the mercantile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colony only as a market or a factory , whence he may receive produce , and where he may sell , for his own profit , the products of English industry . To the eye of the merchant legislator a colony is a mine of wealth for the home interest , and must be governed for the advantage of that interest . The colonial ministry calculate exchanges ; they adjust tariffs , and pass acts for the regulation of colonial commerce , conducive only to the wealth of England . The offices of the colonies must be filled by younger sons , pennyless nephews , and promising proteges , who are there to reap wealth and honors , to make them worthy co-mates of their more fortunate brothers and cousins at home . The army is established for the defence of the colony , and the colony is governed for the honor and the benefit of the army : England is everywhere : all things must flow back to England ; she governs like a lord ; she legislates like a merchant* and it happens from this cause as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sooner is a colony of Englishmen strong enough to protect its own interests , it wishes to shake off dependence upon its employer and merchant-master at home . It wishes to labor and to trade on its own account . It will not be taxed , nor have its commerce and manufactures suppressed for the benefit of an English Plutocracy . Whenever the condition of her conquered subjects , and the colonists mingled with them , has been such as to create a full dependence upon the mother country , the colonial system of England has worked . better than any hitherto adopted , even by the wisest nations of antiquity ; not so much because of the superiority of the motive , ( which , we conceive , has been always , primarily , the maintenance of the home interest , ) as because of the superior liberality of the Anglo Saxons and the Anglo Normans themselves ; - of their superiorliberality and 1850. 565 // magnanimity , which tempers a legislation founded upon trade , with principles and motives superior to the mere calculations of gain . From such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free system , which combines the three principles of Greek , Roman , and English colonizatioii and territorial extension ; for , first , the American colonist , wherever he goes , has extended over him the protection of the mother country ,  --  of the imperial free government of the Union ; and , so far , our system assimilates to that of Rome under her mildest Emperors . And , secondly , our system resembles that of the more cultivated Greeks , in the immediate recognition of new colonies as independent states ,  --  democratic sovereignties ; and , lastly , it combines also the system of England in its first motive , which is economy and the increase of wealth . The wealth of the nation as a whole , actuates the colonial legislation of America . But this motive is regulated and kept in check , and guided in its action , by the irresistible principles of the centre ; namely , the three Inviolabilities , of individual liberty , of state sovereignty , and the supreme regulative power of the Nation , or Union . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free colonization ; and that a colonial policy bears every feature of the system of government from which it emanates . In the features of the child we recognize , in their purity and simplicity , those of the parent . Casting an eye then backward over the history of our nation to its origin , we find the first colonies planted upon our shores by an unusual and eccentric movement in the mother country . It had never been the custom of England to drive away her citizens for opinion 's sake , until the times of the persecutions , during which a portion of her inhabitants were driven from their homes and fire-sides to find freedom in the wilderness . These colonists were exiled by a three-fold persecution , social , religious and political ; they were oppressed first by an hierarchy , and they carried with them , in consequence , the germs of religious freedom they were contemned and ousted from places of social honor by a haughty aristocracy , and they took with them , in consequence , an hatred of hereditary priv*i1ege . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived , or affected to derive , from their ancient constitutions ; and they bore , in consequence , to their new homes the seeds of civil and political liberty . Such , at least , were the ideas of the major part of those early colonists , who stamped its present character upon the American government . But this was not all ; they took with them what every Saxon , and every Anglo-Norman inherits , a feeling of nationality , an idea of empire , and of the union and oneness of many states , the highest form of political organization . Hence the pertinacity with which they clung to the mother country ; hence their veneration for the crown , as a perpetual witness and evidence of the union and oneness of the empire . So powerfully however , did the old leaven of selfishness , conjoined with the passion of conquest and subjugation , work in the minds of the governing classes in England , so blindly and pertinaciously did they continue their denial of rights to the colonists ,  --  . the mercantile spirit looking askance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , created for the benefit of the home interest ,  --  notwithstanding the strong attachment , notwithstanding intimate relationship and mutual dependence , separation became inevitable . Thus was added , by the experience of suffering under the oppressions of the homegovernment , a new principle to guide the nation in the extension of its empire ; and this was the principle of the State Sovereignty , remoteness from the centre detracting nothing from the rights of the citizen as the member of a representative State . In a word , the platform upon which they stood while contending for their liberties with the mother country , became as it naturally should , the platform of their separate empire . While this original platform is adhered to in the extension , as well as4he consolidation of the nation , we need entertain no anxiety for the future . The first provision in our system , is that the citizen shall not be deprived of his rights as an elector . It follows that , if circumstances like those of a remote colony , have deprived him , for a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of representative government , in his State and in the Union , he ought , with the greatest possible expedition , to be re-incorporated with the people , of whom he is a member , and reinstated in those privileges of which he has been temporarily deprived . We will not say , in this connection , that the hindrances which have been thrown down before the new State of California , and have threatened to exclude her from the 1Jnion , are unconstitutional hindrances ; we are not strict constructionists , in that sense , to believe that every thing wrong , or impolitic , or injurious , is therefore unconstitutional ; the constitution covers only half the ground of national policy ; it says nothing of colonies ; it meets no exigencies arising upon the extension of the empire ; it lays down no code for the government of territories or colonies . The founders of this government were not prophets in that sense , that they could legislate without a knowledge of the circumstances to which their laws should be applied ; they could give us only rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annexed , nor was that of Florida ; neither were Missouri or Michigan constitutionally anncxed . Nay , was not the Constitution itself a measure for which no constitution had made provision ? Was there any provision in the law of the thirteen old colonies which permitted them to cede their nationality to the Union ? The aim of our colonial policy , if we have and is , that the general structure of the government , or rather that the unity and solidity of our free empire shall not he impaired by the rapidity of its growth ; that an equal vitality and intensity of organizatioa shall pervade every part of it , even to remote extremities . Such is the aim , and for its accomplishment what are the means First , that the native horn , or the adopted citizen shall carry out with him , as an emigrant and a colonist , a feeling that his government goes with him ;  --  a feeling of security as a subject , and of pride and'confidence as a citizen . Second , that he go , not with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambitious and usurping government , coming at his rear to abet invasion , hut with a confidence that when the time is ripe , and he and his fellows have occupied the land , and have made themselves a State , they may efiter again into their nationalities , and recover their citizenship . A colony , not many years ago , planted itself upon the territory of the Mexican Republic ; and there , under the protection of that Republic , acquired the strength and properties of an independent State . It had become desirable in the natural order of events , that they should enter again into the body of the nation from which they were detached . The process of their annexation was an easy and an obviou* one . Had there been a colonial system , recognized as a part of the general policy of our government , the colony of Texas might have re-entered into the Union without a war , and perhaps as a free , and not a slave State ; but , instead of a colonial system , what had we ? On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement and tendency of affairs-who perceived the necessity and certainty that new territories should be added , and the empire extended , if it were only by the natural growth of population , and who yet proposed to vote down the order of events , and who , rather than suffer the addition of a new State , on the wrong side of their balance , would have permitted a division of the continent , and the establishment of independent and rival republics of the same blood and language They , indeed , did not want more territory ,  --  they had no occasion for new States ; but the moving masses of the people had occasion , and did want more territory and more States , and it was an useless endeavor to attempt to vote down their desires or to make their enterprize and adventurous courage a reason for their exile and expatriation . There was an injustice in the opposition against which the popular instinct rebelled , and , naturally , it overleaped the limits of law and reason , and , in a violent reaction , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression against this timid and inefficient policy . On the other side , therefore , there arose a party of annexationists  --  a war party , who saw well enough the necessary course and order of events before them ; who felt the expansive movement , but who , deserted by the light of reason , and leaving behind them the wise example of our forefathers ,  --  the purchasers and negotiators ,  - -  1850. 567 // this faction of no principle proclaimed their purpose to be the conquest and absorption , of the entire continent . There were colonies of armed settlers on the Northern frontier who were to begin a war with England for the acquisition of Canada . By the exercise of a wisdom , which , embodied in one man , represertts the prudence of the American peoplq , that danger was averted . A second effort saved us a second time-during the boundary altercation with England about the Northern territories on the Pacific side of the Continent . In their third attempt , the instigators of war were more successful instead of purchasing from Mexico what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a spirit of peace and conciliation , we trod rudely upon her frontiers , and roused her to a spirit irreconcilably hostile , and that refused negotiation . Late in the day , after a prodigious expenditure of blood and treasure , we recovered ourselves , and began to see reason and right again , as before ; and we purchased the territory which our war faction would have had us seize for a conquest . And now the same faction are beginning again , a fourth time , or , rather , a fifth , - for we recognize them first at the time of the annexation of Louisiana ,  --  and they are preparing for us a series of alarming difficulties ; their aim is universal empire , by conquest , on the new continent . They know he movements and desires of the more restless portion of the people , and with the bayonet they point the way . Their designs look not far into the future ,  - -  not beyond an age . They have it in their power to create causes of war that shall be inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognise no settled colonial system . Since the adoption of the Constitution new territories have been at intervals added to the Union , until the middle third of the continent has come under the Government of the United States . Immense portions of territory , sufficient to sustain many millions of population , are added by each distinct effort , and , in comparatively short spaces of time are divided into States , so that , in rather more than half a century , the extent of inhabitable and cultivatable territory has been increased three fold , and the number of separate sovereignties risen from thirteen to thirty . Seventeen new sovereignties have been added to the Union , each one able and efficient to represent and defend itself . But with the increase is augmented also the power of increase . The addition of every new state heightens the probability of the addition of others . Every new State , form&amp;d upon a new territory , acts upon the territory beyond it , and colonizes another state . The addition of Texas prepares the way for the addition of three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . The establishment of a new state on the Pacific , accelerates the formation of four more , two in the Northern , and two in the Southern and middle parts of the continent . The overflow of population from New Mexico , California , and the territories of Texas , rapidly Americanizes the Northern sections of the Mexican Republic . The absorbing and attractive power of our institutions , the same power which draws an annual emigration of half a million from Europe , which empties entire European villages of their inhabitants , acts with an effect still more intense upon the nations that surround us . By this attractive influence , powerful revolutionary parties are generated in every nation , sufficiently civilized and contiguous , to feel directly the influence of our institutions . rihes revolutionary parties desire to have their governments incorporated with , and under the protection of the Union . It is idle to protest against these effects ; the causes are too creditable to ourselves that we should make the effects a subject of lamentation . And yet we have no policy of colonization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonization . We refuse to look at facts . We deny ourselves the benefits of the future ; or , rushing into the other extreme , we grasp madly at consequences , and , by unjust means , accelerate the movement of events . It is reported that an armed expedition , organized by private adventurers , in league with a revolutionary portion in the Spanish Island of Cuba , is , at this moment , landing upon the shores of that island , with a view to assist in displacing the Cuban Despotism . The Government of the United States , it is said , in conformity with those laws , and with those treaties 568 June , // with foreign nations , by which a strict neutrality is made a part of the national system , have ordered a naval armament to watch this expedition , and forbid their landing . This order of the Executive is struck at by certain Democratic Senators , and others , as an anti-republican order . The Executive , we know , can not lift * finger toward the execution of a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : for , it is the maxim of the war-and-conquest faction , that the best government is that which fails oftenest in the execution of the laws in their view , " that is the best government which governs least : " which is as if one should say , that is the best teacher , who teaches least ; that is the best mason , who builds least ; or the best clergyman , who preaches least ; or the best captain , who commands least effectually ; or the best agent , who attends least to the orders of his employers . By this creed , the present Executive is like to prove a very defective agent . The lawmakers , with us , are the people ;  --  the Executive is their agent ;  --  the less he attends to the commands of those who put him in o*ce , the more pleasing will he be to the Democratic , or no government , faction . This movement of adventurers upon the Island of Cuba has thrown out , into strong relief , the two colors of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , the aggressive faction , are watching eagerly the progress of events in the South . This Cuba business is , doubtless , to them , the first movement in a line of conquest , by which Mexico and the West Indies are to be absorbed . The chances are greatly in favor of their success : they have everything to hope , and nothing to lose : they rely upon two causes to promote their final success first , the onward movement of population , aided by that spirit of military adventure , and colonization , which is congenial to our people , and which , at certain moments , takes possession of the entire nadoui. liiiagine a series of events like the following : The present , or some future expedition effects a landing , and sucee*ds in colonizing a portion of the Island of Cuba . The enterprise , managed with prudence , and well supported at home , could hardly fail . Then follows a season of hostilities , and a truce between the colonists and the defenders'of the Island . Between these new colonists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a time , matters come to a crisis ; the Island makes a sudden effort , and throws off her allegiance to Spain . Spain , either of her own motion , or aided and instigated by England , maintains a furious and destructive war upon the Islanders . American volunteers pour in to aid their countrymen , and share the spoils of victory . Reverses follow : Spain is too powerful for her rebellious subjects . Citizens of the United States , taken in arms against the Government , are executed without trial , or thrown into dungeons . Then begins the movement at home . An universal sympathy with these suffering and adventurous spirits , moves the nationaiheart . Hostility to Spain , the oppressor and her allies , becomes a test of patriotism . In the tempest of popular enthusiasm all parties are carried away . Negotiations with Spain are managed in such a manner , under the excitement of the time , as rather to hurry on the catastrophy ; and there is danger of a general war . Such is the first cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely for ultimate success . Of their particular and personal object in creating the war , and carrying out the system to which it appertains , it is unnecessary to speak at present . The second train of causes upon which they rely is of a more subtle , and much less appreciable character . It is a line of support derived from the attitude taken by non-extensionist party , and which places them , and the entire conservative body of . the nation , at the mercy of the war faction . It begins in the fact that the conservative and constitutional peace party refuse to adopt a colonial system ; whereas they , the war party , have a system , and a very effective one it is , and appeals , upon occasion , to the passions of the people with such force as to overwhelm all opposition ; and the unjust and destruc*-tive spirit of war has its own way , with consequences infinitely to be deplored by the friends of freedom and legitimate progress . Ab initio , in the very beginning , the unconditional opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution itself , and predicts the ruin of the 1850j 569 // nation by its growth . He has no faith in the expansive power of a Republic . He has faith in a despotic , but none in a republican or free expansion . He thinks that the best gover*iment is the least capable of extending its dominion . He reverts to the happy thirteen colonies ; - forgetful of the fact , that it is found*'a much easier task to nationalize thirty than thirteen , sovereigh and independent States . Of the thirteen the best that could be made was a rotten federation , and then a feeble and uncertain Union ; but now , out of the thirty , is there one that can erect itself against twenty-nine ? This error is one which a contemplation of the facts ought at once to dissipate . It is the power of the separate sovereignties of which conservatism should be jealous , and over which it should exert a constant care ; it is they that are in danger , and not the general system . Again ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprize. is beginning to overflow the boundaries of some neighbor State , all that we have to offer is a cry against the unmanageable growth of the ernpire ,  --  the unwi 4dly bulk it has attained , and the formidable dangers that must ensue from the increased patronage of the Executive . We throw down the reins and the steed goes whither he will ; another hand snatches them up , and we are plunged into a war . Colonization , meanwhile , goes on rapidly . i*nds of armed colonists and depredators swarm across the fontier , urged and encouraged by those who , if they confide but little in the constitution , trust implicitly to the timely passions of the people . The crisis arrives . It becomes necessary to negotiate for the protection of our citizens , now colonists upon a hostile territory . We are at a loss what to do . The people , impatient of our hesitation and delay , cry out for violent measures . Events move on . The war is begun . It becomes necessary to sustain the honor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , fifty , a hundred millions ,  --  ariny after army is sent into the field . The enemy , who might have been made friends and allies , with vast loss and great glory are subdued . The people grow weary of the war , and begin to calculate the cost . The war party falls into disrepute , and go out of office . i*egociations ensue for the purchase of territories already conquered . It is a point of honor and of honesty to purchase them . The empire of freedom was not founded by robbers . WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE PURCHASED BEFORE THE WAR ? Of all the systems of policy that have been pursued for national aggrandizement , that of the forcible or fraudulent seizure of the territories and property of others , has led those who have adopted it the most rapidly to their own destruction . Public immovality , originating in the vice and ambition of a few demagogues , who have the art to inspire , in the masses , a spilt of violence , reacts unhappily upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social and moral obligations . As a just war elevates and strengthensan unjust , aggressive war , depresses and corrupts , a people . With ourselves , proud as we are of our strength , and confiding in the undoubted superioity of our arms , the temptations to aggression are extraordinary  --  the ablest statesmanship of the age has been exercised in averting the omens of war . lt is not always in the power of a single man to meet or avert the storm . It is wisdoni to anticipate the danger and prevent its access by measures of progress and of conciliation , providing equally for the growth , education and unity of our future empire .
