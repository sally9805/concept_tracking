txt DEMOCRATIC REVIEW . VOL . XXVI . FEBRUARY , 1850 . NO . CXL . GENERAL LOPEZ , THE CUBAN PATRIOT . WITHIN the past year and a-half the name of General Lopez , of Cuba , has been familiar to the press and people of the United States , as the projector and chief of a revolutionary movement contemplated in that island , which was to have broken out in the summer of 1848 , but which was frustrated by discovery on the part of the government . Many arrests were suddenly made , and he himself , after being informed that his principal friends had been arrested , ( to the number of two hundred , as the account was first brought to him , though it proved afterwards to have been greatly exaggerated , ) had time to escape on board a vessel bound for Bristol , R.

Having obtained from the friends of General Lopez some interesting particulars of his life and career , we propose to employ them as materials for a brief biographical sketch , which will serve to make better known to our readers the brilliant career and noble character of a man whose name is probably destined at no distant day to occupy no small space in the history of our times ,  --  so far at least as that history has to deal with the political condition and changes of the American side of the Atlantic . General Narciso Lopez is now a little over fifty years of age , having been born in Venezuela , in the year 1798 or 9 . His father was a wealthy landed proprietor , owning large estates on the liwios or plains , swarming with cattle , horses , &amp;c . His r*other , who is still living , is one of those women of rare elevation of moral dignity combined with mental strength , whose children , imbued with that noblest inheritance of nature , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lopez was their only son that lived beyond childhood , though of daughters his parents had some fourteen or fifteen ; and , according to the habitual life of the ilanos , passed almost from the cradle to the saddle , or rather , we may VOL . XXVI. - NO . CXL. 1 // perhaps say , to the back of a wild horse without any saddle ,  --  a training well calculated to lay the foundation of that character and habit of fearless hardihood , energy and resolution , which has been illustrated by his subsequent military career . Though so successful as a soldier , and though that success was achieved only by the display of extraordinary capacity as well as courage , it is singular that General Lopez has never been fond of the military profession and life . He did not enter it from choice , but simply as a resource of desperation , under circumstances forced upon him , at the age of fifteen , by the civil war then desolating all the Spanish South American provinces . His father had been stripped of nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through the operation of that cause , and with such means as he was ahle to realize had entered into commercial life at Caraccas , assisted by his son , who , boy as he was , was able to bear the burden of a large share of its responsibilities . At the town of Valencia , in the interior , he had the charge of a branch of his father 's main establishment at Caraccas , at the period of the sanguinary , and for the time decisive ; battle of La Puerta , in 1814 , in which Bolivar , at the head of the insurgent troops , was defeated by the Spanish army under General Boves . Bolivar , though routed , sent orders to the garrison of Valencia to maintain the place , which was done with heroism to the last moment , so long as resistance was possible ; the inhabitants , who knew that massacre and plunder would immediately ensue on the entrance of the victorious army , uniting in the defense with the few soldiers of the garrison . The town being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " plaza " or square , into which were hastily collected all the property and effects which it was considered most important to protect . The house of Lopez 's father happened to be situated at one corner of the square , and the boy took an active part in the defense at that point , and before long found himself recognised by those coflected at that point , soldiers and citizens , without suspecting it himself , as their leader defacto . His father , however , who was in Valencia at the time , but a man of different mould from the boy who then made his maiden trial in arms , took no part in it . The resistance was prolonged three weeks , but no relief came from Bolivar , who meanwhile abandoned indeed all that part of the country which he had thus compromised , and made his way along the coast towards Barcelona . The inhabitants of Valencia felt bitterly resentful at this treatment by the Patriot leader , who had sacrificed them for the escape of the routed fragments of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justifiable on the idea of his comiug to their relief ; while it could not fail to provoke even a redoubled degree of the usual ferocity with which , in that terrible civil struggle , the conquering party was in the habit of treating any town falling into their possession . Massacre of the men was the general rule  --  a rule often enough made to include a proportion of women and children . After the surrender of the place , Lopez was separated from his father , being turned off as a child , while his father was herded with the men , supposed , in spite of the capitulation , to be reserved for massacre that night . The boy himself , indeed , escaped that fate very narrowly . With some other companions he had joined a couple of negroes , slaves of his family , among a great number more who had huddled together in one spot for safety , that class not being usually included in the massacres of such occasions ; but during the // night , he fortunately issued forth with his two servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his father , or to hear something of him . In this hope indeed he was mistaken , ( though his father , as he afterwards learned , did succeed in effecting his own escape , ) but the next morning on returning to the place which they had left for that purpose , they found the ghastly spectacle of eighty-seven bodies with their throats cut like sheep . After hiding about for some time , feeling himself constantly liable to the same fate , and reduced to a condition of entire desperation , be determined to seek safety in the only situation in which it was to be found , by enlistment as a soldier in the army ; and selected an opportunity of offering himself to a serg*ant of more encouraging countenance than the others , by whom , not without some entreaty , he was accepted as a recruit ,  --  the sergeant little suspecting that the boy of fifteen , and small in stature at that , whom he at first told to be off and play , was hereafter to become one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed live to see it , for this good-natured sergeant fell shortly afterwards , it having been Lopez 's lot to convey to him , amongst others , the order for the service which was his last. * Such were the circumstances which threw Lopez into the military career , and which threw him into it on the Spanish side of the civil war of that wretched period . He was a mere boy , and it was the only chance for life ; while at the same time there was probably then no inhabitant of Valencia who would have hesitated to shoot Bolivar , the chief of the Patriot side , as the bitterest of enemies , had they had the opportunity . Spain was then moreover underthe republican Constitution of 1812 , so that , in the civil war at that period , the causeofliberty did not appear to be solely on the Patriot side . The battle of La Puerta was deemed then to have completely crushed the rebellion in that region , though in fact the struggle was renewed and protracted , with various success , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1823 . At the end of the war Lopez , who had thus entered in the ranks , found himself a colonel havina attained that rank at the age of twenty-three through the brilliancy and daring of his services . The first occasion that attracted attention to him was shortly after his enlistment , during an attack upon a certain place which was defended by field-works , there being two bastions connected together by a curtain of about fifty yards in length . The Spanish force beincr divided into two portions , engaged in attacking the two bastions , the ammunition of the one portion gave out , and signal being made to the other to that effect , the commander called for volunteers to lead three mules loaded with ammunition from the one end to the other , a service requiring a passage along the line of fire of the enemy stationed behind the curtain connecting the two . Lopez was the only one who volunteered , and he set out with the three mules in a * This was on the occasion of the first battle of Maturin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made good his retreat only by sacrificing a column which he ordered to defeod a certain position , a service which was certain death , in a war in which prisoners expected no quarter and were not disappointed . Exactly three months afterwards , a second battle was fought near the same spot , in which Morales was victorious , and they found the bodies of the column in question , that is to say , their bleached skeletons , to the number of six hundred , laid out on the ground in regular array , by the Patriots , in rank and file , as though by a mockery of discipline in death . // string , according to the custom of the country , the head of each fastene4 by a cord to the tail of the one before it . At about half the distance across , one of the mules fell dead . The mule killed being unluckily the middle one , it was necessary to untie the cord , and re-fasten the first and third together , all under a severe fire , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in reaching hiss destination unwounded , though his gun was broken by one ball , hi* pantaloons cut by another , and his cap pierced by a third , with the other mules wounded , but not to death ; and the place was taken . The next day inquiry was made , in a general order , for the volunteer who had offered for this decisive service , with a view to his receiving an officer 's commission . The commission , however , he declined , considering himself not entitled to be thus raised over the heads of many men both grown and better qualified , for an act which had proceeded more from the despair and recklessness of hi* situation than from any other spirit ; and , in truth , . still hoping for escape from that situation , and from the service , to which he was still strongly averse ; and the only reward he accepted was that of exemption from the drudgeries of a soldier 's work , and of being mounted instead of marching on foot , to which he had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the genius of the soldier , and the spirit and emulation of military honor , prevailed over his own aversion to the career ; . and , at nineteen , he found himself commander of a squadron of horse , &amp; select force , designed for critical occasions to decide pending contests , a corps into which none but picked men were admitted , and with which it was a point of honor never to turn the back ; and at the age of twentythree , a highly esteemed colonel of * regiment of cavalry . Besides other distinctions , he received during this war the rare military honor of the cross of San Fernando of the secon ( l ( the mostdistinguished ) degree ; a reward not bestowed at pleasure , but which is to be obtained only on a public demand by the person claiming it , and on the institution of a formal process for and against his right , every body being free to interpose an objection , or to depreciate the merit of the ' act for which it is demanded . In the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross . Lopez , not attaching much importance to the act for which he was urged to apply for it , and moreover caring little for the honor itself was only induced to demand it by the Commander-in-Chief , Gen. Morillo , who taunted him with being afraid of a rejection of the demand , and who directed his Secretary to draw up the application , almost forcing the reluctant young officer to sign it . In the negotiations for the withdrawal of the Spanish army , he contributed much to cause the Spanish General ( who could have protracted the contest much longer , though with no hope of eventual success ) * to relieve the country from the further pressure of the evils of war , by his influence exerted in every manner consistent with military honor ; and it is no small proof of what must have been the appreciation of all his character , conduct and motives , entertained even by those against whom he had thus served , having been thrown by the circumstances above explained on the Spanish side in the civil contest thus terminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Patriot government to enter its service , in the same rank held by him in the Spanish arm-y* He declined the offer , not considering that that honor // which had kept him in the service permitted him to accept it ; and he retired with the evacuating army to Cuba , in the year 1823 . Since that date he has been a Cuban , having married and established ' himself in the Island . The re-establishment of absolutism in Spain , by the aid of the French intervention overthrowing for the second time the Constitution of 1812 , wholly prevented his resumption of service , though retaining his nominal rank . The system then adopted was to require a " purification " from all the officers of the army , especially those suspected of too much liberalism , a process consisting in the abjuration of such sentiments and in an oath of devotion and support to the new order of things . Always not only liberal but democratic , in heart as well as in principles , he would never consent to compromise with his conscience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the death of the old King , Ferdinand VII. , the long smothered liberal party broke forth from under the despotic incubus which had pressed it down , and assumed the ascendant in the government of the country . Maria Cristina , the brilliant , bold but unprincipled widow of the old King , after having caused the latter by his will to devise the crown to her infant daughter Isabel , in disregard of the Salic law which had heretofore regulated the su*cession to the throne of Spain , and therefore to the exclusion of the rights of Don Carlos , the King 's brother and next male heir , threw herself on the Liberal party for support , and even resuscitated from its grave the Constitution of 1812 . I'he absolutist or royalist party soon prepared to rise for the maintenance of the right of Don Carlos , whose character and views made him moreover their natural head . Cristina , in anticipation of the severe civil struggle which all knew to be about to ensue , adopted the vigorous measure of disarming at a blow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was practicable ' ; a service which the people were summoned , and came forward eagerly enough , to perform , with the aid of the troops that could be counted upon by the Government . This movement , beginning at Madrid , was at each important point the work of a day , and by its suddenness so successful , that throughout the kingdom six hundied thousand stands of arms were wrested from hands in which they would otherwise have soon been employed for the re-establishment of Don Carlos , the priests , and absolutism . It was in the midst of the tumult of this memorable day at Madrid , that Colonel Lopez , ( who happened to be at the capital with his wife , to reclaim a large sum of money arbitrarily seized from the family of the latter by the Government in Cuba , ) reappeared on the scene , signally distinguishing himself by the activity and boldness which he exhibited , in heading bodies of the people in this operation of disarming the royalists . Always a thorough republican in heart and conviction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revival of the old Constitution and the constitutionalist party , and his joy took the natural form of zealous daring in the performance of this practical service to the cause of his principles ; a service which was not all one-sided , a considerable part of the National Guard and some of the troops being royalist , and several attempts being made by the latter party to rally and make a stand against the tide of popular enthusiasm that rose and raged around them , and finally overbore all resistance . More than once in the course of the day Lopez was seen driving before // him singly with his sword , considerable bodies of the royalists , armed with their guns , to the principal guard-house , to deliver up their arms , treating them with little ceremony , and making them acquainted with the flat of his sword , and indeed cowing them into obedience to his command as though he had been their own officer . The consequence of this day was , that he was speedily despatched to join the army , as first Aide-de-Camp to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active part in the war , being usually selected for the most daring military work , he found himself at its close a General , and covered with military decorations , among which were the highly distinguished ones of the grand-crosses of St. Her .. mengildo and Isabel la Catolica. * Between himself and Valdez ( who was afterwards Captain-General of Cuba ) a devoted friendship arose , which has never sustained any diminution . The only pure and upright Captain-General sent to Cuba within the memory of man , and therefore necessarily too good to be long left by the Government in that post , Valdez* has always been regarded by Lopez as the most virtuous man breathing . In his political sentiments , General Lopez never wavered from his fidelity to the democratic party , known in Spain as the liberal exaltad* party . As a known and reliable member of that party , he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard of the kingdom , a post created for him at a critical period . He at different periods filled the posts of Commander-in-Chief of various provinces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early learned to despise and distrust her , and her false , selfish and intriguing politics . On the occasion of the popular nsurrection at Madrid which , resulted in the expulsion of Cristina from the Regency , Gen. Lopez was earnestly solicited by the people to assume the command of the capital , as Governor of Madrid , which , when he found it incumbent on him as a duty of humanity , at a difficult and critical moment , he consented to do . The city being threatened by the army , he made the most energetic preparations for its defense ; but happily the withdrawal of the obnoxious Queen Mother to Paris averted the necessity of the struggle , for which he had braced the nerves of the people by the firmness of his resolution and the vigor of his measures . Espartero , on whom the government then devolved , and who was soon after appointed Regent by the Cortes , was anxious to induce Lopez to retain the post of Governor of Madrid ; but the latter would not remain , beyond the period of emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselve8 , in a situation in which it might become his duty to act against the people for the repression of tumults , and three times pressed upon the Regent his resignation ; which was only accepted when he positively refused to take a negative answer , and had relieved Espartero from the difficulty of filling his place , by himself recommending a competent successor . Anterior to this period he had been appointed a Senator of the King .. * Even Carlist historians speak with high praise of their own most formidable ene my , Lopez ; relating , among other acts , the manner in which he saved the army and the honor of General Carondelet , who , almost beaten , by a surprise , allowed Lopez , though only a colonel , to rally the flying Iroops , assume the entire command , virtually supersede the general , and to a great extent retrieve the disaster of the day . // dom , by the Liberal city of ' Seville . Authorized by the constitution to nominate three persons for the Senate , from whom the crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make good its desire to be represented by Lopez , by naming as his colleagues , in the nomination , two candidates whom it was impossible for the court to adopt , the one being the Infante Don Francisco de Paula , the uncle of the young Queen and brother of Don Carlos , and the other being a distinguished Carlist Bishop . His office of Senator afforded General Lopez an opportunity of studying the politics of Spain , the spirit and action of its government , especially in reference to its American Colonies , ( Cuba , his *iountry by adoption and marriage , being the principal one , ) which , amidst the clash and splendor of arms , he had never before possessed ; and he willingly , for a while , forgot the latter , glorious as they had been to him , to avail himself of the advantageous facilities of his position for the former . Disgust and indignation were the first fruits ' resolution to be the Liberator of Cuba , the next . The repulse of the Cubaa deputies from their seats in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which gave to those deputies the same rights with those whose votes repulsed them-had already awakened a deep feeling of resentment in his breast , as in that of all his Cuban compatriols . Though a soldier from childhood , he had never had other than an American heart , and he soon learned to regard with self-reproach his own glory acquired in the Spanish service , and to despise the glitter of his own uniform as a mere livery , no more honorable in his eyes than that which bedizened a rich man 's negro calesero in his own country . Such thought in the breast of a man so honest in conviction , so resolute in will , and so fearless in execution , was no barren sentiment ; and he deliberately deter . ' mined to devote the rest of his life to the liberation of his country and the recovery of ' his own dignity ,  --  measuring the latter by a far higher standard than the vulgar one of rank , military distinction , power or court favor . Resigning his seat as a Senator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Havana ; a permission which he did not obtain without extreme difficulty , nor till after long resistance on the part of the Regent , it being contrary to the jealous policy of Spain , in the government of her rich colony , the Queen of the Antilles , to allow any American born officer of rank or importance to go there . An intimate friendship with Espartero , the noble head of the Liberal or Progressist party in Spain , alone made practicable the importunity with which General Lopez insisted on his demand , which he even enforced by making it the alternative to a resignation of his commission ; - and it can not be denied that his own determined purpose in going , and the consequences which have resulted from it , prove clearly enough the policy of that rule , on the part of the Spanish Government , to which be thus succeeded in causing himself to be made the fatal exception. * General Valdez was at this time the Captain-General of Cuba , to Lopez 's secret wishes and views , early adopted , had made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to Cuba , that , several years before , by a proceeding emanating from Havana , and from Tacon , then Captain-General , he had been subjected to a formal trial on the charge of conspiring for the independence of that colony , and of having , at a dinner , proposed as a toast a sentiment to that effect . He succeeded , however , in baffling his enemies , and was acquitted . // which post he had been shortly before appointed , to a great extent through the influence of Lopez , who had urged it strongly as a means of affording to himself an opportunity of returning to Cuba with Yaldez . The latter , as his most intimate and devoted friend , solicited permission that Lopez should accompany him , but without success ; and it was not till several months afterwards that lie finally effected his object , as before remarked , partly through his threat of resigning his commission and partly from the Regent 's personal attachment . It was , we believe , in 1839 , that he returned to Cuba . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friendship and gratitude combined , to require him to postpone any steps towards the accomplishment of the great purpose which never slept within his breast . The downfall of Espartero , and the restoration of Maria Cristina to power , supported by Narvaez and the army , by causing the recall of the virtuous Valdez , ( who was succeeded by O'Donnell , the predecessor of the present , Roncali , ) released him from the personal obligations by which at first he hadfelt himself fettered ; and his friends in Havana were surprised at the evident content and cheerfulness with which he received a change of parties necessarily depriving him of the posts which he held in the military government of the island . Under Valdez , he was Governor of Trinidad and Commander-in-Chief of the Central Department , as well as President of the Military Commission . He gladly laid down these posts on the arrival of the period of opportunity and freedom for which he had impatiently waited ; and creating a pretext for returning to the Central Department in retirement , ( retaining of course his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) by undertaking the working of an abandoned copper mine , he devoted himself mainly to his object of organizing prepara-. tions for his intended rising of the people against their oppressors ; - arr object which , it is scarcely needed to say , required extreme caution and tact as well as boldness , though he well knew that the general sentiment of the people was already strongly predisposed to a movement for independence . With this view he exerted himself in many ways to establish a personal popularity and personal relations , as extensively as possible with the country people of all the surrounding region , the guajiros ; every one of whom is more accustomed to the saddle than to any other seat , so that they may be called a population of cavalry , whom a very little training under the inspiration of such a leader would make a mounted force inferior to none in the world . He employed every mode in his power to make himself personally familiar with them , to win their confidence and to attach them by services and favors ; - an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he spent with an unreserved hand . Among other modes ofploughing the ground for the harvest in his view , he made himself a volunteer dispenser of medicines and medical advice to the country people for many a league around , reposing his conscience on some French manuals of practice , and on some smattering of knowledge in that line , which was probably alone enough to place him " at the head of the profession " among the country practitioners of Cuba . In this way he established the most friendly relations with hun-. dreds of families of the guajiros of the Centro . Another mode adopted by him of bringing the country people toge // ther and of mingling with them , was by making matches for cockfighting at various points . This favorite popular amusement had been forbidden by the Government , for the purpose of preventing such gatherings of the country people ; but having contrived to extort a license from O'Donnell for the occasion of the royalftestas or holidays , though the latter had refused many other applications , he not only got up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which brought together half the country , but he managed to keep it up for the year round at many different places , without being interftied with by the local authorities ,  --  using the shade of some broad tree for the place for meeting . Mingling thus familiarly among the guajiros , in their own costume , and as one of themselves , he thus prepared them to be in readiness for the approaching day . Aided by the respect due to his rank , the brilliancy of his military reputation as the well-known bravest and boldest officer of Cuba , his generosity and character for humanity and good nature , he thus established an influence such , that be has always been confident that that whole region would rise at his voice , whenever he should summon the people to rally round the flag of liberty and independence . Having determined early in 1848 , that the proper time had arrived , he was only induced by some friends to postpone his intended rising for a short time , in order to await the results of some communications which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who knew the state of public feeling in the Island . This delay led , through an accidental cause , to the discovery of his plan by the Government , and to the sadden arrest of his friends , and the consequent necessity , as explained at the beginning of this sketch , of his own precipitate embarkation for this country , from whose friendly shores he hoped soon to be able to return . 1-us plan for Cuba has always been Independence and Annexation to the American Union . After his escape , he was condemned to death. * Against the persons who had been arrested , ( some of them perhaps with reason and some without , ) no evidence existed , and the greater part were released ,  - -  some being sent out of the country . The rest of General Lopez 's life has to be written by a future biographer . To the slight outline we have here given , we will only add a few anecdotes illustrative of that enterprising fearlessness to which , united with a quick and keen perception , fertility of resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be ascribed the rapid and brilliant honors of his military career ; respecting which , the most extraordinary circumstance is , that while it was commenced perforce , and as the only chance for his life , his heart has never been in it , and he has never desired better than an opportunity of withdrawing altogether from the military profession itself . On one occasion in South America , landing with an expedition , somewhat &amp; la Cortez , in a wild and unexplored region , occupied by a highly warlike tribe of wild Indians ( Indios bravos ) who never had , nor ever * Among his papers , seized by the government , was a letter to the queen , resigning his commission , which was to have been sent to the Captain-General a day or two before his rising . This has been described* by a friend who had seen it , as a very noble and beautiful production , finely reconciling the duty of military honor with that of patriotism . // have been tamed , and with whom they had a severe engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for want of water . Striking into the interior in quest of water , after marching in a tropical climate for a whole day without finding stream or spring , they were at last approached , at about sunset , by an Indian warrior mounted on a magnificent horse , cream-colored , with black mane and feet . Lopez was in advance with a small column when the commander summoned him to consultation . The vessels from which they had landed the afternoon before had sailed , so that they had no return . A number had already died of exhaustion and thirst . They contrived to make the Indian understand their want , and he in turn conveyed to them that he could conduct them to water which they could reach by day-break . But here arose the perplexity , how far he was to be trusted . His purpose might be to decoy them away from the relief which they might otherwise perhaps find in the direction they were pursuing , and to lead them off astray to a certain and horrible fate . In the midst of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to occur to another , by proposing to mount himself behind the Indian , on the powerful and fresh horse of the latter , and to go at the utmost speed in quest of the water , to verify what was understood from the signs of the Indian ; telling the commander that if he returned all would of course be well , while if he did not return it would prove that he was killed , that the Indian was playing false , and that therefore they should in that case infer , that , by pushing on in the direction they were going , they would probably find relief . The offer was accepted , and his companions remained on the spot to await the result , all the bands of discipline being meanwhile wholly relaxed . As it resulted , the Indian conducted him truly , though of course Lopez had to plunge into the depths of the forest and of the night , mounted behind a guide who might lead him only into the midst of enemies . He reached the water , returned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole expedition . It proved that the Indian was of a tribe hostile to those against whose territory the expedition was proceeding . Some of his wives had been carried off on a foray , and he was in pursuit of them when he came upon the strangers whom he supposed of course the enemies of his enemies , and therefore his friends . The Indian Orpheus was rewarded not only by the recovery of his two or three lost Eurydices , but by liberal presents , and he afterwards proved a serviceable guide . The occasion on which he received the cross of San Fernando , above alluded to , was as follows . Morillo , at the head of a force of seven or eight thousand men , was pursuing the Patriot army of Paez , numbering about 3,000 , over the lianos or plains of Venezuela , trying in vain to bring the latter to an engagement . This the latter had of course no difficulty in avoiding , his whole force consisting of first-rate cavalry , while the Spanish army was mainly infantry . Lopez was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of a picked squadron , reserved for decisive moments , with'which it was a point of honor never to turn their backs . He had lost half of it in a severe engagement that morning , and with the rest , thirty-eight in number , was marching on the extreme flank of the army , when he received an order from the general to gallop forward and harass the rear of Paez 's retreating army . Morillo had not recognised , at the distance , the fragment which remained of Lopez 's squadron ; which he would never otherwise have sent on such a service , especially after the morning 's work . Rash as the order was , it was of // course obeyed . On the perfectly level prairie which was the scene of the operation , what ensued was in view of both armies . Paez , provoked at the insolence of this little squadron , halted , and put himself in person at the head of a splendid corps of about 300 men , his guard , the well-known flower of his army , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this corps was seen to detach itself from the main body and rapidly approach the little band , whose destruction seemed inevitable before the swoop of that force . Lopez asked his men if they would stand or turn . The reply was that they would do as he should . His answer was to fling himself from his horse , and command them to do the same , thus burning his sh*ps ; and then to form his men in line , to stand their ground as long as they could with the lances and carbines which were their arms . He thus repulsed the charge of Paez and his guard , refusing to surrender , and maintaining ' himself till Morillo could hasten up his cavalry to their support , and till the able Paez , with whom his retreat was of much more importance than the annihilation of this handful of gallant fellows , whom none admired more than himself , withdrew his guard , and left Lopez , with what remained of his dismounted squadron , to receive the cordial embraces of his General , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene . On another occasion , in the Carlist War in Navarre , he saved the Commander-in-Chief , General Valdez , to whom he was at the time Aidede-Camp , and a division of his army , under the following circumstances . Valdez had allowed himself to be surprised with only a small part of his army , in a village named Durango , where he had established his head-quarters ; the rest of the army being scattered in various directions on different services . Suddenly , through one of those rapid movements of concentration which marked the system of warfare of Zumalacarregui , the celebrated Carlist Commander*in*Chief , * he found * Zumalacarregui was a truly great man , and Queen Isabella II . probably owes the throne to which she does so little credit to the chance ball that killed this famous chief on the balcony of a house in Bilboa .

" One thing which Lopez effected , greatly annoyed and puzzled the Carlist commander , no other of the Cristino Generals being able to do the same though several of the latter were natives of the region in question ,  --  this was to organize and keep on foot a Navarrese corps. ( the population of Navarre being all devoted Carlists . ) Lopez managed to keep up a body of 370 of these , whom he treated with great favor and confidence , making them even his body-guard . They were well known as " los Colorados de Lopez , " Lopez 's Reds , " fiom the color of their uniform . Among Gen. Lopez 's papers , is an interesting letter from the great Carlist commander . On the taking of a certain town , Lopez protected the life of a wounded Carlist soldier , a Navarrese , who was found in it , and whom the Cristinos were about to dispatch , according to the polite custom of the country and time . Lopez sent him to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended and cured . Some months after , the man being now quite restored to health , and leading a very comfortable life under the protection he had received , ( practising his trade as a shoemaker , ) he was brought to the attention of Lopez who had forgotten all about him , and the latter sent for him , hoping to find in him a recruit for his Colorados . He began by asking him what excuse he ( L. ) could have , now that the other was cured , for not letting him he shot , since it was only his being wounded before , which had enabled him to save him . This was rather an embarrassing question . General Lopez then went on to ask , if be were free now , where of all places would he prefer to go , and what to do ? The man answered , frankly and boldly , that he would prefer to go and join his old company among the Carlists ; a reply which so pleased Lopez that he at once despatched him with a courteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly superior forces . Durango was situated in a valley , encompassed with hills of ' moderate elevation , of which the enemy suddenly took possession . Escape seemed impossible ; a bird alone , as it seemed , could carry the intelligence to the nearest Cristino division , stationed at Ermoa , ten or twelve miles distant , so as to summon it to the rescue . Colonel Lopez , however , volunteered to do it , claiming it as his duty and right as first Aidede-Camp , and pledged himself to bring up the division at Ermoa . The Commander-in-Chief ' , though regarding the attempt as desperate , yet yielding to his demand , told him he might then take what force he required for the purpose . " I could not do it with the half of the division , " was the answer , " but let me have your piebald horse , which you bought on my advice . " It was brought , and Lopez mounted it , taking with him only his orderly , ( a fellow on whom he could rely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter being mounted on Lopez 's own favorite charger . Directing him to keep close to him , and to regulate his pace by his own , and , since it was not likely that both would escape , instructing him as to the order to be carried to Ermoa , he set out at full speed from Durango , along a road which passed between two emiiences , both occupied by the enemy . Slackening then his speed , as he got well clear of ' the former place , and approached the enemy , but riding with entire confidence , he and his companion presented the appearance of deserters ; and two squadrons which had at first detached themselves from the enemy on both sides to intercept them , slackened the pace at which they moved down upon the road for that purpose . He then , with a nice calculation of the distance at which he might venture it , suddenly clapped spurs to his horse , and rushed through the shower of balls which immediately poured down from both sides and in pursuit , cleared the gauntlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done . In the words of Valdez 's certification , " to the astonishment of the enemy , and of the army , both of whom were watching the operation , he traversed the line , " and the army was saved . In all the acts of heroic daring on the part of Lopez which are familiarly current among the Spanish soldiers , and which , together with his humanity , kindness , and freedom from the arrogant pride habitual to the Spanish officers , have made him so popular with them , it is to be remarked , that the boldness is never recklessness , but is always elicited by a worthy occasion , and combined with that quick and acute calculation of the possibility which is the essence of military genius . We are unwilling to omit an incident in the military life of General Lopez , in which our readers will not fail to recognise the " high Roman fashion . " Together with a large number of others , he was at one time a prisoner in the hands of the Carlists , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountains of Arragon , which was supposed a safe place of custody . There were about seven hundred prisoners collected there . Lopez was the highest in rank among the prisoners , alacarregni , relating exactly what had passed , and adding that he sent him hack the man , free to join his old company , as a mark of respect for the man and for him ( Zurnalacarregni . ) Znmalacarregni replied quite magnificently , in a very courteous letter , that he would not be outdone in generosity by General Lopez , and accordingly , in return for his present , sent him back seven Cristino prisoners , free to join their comopanies . Perhaps the incident helped to throw a little Ii ht , in the mind of the Carlist chief , upon the mystery how General Lopez was able to keep up a corps of Navarrese , and even to trust himself so unreservedly to them as his body.guard . // and was confined in a small room apart from the rest , with four other superior officers . The governor of the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity of outraging his prisoners . He was greatly enraged when a Cristino army , under General San Miguel , now one of the most respectable officers in Spain , began to approach the place to besiege it , overcoming , by extreme exertions , the difficulties which had been supposed to make it inaccessible . The governor thereupon declared that the first gun fired against the place should be the signal for the death of all the prisoners in it , from General Lopez down , ( an act perfectly in accordance with the system of war of Cabrera , who commanded for Don Carlos in that quarter ; ) and offered Lopez permission to write to San Miguel to that effect ,  --  in the belief , of course , that he would dissuade him froii the enterprise . Lopez accordingly wrote , indeed , simply mentioning the fact which he had been requested by the governor to communicate , but adding , that General San Miguel would of course carry out his own plans , without regard to this circumstance , which was , moreover , a proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to maintain the place against the apprehended siege . San Miguel at l*ngth made his appearance before Cantavieja , and began to throw up his siege works . rlie governor then went to the room in which Lopez was confined , and told him that he deeply deplored the necessity under which he was now placed , of ordering the execution of the prisoners , but offered them another chance , by saying that General Lopez might go out to San Miguel 's camp , to explain in person the state of things , so as to induce the latter to withdraw ; giving his word of honor that he would return immediately . Lopez accepted the offer , and presenting himself to San Miguel and his officers , who welcomed him as a favorite friend , sat down to a cheerful breakfast , at which he explained the errand on which he had been sent . He executed it , however , in his own way , by advising San Miguel of the best mode of attacking the town by storm , giving him the benefit of the observations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it was agreed that the attack should be made the next day . The prisoners had contrived to obtain the promise of some forty muskets from some of the Navarrese soldiers in the place , with which they would make at least some resistance to the amiable purpose of the governor ; a resistance which might thus afford a useful diversion during the attack . This being all discussed , together with the breakfast , Lopez rose to depart , which he was not suffered to do till he had overpowered the chorus of opposition he encountered , by the declaration of his inflexible resolution . The governor confessed himself very much astonished to see him back . The town was vigorously attacked the next day , and taken by assault ; the l ) risolIers escaping the impending fate , ( which , by4he-way , a certain cura , or priest , who was one of the principal Carlist officers in the garrison , was the most eager to inflict , ) by the rapidity of the operation , and the terror with which the garrison were impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of reprisals , that was all , " was General Lopez 's modest commentary , on a recent occasion , when the inquiries of some friends ( who happened to observe on hi* table a letter directed to General San Miguel at Madrid ) elicited the particulars of this story , in which we see at least a ray of the classic glory of Regulus , though he himself was the only one who saw nothing in it remarkable . We will mention but one other incident in the career of this extraordinary and noble man , for the purpose of exhibiting his practical aptitude // for the dIrection of popular masses , as well as for military command . Before the expulsion of Maria Cristina from the Regency , when the Liberal Exaltado party had become indignant at the course and indicaLions of the Government , ( it being believed that negotiations were on foot for a coalition between her and Don Carlos , through the means of a marriage of the young queen with his son , ) and when the people were especially exasperated at the feebleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moderado government , Lopez happened to be passing through Valencia , accompanied by a single friend , on his way to the army in Catalonia , to which he had been ordered . It was at a period when the Carlist General , Cabrera , was raging through that region . Lopez was a total stranger in Valencia , where he had no other personal acquaintance than the Captain-General , Mendez Vigo . Spending the evening at the theatre , he heard in his place vague reports of some commotion among the people , of which the Captain-General , to whom he spoke about it , made light . After a short time , however , the latter rose and left his box . Ten minutes had not elapsed before an aide-de-camp came in , pale and excited , and whispering , as he passed , to Lopez , that the Captain-General had been killed by the populace , hastened to escort the wife of the latter , ignorant of her husband 's fate , to the government palace . General Lopez , in pursuance of his military duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whither the authorities of the city had already hastened , and placed himself at their disposal . The general cause of the outbreak was the popular discontent with the Government and its agents in Valencia ; its immediate cause , the recent butchery of sixty Valencian patriots by Cabrera in a horrible manner , and the refusal of the authorities in command to make reprisals on the Carlist prisoners in the gaol in the citadel , or to act with energy in the prosecution of the war . The national guard constituted the bulk of the insurgents , whose numbers by the next morning were said to have swelled to thirty or forty thousand infuriated men , who threatened to attack the citadel , demanding , as the first concession to their vengeance , the heads of two or three of the principal and most obnoxious authorities , and the lives of the Carlist prisoners , and then active measures against Cabrera . On learning that General Lopez was in the citadel , whom they well knew by reputation though he had never before been in the place , the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in his hands and under his command . The trembling authorities entreated him to cotuply with this demand , and to assume the supreme authority of the revolted city , to which he at length consented , as a duty of necessity as well as humanity . Sallying forth alone , in consequence , he soon found himself in the midst of a crowd , raging and shouting around him in deafening and utterly unmanageable confusion , insisting first on the heads of the victims . A den full of hungry and howling lions affords a feeble idea of a Valencian mob on such an occasi-m , and *n that occasion . A sign of faltering would have been fatal . Lopez could only at last by dint of oaths , violence , and even blows , clear a sufficient space around him for intelligible conference with the leaders ; and he then insisted that he would assume the command and government of the city only on condition of implicit obedience to all his directions , the first of which was , that every man should immediately retire to his*home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his governing them , he would return to the citadel , or they might kill him on the spot , as they had done the // Captain-General . He prevailed , and order was restored ,  --  though he has often remarked that , active as has been his military service , this was the most intense crisis , and the most ar*xious moment , of his life . The obnoxious individuals of the government he contrived to get out of the way ; and in regard to the prisoners , he procured from the authorities the names of all the malefactors under sentence of death , of whom there happened to be a large number , fourteen , already doomed to a fate which was only anticipated a little by executing them as Carlist prisoners , so as to appease the first thirst of the mob for their vengeance ; and he then turned their attention into the channels of vigorous preparation for the reception of Cabrera , who was near and threatening the city . In the anomalous situation into which necessity had thus thrown him , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he had only accepted the helm in a hurricane amidst the rocks , to steer the ship to safety and calm again , he was denounced at Madrid , where his democratic principles had already made him an object of jealousy and fear ; and the general commanding a neighbouring division of the army approaclied the city , summoning him to submission . He replied by explaining privately the truth of his position , adding , at the same time , that if the other approached nearer he would defend the city with the people , disclaiming responsibility for the consequences . He thus restored tranq'iillity , and satisfied the people ; and to complete the system of his measures urged the general , ( who had recognised the propriety of Lopez 's course , and had then been admitted into Valencia , ) to proceed at once to attack Cabrera . The latter refused , pleading want of sufficient force . " How much more would suffice to put you in sufficient force ? " " Two thousand men , " was the answer . " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they to come from r ' " I will furnish them from the people of Valencia . " " Nonsense , national guards , volunteers , good for nothing . " " I will command them myself , and be responsible that they shall be the most effective force of your army . " The proposition was at length accepted , and the battalion was organized , to the number of 3,000 , in one evening and night , ready to march the next morning . The greatest e othusiasro prevailed , and it was a contest who should be admitted into the battalion . Cabrera was pursued , brought to action , and completely routed ,  --  the Valencians having , in effect , done the best part of the work . After this , there was no further trouble with them ; anzl Lopez resigned his singular dictatorship , which he had held , independent of the authority of the Government , on a tenure of quasi-revolution , for about a month , and went on his way to his original destination . The Commander-in-Chief , in sending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , a great number of decorations and promotions , through all the grades of the victorious army , beginning with a recommendation of the Grand Cross of " isabel Ia Catolica " for General Lopez . From the disposition of the Court at that time towards him , that recommendation was the single one not accepted ; which elicited from the Commander-in-Chief the reply to the Ministry of War , that if it had on the contrary rejected all the rest , and accepted that one alone , it would have been more just ; for that neither would the battle have been fought without General Lopez , nor without him would it have been won . A nobler laurel still , than that of any of his military honors , is due to General Lopez , for the well known character which attached to him in Cuba , as one to whom a tale of wrong or oppression was never told without // the cewtainty of finding him willing to hear , quick to sympathize , and never backward in exertions to redress . While Valdez was CaptainGeneral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complaints of all kinds , which ascended from the unfortunate and the poor , to the supreme power . On one occasion , with O'Donnell , Valdez 's successor , when , by persistance , he had induced the Captain-General to revoke an oppressive decision which he had just made , in the case of a poor old widow applying for a pension , Lopez told him that he ( O'Donnell ) must bear with him , for that , under his predecessor , he had many a time twenty-five cases in a day , in which he had to urge the petitions of the poor , who made him their advocate , and he produced an appalling list of memoranda of cases which he had then been solicited to present . Not unfrequently has he been known to make journeys from the interior ( the Central Depar4-merit ) to Havana , for the sole purpose of claiming justice for a poor guajiro , improperly imprisoned or otherwise wronged . And in the army the common soldier always knew General Lopez as a sure friend , to whom he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth is , that , combining readily with a very kindly disposition , his democratic principles have naturally generated an habitual sympathy with the poor and the oppressed , which an earnest and resolute energy of character has ever tended to make practical and active . On one occasion , when reproved by the Captain-General , Valdez , for descending from the dignity of his rank , in appearing as the defender of a subordinate officer , before a court-martial composed of members of corresponding grade , his reply was , " that any court representing the law and the dignity of justice , was far above his or any other military rank ; and moreover , that if his general 's fcija ( sash ) was to forbid his defending the cause of the humblest soldier whom he believed to be wronged , he would throw it off , and prefer to return to the rank of lieutenant : " a reply which Valdez afterwards acknowledged to have been right , and to have raised still higher the attachinent and respect in which he had always held General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of some Cuban patriots in civil life , some of whose names are before the world , others , not less worthy , being necessarily reserved , ) has undertaken the noble mission of emancipating Cuba from the yoke and the abomination of Spanish tyranny , with a view to her entrance into our Union . North and south , east and west , we apprehend there are few who will not wish the movement God-speed . That th' people of Cuba are themselves anxious for it , is a truth familiar to us through many accumulated evidences . If any one could doubt it , the one simple fact , that only one lady attended the Queen 's Birth-night ball , in the city of Matanzas , last October , *and that lady the wife of an official , ) would suffice to prove the unanimity of the public sentiment , especially when we regard the time and circumstances under which the brave beauties of Matanzas dared to make so open a demonstration . General Lopez 's prestige with the army , together with its discontent , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the country people , especially of the Central Department of the Island , will probably make the movement a rapid and easy one , whenever he may think it the proper time to make a voyage to Cuba ; - if indeed he still contemplates such a voyage , at some future day , when , under an administration less sympathetic with every anti-popular cause , he may not find the Navy of the United States applied to the inglorious service of the blockade of our own shores .
