txt THE ART OF EATING . FROM THE EARLIEST AGES DOWN TO TEE PRESENT TIME . IT is not to be doubted that the practice of eating was introduced at a very early period of man 's existence . Adam was directed to eat , and a liberal allowance was assigned to him , that is , of the vegetable kingdom , for it is not said that on the fowls of the air , the fishes of the sea , or the cattle of the field , he was permitted to feed . It might be that the teeth were not yet prepared to masticate grosser food than fruit , which requires only the incisors , or front teeth ; but as soon as man found the use of the eye , or canine teeth , he began on solid food , which being transferred to the molars , the system of grinding took place , and meat was in a state fit for nutrition . It is not said how soon the eye teeth appeared ; those of late generations come very early , particularly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late in life . Alas ! too late for posterity . However , this is no business of ours ; all that can be said is , that man immediately became carnivorous , and so remains to this day . Still this carnivorous power was materially checked in its tendencies by want of knowledge of the art of cooking . As yet restaurants were not , oysters could be eaten raw , as they are now ; but science which hnd not dawned could not be applied even to the simplest process of roasting a sirloin or frying smelts . No individual was able to prepare A-lamode beef , or serve up a goose stuffed with sage and onions . Oivilization was gre*itly advanced before new appliances were discovered , before mock turtle soup or mince pies could be presented . The first mention of meat as diet is when Isaac , near his end , directs his son Esan to kill some venison ; and , although he was grossly deceived , by kid being substituted in its place , it seems to have strengthened the old patriarch , simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of currant jelly for the one , or mint sauce for the other . The next direct notice of the use of animal food was immediately previous to the departure of the Hebrews from Egypt . En- // Dee . slaved , as they had long been , by the Egyptians , their food was probably light ; and as they had reason to believe the journey before them would be long and painful , they wisely endeavored to obtain physical strength by a large supply of food more nourishing than that on which they had been forced to live . Accordingly they supped on roast lamb and spinach . The lamb was fairly roasted with fire , " not raw nor sodden at all with water : " and what is more , one entire roast was made of the entire animal . This , it is true , was an incipient step in the culinary art , though not in accordance with our rules , deduced , as they are , from a combination of theoretical science and practical experience . Of this repast , thus prepared , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as they were further required " to let nothing of it remain until the morning . " It was hardly necessary to lay upon them the first injunction , for they were hungry , and had long lived upon less nouiishing diet ; neither is it matter of surprise that they should be unwilling their task-masters should know how well their own private larder was stored , nor the manner their meat was cooked . That they were unaccustomed to such delicate food , and in fact , little used to animal diet , may he inferred from the circumstance that when , somewhat later , while on their wearisome journey , they murmured at being obliged to eat of one vegetable substance morning , noon , and night , for breakfast , dinner , and supper , they sighed over the remembrance " of the fish , cucumbers , melons , onions , leeks , and garlic they had so freely eaten during their abode in Egypt . " No mention is here made of meat . From this time forward , flesh became a standing dish ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abode , are said in their entertainment of strangers to have set before them bread , fruit , and wine , it is pretty certain that the first course was of some more solid substance . It is , however , singular that in the approaches made by the Hebrews and nations immediately succeeding , the culinary art , simple as it was with them , made slow progress , and in some instances actually retrograded . The Bedouins dried their meat in the sun and the Croats , of more modern da*rs , employ a method quite simple , and one that does not in the slightest degree interfere with their habitual pursuits . It is , that when they kill an animal , they cut a morsel of the fattest part , strew over it a little salt , place it under the saddle , when , after a gallop of a few hours , it is brought forth well heated and tender enough to be eaten without further preparation . We are fond of recurring to the J ) ast , and praising the simplicity of former times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive mode of preparing meat is not commendable , and happily is no longer necessary . The march of mind , the boast of our times , has led to refinement , and to more intimate knowledge of an element , the judicious use of which has developed science and enlarged our enjoyments . We allude to fire . The first man was , as we are told , created in a warm climate ; of course it was not likely he should early learn the use , or even make the discovery of an element that his feelings told him was not necessary , although one which civilized moderns of all climes can not now exist without . It is not the father of cookery , but it may be called its godfather , for it certainly stands sponsor for the most of the aliments that sustain us . One thing leads to another : no sooner was it discovered that fire in almost every department of cookery was necessary , than cookery in grateful acknowledgment introduced chemistry , and this in turn led to pharmacy . See , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestowed on the world by cookery as produced by fire , and how much our happiness is promoted by the union of the two . It is true , fire has occasionally been grossly perverted from its original beneficent purpose by being employed to produce conviction on the mind of unbelievers of particular dogmas ; but this is not cooking ; and cooking , which may be considered as the chief cause of bringing fire into service , is in no way chargeable with the ill-use of the properties of its auxiliary . It appears , then , that the cook , the chemist , and the apothecary , act in unison for the benefit of those who eat ; and the number of these is not only quite large , but is constantly increasing ; the cook , by converting the elements into nutriment , the chemist by analyzing their properties , and the apothecary by removing them when they do harm to the system . Having in these preliminary remarks referred to the early habit of eating , and the period when meat was first brought in table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering this new article of food palatable : in other words , give an insight into the art or science ( as it is called by its professors ) of cooking . Here we are forced to leave the most early records , as they are deficient in details , and must be content with gleaning from profane history such facts as may shed light on this interesting and highly important topic . We have consulted Greek and Roman history ( we are tired of Babylon and Nineveli ) , but do not discover , except in a few instances , accounts sufficiently minute for our purpose . The habits and mode of life of these ancient people were entirely different from those of the moderns ; to be sure , they made speeches almost as long as ours , but as they fought and killed game with bows and arrows , instead of muskets that produce fire , they were ignorant of the many uses to which this element may be applied . The advancement of civilization and intelligence has brought us to the knowledge , that while it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a means of sustaining it . Nor do we find that these people , enlightened as they undoubtedly were , could waltz , or dance the polka , both of which-*so much enliven the spirits , refine the taste , and , above all , sharpen the appetite . The earliest notice of Grecian cooking is found in the 9th book of the Iliad . It is known to all scholars that Achilles and the commander-in-chief of the army had a bitter quarrel about a lady , called each other hard names , and separated deadly foes . Achilles being of a fiery temper , left the army , which , in cousequence , suffered many reverses . It being thought necessary to success , that he should resume his place as one of the chiefs , three envoys were dispatched to urge his return . The deputation consisted of Ulysses , Ajax , and an old man named Phenix , a calm country member , who was doubtless selected for the purpose of standing between the cunning of Ulysses and the ardent temperament of Ajax . Achilles , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , Patroclus , to fill the largest bowl with the best wine , and knowing they would be hungry , directed him to prepare refreshments . " He said . Patroclus o'er the blazing fire , Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire ; The brazen vase Antomedon sustains , Which flesh of porket , sheep , and goat contains . " This of course was a stew . After-wards ,  --  " Then when the languid flames at length subside , He strews a bed of glowing embers wide ; Above the coals the smoking fragments turns And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns . " This was a broil . As yet gridirons were not . The party ate and drank plenteously . Madame iDacier and other commentators are pleased with the simplicity of the entertainment , and remark with admiration on the free and easy style in which it was conducted . Patroclus , the friend of the host , was the chief cook ; no servants appeared , each guest helping himself as he liked . It is to be supposed , as Achilles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the festival should be worthy of the exalted personages who were to partake of it ; these were no less than a king , the son of a king , and three renowned Grecian generals . All seemed pleased ; yet by closely viewing the matters it will be seen that this was only outward show , for it did not produce the effect intended . If fleas were then as numerous and as nimble as those of the present day , each ambassador returned home with one in his ear ; and this , exclusive of the feast , was all that was obtained , while Achilles resisted their entreaties , and remained as obstinate as ever . How is this to be accounted for ? Simply thus-there was a defect in the cooking . Had they commenced with a potage d Ut J ? eine , or even a consomme , with a glass of sparkling Catawba immediately after , it would have produced an agreeable feeling ; then bouilli and turbot , or . nguille d la Tartare , with a few hors-d'ceuvres , and a genial spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or kid ( leaving out the pork ) as r6ti , it can not be doubted the party would have risen from table in harmony with each other , the object of the meeting being accomplished , and the war more speedily terminated . It is , however , unfair to condemn people for ignorance ; the Greeks could compose a poem which is still the admiration of the lettered world , but they had never been taught the art of cooking on scientific principles ; had not discovered the new combinations science has developed . Let us add , too , to their praise , that they were the original inventors of the sausage . Their first attempt was made by mingling with a moderate quantity of // pork , the flesh of rabbit , pheasant , and peacock , which being spiced with judgment , the whole was made very tasteful , and was imitated with great success by the moderns down to the sixth century . A distinguished Italian poet who flourished about the same period , composed , in honor of the sausage , a song that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient nor necessary to continue the account of Grecian gastronomy . It probably improved by intercourse with foreign nations , and by the increase of wealth , which generates luxury . Let us pass to others . The Romans were a hardy race of people , of strong minds ,  --  what we should call a go-ahead people ,  --  but deficient in refinement . Much of their literature , and nearly all their cookery , were derived from the Greeks , after time had produced an improvement in Grecian art . In their early career , their best cooks were from Sicily , and their nicest dishes were designated by the name SicuUe dapes . Yet , although thus provided , their tables were loaded with solid materials rather than with skilfully compounded dishes . The profusion was marvellous ; they thought to dazzle by display rather than to win good will and appetite by delicate food scientifically prepared . No better proof need be given of the want of delicacy of the Roman appetite , than their great fondness for pork ; a hard , slow of digestion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing , intended , no doubt , to remove this objection , did not make the meat any better . They thrust a spit red hot through the body of the pig , and suffered it to die without bleeding . Even if by this method the flesh was made tender , the retention of the blood changed its color , and disposed it to more speedy putrifaction . It may be said , en passant , that pork was not improved by a modern invention . A living *ig was taken ( only about two hundred years ago ) made to swallow vinegar , water , a great variety of herbs , all boiled together , then immediately whipped to death , and roasted forthwith . None of these practices , we are happy to say , prevail at present . The Romans eat of many dishes we are accustomed to , many we are not , and many we never think of as food . Game was always in repute . Wild and domestic fowls were much liked , as they are with us , except the nightingale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tongues were in vogue down to the time of William the Conqueror , and were considered a great delicacy . Fish was abundant , and of great variety , yet cod , haddock , and halibut do not appear to have been known , or if so , were not valued . Of the solid meats , the most of them were the same as those we eat ; but the young of the common ass ( asinus ) and young puppies ( cabuli lactantes ) , were they never so well fattened , we could never tolerate . Yet the last were evidently thought a delicacy , for they formed part of the entertainment given by INhecenas to Augustus and Horace . It was not that the Romans were deficient in comestibles * these were abundant and various ; what they lacked was judgment in the choice , and art in combining them . They could well discipline large armies , that conquered wherever they were led , yet they had not the skill necessary to sustain life agreeably ; or , in other words , they were deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for general government , yet lacked skill to give fresh zest to food . Many of their laws axe adopted into our code , but we eschew their kitchen . They were wanting in invention . They were good eaters , but this is not enough to form a man of pure taste . The French professors say , - " L'homme mange : l'homme d'esprit sait manger . " And then their sauces ! It is painful to think of them . Modern adepts will wonder at their taste . It is doubtful if what delighted patrician palates would agree with our plebeian ideas . The most celebrated of their sauces was the garum . This was composed in the following manner : - " The intestines of fish are thrown into a vessel , salted , laid before the sun , frequently turned ; when sufficiently heated , the garum is drawn from them . " This was highly esteemed ; yet it will at once be perceived that , leaving out the seasoning , it is no other than our common fish oil , of a most rancid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pungent by a sprinkling of asafcetida ( silphium ) , the odor of which we have no terms for . It is matter of surprise that the Romans should have been so long contented with combinations of so gross , and , to us , so repulsive a nature , more especially as they had so intimate an intercourse with the more refined Greeks . During the early period of their history , they sent a deputation to Athens to request a copy of the laws of Solon , besides which , many of the // Roman youth were sent there to 6tudy belles-lettres and philosophy ; it is hardly to be supposed these individuals , in search of knowledge , would return without bringing with them correct notions of the fare they had been accustomed to , with the manner it had been prepared . In fact , this intercourse did at lest bring forth a change ; and when , by their all-conquering arms , the world was at their feet , and riches accumulated , the Romans became refined in their taste , and the luxury of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the universe was ransacked for rarities , and the ingenuity of men was tasked to discover new modes of gratifying the new and varied tastes that were formed . Poultry and truffles were brought from Africa , rabbits from Spain , pheasants from Greece , and peacocks from the extreme parts of Asia ; exclusive of this , increased attention was given to the cultivation of fruit , as well exotic as indigenous , so that nothing was left undone to make Rome the focus of gastronomy , as she was the mistress of the world . Thus she remained many centuries , supreme in power , the centre of art , the seat of literature , the home of eloquence , and last , though by no means least , the abode of a class of men who , by their scientific labors , gave dignity to a hitherto neglected department of domestic economy , made it the means of infusing a kindly spirit , and taught mankind the salutary precept that reconciliation is often produced , benevolence awakened , and many of the passions that disturb social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time rolled on , and the flame of the culinary art burned long and bright to cheer the world ; but the kitchen fire , like man , is as liable to trouble , as the sparks to fly upwards . Sad , very sad , is the thought that , just as we have acquired a pure taste of earthly pleasures , a chilling blast of adversity comes into the midst of our enjoyment , withers the sweet flowers we have tended with so much care , and robs us of our delight . The morning dawn may display its brightness , filling us with hope , the noon may be clothed in splendor , but the evening be shrouded in gloom ; and so it was with ancient Rome . Her night came ; her glowing hearths ( particularly the kitchen hearths ) became solitary , or were guarded by new and uncouth forms , who knew nothing but hunger : her harvests were trodden by the horses of voL. rv. - 38 the stranger . The immigrant8 scorned the delicacies before them , the art by which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Palaces were destroyed , and with them the cooks who had made them joyous abodes . By the irruption of the barbarians , the internal as well as the external glories of Rome were effaced , and this was followed by a period of darkness that rested long over the civilized world . Everything fell before Alaric and his rough hordes ; nothing was respected . Soups and science , fish and fine arts , bouilli and belles-lettres , pastry and poetry , all shared alike in one common fate , were involved in the same universal ruin , and ages elapsed before the light of knowledge and the art of cooking were restored , to brighten the mind with one , and refine the appetite of mankind with the other . The conquerors were for a time constant to their horse flesh , or meat of domestic animals , which they eat raw ; but climate and the example of the vanquished crc long brought about a change . They found the delicately prepared meats of the south more pleasant to the taste than their own coarse food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they became insensibly tinctured with civilization , and learned , at last , to estimate the gentleness of social life . A general improvement took place about the fifth century of our era , a period when the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon were in session , for the purpose of settling certain contested religious dogmas . As these councils were composed of from six to eight hundred pious priests , who for a long time were engaged in most solemn discussions , conducted frequentiywith angry debates , it is fair to believe their appetites were rendered keen by their arduous labors , and , judging by the effects produced , it is highly probable that in satisfying these appetites , which they certainly did , this large assembly of cultivated persons afforded , by example , quite as much aid to the cause of good cookery as they did by precept to the general interest of the church . We mention these two circumstances together to show that good feeding and orthodoxy are not unfrequently found hand in hand . Although the progress of amelioration was occasionally checked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France , where it took a stand under the enlightened government of // Charlemagne , and continued to advance during the reigns of his successors . But a most notable change took place from the moment Chivalry commenced to bring an influence on social manners . Then , among many of its achievements was that of the introduction of females into social circles , which not only softened the harsh features in the character of men , but tended still further to improve the gastronomic taste of the age . Cookery was immensely the gainer . The fair and noble dames , who embellished the court , or smiled on suitors , did not disdain to cast an eye on thekitchen , whence now issued aliments made more alluring by varied embellishments bestowed upon them . Pheasants appeared on table , their claws gilt with gold , and the peacock was presented with its gorgeous tail expanded , to charm the eye , while it enticed to a more material sense . Fair hands , hitherto unused to toil , now assisted in some of the minor details of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages have confirmed . The Venetians furnished the spices of the East , and the Arabians the perfumed liquids . Meats were served up in fantastic forms , and fish was sometimes boiled in rose-water . Cookery , like some of the best qualities of our nature , may be diverted from its true purpose , by being carried to extremes . So thought some legislators , who attempted to apply a corrective , by passing sumptuary laws . These , people laughed at and evaded , so that at last they became , like other historical monuments , thought of , but neither read nor observed . The world moved on , and every one lived as well as he could . The meat in the pot simmered  --  the joint turned with the spit  --  the stew frothed  --  the fry uttered its welcome sound , and the gridiron stood a fire which even Taylor or Scott would have winced at . If historical report be true , excellent fare was always to be found within the abbeys , convents , monasteries , and like establishments , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little subjected to the gaze of the profane , enjoyed culinary prerogatives denied to worldly communities . Having brought our battens do cuisine thus far into good company , a place is now open to present cookery in another and highly important point of view . It is astonishing to perceive the aid chronology has received from cookery , and how well it traces the progress of civili zation . The early stage of manhood is marked by men cutting slices from the living animal and eating them raw ; the second period is when the meat is broiled or stewed ; the third , when the mind becomes enlarged , and human skill is exercised in forming combinations to foster the desire of all created beings to reach a point beyond the one on which they rest . Here is civilization . Here is the world 's progress clearly defined by Cookery , which thus has a merit unnoticed even by its most zealous partisans . The present offers a fit occasion to hold a little t*te-*-t*te with our readers , for the purpose of showing what we consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We do not profess to be historians or biographers  --  to give the life and adventures that have passed in various kitchens-furnish a date for each event , or follow a chain of years link by link . This would check the easy freedom we like to take to ourselves , and greatly weary those who are kind enough to listen . Nevertheless , we shall observe a certain degree of order , for the purpose of giving what we have to say sQmewhat the air of an historical treatise . We shall be diligent in research , faithful in relation , and draw our facts from every accessible source . It is the habit ( some call it the mission ) of these United States , our beloved country , to wander far and take whatever they can lay their hands on ; it is equally the elevated mission of the culinary art to promote civilization and refinement , by bringing from far the effect of shill and experience home to the bosoms and stomachs of those on whom the light of science has not yet shone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refinement of manners keep company . Germany was slow in its progress , and it was only till the armies of France carried with them victory and cookery , that gastronomic taste was infused into the nation . Still it was long obstinately bent on plain roast and boiled , and even to this day simplicity and solidity are the characteristic traits of this people . Holland would not raise its head above its marshes . Caviar , sourorout , and gin , were the favorite diet ; and although within almost speaking distance of the fountain of good taste , resisted its culinary blandishments with the same vigor it withstood its armies . Her manners were in harmony with her diet . England , the " Defender of the F*th " the champion of free government and ardent // promoter of civilization , could not be allured to the refinements in cookery , which the age was striving to bring forth . The food of the highest of the Plantagenets was more coarse and illdressed than what is now given to negro slaves , nor when their power fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry VIII . was a regular beef-eater-his successor , Queen Elizabeth , was not more delicate , while her maids of honor breakfasted on stock-fish and beer . What could be expected from a people with such antecedents ? One whose digestive powers had never been brought under a systematic course of education . To these habits they steadily clung many years . About the middle of the seventeenth century a partial improvement was made . Charles II . who had passed much of his life abroad : although not always able to buy a dinner for himself , saw enough to teach him to appreciate a good one . The return of this king gave an impulse to the genius of cookery , and taught the nation-what they did not know before-that man is not made merely to digest . Still John Bull was rugged , which made an ambassador of Louis XIV . ' s , of France , complain that he was sent among barbarians who had a dozen religions and only one sauce-melted butter . This very tardy progress is the more remarkable , as a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were visible as early as the middle of the fourteenth century . This , it must be noted , was observable only in convents , where , as may*be supposed , more attention was bestowed upon this point than in the open world , where moved the rough barons who governed it . The following is a description of a female at her meat , as given by Chau-cer THE NUN . " At mete was she well ytaught with alleShe lette no morsel from hire lippes falle , Ne wette hire fingers in hire sauce depe , Wel coude she cane a morsel and well cepe , Thatte no droppe ne felle upon hire hrest , In curtesie was sette ful moche hire lest . Here over lippe wiped she so clene , That in hire cuppe was no farthing sene Of grese , when she drunken had hire draught Full semely after hire mete she raught . " We are now arrived at a period when art , science , and cookery attalned to distinction by their intrinsic merits . The impulsion was first visible in France the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louis XIV . To France belongs the honor of being the guiding star in an untrodd ! en path , of being the great patron of the aspiring genius of cookery , and bringing home to the bosoms of men the pleasure to be derived from the cultivation of the culinary art . This elevated position she still retains by common consent , reflecting persons perceiving her singular aptitude for the higher branches of the art , and that she possesses a clear perception of the wants and wishes of a large portion of the civilized world . At this time coffee was introduced ; it was brought into Europe by the Dutch ; sugar appeared in larger quantity than formerly . It is doubted among economists whether the ancients were acquainted with sugar as we use it , it being a work of art ; but it was early found by the moderns to be an essential ingredient in many preparations for eating *nd drinking . Brandy was known some time before , but not till now was its use extended ; and tobacco , hitherto confined to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stimulants . Whether the world is benefited by these two last disceverics is very doubtfuL Happily , refinement kept pace with gastronomy . The physical strength of Louis XIV . deelining as he advanced in years , various restoratives were invented which still hold place among the ligueur8 of the day . The spirit of good cheer , with its improvements , was not however confined to France . Queen Ann of England had the reputation of being fond of good living . It was said she had frequent conferences with her cook , and the " Tracts for the Times " make mention of several dishes prepared after " Queen Ann 's fashion . " Notwithstanding the unfortunate closing scenes of the life of Louis XIV. , the culinary art and the public taste did not decline . But it was reserved for the commencement of the Eighteenth Century to cheer the continent of Europe , after a long war , by presenting to the world the enlivening display of the dinde aux truffee ( turkey stuffed with truffles ) . This was an achievement of the Regent Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral irregularities forgotten . Other d*coveries were i*nade* great amelioration was introduced into the arrangements of the dinner table , a spirit of conviviality was fostered , the dinner hours were changed , so that more time might be given for social intercourse ; at the same time , domestic affairs // and political discussions were found to be better understood and arranged when the parties were under the influence of a good dinner or a d4e*iner d lctfourehette . Even the Revolution , with all its horrors , did not sensibly check the disposition to convivial reunions , and many who , in the morning had denounced a political opponent in the Assembly , sat down without thought , while cutting his meat , that the sharp axe of the guillotine was in readiness to take away his appetite and head together . Having brought our notice down to a comparatively recent period , chiefly confined , it is true , to the state of the culinary art , with its influence in Europe , it seems proper to consider what pngress we of this Great Republic have made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced to admit that , notwithstanding our numerous advantages , we are in this respect behind many of the minor cities of Europe . Nature has been most bountiful , but art is deficient to render her gifts enticing . This backwardness to adopt new modes may have been caused by too close an observance of the wise axiom in our Declaration of Indepeudence which says , " Prudence will dictate that governments ( modes of cooking ) longestablished should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and , accordingly , all experience bath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils ( lad mode8 ) ale sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed . " The words within brackets will show how the axiom is to be applied to our subject . In whatsoever manner the patriots of our Revolution argued , it is still matter of surprise that we did not begin to feel a desire for improvement while an intimate intercourse was maintained with the French , when they came to our aid . Lafayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give useful hints ; then came D'Estaing , with an ambassador , both men of rank , who , to their civil and military abilities , must have added taste and judgment in culinary art sufficient to offer many sound precepts . Yet their example or advice , presuming they gave both , had no effect ; in proof of which , we need only refer to a dinner given by Washington at West Point , a few months after their arrival , to a few of his friends . Tl*ls consisted of boiled pork , roast beef , beans , greens , and apple pies , all put on to the table pell mell , and eaten off of plates once tin , but then iron ; this , too , in the midst of a country rich in the products of forest , field , and flood . If the commander-in-chief of the army fared no better than this , is it to be supposed those of inferior rank fared even so well , and how must it have been with the public in general ? Count de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , yet no improvement appeared . Far be it from our intention to disparage the character of the ever to be praised natives , the sons of liberty . They were a noble race , and the food they lived upon was no doubt well adapted to give them energy , mental and physical , to withstand the assaults of their enemies . Their fare , though neither delicate nor well served , was nourishing , and this was all the times required . Yet , admitting that this repast might , for the most part , be a healthy diet , we must demur to the vegetable portion of it . Anot ? er cause of the backwardness of our people to fraternize in a gastronomic way with the auxiliaries , was a lurking dislike to the French as a nation . The Americans. , as colonists , had been much annoyed by them , and this they remembered ; to this was added a portion of the mother 's hatred which the children had inherited . This ill feeling was openly manifested in the intercourse between the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the efforts of Washington , and the conciliatory disposition of Lafayette , might have produced unfortunate consequences . The Americans were willlng the French should fight for them , but would not be prevailed upon to eat with them . During the whole course of our struggle , fish was seen only in its most simple form ; en mcttelote it was unknown , of course its virtues unprized . How we were able to continue on such friendly terms with the French during their stay of two years and a half , without imbibing any of their refinement , can be explained only by the extreme necessity we were under for their military aid , not for their culinary knowledge . That they rendered us good service during the contest is beyonddispute ; whether we profited by their taste and skill in cookery , it must be confessed , is very doubtful . It may not be difficult to account for the pertinacity with which our predecessors adhered to their accustomed fare , when we take into view the force of education , climate , and occupation ; beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a material influence on our character , this is not merely the food , but chiefly the manner it is prepared . Herein we fall , and herein we are subjected to the reproof of foreigners . French food is light  --  the French are a sprightly people . English food is heavy , and the English are solid and serious , while the Americans are so little guided by scientific rules in their cookery as to give Europeans occasion to accuse them of being wanting in national character . It is not intended to be understood that we entirely neglected the bright examples set before us , but rather that we were too much wedded to established habits , and admitted change with reluctance . Still , changes did take place , as wrn hereafter appear . We got so well out of the war , the spirits of the people were raised , and the dinner table felt the influence . As soon as peace was proclaimed , currant jelly was served with venison ; this was an improvement introduced by Governor Hancock , who , to his many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; fish was occasionally dressed with port wine ; sauces received attention , though much was left unfinished ; and among the higher circles sugar was used in the making of pumpkin pies instead of molasses , as heretofore . This was doing well for a beginning ; even Lord Bacon would have noticed " the advancement of learning ; " yet a still more favorable symptom appeared , and this was a desire to do even better . People were uneasy ; local politics were in confusion , which tended to make matters worse ; besides which , the confederacy was found insufficient to keep the nation together in harmony . During this anxious state , in happy hour , mock turtle soup was invented , and immediately our present excellent Constitution was framed . Being young as a people , jusf out of leading strings , unaccustomed to entire selfgovernment , it was not to be expected close attention could be paid to culinary art . We had just built our house , we had now to see how its interior economy should be ordered ; and as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few could stop * how it should be dressed ; still , a few did think , and well for ns there were such persons ; the consequence was , that improvement slowly and quietly crept on . In the course of this progress , pea soup , which had hitherto been presented with the pea partially boiled lying at the bottom , with the hull floating on top , was now strained , by which process the teeth were not clogged , and more could be eaten without jarring the palate . Chowder , a national dish peculiar to the Eastern States , was first produced by the inventive genius of our venerable and pious ancestors at Plymouth . Our reverence for them created a fondness for this dish , and we still cherish it for that and its intrinsic merit . The refinements introduced into its composition , while they have added to our enjoyment , have not entirely effaced its simplicity , or diminished our gratitude . The French matelote is an imitation , but is so much tinctured with monarchical ornament as to be far removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fish , it is not amiss to remark on , the astonishing varieties that inhabit the waters . If we may believe Hindoo philosophy , the ocean is the source from which sprang all living beings ; that the human species were brought forth in the waters , and that it is by change of air and habit alone men were brought to rest in a terrestrial element . However this may be , we certainly feel no reluctance to feeding on our cousins of the deep , and although their flesh is less nourishing than that of animals , it offers a pleasing variety in our gastronomic festivals . Anchovy sauce and lobster salad were now presented . The last is an agreeable horsd'ceuvre , combining a marine aliment with a vegetable substance , offering a pleasant zest to a light nourishment . This may be said of sandwiches , a delicacy devised for the special benefit of ladies of feeble health and small appetite . Puddings , of which all were fond , are of doubtful character ; they may be light and nutritive , or heavy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought over in the Mayflower , and constitute an important item in the list of our eatables . Sober minded men , accustomed to reflect before they act , ponder before they partake of them , and it is only the young and vigorous who can take them without discrimination . Pork , in a few forms , is with many a favorite dish . Our forefathers , as soon as they could raise animals at Plymouth , made it an essential article of food . In their forlorn condition they were glad to feed on a substance so easily procured ; besides which , their relish for it was heightened by knowing that it was held in abhorrence by unbelieving Jews , on the same principle as that which made // Dee . them avoid celebrating Christmas , because it was a religious festival of Catholics . About fifty years ago , some of our exquisites boiled ham in Madeira wine . This was an expensive luxury which met with little encouragement . Jt took its rise from an incident that occurred in Prussia . Frederick the Great once condescended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his courtiers and among many dishes of exquisite flavor , he was particularly struck by that of a ham . He partook of it copiously , accomj*anying each mouthful with great praise , not only of the meat , but of the cook who had prepared it . A short time afterwards , his majesty dire*ted a ham to be cooked that should have the same flavor as the one he had so much enjoyed . On being told how it had been boiled , he *expressed astonishment at the novel method ; yet , not to lose the pleasure he promised himself , ordered the cook to apply to the courtier for the requisite quantity of wine . The king being an absolute monarch , the liquor and lives of his subjects were at his disposal ; and being of a despotic temper , no one thought of disobedience ; the wine was furnished , but to check fu*ture like requisitions , the practice of *ling ham in wine was discontinued , and it is believed has not been renewed . The alinsent under immediate notice shadows forth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our quality of faithful annotators we may not shrink from the duty this title imposes . Sxssages are a delicate question . We took occasion to mention them when treating on Grecian art from which they date their birth . " Westward the course of empire takes its way , " and so it was with sausages . They passed from Greece to Rome , and rested long in various parts of Italy . Bologna , where the famous painters Caracci Guido and **25;121;TOOLONG of paiAting enriched by their works  --  a city that gave several popes to the church-was also the centre of art , science , and sausages , a distinction it still retains . Thence they ( the sausages ) passed to Lyons , in France , where , with occasionally an exception , they form an agreeable condiment ; they then traversed the ocean to our western hemisphere , and it is painful to add they suffered by the voyage , being now greatly deficient in delicacy . Our sausages are made chiefly , if not altogether , of pork , are indifferently seasoned , without care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that fine flavor which gives so much reputation to those of the eastern world . Another cause operates powerfully to lessen the merit of our American sausage . Sinister remarks are thrown out on the ingredients of which it is composed , and when spoken of , or brought on table , allusions are whispered to its supposed illegitimate parentage . It is unnecessary to dwe* longer on the various substances that constitute our food ; we have them in profusion ; our * ! efect lies in the want of scientific knowledge in their preparation-the proper method of displaying them on a table , so as to produce a good effect , and skill in adding side dishes ( hors d'oeuvres ) , to give fulness to the group . Mistakes are made in placing the courses ; a r6* sometimes &amp;imes in before an entr*e ; and what ought to be a side dish is often made to figure out of its proper place . In the eyes of the uninitiated these are slight defects , which time may remove , and they are not mentioned to depreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , for the benefit of our successors , that a well-ordered table affords refreshment to the mind while it presents nourishment to the body . If , as some people assert , the seat of the soul is in the stomach , how important it is that the etherial part should be properly cherished . It is not , however , the kind of food one eats , or the more or less skill with which it is prepared , that is the essential point ; there is another consideration comes in worthy of equal notice , this is the manner the food should be eaten . There are five kinds of eaters. 1 . There is your dull man , who seems to eat merely from habit , mainly because his parents did so before him , and he expects his children will follow his eximple. 2d . Your impatient , fidgety being , who is all activity , and who falls to at once on the dish that happens to be before him . 3d . Your careless eater , without education , who considers so much time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dishes on the same level , and hardly knows the difference between the breast and the drumstick . 4th . Next comes your ravenous animal , who thinks only of quantity , takes everything that comes in his way , as if anxious to show the capacity of his stomach . 5th . Lastly , come the professors , men of taste , who cast a practised eye over the table before they eat , use // judgment in the choice of such dishes as suit their habits , and eat sparingly of each , that their palate may be gently excited by variety . These are the guests who are the best dinner-table talkers . And here we take the liberty of presenting a precept given by an ancient philosopher , whose name we do not remember , neither is it of consequence , that the month is the vestibule of the soul , the gate of discourse , the portico of thought ; of course nothing unclean ( of course unpalatable ) should go in or come out . To this we beg leave to add that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if napkins are to be had . It is time to bring our remarks to a close , and some of our friends may think we have already said too much . But , exclusive of the interest we take in what we consider an essential matter , and even at the risk of wearying those whose friendship we value , we shall throw out a few hints on what we conceive to be the most classical mode of forming an agreeable dinner party . It should consist of eight or nine-more would require a parade which would be tiresome ; in this number ladies must certainly be included . Care should be taken to seat the guests that are congenial to each other . It is not advisable to talk much when one begins to eat . Each person is placed at table to perform a service , and the first course has the effect to give an idea of the work to come ; then the guest has time for reflection , his mind becomes composed , after which he may gradually unfold it . If the party be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near by ; if small , it may be made general . Do n't touch champagne until the commencement of the second course , if you do you will be gay at the wrong time . Above all , violent emotions should be avoided in the early stage of the repast ; as this proceeds , hilarity will naturally follow ; the soul as well as body will exhibit the effect by fresh color to the countenance , brightness to the eyes , and lively sallies , while a gentle warmth will *servade the whole system . The conversation should be on the common topics of the day , music , poetry , the opera , painting , men , women , and books , on politics very little . The greatest care should be taken to prevent argumentation . If a guest feels inclined to commit this misdemeanor , the host may feel justified in recommending another glass of brown stout , with another piece of cheese . The party should leave the table all together , and take coffee in the drawing-room ; when there , individuals may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any special topic ; there will always be a few left to chat with ladies , who wish to talk instead of reposing . All this displays , as we believe , the happy moral and physically favorable effect of a good dinner , with a choice selection of guests . The general course of these our remarks leads us to the thought that an essential part of education is neglected in this city . We have schools where book-learning is poured into the heads of scholars in streams ; we abound in lecturers , who treat on all possible subjects ; and we have societies for the encouragement of religion and morals , besides associations and laws to teach people what they shall drink and how much they shall drink . how is it , thea , that in the great desire to ameliorate the moral and physical condition of our people , no society has been formed to regulate their eating ? Few things are more needed . Almost all men eat more than they ought ; and this is done in a hasty manner . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vexation , a man will sit down and eat ravenously , his plate filled with every variety that the table affords , all put together . The next day he feels uneasy , and wonders what is the matter . In a month or two our gormandizer finds he has the dyspepsia , which lingers about him for years , and affects his mind . All things are bright when you have eaten enough-they are gloomy when you have eaten too much . Now , we can not but believe a remedy might be applied that would relieve the mind and save the lives of many of our suffering brethren . We abound in* pure philanthropists : let them lose no time in unit ,  - -  ing for the purpose . If what we have written shall have the effect to awaken them to the performance of this act of humanity , we shall hail the bright day , amply recompensed for our labors by seeing our disinterested efforts made the means of teaching the ignorant , enlightening the partially instructed , and increasing the enjoyment of a large portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
