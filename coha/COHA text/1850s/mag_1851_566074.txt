txt ART . VI. -A SKETCH OF THE LIFE AND CHAR ACTER OF HON. SIMEON BALDWIN . IN our last number we presented a sketch of the life and character of the Hon. David Daggett . The bereaving hand , which gave occasion for that sketch , summons us now to present another . The venerable Judge Baldwin , to whom we then alluded as daily waiting , in his ninetieth year , with the serenity of patience and hope and in the confidence of faith , for his departure , in a little more than five weeks went to join his friend . Having occupied for many years a seat on the bench of the same court , united to him in the fellowship of the same church and in the bonds of neighborhood and affectionate intimacy during a long life , he was scarcely separated from him in death . We are confident that we shall gratify , not only ourselves , but many of our readers , who , during their college life as well as at their subsequent occasional visits to their Alma Mater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ en brought into conflict against nothing but the militia of the other Grecian states , or the undisciplined hordes of the King of Persia . // to see his noble form and benignant face , if we render to him in our pages the just tribute of a brief review of his life and his virtues . SIMEON BALDWIN was born December 14 , 1761 , in the town of Norwich in what is now the State , but was then the colony of Conn'ecticut ; and of course on the day of his decease , May 26 , 1851 , had passed through Live months and twelve days of his ninetieth year : thus extending his earthly pilgrimage through the average lifetime of three generations . He was the youngest among seven children of Ebenezer Baldwin , the grandson of Thomas Baldwin , and great - grandson of John Baldwin , the first ancestor of this branch of the Baldwin family in this country . John Baldwin came from England with the Puritan emigrants from the counties of Bucks , Surrey and Kent , who accompanied their pastors , Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the settlement of New Haven , Milford and Guilford . Of these emigrants , six families bore the name of Baldwin . John Baldwin 's name am pears on the records of the town of Guilford , in the tax list of the planters and inhabitants of that town , in 1646 . It appears , also , from these records that he was married there in 1653 , and had a son born there in 1654 , and a daughter in 1656 ; and it appears , moreover , from the records of Norwich , that he was one of thirty-five proprietors who purchased and settled that town in 1660 . At that time he removed with his family to that place , and took up his residence on the town lot assigned to him . On this same spot , were born his son Thomas , his grandson Ebenezer , and his great-grandson Simeon , the subject of the present sketch . The parents of Simeon Baldwin were devout and godly persons , who by prayer , faith and Christian nurture devoted their children to Christ and his church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mother when he was a little more than a year old ; but her place was in due time supplied so well by a second wife of his father , that he never knew or could see any difference , as he has often said , between her and a real mother . His father combined , as is often the case in the early history of colonies , mechanical and agricultural pursuits . He was a man tr*sted , honored and useful in the civil and religious affairs of Norwich , an active member of the church , a magistrate of the town , and its representative in the General Assembly . Mr. Baldwin , thus favored by early parental influence , was also eminently favored in the instruction which for a time he received in studies prep*iratory for admission to college . He went , // at th' age of thirteen , to reside in the family and under the tuition of his oldest brother , Rev. Ebenezer Baldwin , pastor of the Congregational church in Danbury , who was then , though in early life , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philanthropists and patriots in the colony . Judge Trumbull , in a memoir of his own life , and of the various writers on the history of Yale College , makes honorable mention of him as one of an able body of tutors , who , entering upon their office at a period when the college had fallen into disfavor among many of the civilians of the State , and was in a great measure forsaken by its students on account of general dissatisfaction with its administration , by their eminent scholarship , affable manners , efficient authority , and modes of instruction adapted to the progress of the times , contributed much to raise again its reputation , restore it to confidence , and repair its prosperity . The late Chancellor Kent , who was under his tuition at Danbury with Simeon Baldwin , whose classmate he was in college , and through life his admiring and familiar friend , in an address before the Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1831 , alludes to Rev. Ebenezer Baldwin , as his early preceptor , with an affectionate warmth which time had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching tribute to his worth and virtues . He calls him " a great and excellent man , * ' and gives a glowing eulogy on his piety , his learning , his eloquence , judgment and patriotism . Simeon Baldwin commenced his studies with his brother , in Danbury , at a most trying period of our American history , in 1774 , when the colonies were burdened under the oppressive measures of the British Government ; and patriotic and courageous men were actively engaged in preparing for the daring , and to any but the righteous and the brave , desperate work of resistance and revolution . His recollections of that period were vivid and accurate ; and he has often spoken in late years of the active part which his brother took in that work preparatory to our struggle for civil liberty , thinking that struggle sacred , chiefly because it involved religious liberty . Particularly has he spoken of an address , which his brother published in the year 1774 , under his own signature , to the people of the western part of the colony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which their liberties were then involved by measures of the British Government , which , as he clearly showed , violated alike their natural rights as men and their constitutional rights as Englishmen ; and also of a sermon which his brother preached , and afterwards published by request , on Thanksgiving Day , in Iovember , 17Th , that was designed to keep up the spirits of the people in the dangerotis // struggle in which they were then fully engaged , by the events that had occurred during the year then drawing to a close , especially the battles of Lexington and Bunker Hill . A vivid idea of the vast changes which have taken place during our friend 's lifetime is conveyed by a fact that he has often narrated . A rumor reached Danbury that a battle had been fought on Bunker Hill , but no definite intelligence had been received there of its character or issue . This was nearly three weeks after the battle . So , to procure satisfactory information , Simeon Baldwin , then fourteen years old , was sent on horseback fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to borrow the Hartford paper , which contained an account , official probably , of that engagement . On his return the inhabitants of the town assembled in great numbers around the house of his brother to hear it read . How much is embraced in a life , one extreme of which is in such a period , and the other in a period , when the nerves of intelligence , reaching to all points in a country extended tenfold , are literally operated by the power and with the speed of the lightning . But the distinguished advantages of Mr. Baldwin under the tuition of his brother , after continuing about two years , were calamitously cut off . In the impending and gloomy campaign of 1776 , when the defense of New York , threatened by the British army of 30,000 , well disciplined and well equipped , had become well nigh desperate , " iRev . Ebenezer Baldwin ( we use here the language of Chancellor Kent ) was incessant in his efforts to cheer and animate his townsmen to join the militia , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give weight to his eloquent exhortations , he added that of his heroic example . Tie went voluntarily as a chaplain to one of the militia regiments . His office was pacific , but he nevertheless arrayed himself in military armor . I was present ( adds Chancellor Kent ) when he firmly and cheerfully bade adieu to his devoted parishioners and affectionate pupils . " This was about the first of August , 1776 . Soon after his arrival at New York , Simeon , then fourteen years old , went at his summons on horseback to carry to him some clothing and provisions . He remained a short time in New York , and was sent back by his brother , who anticipated the next day an attack from the enemy 's forces . When the anticipated attack took place , Mr. Baldwin 's horse was taken with all his baggage . The loss of his clothing subjected him to severe exposure , especially in the chilly nights ; which , with other hardships of his service in ministering to the sick and suffering soldiers , resulted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickness was immediately sent to Danbury ; and Simeon was dispatched // to New York to convey him to his home ; which he accomplished , though they were detained for a time at a town on the way by the severity of his brother 's disease . He then went immediately from Danbury to Norwich to summon the family friends . They arrived just in season to hear the last words , and witness the death , at the early age of thirty-one , of this , one of the most promising and heroic of the clerical martyrs to our national freedom . His eminent reputation and worth may be inferred from the fact , that , notwithstanding his youth , he was the favorite candidate for the Presidency of Yale College , then occupied pro tempore by Professor Daggett , and would undoubtedly have been chosen to that office , had his life been continued . Being thus bereaved of the instruction of his brother , Mr. Baldwin pursued his preparatory studies partly at Coventry with Rev. Mr. Huntington , and partly at Lebanon at the school of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He entered Yale College in the year 1777 , during the Presidency of Rev. Dr. IDaggett , and graduated with honor in 1781 . Of that class he was the last survivor . On the recent triennial catalogue every name except his is prefixed with the fatal star . The whole of his college life was in the stormy and exciting period of the revolutionary war , and at times the college was wholly forsaken , the students being distributed under the care of their instructors , in different towns in the State . They were in New Haven , however , at the time of the attack on this place by detachments of British troops under Generals Tryon and Garth ; and Mr. Baldwin with a company of his fellow students , joined the forces which were hastily collected to resist them , at what was then and is now called " Neck Bridge , " a bridge over the western branch of the Quinnipiack river , near Cedar Hill . He participated at that point in a skirmish in which a man standing near him was shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law , in New Haven , with Judge Chauncey ; but in the next year , having been appointed , in connection with John Lovett of the next following class , to the charge of the Academy at Albany , he removed to that city ; where he resided in the family of Peter Yates , then an eminent lawyer in that city , of whose valuable law library he availed himself for the continuance of his professional studies so far as was compatible with his duties as teacher . He there formed a pleasant acquaintance with Edward and Brockholdst Livingston , who were both pursuing their legal studies at that time under the direction of Mr. Yates . Here again we get a striking view of the changes which his long life has witnessed in this fact , that at that time there were but sixteen counselors at the bar in the whole State of New York , with all of whom // Mr. Baldwin became acquainted . Among his pupils at the Academy in Albany were John V. Henry , who afterwards became an eminent lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge of the Supreme Court of that State . In 1783 , two years after his graduation , he entered on the office of tutor in Yale College , which he filled with ability and fidelity for three years , pursuing at the same time the study of law with Judge Chauncey , till 1786 , when , with his early and life-long friend David Daggett , he was admitted to the bar of New Haven County , and entered on the practice of his profession fri this town . Four years after , in 1790 , he was appointed by Judge Law clerk of the District and Circuit courts of the United States , and continued to perform the duties of that office , in connection with an extensive professional practice in the State courts , for thirteen years , till the autumn of 1803 , when he was elected a representative from Connecticut of the eighth Congress of the United States , with iRoger Griswold , Calvin Goddard , and S. W. Dana as his associates . He attended the two sessions of that Congress , which expired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice at the bar , and was re-appointed by Ji*dge Law clerk of the District and Circuit Courts . In 1806 , when he was forty-five years of age , he was appointed by the legislature of the State an associate judge of the Superior Court and of the Supreme Court of Errors . In that office he was continued for eleven years , by annual appointment , which was the custom under the old constitution , till 1817 , when the Federal party went out of power in the State . He then returned to his practice at the bar . In 1822 he was appointed by the General Assembly one of the commissioners to locate the Farmington Canal , and was made President of that board . In 1826 he was chosen Mayor of the city of New Haven . In 1830 , in his 70th year , after having seen the canal located and completed to the Connecticut river at Northampton , lie resigned his position as commissioner , and since that time has held no public office . The practice of his profession , however , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has pursued , notwithstanding his age , till within a few years . During his practice at the bar , before he was appointed judge , he occasionally taught in his office students at law , some of whom in after life became eminent ; among whom may be mentioned the late Jeremiah Mason , who cherished for him through life a respectful and affectionate regard . At the age of twenty-six , about a year after he was admitted to the bar , Mr. Baldwin married Rebecca , daughter of the Hon. Roger Sherman , of New Haven , a man justly renowned as one // of the committee who reported the Declaration of Independence , and one of the signers of that instrument , and as one of the ablest members of the convention which formed the Constitution of the United States . She deceased in 1795 , after a married life of eight years , having been the mother of four children . Of these , two survive him , one of whom has always dwelt under her father 's roof in the constant and affectionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Hon. Roger Sherman Baldwin , late Senator of the United States from Connecticut . Five years after the death of his wife , on the 13th of April , 1800 , Mr. Baldwin married Elizabeth , another daughter of Hon. Roger Sherman , and widow of Sturges Burr . With her he was permitted by a kind Providence to live in happy union for half a century , till July , 1850 , when she deceased at the age of eightyfive . Five children were the offspring of this marriage , two of whom survive . The c9mmencement of Judge Baldwin 's religious life he was never able to date ; and it was partly for this reason , and partly from his very high idea of the spiritual characteristics which are necessary to evince piety , that he deferred to a late period his union with a Christian church . He made a profession of his faith in Christ , and of his devotion to his service , by uniting with the North Church in New Haven , in August , 1831 , during his seventieth year . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friends had regarded him as truly a religious man . Indeed , from his youth , he seemed to have practiced many of the Christian virtues , and to have maintained a deportment in respect to moral and religious things , which can not easily be accounted for , except on the supposition that he possessed real piety . From his early days , and especially after he assumed the responsibilities of professional and married life , he was an earnest and liberal supporter of religions institutions , a regular , reverent , and devout attendant on divine worship and the preaching of divine truth , a lover of Christian people , and remarkable for his kind , considerate , delicate , decided and persevering friendship to Christian ministers , especially his own pastors . In the great religious awakening which prevailed in New Haven in 1831 , he was quickened , and caused to feel that he ought not longer to defer his union with Christ 's professed people . And from that time , though he has never indulged in strong declarations of his religious feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of public religious teaching or exhortation , he has scrupulously attended to religious duties , and has manifestly // been growing in godliness , in spiritual peace , comfort , hope and joy , and in meetness for the inheritance of the saints in light . The intellectual and moral qualities of Judge Baldwin were such as eminently fitted him for the duties of the high judicial office , which he held for eleven years in the maturity of his life ; and also to attract , as he did , the universal respect and confidence of his fellow citizens , and the admiration and love of all his familiar friends . Never was it more true of any one than of him , that none knew him but to love him , nor named him but to praise . His intellectual qualities , as they were developed in his life , were so blended with , and affected by his moral qualities , that it is difficult in any analysis of his character to distinguish them , and set them forth separately . His judgment was uncommonly sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth and evidence clearly and accurately . His own ideas were conceived definitely and fully . He understood perfectly the limits of his knowledge . He always knew what he did know , and what he did not know ; and what he did know he knew well , and what he did not know he either learned thoroughly , or let alone . He had a power of perspicuous and exact statement , which enabled him always to communicate to others his knowledge or opinions clearly and accurately . His memory was remarkably ready , capacious , methodical and retentive ; and was able to unfold , even to his last months , the large and rich treasures gathered during nearly a whole century . His love of truth and of equity was strong and warm , though never violent ; and it always guided and controlled his feelings and conduct . He was candid , impartial and uninfluenced by prejudice , to a degree rarely witnessed and never surpassed . All his acquaintances will agree that a more fair-minded man they never knew . His integrity was disinterested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrious , and thorough . His qualities were not those which dazzled by their brilliancy , or overwhelmed by their rapidity and energy ; but they were those which inspired entire and universal confidence . They qualified him peculiarly for the office of Judge of the Superior Court , which he held for eleven years , and should have held for fourteen years more till he reached the age of seventy . It is one of the evils incident among far superior benefits , to popular governments , an evil which should be carefully guarded against , that political conflicts and changes sometimes result in the discontinuance of such men in such offices as that of judge of our higher courts . Such men in such offices should be retained , to whatever party they belong . // Judge Baldwin has so far outlived his generation , that very few in the State have any adequate recollection of his administration of the judicial office . But one of the few , Hon. Thomas Day , who was then , as he is now , Reporter for the Superior Court of Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief statement of his opinion of the judicial character of Judge Baldwin-an opinion with which Chief Justice Williams has expressed entire coincidence . We take the liberty to quote it : - " Everybody , " says he , " in New Haven knew Mr. Baldwin as a man a few in ay recollect him as a lawyer . I had good opportunities of knowing him as a judge ; but all that was distinctive of him in that capacity may be said in a few words . His judgment was sound , the result of thorough investigation and reflection . He was as free from bias as any man that ever gave an opinion . He was not deficient in the learning obtained from books ; but he relied more on his own good sense than on the subtleties or refinements of the law . He had less versatility than some other men . Indeed the excellence of Judge Baldwin consisted in his being always the same  --  the same upright , deliberate , intelligent man . His leading qualities as a Judge were those which were conspicuous in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from the bench . " Judge Baldwin was a man of great amiableness and kindness ,  --  the result of a fine native disposition , cultured by principle , and purified by grace . He was always careful never to harm the interests or wound the feelings of any one , and was disposed to accommodate everybody . This kindness of heart , united with his love of equity and his sound judgment , made him a true , decided , and wise philanthropist . The poor , the depressed , and especially the oppressed , always found in him a considerate , tender and prudent friend . He imitated , in this respect , our divine Lord , as he is described in the language of poetic prophecy , " He shall deliver the needy when he crieth , the poor also , and him that hath no helper . " In sympathy with the Latin poet , he counted himself a man , and deemed nothing human alien from himself . He was always the friend of that race , who have encountered an extraordinary share of earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his professional life , was especially active in their behalf . He received a strong tendency in this direction , not only from his own feelings and principles , but also from the example of his brother , Rev. Ebenezer Baldwin . In an unpublished memoir of his brother , which Judge Baldwin prepared only two years since , speaking of his brother , and others who sympathized with him , // he uses the following language : " While contemplating and endeavoring to enforce the sublime idea that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights , and that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , they found that among ourselves these self-evident truths were disregarded in a long-established system of negro slavery . To remove this beam from our own eyes , that we might see clearly to remove the mote from our brother 's eyes , Rev. Mr. Edwards , of New Haven ( afterwards Dr. Edwards , President of Union College ) , and Mr. Baldwin , by agreement , addressed the public in a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Baldwin had attended as a delegate , aud officiated as a scribe of the council which ordained Mr. Edwards in the ministry at New Haven . They became intimate friends , and as they harmonized in sentiment on the great questions of public liberty which then agitated the country , so also were their opinions in unison in regard to the unlawfulness of slavery . Their essays on that subject , which were published alternately in Green 's paper , in New Haven , in the years 1773 and 1774 , excited much attention , caused many emancipations , and contributed to produce a course of measures which eventually abolished slavery , not only in Connecticut , but in all the Northern States . " One of these measures , adopted after Mr. Baldwin 's death , was the formation of " the Connecticut Society for the promotion of freedom , and for the relief of persons unlawfully held in bondage . " In the origin and operations of this Anti-Slavery Society , which was formed in 1790 , the year after the adoption of the Constitution of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his brother , and taking up his mantle , bore an active part . The chief article of the constitution of this society was in these words : " The members of this society shall , individually and collectively , cooperate with such societies as have been , or hereafter may be , formed in the United States of America , or other parts of the world , for the extension of freedom , or the abolition of slavery ; they shall endeavor to enforce an obedience to the laws which are or shall be enacted in this State for the progressive extension of freedom , and shall to the utmost of their power afford relief to persons unlawfully holden in bondage ; they shall also endeavor to promote the education , enlighten the minds , and correct the morals of the negroes , to render them industrious , and to furnish them with the means of honest employment . " Of this society , Mr. Baldwin was the most active member , being its secretary , conducting all its correspondence , and directing in its arrangements . A short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer many documents , published by that society , most of // them sermons against slavery by eminent clergymen , or petitions to Congress to act , so far as it constitutionally could , for the removal of slavery . They all bear his name as secretary . Judge Baldwin was uncommonly charitable in his judgment of others . Though he had decided opinions , and was strict in his views of right and wrong , he yet always thought and spoke kindly of those who differed from him . He had also singular simplicity and transparency of character . He was always open and frank in his feelings , his words and his conduct . He was wise , but never crafty ; prudent , but never cunning ,  --  " an Israelite indeed , in whom there was no guile . " Judge Baldwin was a man of public spirit . The interests of churches and ecclesiastical societies , of the town , the city , the college , the country , the world , were near his heart ; and , though cautious and discreet , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , to partake in any reasonable measure for their advancement . His private interests he never allowed to stand in the way of public advantage . Judge Baldwin 's kindness of heart , his considerate and delicate regard for the feelings of others , his frankness and openness of character , his large acquaintance with distinguished men and cultivated society , and his easy manners and affable conversation , made him remarkable for his courtesy . He was a true Christian gentleman . The equanimity of Judge Baldwin was rarely equaled . Though he had strong and delicate sensibilities , and though he passed through many severe domestic bereavements and afflictions , and has had a share of trouble from the unjust and hard dealings of the world and the variations of fortune , yet , such were his self-control and balance of mind , and so cheerful and grateful were his views of divine Providence , that his soul was always calm and even serene . In speaking of the moral qualities of our deceased friend , we have used strong and earnest language : for this alone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have known him well will not accuse us of going beyond the bounds of due commendation . Indeed , in describing Judge Baldwin as a sound-minded , fair-minded , pure-minded , and true-hearted man , it is difficult to say anything which is extravagant . The degree in which Judge Baldwin retained his intellectual and most of his bodily powers was very extraordinary ; owing doubtless , partly to a good native constitution , but more to a wise temperance , and his entire equanimity . His hearing was indeed seriously impaired ; but his form was , to the last , as erect , and his step almost as firm , as in youth . And in his mind there // was no perceptible failure , even in his four-score and tenth year . Three years since , he appeared before a committee of the Legislature , and plead a cause in which he was interested as ably as if he had been in his meridian . And lately , at a meeting of the bar of New Haven county , occasioned by the death of Judge Daggett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all the clearness , method and justness of thought and expression , for which he has ever been distinguished . Nevertheless , the time of his death was ordered in great kindness . For a disease , well known to all who looked upon his face , * which , though it has been spreading for a few years past , had hitherto given him pain , only or chiefly , in anticipation , had arrived at a stage , that would have rendered a prolonged life a grievous burden . He was submissively willing to wait all his appointed time till his change should come ; yet he desired to depart , not only that he might enter upon his heavenly rest , but that he might be saved from the evils of his threatening disease . In view of the time of his departure , as well as of the whole course of his life , we may well use with slight variations the language of one of our own poets : " Why weep ye then for him , who having run The bound of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all enjoyed , life 's labors done , Serenely to his final rest has past ; While the soft memory of his virtues , yet , Lingers like twilight hues , when the bright sun is set . " His youth was innocent : his riper age , Marked with some act of goodness , every day ; And watched by eyes that loved him , calm , and sage , Faded his last declining years away . Cheerful he gave his being up , and went To share the holy rest that waits a life well spent . " That life was happy ; every day he gave Thanks for the fair existence that was his ; For a sick fancy made him not her slave , To mock him with her phantom miseries . No chronic tortures racked his aged limb , For luxury and sloth had nourished none for him . " We may be glad that he has lived thus long , And glad that he has gone to his reward ; Nor deem that kindly nature did him wrong , Softly to disengage the vital cord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye Dark with the mists of age , it was his time to die . " // The exercises of Judge Baldwin 's mind , during his last weeks and days , were as pleasant to reflect upon , as his whole life is in the review . The substantial hope of eternal life which for years he had indulged , on the ground of his faith in the Savior of sinners , had gradually increased to a confident assurance , which he frequently , though modestly , expressed . He knew that he trusted the Savior ; and he knew that the Savior 's promises were sure . He knew in whom he believed , and was persuaded that his soul , thus intrusted to that Savior 's hands , would be saved and blest . He delighted in prayer . And when , through weakness , it was difficult for him to direct his own thoughts ,  --  to have another come daily and offer prayer for him and with him , at his bedside , was a pleasure , for which he exhausted the expressions of gratitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue from the body into the joy of his Lord ; and it was granted . He passed gradually and quietly away , without apparent suffering .
