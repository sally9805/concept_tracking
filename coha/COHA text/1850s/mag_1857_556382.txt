txt THE life of the late Sir Robert Peel is identified with the history of party in England for the last forty years . From his first entrance into Parliament , he was one of the most prominent of the rising men among the Tories , then at the zenith of their power . At the close of his career , he witnessed the waning fortunes and final disruption of that party . He came into notice as a disciple and follower of the younger Pitt . He lived to be the acknowledged leader of a party with entirely different views of public policy . He held office under the crown for a greater length of time than any of his contemporaries , except Lord Palmerston ; and in the discussion of every question which was agitated during his Parliamentary life he took an active part . He was alternately the idol of his party , and the object of their most bitter invective . Though he originated no great measure , he left a deeper mark upon the legislation of England than any other statesman of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In considering his life , therefore , we have to deal with almost every question of any importance in the foreign and domestic policy of England since the commencement of the Liverpool Administration . Some of these questions have now lost // 443 SIR ROBERT PEEL . their interest . The secret history of others still remains to be unfolded . But enough light is thrown upon some of the most important of them by the two works first named at the commencement of this article , to dispel whatever obscurity may have attached to Sir Robert Peel 's connection with those measures . M. Gnizot approaches the discussion of several of these topics under peculiarly advantageous circumstances . During the whole of Sir Robert Peel 's second ministry he was at the head of the French government . He was therefore in a position to observe all Sir Robert 's measures from an entirely independent point of view . To this duty he brought a singularly calm and impartial temper of mind , an intimate acquaintance with English history and politics , and liberal and comprehensive views in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of the right of search , the Tahiti question , the repeal of the Corn Laws , and the Spanish marriages , are especially full , candid , and judicious . In other respects his volume presents a calm and manly estimate of Sir Robert Peel 's character and public services , - in its whole tone and structure worthy of the author 's reputation as a statesman and an historian . It is a striking illustration of the temper of our times and of the entente cordiale which these great men upheld , that the life of a prime minister of England should thus be written by a contemporary prime minister of France , with such remarkable candor and impartiality . The two volumes of Memoirs , published in accordance with a codicil to Sir Robert Peel 's will , comprise a series of letters , with explanatory narratives , designed to elucidate his course at three of the most important periods in his life , - in regard to the removal of the Catholic Disabilities , the formation and overthrow of his first ministry , and the repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course which he adopted on these occasions would continue to be discussed after his death , he selected from his private papers such of the confidential letters relating to these subjects as he thought necessary for his vindication , and arranged them for posthumous publication , with a commentary designed to pre // Oct. serve the continuity of events and to illustrate the obscure points . These narratives and letters have been published by his literary executors with only a few omissions , - those chiefly in the last of the three memoirs , - and with a few additional documents which had been preserved by him to be published at their discretion . The whole collection is a valuable contribution to recent history , and we shall have occasion to refer to it repeatedly . The four large and closely printed volumes of Sir Robert 's Speeches furnish a remarkable proof of the extent and variety of his Parliamentary services . They cover a period of more than forty years , from January , 1810 , to June , 1830 , and relate to nearly every important question which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He vas always a skilful debater , a prudent and well-informed leader , a close reasoner , and an impressive speaker ; and in many of his speeches we recall passages of lofty eloquence . Yet it is rather for their remarkable adaptation to the time and circumstances in which they were delivered , than for their brilliancy or their luminous exposition of general principles , that these speeches will be read . In other words , Sir Robert Peel was a practical , rather than a theoretical , statesman . Content with persuading or overruling his audience , he always spent his strength on the matter actually in hand . The elder Sir Robert Peel was a respectable Tory in Lancashire , where he rose to wealth and influence by his successful prosecution of the business of cotton-spinning . At the age of forty he entered Parliament as member for the borough of Tamworth , and in 1801 he was knighted . In Parliament he was a sturdy supporter of the ministerial measures* and in the country he upheld the same cause by his money , and in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the cause which he had espoused . He was a man of strong , clear sense , and much energy , but with the limited views and thoroughly aristocratic opinions which were generally held by the Tories fifty years ago . Entering Parliament when the French Revolution was just beginning to alarm the higher classes in England , he naturally adopted the political dogmas current among those with whom he // 445 associated , and he held them with great tenacity through life . He died at Drayton Manor , in 1830 , at the advanced age of eighty years . His more famous son was born at Bury , on the 5th of February , 1788 . The boy was early instructed in the principles of his father , with a view to fitting him for public life ; and we are told , that , when he was a mere child , his father was in the habit of placing him upon a table to repeat the sermon which he had just heard from some High-Churchman fresh from the banks of the Isis . To his father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind from which he never wholly recovered , and which Sydney Smith once pleasantly referred to travelling in dangerous company . " Mr Peel and his chaplain , " said the great wit , in 1826 , " have been travelling together , and some of the parson 's notions have been put up in Mr. Peel 's head by mistake . " When he was old enough to leave the paternal roof , he was sent to the great public school at Harrow , where he distinguished himself by his progress in solid learning , and his faithful use of all the advantages which such a school offers to an ambitious and pains-taking youth . Lord Byron , who sat in the same form with him , bore testimony to his youthful integrity and his devotion to his studies , and declared that there were always great hopes of him among both masters and scholars . At the age of sixteen he entered Christ Church College , Oxford , as a gentleman commoner* and in 1808 he took his degree of Bachelor of Arts with the highest honors , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double distinction which no one had ever before achieved . In 1809 , when he was only twenty-one years of age , he entered Parliament as member for Cashel , in the county of Tipperary , Ireland . Like the elder and the younger Pitt , Burke , Fox , Canning , and Brougham , he owed his entrance into public life to that close-borough system which was happily overthrown by the Reform Bill of 1832 ; and his first constituency numbered only *twelve persons . Though Fox , Burke , and Pitt were dead , and Grey had been called to the Upper House two years before , young Peel found on the future theatre of his fame many eminent men to kindle his // ambition , and to set before him models of Parliamentary eloquence . Grattan was there , as were Canning , Brougham , Palmerston , and Castlereagh . Nor must we forget such men as Windham , Tierney , Sir Samuel Romilly , Wilberforce , and Spencer Perceval , the head of the government and leader of the House of Commons . If the future statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to excite him to the use of all his powers , he was scarcely less so in regard to the time of entering Parliament . His party was in power , and with the prospect of a long continuance in office . Yet the position of the Tories was by no means such as to leave the supporters of the government idle . They were waging war upon the Continent with a powerful enemy ; the Waleheren expedition had miserably failed , and was to be defended in Parliament ; and the relations of Great Britain with this country were in an embittered and dangerous state . At home there was a strong opposition , particularly in the city of London , which was soon after greatly exasperated by the imprisonment of Sir Francis Burdett ; and already the king was again showing indications of the approach of that malady from which he never afterwards recovered . In Ireland , 0 ' Connell was agitating for Catholic Emancipation , and talking about a repeal of the Union . Everywhere the fruits of that great struggle which had drawn so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of the public mind , kept from frequent outbreaks only by the strong arm of government . Upon entering Parliament , Peel did not push himself forward by frequent and elaborate orations . His first remarks were merely brief statements , or explanations of questions about which he could furnish the House some information . His first set speech was delivered at the opening of Parliament in January , 1810 , on seconding the address . This was followed , the next year , by a defence of the Duke of Wellington as to the policy pursued by him in the Peninsular war . Though these speeches are in no way remarkable , they found favor in the eyes of Tories like Lord Eldon and Mr. Perceval , to whose principles the new aspirant for political fame was then entirely committed . He was appointed Under Sccretary // for the Colonies , and was regarded as likely to succeed to the leadership of the High Church and Tory party , whose cause he had unmistakably espoused . Nor were his prospects of speedy and rapid advancement diminished by the reconstruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1812 . Lord Liverpool , the new prime minister , was always anxious to strengthen his party by attaching to it the rising young men in the House of Commons , and soon after his accession he appointed Peel Chief Secretary for Ireland . This office he held for six years , during a period when Irish affairs engaged much of the attention of Parliament , and afforded frequent opportunities for attacks upon the ministry . Every speech which Peel delivered during this period , with only two or three unimportant exceptions , relates to some Irish question , or is in opposition to the claims of the Roman Catholics . Thus early and constantly were his opposition to Catholic Emancipation , and his attention to the details of his official duties , exhibited . The principles avowed in these debates were greatly modified in subsequent years ; but his business habits he retained through life . Whilst he held the Irish Secretaryship , and in consequence of the stringency of the measures he advocated , he was constantly pursued with all that bitterness of invective , vituperation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stung by the sarcasms levelled at him by O'Connell , he lost that calm and imperturbable temper which a statesman ought to preserve when assailed by personal obloquy , and challenged the Agitator . The circumstances became known , and O'Connell was arrested and bound over to keep the peace towards all his Majesty 's subjects in Ireland . The affair , however , did not end here . Peel and his second went over to England , and then proceeded to the Continent to arrange a hostile meeting beyond the British dominions . O'Connell followed them to London , where he was again arrested , and was brought before Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough , who placed him under new bonds . The duel was thus happily prevented . But from this period dates that bitter personal enmity , far more rancorous than mere party animosity , with which O'Connell regarded Peel // through the rest of his life . From that time he was a th*irn in the side of the English statesman ; and under his influence Ireland was always the chief difficulty with which Peel had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Macaulay , in the great debate in 1840 , upon a motion of want of confidence in the Melbourne ministry , " that if , with the best and purest intentions , the right honorable baronet were to undertake the government of this country , he would find that it was very easy to lose the confidence of the party which raised him to power , but very difficult to gain that which the present government happily possesses , - the confidence of the people of Ireland . " The remark was as true as it was severe . Peel never possessed the confidence of Ireland . In 1818 he resigned the Irish Secretaryship ; but he did not withdraw his attention from public affairs because he was relieved from official duties . He was still busy and energetic ; and he was soon appointed to the important post of Chairman of the Bullion Committee , which had been raised on motion of the government to inquire into the state of the Bank of England . Great care had been taken in the formation of the committee to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the House of Commons , it was declared in debate that fourteen were supporters of the existing government . Probably as large a proportion entered upon the inquiry with opinions upon the general subject similar to those which Mr. Peel admitted that he then held , and opposed to those which he afterwards embodied in his famous Report . The result of his thorough investigation of the subject was an entire and radical change of his views in regard to it . Upon the general question of the resumption of specie payments there was great unanimity in Parliament and throughout the country . But in reference to the time and manner in which this object should be effected , there was a great divergence of opinion . By many persons , particularly the merchants of Bristol and London and the Bank Directors , an immediate resumption was strongly deprecated . On the other hand , the political economists generally favored such a course . Early in April a preliminary Report was presented , // authorizing a continuance of the Bank Restriction Act for a limtt*d period . In the mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early resumption . Though he did not originate the government plan , it was understood that he arranged its details and drew up the Report recommending it . This Report was finally adopted in committee , and was presented to Parliament on the 24th of May . On the evening of that day the elder Peel rose in his place to present a remonstrance against the proposed measure from the London merchants . " To-night , " he said , " I shall have to oppose a very near and dear relation . " And he went on to speak of his regard for the memory of Mr. Pitt , adding : " I well remember , when the near and dear relation to whom I have alluded was a child , I observed to some friends , that the man who discharged his duty to his country in the manner in which Mr. Pitt had was most to be admired , and most to be imitated ; and I thought at that moment , if my own life and that of my dear relation were spared , I would one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same path . " It must , indeed , have been a grievous disappointment to the old man , when the son , upon whose political orthodoxy he had set his fondest hopes , thus fell away from the financial policy of the guide , philosopher , and friend , whose praises , as " the heaven-born Chancellor of the Exchequer , " the Tories had so often shouted forth at the Carlton Club . But Mr. Peel was always ready to forsake the traditional policy of his party , whenever in his judgment the exigencies of the country demanded such a course . The time he thought had now come for a change , and he met the issue with a modest firmness which challenges our respect and admiration . " Many difficulties , " lie said , " have presented themselves to me in discussing this question . Among them is one which it pains me to observe ; and that is the necessity I feel of opposing myself to an authority to which I have always bowed , and I hope always shall bow with deference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and from that duty I may not shrink , whatever may be my private feelings . " This speech , by far the ablest that Peel had yet delivered , // exerted a great influence , and at the close of the debate the resolutions introduced by him were carried without a division . The wisdom of the course adopted in the settlement of this question has often been impugned ; and Peel was repeatedly assailed for the part which he took in it . But Without entering upon a discussion that would carry us far beyond the proper limits of this article , it is sufficient for our present purpose to say , that every candid person who carefully examines the subject must acquit Peel from the charge of acting from interested motives . For the next two or three years he took a much less active part in public affairs than at any other period of his life . In 1820 he did not speak once in Parliament . In June of that year he was married . His wife was a daughter of General Floyd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great part of this period of comparative inactivity in Peel 's life , the public mind was kept in a disturbed and harassed state by a series of memorable events , showing the temper of the men who then ruled England . In the summer of 1819 occurred the great reform meeting at Manchester , and the dispersion of the reformers by the magistrates under circumstances of cruelty and bloodshed which gave to it the name of the Battle of Peterloo , or the Manchester Massacre . Then came the death of George III . in January , 1820 , followed in a few months by the ridiculous farce of the Cato Street Conspiracy , and all the disgusting details of the queen 's trial . From any immediate connection with the measures adopted by the ministers as these various questions came up , Peel was relieved , happily , indeed , for his own reputation . But in February , 1821 , he spoke in the House of Commons in opposition to the Marquis of Tavistock 's motion in censure of the course pursued by the ministers in the proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministerial policy upon this and the other questions of the day , was likewise shown by his being selected to succeed Lord Sidmouth as Secretary of the Home Department , upon the retirement of that venerable nobleman in 1822 , and by his adoption of a similar policy in his own early measures as Secretary . // 451 SIR ROBERT PEEL . This office he held for five years , until the disruption of the Lixerpool Cabinet in 1827 . No measure of much historical importance marked the course of his administration . As a member of the government , he constantly opposed the Catholic claims , and was regarded as one of the leaders of the ultra-Protestant party . He was also thought to look with but little favor upon the more liberal diplomatic and commercial policy of Canning and Huskisson . Indeed , when Lord Sidmouth resigned , there had been a strong feeling in favor of the appointment of Canning as his successor , from a widely difihsed belief that the opinions of that great statesman were more liberal than those of his rival . But Canning lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with the queen ; and it was not until the suicide of the Marquis of Londonderry , some months later , that the ministry was reinforced by the accession of his splendid talents . A few months afterward Mr. Huskisson was appointed to the Presidency of the Board of Trade ; and it soon became apparent that a new order of things had begun , extending even to the Home Department . Mr. Canning 's foreign policy was based on entirely different principles from that of his predecessor , and marked the commencement of a new era in English politics . Thus matters went on until the illness of Lord Liverpool rendered a reconstruction of the Cabinet imperatively necessary . Then all the secret jealousies which had weakened the ministry appeared ; and it became necessary to settle definitely questions which had long remained open . Canning and Peel had acted together under Lord Liverpool ; but neither was willing to see the other raised to the premiership , and the choice virtually lay between them . This circumstance rendered it necessary to form a cabinet which should be either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Placed in this position , the king , after much hesitation , yielded to the necessity of the case , and appointed Canning First Lord of the Treasury . Eldon , Peel , Wellington , Melville , and the other anti-Catholic members , at once resigned . These resignations were communicated under circumstances which gave to them all the appearance of a factious combination to harass the new // minister , though it was afterwards denied that there had been any concerted action among the members who retired . The new ministry was composed chiefly of the political friends of Mr. Canning ; but it was cordially supported by the great body of the Whigs . Mr. Canning united in his own person the offices of First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer , in order that the financial measures of the government might be more efficiently carried out in conjunction with his friend , Mr. Huskisson , who retained the Presidency of the Board of Trade . Sir John Copley , created Lord Lyndhurst , succeeded Lord Eldon as Lord High Chancellor . Mr. Robinson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also raised to the Upper House under the title of Viscount Goderich , and was intrusted with the seals of the Colonial Department . Lord Dudley succeeded Mr. Canning as Secretary for Foreign Affairs ; and Mr. Sturges Bourne took Peel 's old place as Home Secretary . Lord Palinerston was Secretary at War . The ministry thus embodied within itself much available talent . But it was subjected to fiercer assaults than any ministry which had held office for many years . In Parliament it was attacked by the retiring ministers and their immediate supporters , - particularly by Mr. George Dawson , a relative of Mr. Peel . Peel also spoke in explanation of his resignation , and placed his withdrawal from office distinctly upon the ground that he could not act under any minister who was favorable to the Catholic claims , and to these Canning was strongly committed . " For a space of eighteen years , " he said , on the 1st of May , 1827 , " I have pursued one undeviating course of conduct , offering during the whole of that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as I believe , a constitutional resistance to the making of any further concessions to the Roman Catholics . During fourteen out of those eighteen yearslhaveheldoffice ; and during eleven of those fourteen years I have been closely connected in office with that country most interested in the decision of those claims . The opinions which I held during that time I still retain . " Two days later he made a more direct attack upon the ministry , in reply to a brilliant and sarcastic speech by Mr. // Brougham in its defence . Out of Parliament the ministry was assailed with the most vindictive fury by all the hack writers in the interest of the new opposition . But the stoutest blow was struck in the House of Lords by Earl Grey , the most eminent of the friends and followers of Mr. Fox , and an orator who recalled the memory of those days when Parliament was adorned by the matchless eloquence of Pitt , Fox , and Sheridan . Having opposed Canning through his whole life , and still retaining a bitter recollection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord was not ready to give his confidence to the new ministry , and he attacked the premier in a speech not less remarkable for its brilliancy and power , than for its extreme bitterness . Worn out by these incessant attacks , Canning withdrew at the close of the session to the villa of the Duke of Devonshire at Chiswick , to seek the needed rest and relaxation . But his battle was over ; and he rapidly sank under the weight of disease . He died on the morning of the 8th of August , 1827 , in the very room which Fox had occupied when he too sought rest for his weary body in the same beautiful spot , twenty-one years before . In calmly surveying the history of Mr. Canning 's ministry , and of the events immediately preceding his death , the conviction must be forced upon every unprejudiced mind , that all the rules of honorable party warfare were violated in the attacks made upon him . We may not indeed be quite willing to agree with Lady Canning 's opinion , when she wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's murderers , " because he had accepted office in the Wellington ministry with Mr. Peel , nor with Lord George Bentiuck , when he exclaimed , in one of his fierce diatribes against Peel , twenty years later , " They hounded my illustrious relative to death . " Still it must be admitted that Canning 's administration was not allowed a fair trial , that he was assailed with a malignity which nothing could justify , and that his death was hastened by the anxiety and hard and constant toil occasioned by these attacks . And to this censure it is impossible not to consider Peel as in some degree amenable . It is true that his own language was dignified 39 * // and decorous ; but certainly it was incumbent on him as a party leader to repress the asperity of his followers . Though he did not himself indulge in the low personalities which were levelled at Canning , he suffered his kinsman , Mr. Pawson , to lead on the attack . Upon the death of Canning it becarpe necessary to reconstruct the ministry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was raised to the premiership . But he was utterly incompetent to the task which he had undertaken ; and alarmed by the threatening aspect of public affairs , he eagerly availed himself of the plea of ill health to resign before the close of the year . The Cabinet at once fell to pieces from its own weakness . The Duke of Wellington , who had declared in the House of Lords , a few months earlier , that he should be mad to think of assuming the duties of head of the Treasury Department , was intrusted with the charge of forming a new administration . This trust he readily accepted ; and five of the Canningites consented to take office under him , - Lords Lyndhurst , Dudley , and Palmerston , Mr. Huskisson , and Mr. Charles Grant . The first three retained the offices which they had held under Mr. Canning ; Mr. Huskisson was appointed Colonial Secretary ; and Mr. Grant , President of the Board of Trade . Mr. Peel was once more placed at the head of the Home Department , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Chancellor of the Exchequer ; Lord Bathurst returned to office again as President of the Council , - a position which it is said that Lord Eldon was not unwilling to accept if offered ; Lord Ellenborough , one of the most brilliant orators in his party , was Lord Privy Seal , an office which he subsequently exchanged for the Presidency of the Board of Control . The ministry thus embodied nearly the same elements that had composed the Liverpool administration at the time of its downfall ; and its accession to power was hailed with delight by the Tories . But , alas for the vanity of human wishes and human expectations ! the Tories were soon to find that their own leaders were more dangerous persons than even their political enemies . In the communication which the king made to the Duke // of Wellington relative to the formation of a new administration , his Majesty had said , that " he thought the government must be composed of persons of both opinions with respect to the Roman Catholic question ; that he approved of all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection to anybody excepting to Lord Grey . " With this view Mr. Peel entirely concurred ; for it was clear to his prudent and sagacious mind , that upon no other basis could a strong government be constituted . " What , " he wrote to his friend , Mr. Gregory , in a letter marked most private , " must have been the inevitable fate of a government composed of Goulburn , Sir John Beckett , Wetherell , and myself ? Supported by very warm friends , no doubt , but those warm friends being prosperous country gentlemen , fox-hunters , &amp;c. , &amp;c. , most excellent men , who will attend one night , but who will not leave their favorite pursuits to sit up till two or three o'clock fighting questions of detail , on which , however , a government must have a majority , we could not have stood creditably a fortnight . " The administration which was thus formed was strong in itself , and strong in the confidence of the nation . But it also possessed elements of weakness which became apparent even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows a difference of opinion among its members upon important questions , however powerful it may be at first , is sure to become feeble . Men of fixed opinions and rooted principles upon the one side , and upon the other men of no opinions and no principles , can not long act together in harmony . This was the difficulty in the present case . The ministers were men of liberal tendencies , watchful of the signs of the future . The men who supported them by their votes in Parliament and by their votes at the hustings were bigots and fanatics , swayed only by hereditary feelings and prejudices . Consequently the government , which was universally admitted to be very strong when it took office , found itself at the end of two years so weak as to be contemptible ; and such must always be the issue of similar endeavors to construct an administration or a party . There must be harmony of opinion upon every important subject , or the attempt will inevitably fail . // The ministry had been in office but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lord John Russell for a repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts , which was carried by a majority of forty-four , " although , " as Peel admits , " it was opposed with all the influence and authority of the government . " Perceiving all the embarrassments which must ensue from this defeat , and yet unwilling to resign , the ministers , at the suggestion of Mr. Peel , and after consultation with some of the most influential prelates of the Church of England , determined to make a virtue of necessity , and to take up the repeal as a government measure . With this new support , and with some amendments proposed by Mr. Sturges Bourne , in accordance with the arrangements between the government and the Bishops , the bill was carried triumphantly through the Lower House , and also passed the House of Lords , in spite of the unwearied opposition of Lord Eldon . Though the bill , as it finally passed , is open to criticism in some of its parts , its passage was an important point gained for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the removal of the Catholic disabilities . Following soon upon this defeat came Sir Francis Burdett 's celebrated motion , " that it is expedient to consider the state of the laws affecting his Majesty 's Roman Catholic subjects in Great Britain and Jreland , * ' with a view to their final and conciliatory adjustment . The debate lasted for three evenings , and engaged nearly all the principal speakers upon both sides . Among those who spoke in favor of the motion were Sir F. Burdett , Sir James Mackintosh , Mr. Lamb , Mr. Grant , Mr. Huskisson , and Mr. Brougham . Among the opponents were Sir Charles Wetherell , Sir R. H. Inglis , and Mr. Peel , the last of whom delivered an elaborate speech upon the subject , closing with the declaration , that " he had always been the steady and consistent opponent of the measure , but not without deeply considering it . Retaining his opinions , he should sit down as he had begun , with stating , notwithstanding the high authorities which were cited in opposition to him , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Parliament , it was not just nor expedient that the Roman Catholics and the Protestants of Ireland should stand , in // respect of civil offices , on precisely the same footing . " Upon a division , there was a majority of six in favor of the motion . In the Upper House the consideration of the subject was postponed until the 9th of June , when the motion was negatived . In the mean time two circumstances occurred , which largely contributed to determine the subsequent course of the ministry upon this question . A week after the debate in the House of Commons Mr. Huskisson resigned , or was dismissed ; and his withdrawal was followed by the resignation of all the Canningites . The circumstances of the case were peculiar , and deserve a passing notice . Upon a motion to disfranchise the corrupt borough of East Retford , and to transfer its franchise to Birmingham , which was opposed by Mr. Peel , Mr. Huskisson had taken ground against his colleagues and voted with the advocates of Parliamentary reform . Alarmed at the probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , he went home from the House at two in the morning , and wrote a private and confidential letter to the Duke of Wellington . The language of this letter is ambiguous ; though it is certain that Mr. Huskisson only intended to make the tender of a resignation , and not to present a formal resignation . But the premier , who was glad of the opportunity to get rid of Mr. Huskisson , chose to put the least favorable interpretation upon the letter , and no explanations or intercessions would satisfy him that it was incorrect . Accordingly Mr. Huskisson went out of office , with all his liberal colleagues . Their resignations rendered some changes in the ministry necessary ; and among the new members introduced was Mr. Vesey Fitzgerald , member for the county of Clare , and one of the most popular Tories in the Irish representation . But when he sought a re-election he was opposed by Mr. O'Connell , and was defeated after a bitter and protracted contest . The election of Mr. O'Connell caused an immense excitement throughout the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From that moment Catholic emancipation became a necessity . Even before these occurrences had increased the difficulties of his position , Mr. Peel had begun to receive the most // alarming intelligence from Ireland , showing how widely diffused was the discontent of the lower classes of the community , and suggesting a doubt whether the troops could be relied on in the event of an outbreak . Acting upon this information , and convinced that some concessions must be made , he advised the Duke of Wellington and his colleagues in the Upper House not to commit themselves too strongly against the Catholic claims . This advice they very wisely followed ; and though they spoke and voted against the Marquis of Lansdowne 's motion that the Lords should concur in the resolution passed by the Commons , their language was so guarded , that it was at once inferred they did not intend to close the door to the further discussion of the subject . " I have collected encouragement , " said Lord Lansdowne , in his closing speech , " from that most important admission from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of a great difficulty existing , and out of which he at present saw no outlet . This admission has been confirmed by the noble Duke , so that it will not now be denied that the Catholic question has reduced this country to a state of great difficulty . " And he added : " This statement having been made by two noblemen so high in the confidence of the sovereign , it almost necessarily follows that it is accompanied with their intention of looking at this question with a view to its final arrangement . " As the summer advanced , the threatening aspect of affairs continued to increase . Frequent communications passed between the Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary for Ireland and Mr. Peel , and between the Duke of Wellington and Mr. Peel ; and on the 11th of August the latter wrote to the prime minister , expressing the opinion that it would not conduce to the satisfactory adjustment of the question , if any measure for that purpose should be brought forward by him , and tendering his resignation . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hazard of any sacrifice , to maintain the opinion which I now deliberately give , - that there is upon the whole less of evil in making a decided effort to settle the Catholic question , than in leaving it , as it has been left , an open question , - the government being undecided in respect to it , and paralyzed in consequence of that // indecision upon many occasions peculiarly requiring promptitude of action . " But the year closed without any decision in regard to the course to be pursued upon the opening of Parliament ; and on the 12th of January , 1829 , Mr. Peel wrote to the Duke of Wellington , reiterating the opinion , that he could lend a more efficient aid in the settlement of the question by resigning than by continuing in office . Accompanying this letter was a memorandum covering his views upon the subject , which he desired should be shown to the king . Five days afterwards the premier replied , entreating him not to press his resignation , but to endeavor to obtain the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation of Ireland . This determination was immediately announced in a Cabinet meeting ; and on the day after Mr. Peel 's paper was submitted to the king , each of the six members of the government who had uniformly opposed Catholic emancipation had a separate interview with his Majesty , and expressed similar views with those embodied in the memorandum already submitted . In the end , the king 's consent to the consideration of the subject was obtained ; and a paragraph was inserted in the speech at the opening of the session of 1829 , recommending that Parliament should take into " deliberate consideration the whole condition of Ireland , " and that they " should review the laws which impose civil disabilities on his Majesty 's Roman Catholic subjects . " The first difficulty in the way of an adjustment of the question was thus removed . But there were other and unforeseen obstacles to be encountered before the measure could be carried to a triumphant issue . Upon the day before the king 's speech was delivered , Mr. Peel intimated his intention to vacate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oxford , from a belief that the course which he was about to take was not in accordance with the views of his constituents . By the request of his friends in the University , however , he consented to stand for a re-election . But he was defeated by a large majority , and the candidate of the anti-Catholics , Sir R. H. Inglis , was chosen after an angry struggle . He narrowly escaped a simi // lar defeat at Westbury , where a few hours ' delay would have given the election to his opponent . In the mean time a new and formidable difficulty arose , from an unexpected quarter , threatening to put an end to all attempts at concession . Two days before the time appointed for the introduction of the ministerial measure into the House of Commons , the king summoned the Duke of Wellington , Lord Lyndhurst , and Mr. Peel , to wait on him at an early hour the next morning . In this interview his Majesty asked for a complete and detailed explanation of the manner in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To a part of the plan as unfolded to him he strongly objected , declaring that " he could not possibly consent to any alteration of the ancient oath of supremacy , " and that , as his sanction to their proceedings had been given under a misapprehension in regard to an important particular , he had no alternative but to retract his consent . After a short interval he added : " But after this explanation of my feelings , what course do you propose to take as my ministers ? " Each of them respectfully tendered his resignation , which was accepted ; and after five hours of unintermitted conversation the interview ended . At a late hour in the evening of the same day , however , the king wrote to the Duke of Wellington , informing him that he anticipated so much difficulty in the formation of a new ministry , that he desired the ministers to withdraw their resignations , at the same time giving them liberty to proceed with their proposed measures . It was in view of this remarkable episode , as Sir Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed the peculiar phraseology with which he opened his speech in Parliament the next evening . " I rise as a minister of the king , " he said , " and sustained by the just authority which belongs to that character , to vindicate the advice given to his Majesty by a united Cabinet , to insert in his gracious speech the recommendation which has just been read respecting the propriety of taking into consideration the condition of Ireland , and the removal of the civil disabilities affecting our Roman Catholic fellow-subjects. " * // His speech upon this occasion occupied four hours in the delivery , and was an able and lucid exposition of his views upon the whole subject of the Catholic Disabilities . After stating that he had for years attempted to maintain the exclusion of the Catholics from Parliament and from all high offices in the government ; that he did not think it was an unnatural or unreasonable struggle ; that he resigned it from a conviction that it could be no longer advantageously maintained ; and that he yielded to a moral necessity which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the evils which had resulted from allowing this subject to be an open question in the ministry , maintaining that this principle of a neutral government must be abandoned ; and that , in the existing state of parties and of public opinion , it would be impossible to form a united government on the basis of permanent and unqualified resistance to concession , with any prospect that such a government could hold its ground and administer the affairs of Ireland with satisfaction and success . He then explained at great length the details of the proposed measure of relief , answered some of the objections which might be brought against it , and concluded by moving that the House should resolve itself into a committee to consider the laws imposing civil disabilities on his Majesty 's Roman Catholic subjects . The motion was strenuously opposed , but was finally adopted by a majority of one hundred and eighty-eight . Every step in the progress of the bill was resisted with the utmost strenuousness by the High-Church party , headed by *ir R. H. Inglis , Sir Charles Wetherell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of Peel , and , as if the English language were not rich enough in vituperative epiwhich differs in some important particulars from the account given by Lord Eldon on the authority of the king , and printed in Mr. Twiss 's Life of Lord Eldon , and in Lord Campbell 's Lives of the Chancellors . But it is much more probable that the venerable ex-Chancellor misunderstood the king , than that Sir Robert should have misrepresented the facts , - especially as he wrote with Lord Eldon 's memoranda before him . Lord Eldon says there were two interviews . Mr. Peel says there was but one . Lord Eldon says , that after the ministers " threatened to resign , " the king told them to " go on . " Mr. Peel says , that their resignations were accepted , and announced at a meeting of the Cabinet , and that it was late in the evening when they were requested to resume office . // thets , the classics were ransacked to furnish additional insuits ; petitions and remonstrances poured into Parliament from all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stiyred to their lowest depths . But it was all to no purpose . The third reading was carried on the 30th of March by a majority of one hundred and seventy-eight . In the Upper House there was also an active but unsuccessful opposition ; and on the 10th of April the bill finally passed by a majority of one hundred and four . Three days afterwards it was signed by the king ; and thus this long and bitter struggle was at length terminated . For no part of his public career was Mr. Peel ever more bitterly assailed than he was for his course upon this great question . Nor need we feel surprised that such should have been the case . The change in his policy had been so sudden and thorough , that men could not easily explain it , and were ready therefore to ascribe it to the most disreputable motives , to declare that without justifiable cause he had betrayed the party which had supported him thus far through life , - that he had sacrificed his principles to his fears or his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand acquitted . The course which he now took involved too great a sacrifice of his consistency to have been adopted without much hesitation , and a thorough conviction that it was the only course which he could take . In truth , under the circumstances in which he was placed , no other course could be justified or defended on any tenable ground . The country was in a position of extreme peril . The government of Ireland by coercion had been thoroughly tried , and had miserably failed . There was no other resource left , but to try concession ; and this alternative Mr. Peel boldly met . For this decision he must be held in honor . But there is another part of his conduct which is justly open to animadversion . That he finally relinquished his narrow principles and bigoted notions is creditable to him ; it is not creditable to him that he should so long have resisted the force of argument and of public sentiment . He had clung to the policy of the disabling laws till he was compelled to give it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a voluntary concession . // And that his course was open to this objection he seems to have been aware ; for at the close of his Memoir on the Roman Catholic Question , in speaking of the charges brought against him , he says - " If it had been alleged against me that the sudden adoption of a different policy had proved the want of early sagacity and foresight on my part , - if the charge had been , that I had adhered with too much pertinacity to a hopeless cause , - that I had permitted for too long a period the engagements of party or undue deference to the wishes of constituents to outweigh the accumulating evidence of an approaching necessity , - if this had been the accusation against me , I might find it more difficult to give it a complete and decisive refutation . " The passage of the Catholic Relief Bill had opened a dangerous schism in the ranks of the Tory party , and had greatly weakened the ministry . But they were to encounter other difficulties scarcely less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England commercial distress everywhere prevailed ; and no sooner had Catholic emancipation been carried , than new life was infused into the demand for Parliamentary reform . Added to all these causes of weakness , the death of George IV. , in June , 183Q , was another blow upon the Wellington ministry . But a declaration of the new king , William IV. , that he did not intend to make an immediate change in the government , relieved them from any present feeling of insecurity . A month later , however , all England was thrown into a new excitement by the overthrow of the government of Charles X. of France , and the elevation of the Duke of Orleans to the throne . In a few days the general election took place for the first Parliament of the new reign , and resulted disastrously for the ministry . No cabinet minister , it was said , obtained a seat in any open and popular election ; and many of the Tory members who were chosen were hostile to the existing government . Another , and not the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election of Mr. Brougham as one of the members for the great county of Yorkshire , after an explicit declaration of his intention to bring forward a motion for a reform of Parliament . Every man in public life saw that agitation for Parliamentary reform would succeed that for Catholic emancipation . // It was while the country was in this feverish and excited state that the new Parliament met , and the Duke of Wellington made that memorable declaration in the House of Lords which sealed the fate of his ministry , and inaugurated a new era in the history of English politics . " I am fully convinced , " he said in the debate upon the address , " that the country possesses a legislature which answers all the good purposes of legislation , and this to a greater degree than any legislature ever has done in any country whatever . I will go further , and say that the legislature and the system of representation possess , and deservedly possess , the full and entire confidence of the country . " And , as if this language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reply to Earl Grey : " Under these circumstances , I am not prepared to bring forward any measures of the description alluded to by the noble Lord . And I am not only not prepared to bring forward any measure of this nature , but I will at once declare that , as far as I am concerned , as long as I hold any station in the government of the country , I shall always feel it my duty to resist such measures when proposed by others . " Nothing could have been more untimely than this uncompromising language , at a moment when the French and Belgian Revolutions were perceptibly weakening the power of the ministers , and the advocates of reform felt strong enough to attempt to free the representative system from some of the anomalies by which it was disfigured . It aroused a feeling of indignation throughout the country , which was still further exasperated by another indiscreet step of the ministry a few days later . The king , the queen , and the ministers had accepted an invitation to dine with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week after the opening of Parliament . Suddenly it was announced that his Majesty would not visit the city , and that the banquet was postponed ; and it was stated , in explanation of this change of purpose , that the ministry had received information that the king would be insulted , and the prime minister 's life would be endangered , if they attended the proposed dinner . Doubtless the fears were wholly unfounded ; but the Duke had been hooted through Piccadilly , and he thought it prudent to protect // his residence by iron window-shutters . Consols fell rapidly as the panic increased ; and for a time the public seemed as much alarmed as if the cry of an invasion by the French had sounded in their ears . They had scarcely recovered from their alarm , when the ministry was defeated in the House of Commons by a majority of twenty-nine votes , on a motion for a committee to examine the accounts connected with the civil list . The next evening , just a fortnight from the commencement of the session , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Peel by the death of his father , announced in the two Houses that their resignations had been accepted , and that they held office only until their successors were appointed . Earl Grey was immediately invited to form an administration , which he agreed to do upon condition that Parliamentary reform should be made a Cabinet measure . The condition was accepted ; and this eminent statesman , who had been excluded from office through so many years on account of his unalterable devotion to liberal principles , at length became the head of an administration formed to carry forward the work which he had so much at heart . He had stood by the side of Burke , Fox , and Sheridan , at the impeachment of Warren Hastings ; he had kept his integrity unblemished through forty years of Parliamentary life ; he had been found faithful among the faithless ; and now he was in a position to do what even the great men at whose feet he had learned his first lessons in statesmanship had failed to accomplish . The men whom he called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their zeal in the cause which they had espoused . Lord Althorp , a man of pure and lofty character , and possessing in large measure the confidence of his party and the country , was Chancellor of the Exchequer , and leader of the House of Commons . Mr. Brougham was raised to the Woolsack , and brought to the support of the ministry indefatigable energy , great oratorical powers , and an unrivalled versatility of talent . The Marquis of Lansdowne was made President of the Council , and Lord Durham , the son-in-law of the premier , was Lord Privy Seal . Four of the Canningites also held office , Lord Palmerston as 40 // Foreign Secretary , Lord Melbourne ( Mr. Lamb ) as Home Secretary , Lord Goderich as Colonial Secretary , and Mr. Charles Grant as President of the Board of Control . Sir James Graham , afterwards one of Peel 's most intimate friends and chief supporters , was at the head of the Admiralty . In subordinate stations were Mr. Stanley , better known as the Earl of Derby , and Lord John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the government measure , - a duty which it must be admitted that he discharged with consummate ability . On the 1st of March , 1831 , he brought forward the proposed plan , in a speech of remarkable clearness and force . The measure was at once violently opposed by the members of the late government and their adherents . The debate lasted seven nights , and between seventy and eighty members spoke . On the third night Sir Robert Peel delivered an able and ingenious speech against the contemplated reform , basing his objections , however , on the details of the measure , rather than on the principle on which it was founded . The first reading was carried without a division , notwithstanding the violent opposition which had been made to the bill . But on the second reading the battle was renewed with even greater ardor , and it was carried only by a majority of one , in the largest House which was ever known to have divided upon any question . After so narrow an escape from defeat , it was universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to do , and went on with the bill . On the 19th of April they were left in a minority of eight upon a motion of General Gascoyne , ably supported by Sir Robert Peel , that the number of representatives for England and Wales ought not to be reduced . Two days later they sustained a second and still more disastrous defeat upon a motion of Lord Althorp , that the House should go into a consideration of the supplies . After this defeat , there was no alternative but for the ministers to resign , or to take the sense of the country . They resolved to adopt the latter course , although it was less than a year since the last general election . The dissolution took place immediately , and amidst the greatest confusion and excitement in both Houses . // In truth , the scenes which occurred on that day , especially in the Upper House , have never been exceeded in disgraceful extravagance by any similar exhibitions of which we have ever read . The result of the elections was a complete ministerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform Bill was introduced . The debate upon the second reading cornmenced on the 4th of July , and lasted for three nights . On . the last evening Sir Robert Peel , in answer to repeated calls , spoke at length against the bill , in a cautious and moderate speech , quite in contrast with the general tone of most of the opponents of reform . Yet he indulged in some personalities in reply to the attacks of Mr. Macaulay , who had spoken with great effect on the preceding night ; and it must be acknowledged that he argued in the spirit of an advocate seeking to gain his cause , rather than as a statesman desirous to promote the welfare of the country . Upon a division , the second reading was carried by a majority of one hundred and thirtysix , in a very full House . A few days later , the House went into committee , and so persistent was the opposition , that the bill did not pass its third reading until the 21st of September . During this long interval the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the most adroit Parliamentary tacticians could devise was tried , in order to protract the debate and defeat the measure . Every borough was contested , even though it was apparent that nothing could be gained by so factious a course . Sir Robert Peel spoke more than forty times upon these petty details , and two or three times at considerable length upon the general principles of the measure . The third reading , however , was carried by a majority of one hundred and nine . The debate in the House of Lords commenced on the 3d of October , and lasted for five nights . It was scarcely less animated and ably conducted than was that in the Lower House ; and the opening speech of Earl Grey was one of the most vigorous and splendid arguments in favor of Parliamentary reform ever delivered . But the Lords were not yet ready to yield , and the bill was thrown out by a majority of forty-one , including every one of the Bishops excepting the // Bishop of Norwich . Undismayed by this result , the ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle in the next session . In order to facilitate this course and give some countenance to it , a vote of confidence in the ministry was passed in the House of Commons ; and on the 20th of October Parliament was prorogued , to meet again in December . In the mean time occurred the Bristol riot , upon occasion of the public entry into that city of the Recorder , Sir Charles Wetherell , one of the most violent and bigoted oppomients of Catholic emancipation and of the Reform Bill . Elsewhere also there were riots and disturbances , which justified the fears of those who thought that nothing but the passage of the bill could save the country from civil war . On the 12th of December , Lord John Russell asked and obtained leave to bring in a third Reform Bill , differing but little from its immediate predecessor . Four days later , the debate on the second reading began , and lasted two nights , on the second of which Sir Robert Peel spoke briefly in opposition to the bill , and in defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a spirited and able attack by Mr. Macaulay . At the close of the debate , the second reading was carried by a majority of one hundred and sixtytwo ; and the further consideration of the subject was postponed until the termination of the recess for the Christmas holidays . On the 20th of January , 1832 , the House went into committee on the bill , where the opposition again managed to protract the discussion for nearly two months ; but in this factious course they were no longer countenanced by Sir Robert Peel , who yielded the doubtful honor to Mr. Croker , a man of great industry , of much experience , of no liberality in his political opinions , except upon the Catholic question , and of an implacable temper . On the last night he spoke once more in opposition to the bill , but less ably than before , and evidently with the feeling of one who knows that he is in a hopeless minority . The third reading was carried by a majority of one hundred and sixteen ; and the battle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate commenced on the 9th of April , and // was continued for five nights . Indeed , it was after seven o'clock on the morning of the 14th when the House adjourned . The second reading had been carried by a majority of nine ; but still the bill had to pass the ordeal of a discussion in committee . Before that struggle began , Parliament adjourned for the Easter recess , and did not meet again until the 7th of May . The Lords went immediately into committee ; and on the first division the ministers were left in a minority of thirty-five . For a moment they hesitated in regard to the step they should next take . But the hesitation was only momentary . They determined to ask the king to create such a number of peers as would secure the passage of the bill . The request was made by Earl Grey and Lord Brougham after a Cabinet meeting , and was refused . Nothing was left for the ministers to do , but to give up the bill or to resign . They resigned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wellington was empowered to form a ministry . But all his negotiations for that purpose failed ; and he was compelled to return his commission to the king . The result was the recall of the Whigs , in connection with some agreement the nature of which has never been divulged . It seems probable , however , that his Majesty undertook to secure the absence of a sufficient number of peers to render the passage of the bill certain , and that , if this endeavor should fail , he agreed to create new peers as requested . The plan was tried , and had the desired effect . A circular letter was addressed to the opponents of the bill , and , in acquiescence with its suggestions , the Duke of Wellington and about one hundred other peers absented themselves from Parliament during the remaining discussions . The bill then passed by a large majority , and on the 7th of June received the royal sanction and became a law . Sir Robert Peel 's opposition to this important measure was characterized by great acuteness of intellect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , rather than by enlarged views and liberal principles . He brought to the discussion a far less candid temper than he exhibited in dealing with the Catholic claims , and though he often spoke with moderation and calmness , it was too // Oct. evident that he sought rather to place obstacles in the way of the ministers than to aid in perfecting a necessary reform . In general his language was dignified ; but occasionally he stooped to acrimonious remarks , particularly in repelling the frequent attacks of Mr. Macaulay , whose brilliant arguments contributed so much to the final success of the bill . It must be admitted that his opposition in committee to the second bill was factious and unworthy of a statesman ; but it is due to his memory to add , that , when he perceived that nothing could be gained by such proceedings , he withdrew from the contest , and , yielding to the unmistakable will of the people , honestly accepted the new order of things . The change which was effected by the passage of the bill was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , and no reform less thorough and sweeping would have satisfied the just demands of the great manufacturing towns and of the people at large . Nor can we doubt that much of the security which England has since enjoyed is owing to the passage of the Reform Bill of 1832 . In the first election under the new system , the Whigs carried a large majority of the House of Commons ; and Sir Robert Peel found himself at the head of a party numbering little more than a hundred members . For the next two years he was the acknowledged leader of the Opposition . The duties which devolved upon him in this capacity he discharged for the most part in a temperate and judicious manner , aiming especially to consolidate a party that should become strong enough in Parliament and in the country to take advantage of any mistake which the Whigs might make . Among the more important measures which engaged the attention of Parliament during this period , and in the discussion of which he took part , were the renewal of the Bank Charter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its branches a legal tender ; the renewal and essential modification of the East India Company 's Charter ; the abolition of slavery in the British West Indies ; the enactment of a new Poor Law , introducing important changes in the previous laws ; the passage of a Factory Bill limiting the number of hours during which children could // be employed in manufacturing establishments ; and several bills designed for the pacification of Ireland . Differences of opinion upon this last-named subject existed in the Cabinet , and contributed to the early overthrow of a ministry which seemed to be so strong , and had accomplished so much to perpetuate its memory . First came the secession of Mr. Stanley and Sir James Graham , in consequence of their objections to a measure affecting the Irish Church . A few weeks later Lord Althorp resigned , on account of his unwillingness to take charge in Parliament of a stringent Coercion Bill which he had condemned in the Cabinet . Feeling that it would be impracticable to carry on the government without the efficient support of which he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and full of honors , and retired from public life , with an imperishable renown as the reward of his long and faithful services . In this emergency , the king , desirous of forming a coalition ministry , requested Lord Melbourne to " communicate with the Duke of Wellington , with Sir Robert Peel , with Mr. Stanley , and with others of their respective parties , as well as with those who have hitherto acted with himself and have otherwise supported the administration , " and " endeavor to bring them together , and to establish a community of purpose . " But it was obviously impossible to carry such a scheme into successful execution . Differences of opinion had broken up the Whig ministry . Even greater differences of opinion separated the statesmen whom it was now proposed to unite . Every one of the new members who were to be introduced into the ministry from the old Tory party had " recently expressed , not only general want of confidence " in the government , " but the strongest objection , founded upon principle , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider " vital and essential . " His Lordship therefore declined to unite in the formation of such a ministry ; and the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel , who acted in concert , were equally unwilling to take office with their political opponents , though they " were resolved , if invited , not to decline the responsibility " of attempting to form a ministry of their own partisans . The // endeavor to form a coalition ministry was therefore given up as impracticable . In consequence of the failure of this notable scheme , Lord Althorp was induced to return to office , and Lord Melbourne became head of the government . But the ministry was not permitted to last long . By the death of his father , which occurred soon after the ministerial crisis , Lord Althorp was called to the Upper House ; and when Lord Melbourne waited upon the king to confer with him in regard to the new arrangements rendered necessary by this event , his Majesty very politely informed him that he had no further occasion for his services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will probably always remain obscure . But it was universally believed at the time that the dismissal of the ministers was owing to the queen 's influence . After reading Sir Robert Peel 's Memoir upon the subject we see no reason to doubt the correctness of the opinion . One thing , however , is certain , that the retiring ministers were very badly treated . Upon applying to the Duke of Wellington to form a new ministry , the king was advised to offer the first place in the government to Sir Robert Peel , who was then travelling in Italy . In the mean time his Grace consented to take the offices of First Lord of the Treasury and Home Secretary , in order to carry on the government until an answer could be received to the message sent to Peel. * Immediately upon the receipt of this message Peel set out upon his return . He arrived in London on the 9th of December ; and on the same day he wrote to Lord Stanley , who had been raised to * By virtue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also exercise the functions of the Foreign and Colonial Secretaries . This monopolizing of the government was stigmatized by the Whigs as unconstitutional , and furnished a subject for much angry comment and many humorous allusions . " The Irish , " said Albany Foublanque in the Examiner , " hold it impossible for a man to be in two places at once , like a bird . ' The Duke has proved this no joke , - he is in five places at once . At last , then , we have a united government . The Cabinet Council sits in the Duke 's head , and the ministers are all of one mind . " To the Countess Grey , Sydney Smith wrote : " It is supposed that the messenger who is gone to fetch Sir Robert Peel will not catch him before he is nt PLcstum ; in the mean time the Duke of Wellington holds all offices , civil , military , and ecclesiastical , and is to be Bishop of Ely ( if Ely dies ) till Peel arrives . " // the peerage by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham , inviting them to take office in the new ministry . The former declined , in a very admirable letter , in which he set forth with much clearness and force the insuperable objections to taking office with those who had so recently been his strenuous political opponents , and whose views upon many points were irreconcilable with his own . " If any beneficial moral effect , " he justly observed , " were produced by my separation from Lord Grey and my former colleagues , and my abandonment of office for the sake of conscience and principle , that effect would be wholly destroyed by my speedy return to office with their political opponents ; the motives of my former conduct would be suspected , whereas now they can not be impugned ; and any reasons which might be urged in vindication of the present junction would be powerless as opposed to the public sentiment , which revolts against all political coalitions , especially when they are made the immediate stepping-stone to power . " Sir James Graham , in a private interview , also declined to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown back entirely upon his old political adherents . He became First Lord of the Treasury ; the Duke of Wellington was made Foreign Secretary ; and Lord Lyndhurst was restored to the Woolsack . Among the most important of their associates were Lord Rosslyn , President of the Council ) Lord Wharncliffe , Lord Privy Seal ; Mr. Goulburn , Home Secretary ; Lord Aberdeen , Colonial Secretary ; Lord Ellenborough , President of the Board of Control ; and Sir Henry Hardinge , Chief Secretary for Ireland . As soon as the ministry was arranged , a dissolution of Parliament took place . The elections resulted unfavorably to the new ministry . They elected only a minority of the House of Commons ; and even one of the members of the Cabinet , Sir George Murray , failed to obtain a seat . Nor were the Whigs , who felt justly indignant at the treatment they had received , disposed to show their successors any unnecessary favors . Upon the very first vote in the House , that upon the choice of a Speaker , the Opposition obtained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a series of defeats , which in six weeks // from the opening of Parliament drove the ministers from office . In the Upper House they were able to carry the Address without amendment . But in the Commons the amendment proposed by Lord Morpeth was adopted by a majority of seven . Upon the 26th of March they sustained another defeat upon a motion that the king be requested to grant a royal charter of incorporation to the University of London . Still the ministers did not resign ; and the contest between the two parties was renewed and kept up with spirit . On the 2d of April they were left in a minority of thirty-three upon a motion of Lord John Russell that the House resolve itself into a committee to consider the Teniporalities of the Irish Church . This defeat was followed by another on the 7th of April , when the House by a majority of twenty-seven adopted a motion , likewise offered by Lord John Russell , that no measure upon the subject of tithes in Ireland could lead to a final and satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of the surplus revenues of the Irish Church to the general education of all classes of Christians . After this defeat it was clear that the ministers could no longer hold office with credit to themselves or advantage to the country ; and the next evening their resignation was announced in Parliament . The ministry had failed ; but it had failed through no fault of the premier . The struggle had been short , but it had been severe ; and it was only when further resistance was impossible , - when the last blow had been struck , - that he retired from the contest . The battle had been waged with great tact and judgment upon both sides ; but the majority against the ministers was far too great to admit of any other result than that which was actually witnessed . After a short delay the Whigs were recalled to power under the premiership of Lord Melbourne , and with some modifications in the arrangement of the principal offices . Lord John Russell was made Home Secretary in place of Lord Duncannon , to whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Gleneig ) was placed at the head of the Colonial Department , and was succeded in the Presidency of the Board of Control by Sir John Cam Hobhouse . Mr. // Spring Rice was made Chancellor of the Exchequer , in place of Lord Althorp . The Great Seal was put into commission , and the next year it was given to Sir Charles Pepys , who was raised to the peerage with the title of Lord Cottenham . The Marquis of Lansdowne , and Lords Palmerston and Holland , resumed their old offices . This ministry , with some alterations by the introduction of new members and the exchange of places , continued in office for more than six years . During the whole of this period , Sir Robert Peel was at the head of the Opposition , which he conducted with great ability and upon the same general principles that he had adopted after the passage of the Reform Bill . But it is aside from our present purpose to trace in detail the history of the stormy debates in which he was engaged as leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to power , the Whigs possessed a sufficient majority to enable them to carry most of their measures , to effect some needed reforms , and in general to conduct the government in a useful and creditable manner . Yet it was evident that their tenure of office was gradually growing weaker , when the death of William IV . in June , 1837 , and the accession of Queen Victoria with all the *clat attending the commencement of a reign , gave them new vigor and popularity . This , however , did not last long ; and in the elections they gained nothing . The Tories at once set about driving them from office . In this attempt they were ultimately successful , though only at the close of a bitter and protracted struggle . The troubles in Canada , the spread of Chartism , the financial difficulties of 1837 and 1838 , the failure of the crops in 1838 , the discontent in the West Indies , - all tended to weaken the ministry ; and their defeat on a motion to go into committee upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resignation of the ministry , the queen sent for the Duke of Wellington , who advised her to place Sir Robert Peel at the head of the new government , as the chief difficulties of her administration would have to be encountered in the House of Commons . But here an insuperable obstacle arose . Sir Robert demanded , as essential to the success of his arrangements , that the principal places in the queen 's household should be // put at his disposal . This her Majesty declined to grant , alleging that the demand was " contrary to usage , " and " repugnant to her feelings " ; and in the refusal she was sustained by her late ministers . In consequence of this diiiculty , Sir Robert Peel declined to undertake the formation of a new government , and the Whigs returned to office , reinforced soon afterwards by the accession to places in the Cabinet , of the Marquis of Normanby , Lord Morpeth , Mr. Macaulay , Mr. Labouchere , and Mr. F. T. Baring . In reviewing the history of this ministerial crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tories were entirely free from blame . The demand of Sir Robert Peel was strictly constitutional and legitimate , but under the circumstances it was harsh and impolitic , and such as he would scarcely have made if he had felt greater confidence in his own strength . On the other hand , the Whigs , in advising the queen not to yield to this demand , certainly recommended a dangerous stretch of her prerogative . The excitement and ill-feeling which were engendered by it , however , gradually died away , and left few , if any , permanent traces. * With the return of the Whigs began one of the most severely contested Parliamentary struggles in the recent history of England . Every opportunity of embarrassing and weakening the ministry was eagerly seized upon and turned to the best advantage by Sir Robert Peel and his party ; and as often as a new attack was made upon them , the ministers , while they skilfully and vigorously defended themselves , took care to damage their opponents by sarcastic references to Sir Robert 's previous inconsistencies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to encounter in the government of Ireland . Upon no occasion , however , was the struggle conducted with more ability or with more determined energy , upon both sides , than in the two debates in Janpary , 1840 , and May , 1841 , upon motions that the ministers did not possess the confidence of the House . In both of these * For some reason Sir Robert Peel 's explanations in the ilonse of Commons , in regard to this ministerial crisis , are omitted in the collection of his Speeches mentioned at the commencement of this article . His remarks , however , are given in Hansard 's Parliamentary Debates , third series , Vol . XLVII . // debates , Sir Robert spoke at great length , and with even more than his accustomed caution and ability . The ministers , however , on the first occasion obtained a majority of twenty-one . But on the second occasion they were left in a minority of one ; and , after consultation , they determined , in view of the defeats which they had already e.xperienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . The result of the elections was far more disastrous for them than could have been anticipated by any one ; and when Parliament met , they were in a decided minority in both Houses . In the division on the amendments to the Address , the Opposition prevailed by a majority of ninety-one . Satisfied by this result that it would be impossible for them to continue the unequal struggle any longer , the ministers resigned , having retained office through many harassing difficulties , and for a greater length of time than any ministry since the death of Lord Liverpool . Sir Robert Peel was once more invited to form an administration , and again resumed office . The circumstances in which he was now placed promised well for his continuance in the ministry , and for his success in carrying the measures which he might bring forward . The Whigs had been completely overthrown , and were in no condition for a speedy resumption of office ; he was at the head of a strong party flushed with recent success ; and the country was disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had many difficulties to contend with ; and the retiring ministers took care that he should be fully aware of the nature and extent of those difficulties , and of the strict responsibility to which they meant to hold him . In the mean time his ministry was wisely constituted , and gave general satisfaction . Lord Aberdeen , an honest and skilful diplomatist , was made Foreign Secretary , and soon proved the wisdom of the choice by the success with which he settled the difficult and delicate questions then open with France and the United States . Mr. Goulburn was made Chancellor of the Exchequer ; but his selection was certainly less fortunate than that of Mr. Gladstone as Vice-President of the Board of Trade , from which place he was subsequently raised to a seat in the 41* // Cabinet . Lord Stanley and Sir James Graham consented to take office as chiefs of the Colonial and Home Departments , and added much strength to the ministry . Lord Lyndhurst was again made Lord Chancellor ; and the Dnke of Wellington was once more in the Cabinet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain time for arranging their measures , and after passing a few necessary bills , they prorogued Parliament until February , 1842 . One step of great importance , however , was taken at the close of the year , from which the best results flowed . This was the appointment of Lord Ashburton as Ambassador Extraordinary to the United States , for the purpose of negotiating a settlement of the boundary line between the State of Maine and the Province of New Brunswick . Early in the next sesf4on , Sir Robert brought forward the ministerial plans . His first measure embraced a revision of the Corn Laws , with the adoption of a moderate sliding scale , and was opposed by the Whigs , who strenuously advocated a fixed duty , and by the Free-Trade party , who demanded a total repeal of the Corn Laws . To both of these plans , the minister avowed his entire opposition ; and , after a prolonged discussion , his plan was adopted and became law . He next took into consideration the deficit in the revenue , which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to between two and three millions of pounds sterling in 1842 . To remedy this growing evil , he proposed the adoption of an Jncome Tax , limited in its operation to three years , which was also carried , but not without a strong resistance . His third financial measure provided for a reduction of the import duties upon many important articles , and their entire repeal in regard to others . This measure was likewise adopted with some amendments ; and the commercial policy of the new ministry might now be considered as fairly before the country for trial , though there were still some of its details to be arranged . A remark of Mr. Huskisson , in 1825 , in proposing a modification of the then existing commercial and colonial policy , which was referred to by Sir Robert Peel in his speech upon bringing forward this third measure , may be cited here , as it furnishes a key to the policy of the latter upon this // whole class of subjects , and also in regard to many other questions . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give effect to new principles where circumstances do not call for their application ; feeling as I do , from no small experience in public business , - and every day confirms that feeling , - how much , in the vast and complex interests of the country , all general theories , however incontrovertible in the abstract , require to be weighed with a calm circumspection , to be directed by a temperate discretion , and to be adapted to all the existing relations of society with a careful hand , and a due regard to the establishments and institutions which have grown up under those relations . " Applying this doctrine of a wise and far-sighted expediency to the measures which Sir Robert Peel brought forward as a minister , we shall readily understand the changes through which he passed in the course of his political career . No other legislative measure , of much importance , was introduced or carried in the remainder of 1842 , or in the following year . But much progress was made in adjusting the numerous disputes with other nations in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close , and in August a treaty of peace and commerce was signed by the British and Chinese Commissioners . In the same month the negotiations between Mr. Webster and Lord Ashburton were brought to a happy termination by the signature of the Treaty of Washington . It is a curious and striking illustration of the blindness of party animosity , that in both countries the negotiators of this treaty should have been assailed with equal virulence . In England , Lord Palmerston called it " the Ashburton Capitulation . " Our party hacks called it " the Webster Capitulation . " Mr. Macaulay thought that the correspondence on the part of Lord Ashburton " had been conducted in such a manner as to lower the character of England , " and that it was pervaded " with a certain humble , caressing , wheedling tone utterly inconsistent with the dignity of the office which Lord Ashburton occupied , " while " the whole tone of the correspondence on the part of the United States was firm , resolute , vigilant , and unyielding . " On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Great Britain to the United States were few in number , small in value , nothing for her to yield , injurious to her to retain , and already as effectually ours without the treaty as with it , " and that " our grants to her were large and valuable , material for her to receive , dangerous and injurious for us to yield , and involving not only territory , but natural boundaries . " But time has silenced all this invidious clamor ; and it is now the universal sentiment of both countries , that this memorable treaty effected a fair and just settlement of the disputed points , that it was honorable to both parties , and a noble monument to the ability and integrity of its negotiators . Some progress was also made during this period towards a restoration of friendly relations with France , which had been interrupted by the expedition against St. Jean d'Acre in 1840 , and by a divergence of interests in regard to some other subjects of international polity . It was in the government of Ireland , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministers existed . No sooner had Sir Robert returned to power , than O'Connell , rankling with the recollections of personal grievances and distrustful of Tory rule , renewed his agitation for the Repeal of the Union . He at once organized the Repeal Association , which soon spread its branches over the greater part of the island , and attained immense power , and he set on foot a series of monster meetings , which were frequently attended by more than a hundred thousand persons , and were addressed with the most inflammatory appeals . Perhaps the most remarkable of these assemblages was . that in August , 1843 , upon the hill of Tara , a spot famous in Irish history and song . There the ancient kings of Ireland had been elected ; there a battle had been fought in the rebellion of 1798 ; and there , if anywhere , the foundations of a new kingdom might be laid . Amidst these historical associations , so well suited to kindle their excitable imaginations , the multitude , variously estimated at from five hundred thousand to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldness by 0 ' Connell . Among other flaming exhortations , he besought them to " die freemen rather than live as slaves , " prophesied that , " before twelve months were over , an Irish Parliament // would sit in College Green , " and announced that within that period " he would himself be free or in his grave . " Worthless as was all this fustian oratory , it yet alarmed and endangered the government , and they determined to put a stop to the monster meetings . An opportunity for doing so soon occurred . Another monster meeting had been appointed to be held on the 8th of October , on the battle-field of Clontarf , where Brian Borouch had crushed the Danes more than eight centuries before , and only three miles from Dublin . Great preparations , much resembling those for a military campaign , had been made , when the Lord Lieutenant , the day before the appointed time , issued a proclamation forbidding the meeting , warning all well-disposed persons to abstain from attending it , and commanding all persons who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressing it . On the 14th , O'Connell , his son , and eight of their principal associates , were arrested on a charge of conspiracy , sedition , and unlawful assembling . From various causes , the trial was postponed until the 15th of January , 1844 , when it began and lasted for twenty-four days , terminating in a verdict of Guilty upon all the counts in the indictment against O'Connell , and upo.n most of the counts in the indictments against his fellowprisoners . Though a majority of the counts in the indictments were subsequently pronounced to be bad and informal by the twelve judges , and the verdict was reversed by the House of Lords sitting as a Court of Appeal , the power of O'Connell was finally broken . Tranquillity was once more restored to Ireland ; and within three years , the great Agitator died , broken in body and mind , whilst on his way to Rome that his last hours might be soothed by the papal benediction . Among the subjects which engaged the attention of Sir Robert in the next two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a just and generous measure , to which he gave an able and cordial support ; the renewal and revision * His speeches on this question are not comprised in the collected edition of his Speeches . But they may be found in Hausard , and in the " Debates on the Dissenters ' Chapels Bill . " // of the Bank Charter ; the renewal of the Income Tax for a further period of three years ; the grant of an additional allowance to the Roman Catholic College at Maynooth ; and the *stablishment of three new academical institutions in Ireland , under the title of the Queen 's Colleges . The relations with France also occupied much of the attention of the government , - particularly the two exciting subjects of the Tahiti question and the Spanish marriages . But by the wisdom and inoderation of Lord Aberdeen and M. Guizot these questions were adjusted , and war between the two countries was averted . A little later , the dispute with the United States about the Oregon boundary rose into importance , and threatened to involve the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus did the government of Sir Robert Peel suppress sedition and restore tranquillity in Ireland , encourage education , protect the rights of conscience , and maintain peace with other countries , overcoming the various difficulties which it had been thought could not be surmounted by them . But a still more formidable and a fatal difficulty was now to be encountered . The season of 1845 had been unusually cold , wet , and stormy , and it became certain that the harvest would be a very small one , and that consequently the prices of grain would rule high . Men were anxiously looking for the result , when a new and unknown disease appeared , spread with fearful rapidity among the unharvested potatoes , and soon extended to those which were gathered . In Ireland , especially , the potato rot prevailed to an alarming extent . All through the autumn , tidings adapted to awaken the most gloomy apprehensions reached the ministry . A scientific commission , which was sent to Ireland to examine into the nature and extent of the evil , failed to effect anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crop could be relied upon as fit for the food of man , and it was even feared that not enough would be saved for seed in the following year . Famine was imminent . As early as the 13th of October , Sir James Graham , the Home Secretary , had begun to consider what the remedy should be . " Could we with propriety , " he wrote to the premier on that day , " remit duties in November by Order in Council , when Parliament might so easily be called together ? // Can these duties , once remitted by act of Parliament , be ever again re-imposed ? Ought they to be maintained with their present stringency , if the people of Ireland be reduced to the last extremity for want of food ? " Sir Robert saw the dilemma , and perceived that " there was little prospect of a common accord as to the measures to be adopted . " On the 6th of November , he proposed to the Cabinet to reduce the duty on grain in bond to one shilling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to summon Parliament immediately for the passage of an act of indemnity , and early in the following year to propose a modification of the Corn Laws . Only three of the members of the Cabinet , however , Lord Aberdeen , Sir James Graham , and Mr. Sidney Herbert , supported these proposals , and they were rejected . The Cabinet met again on the 25th of November , and continued in session until the 5th of December , engaged in the discussion of this subject . Sir Robert brought forward a new plan for the revision of the Corn Laws , which was finally acquiesced in by all his colleagues with the exception of the Duke of Buc* cleuch and Lord Stanley , who announced their inability to support any measure involving an ultimate repeal of the Corn Laws , and their intention to resign if such a measure should be brought forward . In view of these resignations and of the reluctant consent which others had given , Sir Robert tendered his own resignation to the queen on the 5th of December . While the ministry was discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his constituents , the electors of the city of London , which undoubtedly had some influence in determining Sir Robert 's course . In this letter the Whig leader accused the ministers of inactivity , declared his own opinion to be in favor of the repeal of the Corn Laws , intimated that the ministers were merely waiting for an excuse to give up the obnoxious laws , and advised the people " by petition , by address , by remonstrance , to afford them the excuse they seek . " Nor did he neglect the opportunity to smooth his own way to office . " I have for several years , " he said , " endeavored to obtain a compromise on this subject . In // for the sliding scale . In 1841 I announced the intention of the then government of proposing a fixed duty of Ss. a quarter . In the past session I proposed the imposition of some lower duty . These propositions were successively rejected . The present First Lord of the Treasury met them in 1839 , 1840 , and 1841 by eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caused , the moral happiness it had diffused . He met the propositions for diminished protection in the same way in which he had met the offer of securities for Protestant interests in 1817 and 1825 , - in the same way in which he had met the proposal to allow Manchester , Leeds , and Birmingham to send members to Parliament in 1830 . " Lord John was accordingly sent for to form a new ministry . But after a long negotiation with Sir Robert Peel with a view to ascertain how far the latter would support the government in an attempt to modify the Corn Laws , his Lordship was obliged to relinquish the endeavor to form a government , in consequence of the refusal of one of his political friends , Earl Grey , son of the former prime minister , to concur in the proposed arrangements . Sir Robert Peel at once resumed office , with all his late colleagues excepting Lord Stanley , and with the promise on the part of Lord John Russell that he would not obstruct the government measure . Parliament met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir Robert brought forward his proposed measure of relief . His plan involved the entire repeal of the Corn Laws at the expiration of three years . In the mean time , Indian corn , buckwheat , and other grains used principally as food for cattle , were to be admitted free of duty , and upon wheat there was to be a reduction of duty , though the sliding scale was to be retained . The measure was violently opposed by the landed interest , under the leadership of Lord George Bentinck , who gave proof of an ability which it had not been supposed that he possessed ; and it was not until the 16th of May that the bill finally passed the House by a majority of ninety-eight , composed of Whigs , Free-Traders , and personal adherents of the ministers . In the Upper House the bill also encountered strong opposition , and did not pass until the 26th of June . The passage of this bill was the last and dearly bought triumph of the Peel // ministry . The Protectionists , angry at what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert , were eager for the first opportunity to punish the minister . Such an opportunity they soon found . Early in the session the ministers had introduced a bill for the Protection of Life in Ireland , which had passed the Lords with but little resistance , and was now under discussion in the Lower House . Taking advantage of the Whig opposition to this measure , the Protectionists joined their old enemies , and by a majority of seventy-three threw out the bill on the same day on which the Corn-Law Bill passed the Lords . That day witnessed a double triumph for Sir Robert Peel , in the repeal of the Corn Laws and in the announcement that the dispute about Oregon was settled . But it witnessed the final overthrow of his ministry . On the 29th , he announced that he had ceased to hold office . Lord John Russell was once more summoned by the queen to place himself at the head of the government . His attempt to form an administration was successful ; and by persuading some of those statesmen who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by calling in also such new talent as was available , he formed an able and efficient ministry . Lords Cottenham , Lansd owne , and Palmerston resumed their old offices . Earl Grey consented to take the seals of the Colonial Department ; and his cousin , Sir George Grey , was placed in the Home Department . Mr. Wood , soon afterwards raised to a baronetcy , as Sir Charles Wood , was made Chancellor of the Exchequer . Mr. Labouchere was transferred to the Chief Secretaryship for Ireland . Mr. Macaulay was appointed Paymaster of the Forces ; but having been rejected by the Presbyterians of Edinburgh on account of his speech and vote in favor of the increased grant to Maynooth College , he soon after resigned his office and retired to private life . This ministry , with a few internal changes , continued to carry on the government during the remainder of Sir Robert Peel 's life . By the accession of the Whigs , Sir Robert found himself in the position of an independent member of Parliament , and at the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer responsible for the measures of government , the von . Lxxxv. - NO. 177. 42 // closing years of his life constituted not the least honorable and praiseworthy part of his long and checkered career . Unseduced by the solicitings of an eager ambition , he seemed anxious to forget the animosities of his earlier years , and gave to many of the measures of Lord John Russell 's administration au honest and manly support . He continued to be assailed with bitter sarcasms and stinging invective by Lord George Bentinck , Mr. D'Jsraeli , and the other leaders of the Protectionist party in Parliament , and by partisan writers in the Quarterly Review and other Tory journals . But he steadily rose in the estimation of those who had no recent grievances to avenge . " After his fall from power , " says Mr. Macaulay , one of the most active , as he was certainly the most brilliant of his antagonists , " a cordial reconciliation took place between us : I admired the wisdom , the moderation , the disinterested patriotism , which he invariably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I lamented his untimely death , as both a public and a private calamity ; and I earnestly wished that the sharp words which had been exchanged between us might be forgotten . " His last speech in Parliament was delivered on the 28th of June , 1850 , in opposition to Mr. Roebuck 's famous motion approving of the foreign policy of Lord Palmerston . It is certain that Sir Robert did not desire the overthrow of the government ; but thinking that Lord Aberdeen had been unjustly assailed , he felt bound to defend him and to oppose the motion . The debate lasted all night ; and it was once more by the light of the rising sun that Sir Robert Peel walked home from the scene of his earlier and his later triumphs for the last time . He took a few hours of needed rest , and then went forth to the discharge of new duties , as one of the cominissioners intrusted with making the preliminary arrangements for the Great Exhibition of 1851 . In the latter part of the day , he rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeding slowly up Constitution Hill , his horse suddenly shied , and threw him violently over his head . He fell with his face downward , and when raised from the ground , he fainted before a carriage could be procured . When he reached his residence , he walked into the house // alone , but fainted again in the hail . He was carried into the nearest apartment ; and it was only with the greatest difficulty that he was removed from the sofa where he was first placed to an hydraulic bed in the same room , - the diningroom where he had so often welcomed his friends . There he breathed his last , after three days of intense suffering , but little alleviated by the watchful care of the attending physicians and surgeons . For it must be observed that this great statesman , who had stood undismayed in the midst of the fiercest political strife , when friends and followers were forsaking him , charging him with treachery and duplicity , and ascribing to him the vilest of motives , was keenly sensitive to physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough examination of his injuries ; an attempt to reduce a fracture of the collar-bone had to be given up , in consequence of the suffering which it occasioned ; and it was only after his death that it was ascertained that one of his ribs was broken , causing a congestion of the lungs . During his sufferings he was frequently delirious , and the presence of his wife and children increased his excitement so much , that they were not allowed to remain in the room . On Tuesday , the 2d of July , it became apparent that his sufferings must soon terminate . His old friend , the Bishop of Gibraltar , was sent for , and his family were again admitted to the bedside of the dying man . A faintly breathed " God bless you ! " showed that he recognized them , as he sank into unconsciousness . Shortly after , two other friends , Lord Hardinge and Sir James Graham , whose names had often been on his lips in his moments of delirium , arrived , and remained with him until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he breathed his last , in presence of these two friends , his son-in-law , three of his brothers , three of his sons , and his physicians . Lady Peel 's emotion was so great that she had been led from the room some time before his last hour came . His death caused a deep sense of loss in Parliament and throughout the country . In the House of Commons , Lord John Russell offered , on behalf of the government , a public funeral , such as had been given to the younger Pitt . The offer was declined , in accordance with the often repeated // wishes of the deceased statesman ; and on the 9th of July , in a drenching rain and a thick fog , his mortal remains were borne across the fields from Drayton Manor to the parish church , followed by his family , his principal political friends , his servants , and his tenants . The funeral service was read by the Bishop of Gibraltar , in the presence of a numerous multitude , who had gathered from Tamworth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the greatest statesmen of the nineteenth century . Three days later , Lord John Russell proposed that a monument should be erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey , and the motion was immediately adopted . One other mark of respect the government were desirous of showing for his memory by raising Lady Peel to the peerage , as had been done in the case of Mr. Canning 's widow . But the honor was declined , in consequence of a special request of Sir Robert Peel , that no member of his family should accept any title or public reward for the services which he might have rendered to the state . Other testimonies of respect were shown elsewhere . In London , Edinburgh , and the great manufacturing towns , public meetings were held , and measures were taken for the erection of monuments and statues . The most remarkable demonstration of gratitude and respect , however , was a penny subscription for the erection of a Poor Man 's National Monument , which it was proposed should bear these words from his speech on retiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , that I shall leave a name sometimes remembered with expressions of good-will in the abodes of those whose lot it is to labor and to earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow , when they shall recruit their exhausted strength with abundant and untaxed food , the sweeter because it is no longer leavened by a sense of injustice . " The character of Sir Robert Peel has been drawn by various writers and speakers , and from entirely different points of view . But by no one has it been more justly appreciated than it has been by M. Guizot . Brought into frequent intercourse and contact with him , both in public and in private relations , and unbiassed on the one hand by party fellowship , or on the other hand by party hostility , he has sketched %he great outlines of his character with a few masterly touches . // " He was a great and honest servant of the state , " the French historian remarks , " proud with a sort of humility , and desiring to shine with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country without any craving for reward , heedless of fixed principles or longstanding political combinations , anxious at all times to ascertain what was demanded by the public interest , and ready to carry it into effect without caring either for parties and their rules of conduct , or for his own acts and words ; severing himself from the past without cynical indifference , braving the future without adventurous boldness , solely swayed by the desire to meet the necessities of the present , and to do himself honor by delivering his country from peril or embarrassment . He was thus in turn a Conservative and Reformer , a Tory , a Whig , and almost a Radical ; popular and unpopular ; using his strength with equal ardor , sometimes in making an obstinate resistance , sometimes in yielding concessions which were perhaps excessive ; more wise than provident , more courageous than firm , but always sincere , patriotic , and marvellously adapted , in a period of transition like ours , to conduct the government of modern society as it has become . " There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this remarkable man , and that demands a large charity in judging of his life . He had opposed Mr. Homer 's resolutions for the resumption of specie payments by the Bank of England ; yet , in 1819 , he introduced and carried a similar measure . He had steadfastly opposed Catholic emancipation , and so violent had been his which Sir James Mackintosh once gave him . Yet , in 1829 , he brought forward and advocated the Roman Catholic Relief Bill as a government measure . He had been the constant and ardent supporter of the Corn Laws ; yet , in 1846 , he headed a successful movement for their entire abolition . He had been a Tory of the strictest sect ; yet his last votes in Parliament were given in support of Whig measures . Such and so marvellous were the changes in his political career . But , through the whole of it , we recognize an honest purpose and a resolute will , gradually overcoming the pernicious influences of his education and his early associations . Though he had attained the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary distinction . Conscious 42* // that the true bent of his mind was towards a political life , he gave to the prompt and efficient discharge of its various duties all his intellectual strength and ability . Still he was not unmindful of the claims of literature upon a statesman and a politician . As a minister , he was a liberal patron of men of letters , both among his political friends and his opponents . When he took office in 1834 , one of his first acts was to propose the elevation of Southey to a baronetcy , and to proffer his services in promoting the ecclesiastical preferment of the poet 's son-in-law . And the same wise and liberal policy in the encouragement of literary men guided him in his second administration . He possessed a large and wellselected library ; and his acquaintance with general literature F was extensive , though it was overshadowed by his marvellous familiarity with political history and social economy . He was a lover of painting and sculpture ; but he had little knowledge of music , and apparently little pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the cultivated tastes of a welleducated English gentleman , without ostentation and without pedantry . His habits were temperate and regular ; and his private character was stained by no vices . Cold and reserved in his manners , he did not make many personal friends ; but the few with whom he was intimate were devotedly attached to him , and allowed no change in his opinions to weaken their regard for him .
