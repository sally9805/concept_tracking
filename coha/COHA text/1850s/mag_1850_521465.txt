From the North British Review . The Poetical Works of WILLIAM WORDSWORTH , D.C.L. , Poet Laureate , &amp;c . London , 1849 . ANOTHER great spirit has recently gone from the midst of us . It is now three months since the nation heard , with a deep though quiet sadness , that an aged man of venerable mien , who for fifty years had borne worthily the name of English poet , had at length disappeared from those scenes of lake and mountain , where , in stately care of his own worth , he had fixed his recluse abode , and passed forward , one star the more , into the still unfeatured future , whither all that lives is rolling , and whither , as he well knew and believed , the Shakespeares and Miltons , whom men count dead , had but as yesterday transferred their kindred radiance . When the news spread , it seemed as if our island were suddenly a man the poorer ; some pillar or other notable object , long conspicuous on its broad surface , had suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should detain our thoughts for a little in the vicinity of this event ; that , the worldly course of such a man having now been ended , we should stand for a little around his grave , and think solemnly of what he was . Neither few nor unimportant , we may be sure , are the reflections that should suggest themselves over the grave of William Wordsworth . of the various mysteries that the human mind can contemplate none is more baffling , and at the same time more charming , to the understanding , than the nature of that law that determines the differences of power and mental manifestation between age and age . That all history is an evolution , that each generation inherits all that had been accumulated by its predecessor , and bequeatlies in turn all that itself contains to its successor , is an idea to which , in one form or another , science binds us down . But , native as this idea now is in all cultivated minds , with how many facts , and with what a large proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in apparent contradiction Looking back upon the past career of our race , does not the eye single out , as by instinct , certain epochs that are epochs of virtue and glory , and others that are epochs of frivolity and shame ? Do we not speak of the age of Pericles in Greece , of the Augustan age in Rome , of the outburst of ehivalry in modern Europe , of the noble era of Elizabeth in England , and of the sad decrepitude that followed it ? And is there not a certain justice of perception in this mode of speaking Does it not seem as if all ages were not equally favored from on high , gifts both moral and intellectual being vouchsafed to one that are all but withheld from another I As with individual men so with nations and with humanity at large , may not the hour of highest spiritual elevaCCCXXXII . LIVING AGE . VOL . XXVI. 37 tion and sternest moral resolve , be nearest the hour of most absolute obliviousness and most profound degradation Has not humanity also its moods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pregnant with the wit of unconcern ; again , touched to higher things , tearful for very goodness , turning an upward eye to the stars , and shivering to its smallest nerve with the power and the sense of beauty ? In rude and superficial expression of which fact , have not our literary men coined the common-place that a critical and sceptical age always follows an age of heroism and creative genius ? These , we say , are queries which , though they may not be answered to their depths , it is still useful to point out and ponder . One remark only will we venture in connexion with them . According to one theory it is a sufficient explanation of these moral and intellectual changes in the spirit of nations , to suppose that they take place by a law of mere contagion or propagation from individual to individual . One man of powerful and original nature , or of unusually accurate perceptions , makes his appearance in some central , or , it may be , sequestered spot ; he gains admirers or makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form an opinion of him from a distance ; they , again , in their turn , affect others , till , at last , as the gloom of the largest church is slowly changed into brilliance by the successive lighting of all its lamps , so a whole country may , . ? istrict by district , succumb to the peculiarity of a new influence . Now , this is perfectly true ; and it would be indeed difficult to estimate the amazing efficacy of such a law of incessant diffusion from point to point over a surface ; but we are convinced that this modc of representing the fact under notice does not convey the whole truth . Concerning even the silent pestilences we have been recently taught that they do not wholly depend on transmission from individual to individual , but are rather distinct derangements in the body of the earth itself , tremors among its electricities and imponderables , alterations of the sum-total of those material conditions wherewith human life has been associated . In like manner , as appears to us , must those streaming processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change is diffused over a community , be regarded as but the superficial indications of a deep contemporaneous agitation pervading the whole frame of nature . From the mineral core of this vast world , outwards to the last thoughts , impulses , and conclusions of us its human inhabitants , there runs , as science teaches , a mystic law of intercourse and affinity , pledging its parts to act in concert . The moral and intellectual revolutions of our world , its wars , its new philosophies , its outbursts of creative genius , its profligate sinkiugs , // and its noble recoveries , all must rest , under the decree of supreme wisdom , on a concurrent basis of physical undulations and vicissitudes . When , therefore , a man starts up in any locality , charged with a new spirit or a new desire , there , be sure , the ground around him is similarly affected . New intellectual dispositions are like atmospheres ; they overhang whole countries at once . It is not necessarily by communication or plagiarism that the thought excogitated to-day in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gdttingen and Oxford are found speculating at the same time in the same direction . In our own island , for example , it is a fact capable of experimental verification , that whatever is being thought at any one time in any one spot , is , with a very small amount of difference , being independently thought at the same time in fifty other places at all distances from each other . And yet it is equally true that in every moral or spiritual revolution there is always a leader , a forerunner , a man of originality , in whose individual bosom the movement seems to have been rehearsed and epitomized ; and that , in the beginning of every such revolution , the power of contagion from man to man , and the machinery of the clique , school , or phalanx , must come into play . We do not think that these remarks are too remote or abstract for the present occasion . The nineteenth century , it appears to us , is a sufficiently large portion of historic time England is a sufficiently large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England , or of any other nation , is a sufficiently important element in that nation 's existence to justify our viewing that remarkable phenomenon , the revival of English poetry in the nineteenth century , in the light of the most extreme general conceptions that can be brought to bear upon it . Against the preceding observations , therefore , as against what seems an appropriate background , let us try to bring out the main features of the phenomenon itself , so far at least as these can be exhibited with reference to the life and writings of its most " representative man . " And first , of Wordsworth regarded historically . From Dryden till about fifty years ago , say our authorities in literary history , was an era of poeti*cal sterility in England . When Coleridge gave lectures in London on the English poets , he divided them into three lists or sections ; the first including all the poets from Chaucer to Dryden ; the second , all those from IDryden inclusive till the close of the eighteenth century ; and the third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him of the characters of these three periods relatively to each other , was essentially that conveyed in the strange theory of alternate ebb and flow , alternate immission and withdrawal of power , as regulating the progress of the universe . In other words , the first period was a period of strength , youth , and outburst ; the second was a period of cleverness , conceit , and poverty ; and the third was a period of revival . For , the poetic spirit being one constant thing , a certain specific and invariable quality or state of the human soul , not capable of change from century to century , but the same of old , now , and forever , it follows that the history of poetry can present no other appearance than that of alternate excess and deficiency , alternate extinction and renovation . That is to say , accepting the poetry of Chaucer and Milton as true poetry , we can not go on to defend the poetry of Pope sand Johnson as true poetry of a different kind , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry is true poetry of a different kind still . Except in a very obvious sense , rendered necessary by convenience , it can not be said these are kinds of poetry . The materials on which the poetic sense works are constantly varying ; infinite , also , are the combinations of human faculty and will with which this sense may be structurally associated ; but the sense itself , whensoever and in whomsoever it may be found , is still the same old thing that trembled in the heart of Homer . An age may have it or want it ; may have more of it or less of it ; may have it in conjunction with this or with that aggregate of other characteristics , but can not abandon one form of it and take up another . In these remarks we have embodied what we consider a very necessary caution . If much good has been done by that exaltation of meaning which the words poet and poetry have received from the hands of Coleridge and others , as well as by their kindred services in distinguishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding , genius and talent , creation and criticism , we are not quite sure but that , at the same time , this infusion of new conceptions into our language has been productive of some mischief . Agreeing , upon the whole , with the sentence of condemnation which has been of late passed upon the poor eighteenth century ; believing that it was a critical , negative , and unpoetic age ; nay , even believing ( however the belief is to be reconciled with the doctrine of continuous historic evolution ) that it was one of those seasons of comparative diminution of the general vital energy of our species that we have already spoken of , we still think that too sweeping a use has been made of this notion and its accessories by a certain class of writers . Let us illustrate our meaning by an example . Keats , the poet , and James Mill , the historian of India , were contemporaries . The one , according to the language introduced by Coleridge , was a man of genius ; the other was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever in a human soul at all , there was a portion of the real poetic essence  --  the real faculty divine ; Mr. Mill , on the other hand , had probably as little of the poet in his composition as any celebrated man of his time ; but he was a man of hard metal , of real intellectual strength , and of unyielding rectitude . In certain exercises of the mind he could probably have crushed Keats , who certainly was no weakling , as easily as a giant could crush a babe . But , suppose the two men to have set together on Hampatead Heath // in a starry night , which of them would have been the stronger-which would have known the most ecstatic pulses l Or , to make the case still more decisive , suppose the two men to have been Keats and Aristotle ; Keats a consumptive poetic boy , and Aristotle the intellect of half a world . Does not such a contrast bring out the real injustice that has been done to many truly great and good men by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become general , of placing all the men that belong to the so-called category of genius in one united mass above all that only rank in the category of talent ? Fur , granting , as we certainly do , the reality of some such distinction as implied between the two substantives , is it not clear that the general mass of mind possessed by a man reputed to belong to the inferior category , and consequently , also , his general power to influence the soul of the world , may exceed a thousand times that possessed by a man of the other ? In other words , may not a man rank so high in the one kind , that even allowing the kind itself to be inferior , it may be said with truth that he is a hundred times greater a man than some specified lower man in the other ? Practically , the tenor of these remarks is that we are in the present day committing an injustice by following the tendency of our young Coleridgians to restrict the meaning of the quantitative word " greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius . " And , speculatively , their tenor may be expressed in the proposition that this quality or mode of mind called genius , the poetic sense , creative power , and so on , may exist in association with all possible varieties of intellectual or cerebral vigor , from the mediocrity of a Kirke White or an Anacreon up to the stupendousness of a Shakspeare . It is thus , that while agreeing in the main with the opinion that from Dryden to the close of the next hundred years was a poetic interregnum , we would still make our peace with those who would fight the battle of the much abused eighteenth century ; and that we would steer clear of the controversy whether Pope was a poet . As deficiency in poetic power does not imply corresponding deficiency in what may be called ordinary cerebral vigor , so the eighteenth century , though admitted to have been unpoetic , may have been a very respectable century notwithstanding ; and even were we to exclude Pope from the class of poets ( which most certainly we would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon in literature , not , on that account , a whit the less remarkable . A deeper analysis would carry us further into the question as to the connection between poetic power and general intellect in individuals and in ages ; but here we must stop . Having thus explained in what sense we understand that general assertion regarding the low state of English poetry in the eighteenth century , ( part of the seventeenth included , ) with which the name of Wordsworth is irrevocably associated , let us attend a little to the facts of the case . In what did the sterility of English poetry in that age consist , and what words would best describe 579 it ? Here Wordsworth himself comes to our aid . The following is from an Appendix to the Preface to the second edition of his " Lyrical Ballads , " published in 1800 ; the subject under discussion is Poetic Diction . The earliest poets of all nations generally wrote from passion excited by real events ; they wrote naturally and as men ; feeling powerfully as they did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poets , and uren ambitious of the fame of poets , perceiving the influence of such Ianguage , and desirous of producing the , same effect without being animated with the same passion , set themselves to a mechanical adoption of these figures of speech , and made use of them , sometimes with propriety , but much more frequently applied them to feelings and thoughts with which they had no natural connexion whatsoever . A language was thus insensibly produced , differing materially from the real language of men in any situation . The reader or hearer of this distorted language found himself in a perturbed and unusual state of mind ; in both cases he was willing that his common judgment and understanding should be laid asleep , and he had no instinctive and infallible perception of the true to make him reject the false the one served as a passport for the other . The emotion was in both cases delightful , and no wonder if he confounded the one with the other , and believed them both to be produced by the same , or similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of a man to be looked up to , a man of genius and authority . Thus , and from a variety of other causes , this distorted language was received with admiration ; and poets , it is probable , who had before contented themselves for the most part with misapplying only expressions which at first had been dictated by real passion , carried the abuse still further , and introduced phrases composed apparently in the spirit of the original figurative language of passion , yet altogether of their own invention , and characterized by various degrees of wanton deviation from good sense and nature . * * * Peghaps in no way , by positive example , could be more easily given a notion of what I mean by the phrase poetic diction than by referring to a comparison between the metrical paraphrases which we have of passages in the Old and New Testament , with those passages as they exist in our common translation . By way of immediate example , take the following of Dr. Johnson Turn on the prudent ant div heedless eves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No stern command , no monitory voice , Prescribes her duties , or directs her choice ; Yet , timely provident , she hastes away To snatch the blessings of a plenteous day ; When fruitful summer loads the teeming plain , She crops the harvest , and she stores the grain . How tong shall sloth usurp thy useless hours , Uniierve thy vigor , and enchain thy powers ? While artful shades thy downy couch enclose , And soft solicitation courts repose , Amidst the drowsy charms of dull delight , Year chases year with unremitted flight , Till want now following , fraudulent and slow , Shall spring to seize thee , like an ambushed foe . From this hubbub of words pass to the orioinal " Go to the ant , thou sluggard , consider her ways and be wise ; which having no guide , Qverseer , or // ruler , provideth her meat in the summer , and gathereth her food in the harvest . How long wilt thou sleep , 0 sluggard l when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep Yet a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hands to sleep . So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth , and thy want as an armed man . " sum up the views thus presented by Wordsworth of the state of English poetry after Milton , it may be said that at that time the nation , having lost much of the genuine poetical power it had formerly possessed , but still preserving a form of composition to which it had been so long and so powerfully accustomed , began to regard the essence of poetry as lying in metre , accompanied by a certain peculiar and artificial phraseology called poetic diction ; thus begetting that exaggerated antithesis between poetry and prose with which our language is still infected . Instead of regarding the poetic faculty as consisting in a mode or attitude of the mind , distinguishable , on the one hand , from the scientific mode or attitude whose function is investigation or exposition , and , on the other hand , from the oratorical mode or attitude whose function is to excite or stimulate in a particular direction-they made poetry to consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of a poet according to the degree of mastery he had attained in the use of this mode of language , and the degree of general in ental power and resource he could manifest through it . Hence , in the first place , a gradual increase of departure in metrical composition from the idioms and combination of words deemed appropriate to prose ; and , in the second place , a gradual reduction of the range of metre itself to certain fixed varieties and methods of versification , which the older poets , who did not so much assort their thoughts to rhymes as let the thoughts flow out in their own rhythm , would have disdained as much as a natural cascade would disdain the assistance of pipes . But while an exaggerated antithesis was thus established between prose and poetry , it by OQ means followed that a very wide separation was drawn between the devotees of the one and those of the other . Poetry was indeed a different form of diction from prose ; but then , as it was not difficult for a clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well be both a poet and a prose-writer . To pass from prose to poetry was but to pass , as it were , from one 's town to one 's country house . Hence it was that so many of the literary men of last* , century had a reputation both in prose and in verse . General mental vigor carried an author triumphantly through either form of composition . Wit , sarcasm , strength , manliness , whatever qualities of intellect or disposition could earn respect for a writer in prose , were all capable-with a little training , or a slight native impulse towards the picturesque , to aid himof being transfused into metre . The best poetry of the age was , accordingly , rather wit or reflection expressed in metre than real poetry in the strict sense of the wjrd . And here lies the de fence of the poets of that time , as well as their condemnation . Of many of them it may be denied that they were poets ; but of almost all of them it may be asserted that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning them , therefore , let not this be forgotten . If Johnson was no poet , he was a very ponderous and noble old fellow , nevertheless ; and even the purists that would clip the laurels of Dryden and Pope , must admit that we have no such manly literati as the former now-a-days about Leicester Square , and that the other was a diamond of the first water . But the change came at length . By the mysterious operation of those laws that determine the risings and the sinkings of the mental state of humanity as a whole there seemed to be effected , towards the close of the eighteenth century , a sudden increase of the vital energy of the species . Humanity assumed a higher mood ; a deep agitation , as if from a fresh electric discharge out of space into the solid body of our planet , shook the soul of the world , and ( God so willing ) left it troubled and excited . The two most conspicuous and extensive manifestations of this heightened state of the world 's consciousness were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transcendental philosophy in Germany , and in the region of action , the French Revolution . But as if the same spirit which burst forth in these two great eruptions also sought vent through smaller and apparently unconnected orifices all over Europe , there were not wanting other significant indications of the change that was tr*nsactiug itself . In Germany , seemingly apart from the transcendental philosophy , though in reality deriving strength froni it through a subterranean conduit , a new literature came forth under the care , first of Lessing , and then of Goethe . And , in our own country , sprinkled over as it had been in spots by the sound and fertile philosophy of Reid , there was a feebler exhibition of the same phenomenon . Even in the age of reputed degeneracy there had been men of the true poetic spark . Dryden and Pope may not have kept it pure , but they assuredly had it ; Gray , notwithstanding the dreadful disintegration to which his Elegy has been submitted by modern critics , did certainly possess the ear and sensibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ; and Thomson , Wordsworth himself being judge , was a genuine child of rural nature . Nor here , whatever other names are left unmentioned , let his be forgotten , the Boy of Bristol , the drunken choir-singer 's posthumous son , who was found dead in his garret in Brook Street , Holborn , on the 25th of August , 1770 . But the real poetic outburst came after these men had been removed from the scene , and was plrsinly a consequenc.e of that general commotion of the whole earth to which we have already alluded . Its earliest unmistakable signs may be said to have been given in the works of Cowper and Burns . In the bard of Olney , valetudinarian as he was , the new force that was pent 580 // 581 qwq // der of Wordsworth 's long life was spent among the Lakes . Here , in the enjoyment of worldly competence , he walked , boated , wrote , and attended church ; hence from time to time he issued his new poems , or collections of poems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate their peculiar character ; and here , in the bosom of his admiring family , he received the chance visits of such stray worshippers as came privileged with letters of introduction , talking with them in a cold , stately way , and not onfrequently ( be the truth distinctly spoken ) shocking them by the apparent egotism with which he referred to or quoted his own poetry ; the inordinate indifference he displayed towards must things besides ; the painful rigor with which lie exacted from those around him every outward mark of respect and attention ; and the seriousness with which he would repeat the most insignificant words that had been uttered in his praise . These particulars regarding the man , are already irrevocably before the public in our books of literary gossip , and may not , therefore , be wholly omitted even in a notice dedicated to the poet . But whatever may have been his bearing in the presence of other men , Wordsworth must have been at least modest and cordial in his communion with Nature . And it is thus that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social board , lavishing the kind word and the hearty repartee ; not as the self-forgetting enthusiast of the hour , burning his way through crowds , and drawing adoration and love in his train ; but , as he was in his old age , the conscious patriarch of English poesy , the grayhaired and hard-featured recluse , shunning the - haunts of men , yet with a benevolent hand for the familiar woes of the neighborhood which knew and honored him ; accustomed to walk alone by day amid the woods ; to pace muttering by the ripple of a lake in the moonlight ; or , standinghalf way up a mountain , to turn his pale , unearthly eye towards the . heaven of stars . Such he was through all the turmoil of a generation into which , almost alone of his coevals , he had lived to advance ; and such he was till , in his eighty-first year , death took him . The nature of the revolution effected by Wordsworth in the state of English poetry will be best understood by attending to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his various Prefaces and Dissertations between 1800 and 1820 . On these propositions , as supplementary to his general critical onslaught on the poetry of the previous age , he may be supposed to have rested his claims to be considered not only a poet , but also the father of a new poetical era . Poetry , according to Wordsworth , " takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity ; " what the poet chiefly does , or ought to do , is to represent , out of real life , scenes and passions of an affecting or exciting character . Now , men originally placed in such scenes , or animated by such passions , use a nervous and exquisite language expressly adapted for the occasion by nature herself ; and the poet , therefore , in imitating such scenes or passions , will recall them more vividly in proportion as he can succeed in employing the same language . Only one consideration should operate to make him modify that language ; the consideration , namely , that his business as a poet is to give pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though natural in the original transaction of a passionate scene , would be unpleasant or disgusting in its poetic rehearsal , must be omitted . Pruned and weeded in accordance with this negative rule , any description of a moving occurrence , whether in prose or verse , would be true poetry . But to secure still more perfectly their great end of giving pleasure while they excite emotion , poets have devised the artificial assistance of meta*e or verse . The rationale of the use of metre consists in this , that it provides for the reader or hearer a succession of minute pleasurable surprises apart from and independent of the emotion produced by the matter for which it is the vehicle . A prose version of a passionate story , though , if well managed , it would not be so painful as the original trarisaction , and might even be pleasurable , would still in many cases be sufficiently painful to prevent its being read more than once . But , by narrating the same in metre , the poet is able , as it were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared , which , though not very perceptible , are still sufficient , by mingling with the current of the meaning , to attemper and sweeten its effects . And rhyme is a still higher form of the same device . The necessities , therefore , of metre and rhyme do oblige certain departures in poetry from the primary language of emotion but , allowing for those , good poetic diction should still approach very near to the language of real life . This view , so useful as an aggression upon the florid diction of the poets of the preceding age , certainly errs by exaggeration . Wordsworth 's own poetry will not stand to be tried by it ; for , as Coleridge has shown , there is hardly a verse even in his most sinil ) le productions , that does not deviate from the so-called language of real life . And it must inevitably be so . For , in the first place , the mere application of the negative principle of modification laid down by Wordsworth , would amount to an abandonment of the point at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of real passion in humble life the bad grammar , the incoherence , the mispronunciations , and so on ; and the language that would then be left for the poet would be a very rare and select language indeed , existing literally nowhere throughout the community , but purely supposititious and ideal , the sap and flower of all popular expression . So also with the representation of passions of a higher order . The only sense in which // the language of a great part of our best poetry can be said to resemble real language , is that it is the kind of language that a few of the most cultured persons of the community would employ on very rare and impressive occasions . But even the choicest spontaneous language of the best minds , when most nobly moved in real life , must undergo modification before it can be used by the poet . And though Wordsworth has provided for such modification , by laying down the positive principle , that the poet is at all times to remember that it is his office to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle as regards metre and rhyme ; yet he does not seem to have seen the whole energy of this principle as determining and compelling departures from common usage . His argument for the virtual identity of poetic language and the language of real life , reminds us of the mania for what is called a simple conversational style . Why do not men write as they speak Why do they not convey their meaning in hooks in the good racy English which they employ at the dinnertable , or when giving their household orders ? Such are the absurd questions that are asked every day . It never seems to enter into the minds of these people that conversation is one thing , public speaking another , and writing a third ; that each involves and requires a distinct setting , so to speak , of the faculties for its exercise ; that in passing from one to either of the others , certain powers must be called into play that were before at rest , or sent to rest that were before in play ; and that , accordingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to insist that there shall never be anything greater in the world than what conversation can generate . But a world thus restricted to the merely conversational method of literary production would fall into decrepitude . When a man talks with his friend , he is led on but by a few trains of association , and finds a straggling style natural for his purposes ; when he speaks in public , the wheels of thought glow , the associative processes by which he advances become more complex , and hence the roll , the cadence , the precipitous burst ; and , lastly , when he *vrites , still other conditions of thought come into action , and there arises the elaborate sentence , winding like a rivulet through the meadow of his subject , *r the page jewelled with a thousand allusions . Precisely so in the matter more immediately under discussion . Here too there is a gradation . A man in a state of excitement talks in vivid language , and even sets his words to a rough natural music , his voice swelling or trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the literary repetition of such a scene , nature suggests a new set of proprieties , answering to the entire difference between the mind in the primary and the mind in the secondary attitude ; and a literal report would be found to defeat the very end in view , and to be as much out of place as a literal copy in painting . Even in prose narration there must be a more select and coherent language than served in the primary act of passion , as well as a more melodious music . And when , moved to a still higher flight , the story lifts itself into metre , availing itself , as it were , of a device sanctioned by an origin in some of the more splendid moments of the ancient human soul , then , in exchange fur certain advantages , it submits to restrictions that come along with themn . Finally , if the charm of rhyme be desired , this too must be phrchased by further and inevitable concessions . Thus , we repeat , there is a gradation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex set of necessities than in actual experience ; in metrical narration the conditions are more complex still , so that , if the speech were of marble before , there must now be speech of jasper ; and , lastly , in rhyme the conditions compel the thought through so fine a passage that the words it chooses must be opals and rubies . Nor in all this is there any - departure from nature . On the contrary , it is a noble provision that , where the ordinary resources even of musical prose are apt to fail , the mind should have more intense methods of production in reserve . Such methods are metre and rhyme . They do not impair the work of intellectual invention , but rather assist it , and render it capable of a more exquisite class of performances than would otherwise be possible . In prose , however musical , the meaning flows as it were easily over a level , obeying the guidance of its own associations ; in metre new associations are added , which , while they increase the difficulty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when with this is conjoined rhyme , or the obligation of conducting the already moving thought in the direction or towards the horizon of a certain possible number of preconceived sounds , then every fibre of the mind is alert and electric , the whole strength of the household is called into action , and things are done that would surprise the gods . Although there seems to be no doubt that the vehement opposition that greeted Wordsworth on his appearance as a poet , was determined partly by a perception on the part of the public of those weaknesses in his theory to which we have been alluding ; it seems plain , also , that much of it was a mere display of that instinct of indignation that seizes men when they see their household gods invaded . " Pedlars , " and " boats , ' and " wagons ! " Oh ! ye shades Of Pope and Dryden , are we come to this ? Such was the universal feeling of the critics . The controversy between the Edinburgh Review and XVordsworth was literally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the old derived certain advantages from the obstinacy and want of tact with which the new exposed and made a boast of its most galling peculiarities . For , if Jeffrey 's criticisms on Wordsworth 's poetry be now compared with the criticisms of Wordsworth 's own friend Coleridge , as published in the Biograplmia Literaria , it will be found that , immeasurably as the two critics differ in spirit , the one refusing to 583 // 584 qwq // Yet there is reason in this . Poets preeminently are men that breathe their own spirit into things , that make self dominate over what is distinct from self , that give out into the universe more than they receive from it . So in Goethe 's matchless lines on the poetWherewith bestirs he human spirits ? Wherewith makes he the elements obey ? Is t not the stream of song that out his bosom springs , And to his heart the world back coiling brings ? That is , the stream of song , or , in other words , of self , flowing forth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entwines itself there with this and with that portion of matter or experience , and then flows back to whence it came , coiling what it has captured along with it . This power , this overflowing of self upon the universe , so characteristic of the poet , appears most of all in his eye . The eyes of some men are dull and obtuse ; those of others are sharp and piercing , as if they shot their power out in lines ; the eyes of the poet are heavy-laden and melancholy , like pools continually too full . However we choose to vary the words that are taken to define the essential faculty of the poet , we shall find that they apply to Wordsworth . Every page of his poetry abounds with instances of imagination . Thus , from the ExcursionSome tall crag That is the eagle 's birth-place , or some peak Familiar with forgotten years , that shows Inscribed upon its visionary sides The history of many a winter-storm , Or obscure record of the path of fire . Or from Peter BellAnd he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scars ; Where deep and low the hamlets ha Beneath their little patch of sky , And little lot of stars . Or from the noble ode on Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of fYhildhoodOur life is but a sleep and a forgetting : The soul that rises with us , our life 's star , Hath had elsewhere its setting , And cometh from afar ; Not in entire forgetfulness , * And not in utter nakedness , But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God who is our home : Heaven lies about us in our infancy ! Shades of the prison-house begin to close Upon the growing boy ; But he beholds the light and whence it flows , He sees it in his joy ; The youth , who daily further from the east Must travel , still is Nature 's priest , And by the vision splendid Is on his way attended ; At length the man perceives it die away , And fade into the light of common day . These , and hundreds of other passages that might be quoted , show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the true primal quality of the poet-imagination ; a sur charge of personality or vital spirit , perpetually overflowing among the objects of the otherwise conditioned universe , and refashioning them according to its pleasure . If we proceed now to inquire what were the most prominent of those other characteristics which , acting and reiicting with this generic tendency in the economy of Wordsworth 's mind , determined the specific peculiarities of his poetical productions , we are sure to be impressed first of all with his extreme sensibility to , and accurate acquaintance with , the changing phenomena of external nature . It is a just complaint against Civilization , as that word is at present defined , and especially against life in cities , that men are thereby shut out , or rather shut in , from sources of sensation the most pure and healthy of any . That people should know something of the aspects of the earth they live on ; that they should be familiar with the features of at least a portion of its undisguised surface-with its rocks , its waods , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights of day and night , and the varying livery of the seasons ; this it may be said was clearly intended to be forever a part of the mere privilege of existence . But a large proportion of mankind have been obliged to let slip even this poor item of their right in being . Pent up , on the one hand , in their cares against starvation , and , on the other , in their devices for artificial comfort , men have ceased to regard with the same true intimacy as of old , the venerable face of their ancient mother . Certain great admonitions of the outward , indeed , will always remain with men wheresoever they pass their days  --  the overarching sky , the midnight winds , the sea 's expanse , the yellow cornfield , the wooded landscape . And , after all , these are the images of nature that have most power to stir and affect us ; these , of which not even cities can deprive us . Cities , too , have their own peculiar kinds of scenery , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not yet been made . Thus , in Keats ' LamiaAs men talk in a dream , so Corinth all , Throughout her palaces imperial , A od all her populous streets and temples lewd Muttered , like tempest in the distance*bre*ved , To the wide-spreaded night above her towers . But , of the rural minutis* of nature , and also of what may be called her aspects of the horrible and lonesome , most of us , above all if we are denizens of cities , are compelled to be ignorant . Very few , for example , can tell the names of the various forest trees , or distinguish them from each other ; and fewer still can recognize , either by name or association , the various wild-flowers that grow in the meadows . How much also of sympathy with nature have We not lost , by not knowing , with the shepherd or husbandulian , the signs of the weather-what the clouds say when they hurry so , what mean those motions of the cattle , and why the mists roll down the hillsl And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have alluded , who among us experience , save 585 // by rare chance , the realities of those scenes so telling in books of fiction  --  the dark and solitary moor , with the light glimmering in the distance ; the fearful bivouac in the depths of a wood , or the incessant breaking of the waves at midnight against the cliff-embattled shore In that single ride from Ayr to Allowa ' Kirk , ( we agree with a writer in an old magazine , ) the immortal Tam saw more , even omitting the *vitches , than most of us see in a life-time . Now , it is a curious fact , that one of the most characteristic features of that revolution in English poetry with which the name of Wordsworth is associated , has been the increased interest that it has both instinctively aroused and knowingly cultivated in the facts and appearances of material nature . If , as Wordsworth himself has said , hardly a new original image or description of nature was introduced into English veise in the age between Milton and Thomson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nature , nature , " has been their cry , and as Bacon , after his own lordly fashion of thought , fancied that it was of service to his health and spirits to inhale every morning the smell of freshly-ploughed earth into which he had poured wine , so they have interpreted literally their prescriptions to the same effect , by renewing as often as possible their acquaintance with the rural earth , and falling periodically on the turf , as it were , with their faces downwards . In particular , it must have been remarked what an increased familiarity our recent poets have contracted with the vegetable department of nature . Chaucer himself could hardly have described the beauties of a field or a garden more minutely than some of our nodern versifiers . Nor , among the poets that have helped to cultivate this delight in the observation of natural appearances , is there any one that deserves to be ranked before Wordsworth . A native of scenes celebrated for their loveliness , he seems to have been endowed from the first with a capacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few fragments that have been given to the world of his unpublished poem , " The Prelude , " he thus described his sympathy with nature in childhood In November days , When vapors rolling down the valleys , made A lonely scene more lonesome ; among woods At noon , and mid the calm of summer nights , When , by the margin of the trembling lake , Beneath the gloomy hills , homeward I went In solitude , such intercourse was mine : Mine was it in the fi , , *lds , both day and night , And by the waters , all the summer long . And in the frosty seasofl , when the sun Was set , and , visible for many a mile , The cottage windows through the twilight blazed ; I heeded not the summons : happy time It was indeed for all of us ; for me It was a time of rapture ! Shod with steel We hissed along the polished ice , in games Confederate , imitative of the chase And woodland pleasures  --  the resounding horn , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the darkness and the cold we flew , And not a voice was idle : with the din Smitten , the precipices rang aloud ; The leafless trees , and every icy crag Tinkled like iron ; while far distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy , not unnoticed , while the stars , Eastward , were sparkling clear , and in the west The orange sky of evening died away . This intimacy with the face of the earth , this rich and keen sense of pleasure in English nature , whether in her vernal or her wintry aspects , Wordsworth carried with him into manhood . Submitting it , together with all else that he knew of himself , to his judgment for examination , he seems even to have arrived at a theory , that it is essential for every poet that would peacefully possess his faculty in these modern times , to connect himself permanently and domestically with some appropriate spot or tract of scenery , the whole influence of which he may thoroughly exhaust and incorporate with his verse . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction appears to have blended with the mere sentiment of local attachment , which was doubtless strong in him , in determining his retirement to the Lakes . There are even traces , we fancy , of a disposition on his part to generalize the feeling still more , and to lay it down as a maxim that , in all ordinary cases , the natal spot of every human being is the appropriate spot of his activity through life , removal from which must injure him , and that , so far as our present social arrangements render this impossible , and our present facilities for locomotion render the reverse easy , so far we fall short of the ideal state of things , as between us and the globe we inhabit . In the oheynnee of this law , ( hard law for Scotchmen ! ) lay , he seems to have felt , one of the great uses of descriptive poetry . While men do tear themselves away from their native localities , and traverse the earth , or congregate in cities , descriptive poetry , lie persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was one of his most valued claims , therefore , that he should be considered a genctine English descriptive poet . And certainly this is a claim that even those who think most humbly of his attainments can not deny him . There would be a propriety , we think , in remembering Wordsworth as a descriptive poet , along with Chaucer and Thomson , thus distinguishing him both from such poets as Burns and Tennyson , on the one hand , and from such poets as Keats on the other . In such poets as Burns and Tennyson , the element of what may be called human reference is always so decided , that , though no poets describe nature more beautifully when they have occasion , it would still be improper to speak of them specially as descriptive poets . To borrow a distinction from the sister art , it may be said that , if Burns and Tennyson are more properly classed with the figure-painters , notwithstanding the extreme beauty and finish of their natural backgrounds , so , on the same pilneiple , Wordsworth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also admitted , may yet not erroneously be classed with the landscape painters . On the other hand , he differs from poets like Keats in this , that being a native of the country , and accustomed , therefore , to the appearances of rural nature in all seasons , he does not confound nature with vegetation . In the poetry of Keats , as all must feel , there is an excess of greenth and vegetable imagery ; in reading his descriptions , we seem either to breathe the air of a hothouse heavy with the moist odors of greatleafed exotics , or to lie full stretched at noon in some shady nook in a wood , rank underneath with the pipy hemlock , and kindred plants of strange overgrowth . In Wordsworth , as we have seen , there is no such unhealthy lusciousness ; he has his spots of thick herbage , and his banks of florid richness too ; but what he delights in is the broad , clear expanse , the placid lake , the pure , pellucid air , the quiet outline of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which we would call attention , is the general intellectual vigor it displays , the large amount of really excellent thought that is bedded in itthought that would have been valuable to the world in whatever form it had been put forth , and which might easily , had Wordsworth not been a poet , have been put forth otherwise than in metre . We have already asserted , with sufficient distinctness , that poetry is something essentially different from thought or proposition put into verse . A man may have a profound intellect , and may carry in his head a quantity of thought sufficient to set up a University , or to supersede a British Association , and yet may be no poet . Or , on the other hand , a man may have something of the poetic spark in him , and be an intellectual weakling . It remains true , nevertheless , that intellect , or thought-clear , large intellect , such as would be available for any purpose whatever ; deep , abundant thought , such as we find in the best philosophical writings-are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet may either exert itself in such a state of perfect diffusion through the rest of his mind in its creative act , as only to become manifest in the completed grandeur of the result , which is the case , for example , with the poetry of Homer and Milton ; or it may retain its right to act also as a separate organ for the secretion of pure matter of thought , which is the case , above all , with the poetry of Shakspeare . In Wordsworth 's poetry the presence of a superior intellect-an intellect strong , high , and subtle , if not of extreme dimensions-may be discovered by both of these tests . In the first place , the substance of his poetry , its logical compactness , and its entire freedom from mer&amp; rubbish or commonplace , prove that a powerful and scholarly mind must have presided over the work of composition . On the other hand , for proofs that Wordsworth was familiar , even formally , with the best philosophical ideas of his time , one needs only to dip into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , in the following passage , short as 587 it is , the metaphysical reader will discern a perfect mastery on the part of the poet , over a conception the power of grasping which is recognized in the schools as the one test of a mind capable of metaphysical studies My voice proclaims How exquisitely the individual mind ( And the progressive powers perhaps no less Of the whole species ) to the external world Is fitted  --  and how exquisitely tooTheme this but little heard of among menThe external world is fitted to the mind ; And the creation ( by no lower name Can it be called ) which they with blended might Accomplish-this is our high argument . This , and similar conceptions ef a very high metaphysics , were evidently as familiar to Wordsworth as they were to Coleridge , from whom , it is very probable , he may have originally derived them . Indeed , making due allowance for the necessary difference between the scientific and the poetic mode of presenting truths , it may be alleged that there is hardly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in psychology , theology , politics , or literary criticism , some recognition of which may not be discovered either in the poems or in the prose dissertations of Wordsworth . The agreement between these two men intellectually seems to have been complete in almost every particular . Both professed political conservatism ; both conducted their speculative reasonings to a point where they merged in belief in Divine Revelation , and in a system of tenets derived from that belief , not differing essentially from theological orthodoxy ; and both exhibited an ardent attachment to the forms and rules of the Church of England . It may even be questioned by a certain class of critics , whether Wordsworth , in his treatment of such matters , has not sometimes taken leave of the poetical mood altogether , and assumed the mood of the preacher ; whether the didactic fit did not sometimes overcome him in his poetry , and whether he has not allowed the controversial spirit , so manifest in his prefaces , to run over also somewhat deleteriously into his metre . But , as distinct from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice their singularly calm , religious , and contemplative tone . By thoughtfulness or contemplativeness we usually mean something quite distinguishable from mere intellectual vigor or opulence. the French are an intellectual nation ; they think rapidly and powerfully ; but they do not answer to our notion of a thoughtful or contemplative people . Contemplativeness , according to our usage of the word , does not so much imply the power of attaining or producing thought , as the power of brooding sentimentally over thought already attained . If we first oppose the speculative to the active , and then make a further distinction between the speculative and the contemplative , the character of Hamlet in Shakspeare may be taken to represent the union of the speculative and the contemplative . The Prince is a // student from the university , daring into all questions , and fertile at every moment in new generalities and pregnant forms of expression ; but his peculiarity consists in this , that far back in his mind there lie certain permanent thoughts and conceptions towards which he always reverts when left alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when anything is to be done . Now it is this tendency to relapse into a few favorite , and , as it were , constitutional trains of thought , that makes the contemplative character . Nor is it difficult to see in what thoughts it is , above all others , that the contemplative mind will always find its most appropriate food . Birth , Death , the Future ; the sufferings and misdeeds of man in this life , and his hopes of a life to come ; the littleness of us and our whole sphere of knowledge , and the awful relations in which we stand to the world of the supernatural , these , if any , are the permanent and inevitable objects of human contemplation and solicitude . From age to age these thoughts have been handed down ; every age must entertain , and no age can conclude them . What the ancient Chaldean meditated as he lay at night under the stars of the desert , the same things does the modern student meditate as he paces his lonely room . " Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days and full of trouble ; " " How can a man be justified with God B ' " 0 that one might plead for a man with God as a man pleadeth for his neighbor " - amid all the changes of manners , dynasties , and races , these thoughts survive . They and such like are the peculiarly human thoughts , the thoughts of humanity as such ; the thoughts upon which mankind must always fall back , and compared with which all other thoughts are but intrusions and impertinences . Now , although it would be possible , we think , to show that the effect even of abstract speculation , if carried far enough , is to lead men back into these thoughts and keep them there , so that in this sense the most speculative men must , as if by compulsion , become profoundly contemplative ; yet , generally speaking , a distinction may be drawn between men who are speculative , and men who are contemplative in their tendencies . Some men are always active intellectually ; always engaged in some process of inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law of mind or matter . These men are , in the present sense , speculative men ; they are continually at work within the ascertained sphere of human activity ; and it is by the labors of such men that the ma*s of this world 's experience of its own self-contained capabilities has been acenraulated . But there are other men who , either without being mentally active in this way , or , besides being thus active , have a constitutional tendency , at all times , to fall into a musing attitude , to relapse , as we have already expressed it , into certaimi ancient and footworn trains of thought that lead apparently nowhither . These are the contemplative men ; the men whose favorite position is rather at the circumference of the known sphere than within it ; the men who , at whatever time they may be born , receive , cherish , and transmit the permanent and characteristic thoughts of the human race . This quality of contemplativeness is always associated in our minds with the idea of sadness , tearfulness , melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he went out into the fields to meditate at eventide , seems , in our fancy , the most mild and pensive of the characters of the Scripture . And such mcii are the salt of the earth . There is little originality , indeed , in such thoughts as , we have said , form the appropriate food of the contemplative mind . To realize the conception , " All flesh is grass , " for example , or the conception , " Why do the wicked prosper B ' seems hut a very small effort indeed of the intellect , by no means comparable to the effort required in almost every act of daily life . Nevertheless , it remains true that it is ofily out of a deep soil of such old and simple conceptions , that any kind of true human greatness can rear itself , and also that there are very few minds indeed , in these days of ours , over which these and similar conceptions have their due degree of power . It is accordingly one of the chief merits of Wordsworth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interpret all that is visible in the spirit of a conviction of its evanescence , did exist in very high and unusual measure . He was essentially a pensive or contemplative man ; a man that was perpetually recurring to those few extreme thoughts and conceptions which most men never care to reach , and beyond which no man can go . This , which was conspicuous in the very aspect of his countenance , and which his recluse life illustrated , he has himself explicitly asserted . On man , on nature , and on human life , Musing in solitude , I oft perceive Fair trains of imagery before me rise , Accompanied by feelings of delight Pure , or with no unpleasing sadness mixed ; And I am conscious of affecting thoughts And dear remembrances , whose presence soothes Or elevates the mind , content to weigh The good and evil of our mortal state . - To these emotions , whencesoe'er they come , Whether from breath of outward circumstances , Or from the soul-an impulse to herself I would give utterance in numerous verse . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much general vigor of intellect that has earned for him the name of the English philosophical poet . It ought to be observed , also , at the same time , that in all Wordsworth 's contemplative poetry the influence of Christian doctrine is plainly discernible . His meditations on Man , Nature , and the Future , are not those of a pagan sage , however his language may sometimes consist even with a lofty pagan view of the universe ; on the contrary , he seems to think throughout as one in whose manner of transacting for himself those great and paramount conceptions that form the necessary matter of all real contemplation , that sweet and consoling modifica 588 // WORDS WORTH . qwq // his power of imaginatively reproducing it , in his fine series of Ecclesiastical Sonnets , wherein he traces , as in a series of bold retrospective glimpses , the history of Christianity in the British Islands . There are passages in these sonnets worth , for their historical effect , many pages of the writings of our ecclesiastical historians . Of the various other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will particularize but one more  --  the exquisite propriety and delicacy of his style ; his easy and perfect mastery over the element of language . Clearly enough he must have possessed the natural gift of rich and exuberant expression ; but it is equally evident that he must have , at a very early period , submitted this natural exuberance to a careful and classical training , and also that he must have bestowed his best pains in finishing , aecordin* to his own ideas of correctness , all his compositions individually . Hence greater smoothness and beauty , and more of strict logical coherence in Wordsworth 's style than is usual even among careful poets , as well as a more close fitting of the language to the measure of the thought , and a comparative freedom from forced rhymes and jarring evasions of natural forms of words . This appears even in the greater typographical neatness of a printed page of Wordsworth 's poetry , as compared , for example , with a printed page of Byron 's , the lax and dash-disrupted look of which suggests to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a greater literary haste . Specimens of Wordsworth 's extreme felicity of expression have already been given in previous extracts ; and in selecting for incessant repetition such poems of his as " We are Seven , " and such lines as those famous ones about the " yellow primrose , " the public have already indicated their appreciation in his case of this merit in particular . A quotation or two , however , illustrative of the same thing may here be added .

Sonnets . That we would assign to Wordsworth a high place among the poets of England , the whole tenor of our observations hitherto will have made clear . At the same time that he falls short of the very highes ; rank ; that he stands not on the top of our English Parnassus , where Chaucer , Milton and Spencer keep reverent company with Shakspeare , but rather on that upper slope of the mountain whence these greatest are visible , and wherQ vanotis other poets , some of whom are not yet dead , hold perhaps as just if not so fixed a footing : this , also , we trust we have been able to convey as part of our general impression . We do not think , for example , that Wordsworth was by any means so great a poet as Burns , comparing the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only in respect of general mental vigor and capacity , and not in respect to poetic genius per se , that such other men as Dryden , Pope , Scott , and Coleridge , could be justly put in comparison with Wordsworth , and , being so put in comparison , preferred to him on 590 // the whole ; yet there are other names still in our list of poets , for whom , even after the ground of competition has been thus restricted , we believe it would be possible to take up the quarrel . With all the faults of Byron , both moral and literary , we believe that in him the poetic efflux came from greater constitutional depths , and brought , if less pure , at least most fervent matter along with it than the poetry of lATordsworth ; had Keats and Shelley lived longer , even those that sneer at the Byronic might have seen poets comparable , in their estimation , to the Patriarch of the Lakes ; and should our noble Tennyson survive to us as a constant writer till his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , see qualities in him that predict for him a more than Wordsworthian fame . Keeping in view , therefore , these comparisons and contrasts , it seems proper that we should add to the foregoing enumeration of what we consider some of Wordsworth 's characteristic excellencies , a word or two descriptive of those accompanying defects to which it was probably owing that a man , so near the highest , did not quite reach it . First of all , then , as it seems to us , the intellect of Wordsworth , though very far from ordinary in its dimensions , and very assiduously developed by culture , was by no means of the largest known English calibre . Not to bring into the comparison such rare giants of our nation as Shakspeare , Bacon , and Milton , there have been , and probably still are , very many distinguished men in our island fit to rank intellectually as the peers of Wordsworth , or even as his superiors . Making the necessary discrimination between native intellectual strength to arrive at conclusions , and the soundness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson , Burke , Burns , David Hume , and not a few others that might be named , were undoubtedly men of more powerful intellect thanWordsworth . Partly owing to the time at which they lived , partly owing to causes for which they were personally more responsible , the intellectual conclusions of those men , or of some of them , may have been less noble and lofty than those of Wordsworth ; their favorite forms of thought more coarse ; their philosophy less true , deep , and ethereal . But their intellectual strength or grasp , their sense and insight , their whole available power to do , discern , and invent , were indubitably greater . Even of Pope , on whose reputation as a poet Wordsworth and his followers have been , in some respects justly , so severe , it might be maintained that , comparison of poetic merit apart , his was the denser and nimbler brain . Nor , we believe , would the greatest admirers of Wordsworth say that in force and reach of intellect he excelled his friend Coleridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings are , they want the depth , originality , and richness of the similar compositions of the old man eloquent . Wordsworth 's , in short , was not a massive or prodigious , but only a high and superior , intellect . Now , though we have already shown that it is not intellect as such that makes a man a poet , but that either a man may have a great intellect and be no poet , or may be a poet without having an extraordinary intellect ; yet having shown also that to constitute a great poet great intellect is essential , we may , in fact , assume it as a role that the measure of the general intellectual power of'any particular poet is also pro tanto a measure of his poetic excellence . According to this rule we should first apply the intellectual test , so as to decide Wordsworth 's place ( probably beside such men as Coleridge and Dryden ) in our general hierarchy of English men of letters of all sorts taken together ; then dividing this miscellaneous body into kinds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height among the poets ; and , lastly , allowing to the whole class of poets as much additional elevation as might be thought necessary , on the score of the inherent superiority of the poetical constitution as such , we would fix Wordsworth 's just place among all the ornaments of English literature . A second defect in Wordsworth as a poet is his want of humor . This charge has been made so often against other celebrated writers , that one is almost ashamed to bring it forward again in any new case whatever ; nevertheless , it is a charge of real weight against any one regarding whom it can be substantiated ; and it is hardly necessary to offer any proofs that it is true regarding Wordsworth . There are , indeed , poems of his , such as " The Wagoner , " " The IdiotBoy , " and the " Street Musician , " that display a kind of genial and warm interest in the little pleasant blunders an.d less than tragic mishaps of daily life ; but in such instances we seem to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old gentleman looking at matters , or hearing of them , with a hard , benevolent smile rather than as that of a man of hearty native humor recklessly enjoying what is jocose . There is no real mirth , no rich sense of the comic , in all that Wordsworth has written . In that full , sly love of a jest that must have lurked in the down-looking eye of Chaucer , as well as in the broad and manly capacity for laughter that distinguished Burns , the poet of the Lakes was totally wanting . Hence it is , that among all his characters , he has given us none such as the Host of the rj7abard in the " Canterbury Pilgrimage ; " and that living , as he did , in a notable part of England , the whole spirit and peculiarity of which he sought to make his own , he could not imbibe nor reproduce its humors . Whenever , in obedience apparently to an intellectual perception of the existence in society of such so-called " humors , " he attempts to introduce them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or betrays his natural seriousness , by keeping the moral lesson strictly in view . Now , although there have been really great poets , as , for example , Milton and Schiller , in whom this defect of humor was as marked as in Wordsworth , if not more so , yet in such cases it will be found that the defect did , after all , operate to some extent injuriously , and had to be made good in some way by very ample compensations . If Milton had not htimor 591 // he had a large measure of what may properly enough be called wit , and infinite power of scorn , and a tremendous mastery of the language of abuse and sarcasm . As regards Byron , also , not to mention Pope , it is impossible to say how much not only of his popularity , but also of his real worth as a poet , may depend on the quantity of admirable wit which he brought into the service of the Muses . But in Wordsworth there is almost as little of *vit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a benevolent seriousness , a rapt and spiritual state of feelings , and a mild and sacerdotal sympathy with all that he sees . He may feel contempt , as indeed few men are said to have done in a greater degree , but he has no art in the ludicrous expression of it ; he sometimes smiles , but he never laughs . And in a poet of actual English life , above all , this is to be regarded as a considerable disqualification . We hardly know how to indicate what we conceive to he another deficiency in Wordsworth as a poet , otherwise than by repeating the common criticism regarding him , that he wants energy , fire , impulse , intensity , passion . Our previous remarks will have guarded against any misconception of what we here mean . We believe that Wordsworth was , according to his own definition of a poet , " a man endowed with more lively sensibility , more enthusiasm and tenderness , than are supposed to be common among mankind ; " but what we now mean is something quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the demoniac , nothing of the Pythic , in the nature of Wordsworth . I surely not a man ungently made , are the fitting words he uses in describing himself . A calm , white-haired man , that could thrill to the beauty of a starry night , and not a swart-faced Titan , like Burns , full of strength and fire , was the poet of the Excursion . With all his pathos , and all his clearness of vision , there were sorrows of humanity he never touched , recesses of dark moral experience he could not pierce nor irradiate . We feel in his poetry as if we were talked with by some mild and persuasive preacher , rather than borne down by the experienced utterance of a large-hearted man . He does not move us to the depths of our being ; he only affects us gently . Now , one reason for this must evidently he , that naturally and by birth Wordsworth was deficient in some of the more formidable elements that enter into the constitution of man . Possessing in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he seeni8 to have been wanting in the Byronic elemeAt of personal impetus or passion . Moreover , and partly in consequence of this , he appears to have passed through the battle of life all but unwounded . This of itself would account for the placid , self-possessed , and often feeble style of his poetry . In the life of every man distinguished for what is called intensity of character , there will almost certainly be found some sore biog ? aphical circumstance-some fact deeper and more momentous than all the rest-some strictly historical source of melancholy , that must he discovered and investigated , if we would comprehend his ways . Man comes into this world regardless and unformed ; and although , in his gradual progress through it he necessarily acquires , by the mere use of his senses and by communication with others , a multitudinous store of impressions and convictions , yet , if there is to be anything specific and original in his life , this , it would seem , can only be produced by the operation upon him of some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new wakefulness , and evoking all that is latent in his nature , shall bind these impressions and convictions in a mass together , breathe through them the stern element of personal concern , and impart to them its seal and pressure . The experiences that most commonly perform this great function in the lives of men are those of Friendship and Love . The power of Love to rouse men to larger and ' more fervid views of nature has been celebrated since the beginning of time . A man that has once undergone Love 's sorrow in any extreme degree , is by that fact awakened at once and forever to the melancholy side of things he becomes alive to the gloomy in nature and to the miserable in life ; and by one stupendous resumption , as it were , of stars , clouds , trees , and flowers into his own pained being , like an old coinage requiring reissue , he realizes how it is that all creation groaneth and travaileth together in spirit until now . So , also , tItough perhaps more rarely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wordsworth , happily for himself , seems to have met with no such accident of revolution . Passing through the world as a pilgrim , pure-minded , and even sad with the sense of the mysterious past , and the prescience of the mysterious future , nothing occurred in his little journey to strike him down as a dead man , and agonize him into a full knowledge of the whole mystery of the present . Hence , as we believe , the want of that intensity in his poetry which we find in the writings not only of the so-called subjective poets , such as Byron and Dante , but also of the greatest objective poets , as Goethe and Shakspeare . The ink of Wordsworth is never his own blood . It is little more than an extension of the preceding remark , to say that Wordsworth was rather a poet or bard than ( if we may be allowed such a distinction ) a lyrist or minstrel . The purpose of the poet , using the term for the moment in this restricted sense , is simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective , as it is rounded out and made significant in his own mind ; the purpose of the lyrist or minstrel is to pour forth the passing emotions of his soul , and inflame other men with the fire that consumes himself . Accordingly , the faculties most special to the merely poetic exercise , as in the old Homeric epos or in modern descriptive verse , are those of intellect , sensibility , and imagination-passion or personal excitement being but a differential ingredi 592 // ent which may be more or less present according to circumstances , and which ought , as some think , to be absent from pure poetry altogether ; whereas , in lyrical effusion , on the other hand , passion or present excitement is nearly all in all . The poetry of Keats may be taken as a specimen of pure poetry as such ; all his chief poems are literally compositions , or creations , the results of a process by which the poet 's mind having projected itself into an entirely imaginary element , as devoid as possible of all connexion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly and fantastically at its own will and pleasure . As specimens , again , of the purely lyrical , we have all such pieces , ancient and modern , as are properly denominated psalms , odes , hymns , or songs . When , therefore , people talk , as they now incessantly do , of calmness as being essential to the poet ; and when , with Wordsworth , they define the poetic art to consist in the tranquil recollection of by-gone emotion , it is clear that they can have in view only pure poetry , the end of which , as we have said , is to represent in an imaginative manner some portion of the outward . For , of the lyrist or song-writer we would affirm precisely as we would affirm of his near kinsman , the orator , that the more of passion or personal impetus he has the better ; and so far from advising him to wait for complete tranquillity , we would advise him to select as the true lyrical moment , that first moment , whenever it is , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsided that his trembling hands can sweep the strings . But along with this difference comes another . The poet , in describing his scene or narrating his story , feels himself impelled to every legitimate mode of increasing the pleasure he conveys ; and the result , in one direction , is Metre . But however natural Metre may have been in its origin , it has now become to the poet rather a preestablished arrangement or available set of conditions to the rule of which , voluntarily and guided by his instinct for harmony , he adapts what he has already in other respects rendered complete , than a com pulsory suggestion of the poetic act itself careful for its own accoutrement . Not so , however , with the lyrist . As cadence or musical utterance is natural in an excited state of the feelings , so in lyrical poetry ought the song or melody to to be more than the words . The heart of the lyrist should be a perpetual fountain of song ; and when he is to hold direct communication with the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , from the depths of his being , ought to precede and necessitate all his actual speech . Now in this lyrical capability , this love of sound or cadence for its own sake , ( in which , by the by , we have remarked that the Scotch generally excel the English , ) Wordsworth is certainly inferior to many other poets . One might have inferred as much from the narrowness of his theory of verse ; but the fact is rendered still more apparent by a perusal of his poetical compositions themselves . Very few poets , we think , have been more admirable masters of poetic metre ; no versification that we know is more rich , various , and flexible , or more soothing to the ear than that of Wordsworth . But he is not a singer or a minstrel properly so called ; the lyric madness does not seize him ; verse with him is rather an exquisite variety of rhetoric , a legitimate esthetic device , than a necessary form of utterance . We do not think that in all Wordsworth there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the words , we are still haunted ( as we constantly are in Burns , Byron , and Tennyson ) by an obstinate recollection of the tune . Were we required to say in what particular portion of Wordsworth 's poetry he has shown most of this true lyric spirit in which we believe him to have been on the whole deficient , we should unhesitatingly mention his Sonnets . These are among the finest and most sonorous things in our language ; and it is by them , in connexion with his large poem Tite Excursion , or , as we may now say , The Recluse , that his great reputation will be most surely perpetuated .
