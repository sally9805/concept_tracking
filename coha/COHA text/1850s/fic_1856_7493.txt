Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : LITTLE CHARLIE . A LAMENT . from Little Charlie ( 1856 ) BY T. B. ALDRICH . O sunshine , making golden spots Upon the carpet at my feet  --  The shadows of the coming flowers ! The phantoms of forget-me-nots And roses red and sweet !  --  How can you seem so full of joy , And we so sad at heart and sore ?  --  Angel of death ! again thy wings Are folded at our door ! We can but yearn through length of days For something lost , we fancied ours : We 'll miss thee , darling , when the Spring Has touched the world to flowers ! For thou wast like that dainty month Which strews the violets at its feet : Thy life was slips of golden sun And silver tear-drops braided sweet ! For thou wast light and thou wast shade , And thine were sweet capricious ways !  --  Now lost in purple languors , now No bird in ripe red summer days Was half as wild as thou ! O little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  A pencil-mark upon the wall That " naughty hands " made thoughtlessly : And broken toys around the house  --  Where he has left them they have lain Waiting for little busy hands That will not come again ,  --  Will never come again ! Within the shrouded room below He lies a-cold  --  and yet we know It is not Charlie there ! It is not Charlie cold and white , It is the robe , that , in his flight He gently cast aside ! Our darling hath not died ! O rare pale lips ! O clouded eyes ! O violet eyes grown dim ! Ah , well ! this little lock of hair Is all of him ! Is all of him that we can keep For loving kisses , and the thought Of him and death may teach us more Than all our life hath taught ! God , walking over starry spheres , Did clasp his tiny hand , And led him , through a fall of tears , Into the Mystic Land ! Angel of death ! we question not : Who asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel ! we bless thee , for thy kiss Hath hushed the lips of Pain ! No " Wherefore ? " or " To what good end ? " Shall out of doubt and anguish creep Into our thought . We bow our heads : He giveth His beloved sleep !
