Annual Reports of the Commissioners , 4. c. of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report of the Trustees of the Massachusetts General Hospital . 1854 . THESE documents remind us of a class of charitable institutions among us , strongly indicative of the philanthropy and science of our times . Those worthy people who see , in the future progress of the race , only a steady increase of selfishness and vice , would do well to consider the history of the noble enterprise which has been so rapidly and satisfactorily accomplished . Eighty years ago we had not a single establishment devoted exclusively to the care and treatment of the insane . Now they number nearly thirty , and contain about six thousand patients , supported , more or less , at the public expense . If modern humanity had no greater triumph to record than this , it would be amply sufficient to redeem the character of the age from the imputations which the faithless and desponding have been too ready to cast upon it . Such is the contrast between the management of the insane now , and what it was fifty years ago , that one can scarcely help suspecting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by exaggeration and false coloring . But it is a fact , abundantly verified , that this unfortunate class has always included many who , long before the impress of the Divinity was entirely erased from their minds , were banished from the sight , and sooner or later , from the kindly sympathies of friends and relatives , and dragged on a wretched existence in jails and poor-houses , in cold and filth , in solitude and chains , abandoned to the tender mercies of ignorant and irresponsible keepers . Insanity is a terrible calamity at best , but then it was the climax of all human woes , for it contained an ingredient unknown in any other misfortune , - exclusion , not only from hearts and homes to which nature gave a claim , but from the sight of familiar faces , from the ministrations of kindness , and from every circumstance of hope or of joy . In this condition , the process of derangement and destruction was rapidly hastened , until nothing but a clod of the valley , a caput mortuum of humanity , remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of our country , the humblest individual , when stricken down by this calamity , receives the benefit of all the means and appliances which science has discovered and philanthropy brought into active operation , for the purpose of restoring him to himself and mitigating the evils incident to his lot . In comfortable apartments expressly designed for meeting the exigencies of his case , enjoying the pure air and light of heaven , perhaps in the midst of agreeable scenery , expending his surplus energies in useful employment , and guided in the ways of propriety by kind voices and gentle restrictions , he passes through the various stages of his disorder , whether terminating in recovery , or hopeless , chronic disease . And even when made fully aware of the magnitude of this contrast , few can properly appreciate the means by which the change was effected . When Pinel entered the cells of the Bic6tre , and struck off the chains of the furious maniacs , he manifested that kind of courage , of self-reliance , and of superiority to the current notions of the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to constitute an epoch in the history of the race . Without precedent and against the remonstrances of his friends , guided and supported only by a faith , enlightened by the results of observation , no doubt , but still , no less wonderful nor sublime than the highest inspirations of genius , he dealt the first and the decisive blow at a treatment which , repulsive as it was , seemed to be required by an imperious necessity . About the same time , similar views were successfully acted upon in England , by a true-hearted Quaker , Benjamin Tuke , who , in the spirit of his faith , conceived that the insane , as well as the sane , would be best managed by methods of kindness , conciliation , and good-will . Aided by the benevolence of his sect , he established an institution near York , the management of which was distinguished by the complete , systematic exclusion of everything harsh , whether regarded as punishment or necessary restraint . Of course , some time was required before the influence of these experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Long after the fame of the York Retreat had spread over the kingdom , and nobles had solicited the privilege of sharing its // benefits , men were slow to believe that there was no natural affinity between insanity , and chains and stripes , and one could not traverse a lunatic hospital even in England , without witnessing whips , fetters , or iron collars . To inspire the patient with fear , and break his will , at all hazards , by blows , confinement , and every species of contumely , if milder means could not effect the object , was the cardinal principle in the moral treatment of the insane , up to a very recent period . Within the memory of the present generation , and within two hours ' ride of this city , was a private establishment where bleeding and purgatives were not more relied upon , than harsh words , whipping , and partial drowning . The more refractory were inclosed in a coffin-like box pierced with holes , and then lowered into a well where they were kept submerged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when they were brought up , and by rubbing , warmth , and other restoratives , fully resuscitated . No attempt was made to conceal these practices . They were well known in the community , and supposed to belong to the most approved methods of treatment . In the infancy of even our most distinguished hospitals there was a deficiency of furniture and of other little conveniences , and a cheerh*ssn*ess in all their appointments , which would scarcely be tolerated now . In this country , the history of hospitals for the insane is comprised , for the most part , within a comparatively recent period . To the Old Dominion belongs the honor of possessing the first institution devoted exclusively to the care of the insane . It originated in an act of the Colonial government in 1769 , and the building was opened for patients in 1773 . Into the general hospitals founded in the principal cities , the insane had been admitted , with more or less special provision for their treatment . In some instances , one or two wards , in others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their exclusive use . Insanity in its recent state was supposed by medical men to require , like other acute diseases , an active medication and a low diet , and to this end their attention was chiefly directed . Its mental element was very little regarded , and consequently the idea of operating directly upon the mind could seldom be discerned in the treatment of the physician . The // general fact that such operation is beneficial was undoubtedly admitted , and remarkable instances thereof had been recorded , but all this was very far from a recognition of the great principle , that the restoration and comfort of the insane require , in addition to drugs and diet , a special management of the moral and intellectual faculties . When this principle began to be recognized in our country , the inappropriateness and inefficiency of the existing arrangements became obvious , and thus originated the opinion , now universally received , that the proper care and treatment of the insane require that they should be associated together in establishments devoted exclusively to them , at a little distance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an efficient moral treatment . Coincident with this opinion there arose another equally important to the accomplishment of great results , namely , that the pauper insane are morally , if not legally , the wards of the State , and that , in order to fulfil the duties of this relation , the State must provide institutions expressly designed for their custody and cure . Next to Virginia , Massachusetts recognized her obligation as a State to provide for the insane , and the generous style in which she began to discharge it was shown in the hospital at Worcester , which was opened in 1833 . From time to time other States followed the example , and now more than half of the whole number that compose the Union possess hospitals for their insane , supported , more or less , by their respective governments , while in several others the munificence of individuals has rendered the action of the State unnecessary . Any account of American institutions for the insane , without particular mention of an individual whose labors , if measured by their results , are unparalleled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting the play with the part of Hamlet left out . During the last twelve or fifteen years , this indefatigable woman , without the advantages of fortune or even of robust health , but relying solely on her own strong will and the goodness of her cause , has made particular investigation of the condition of the insane in at least a dozen of the States and three or four of the British provinces ; visiting , for this purpose , a large proportion of their jails , poor-houses , // and other receptacles of misfortune and disease . No obstacle has ever been allowed to deter her from pursuing and completing her inquiries . Steadily and quietly she has traversed the length and breadth of the land , and neither opposition nor reproach , neither the rigors of climate nor the pestilence that walketh at noonday , neither fatigue nor sickness , has found her , for a moment , faltering in her course . " In this voyage of discovery , this circumnavigation of charity , " probably no other individual ever witnessed so much physical and mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauging its dimensions and preparing the proper measures for its relief . The facts thus obtained have been laid before the Legislatures of the respective States , and have proved to be an irresistible appeal , without a single exception , to their sense of humanity and justice . In most instances an act establishing a hospital has been passed and carried into effect without unreasonable delay . On no other occasion have the State Legislatures so promptly and effectively responded to the benevolent instincts of the heart , as they have , during the last twenty-five years , in providing for the welfare of this unfortunate and helpless class of our fellow-men . It is to be regretted , however , that the movement has been too much controlled by economical considerations , and that too often the question has been , not how well , but how cheaply , the thing can be done . To meet this spirit , estimates of cost have been made too low , and consequently , points have been sacrificed that were absolutely necessary to the perfect attainment of the object . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to fill the ignorant with suspicion and distrust . Of course , in undertakings of this kind economy is not to be disregarde d , but when allowed to frustrate or mar an important end , it is no longer a virtue . The most superficial inspection of our lunatic hospitals will furnish abundant illustrations of this principle . Little conveniences that have become associated with every one 's ideas of domestic comfort may have been omitted ; the service is laborious , perhaps , and therefore imperfectly performed , for want of suitable arrangements ; the classification of the patients may be poorly provided for , or the fixtures // frail and inadequately secured , or the supply of water deficient , or the ventilation trusted to nature . The whole establishment has a narrow and cramped appearance , probably with a mean exterior , presenting , perhaps , some abortive attempts at architectural display , while the grounds have been suffered to remain very much as Providence left them . The lunatic hospital does not exist among us , in which nothing is wanted to fit it completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally understood how important a part architectural arrangements act in the custody and cure of the insane . They are a substitute , in some degree , for human vigilance and care , and in many ways are intimately coiinected with the comfort of the inmates . Instead of being a matter of secondary consideration , to be determined by the fancy of the builder , they are in fact of the highest importance , and if managed in a spirit of niggardly economy , the institution is deprived , to that degree , of its power to accomplish its purpose , and is as clearly a specimen of folly as a mill with an inadequate supply of power , or a vessel with too large a draught for the stream it is to navigate . The time will come , we hope , when nations will feel that their honor is more deeply affected by the condition of their benevolent institutions , than by those achievements in science or art which enable them to injure one another , or which , at most , only advance their material interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reaper that creates an epoch in the history of agricultural improvements , or a yacht that outsails the fleetest craft , or a fire-arm that does unparalleled execution , Mr. Bull immediately sets about getting up a better reaper , or a swifter yacht , or a more destructive fire-arm . This only induces the younger brother to gird up his loins , and determine to outstrip himself . But when a hospital has been established by either , capable of fulfilling its proper objects to an unprecedented degree , we have never heard of any wonderful alacrity being displayed by the other in excelling or even imitating it . Had it been otherwise , we should not now be obliged to record the fact , that , within half a dozen years , lunatic hospitals better than some of ours which we have been pleased to call models have been pulled // down in England , to make way for others embracing the improvements of the time . That every existing establishment should , in its turn , be left behind by the progress of improvement , is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint But when they go up , not only without those improvements which have been introduced elsewhere , but disfigured by wretched contrivances and arrangements strictly original , we can not help being chagrined and discouraged . Still we have faith to believe that we are not to be left behind in this sphere of benevolent enterprise , and that the nation which beats the universe in clippers , reapers , locks , and pistols , is not to be beaten without an effort in those institutions which are designed to accomplish a great work of humanity . From an undue regard for economy , and deficient information , a bad model for our lunatic asylums was early adopted , and we have gone on ever since , with an occasional exception , repeating all its defects , and dropping , one after another , its better features . The central part of the building was appropriated to the officers , the domestics , and the various services required in a large household . To each end of it was joined that portion of the structure designed expressly for the patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges of bedrooms opening upon an intermediate hall or gallery as it is called , eight or ten feet in breadth and from fifty to a hundred feet in length . If additional means of accoinmodation were required , a similar structure was repeated , either joining the other at right angles , or lapping on at its end and extending in a parallel line . Smaller structures , at a little distance , were erected for the violent and noisy classes . Day-rooms and dining-rooms were obtained by omitting the partitions between two or three bedrooms , though frequently the gallery itself served as a day-room . Bathing-rooms and water-closets were forced into some obscure corner , though the latter were not always found anywhere , in the older structures . The room appropriated to the attendant was one of the range of bedrooms , with no especial facilities for observation . The galleries were low , and imperfectly lighted at one or both ends , and the staircases by which they communicated were winding and narrow . The building was warmed by // means of stoves , cockles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an inadequate amount of fresh air , and also furnished no stinted supply of smoke or gas . A few flues in the walls , capable of carrying off a cupful of air , and terminating in the attic , performed the office of ventilation . The dread of expense and distrust of the patients led to a scanty supply of furniture , so that , beyond a bed by night and a bench by day , most of the patients had nothing around them but naked walls and a monotonous succession of bedroom doors . Even the rooms of the better classes were not always furnished with tables , looking-glasses , or wash-stands , and a carpet was something the wildest imagination had never dreamed of . The whole scene was cheerless , dismal , and forbidding ; and if the patient were cured , it was not , certainly , in consequence of any favorable influence exerted by objects immediately around him . The desire of obtaining something better has been occasionally felt , but from causes already adverted to , aided perhaps by a remarkable complacency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been slow and fitful . The erection of the McLean Asylum , in this vicinity , opened in 18t8 , gave the first notable impulse to the art of hospital construction in this country . True , the old model , such as we have described , was used , but all its better qualities were retained , and some of its imperfections improved . Comfortable day-rooms , eating-rooms , bathing-rooms , and water-closets were provided , the fixtures were convenient , substantial , and well finished , and the whole interior had a tolerably light and cheerful aspect . But it was in the addition subsequently built , under the direction chiefly of Dr. Wyman , the superintendent , that the greatest advance was made . Besides the mental qualities desirable in one having charge of the insane , this gentleman possessed a consfructive genius which was abundantly indicated in all his architectural arrangements . These he adapted to the peculiar exigencies of the insane with a degree of success which , under the circumstances , was certainly remarkable . He was not a man blindly to copy his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , generally , improved . The building which thus embodied the results of his ingenuity // and mechanical talent , and at the same time provided the means of carrying into effect his views of moral management , presented a great advance upon any previous structure of the kind . Many of its mechanical contrivances have never been surpassed , for the object was perfectly attained , though occasionally in a somewhat awkward and circuitous manner . Unlike too many who have labored in the same field , he never troubled himself with makeshifts . Whatever he did was designed for the future , and it bore indications of the substantial and the enduring . The lighter , frailer style of building , now so prevalent , may be cheaper in the outset , but it unquestionably is dearer in the end , and finally becomes not very agreeable to behold . The establishment which next followed the McLean Asylum was erected by the State of Massachusetts , at Worcester , and though , in its general character , not very different from the former , yet it wanted many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while its cheap and flimsy style of construction presented a striking contrast to the finished , massive features of the other . Being intended for the poorer classes , it was unwisely concluded that every subordinate object might be disregarded , provided the principal one - the custody of the patient - were secured . It was the first considerable example of very cheap construction , and one , unfortunately , which building-committees have been too ready to imitate . A few years afterwards , a hospital for the insane was erected near New York , and another near Philadelphia , - offshoots from the General Hospitals of those cities . They are both highly creditable to the country , and in many of their details could scarcely be improved . In the latter , the provisions for the violent classes have been carried to a degree of excellence that has never been surpassed . At both institutions much attention has been given to the improvement of the grounds by judicious planting , until they have become uncommonly beautiful . This is a point which has been deplorably neglected among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grounds around many of our hospitals for the insane . Few persons - sane or insane - have so little sense of beauty as not to be favorably impressed by trees and // July , shrubs , groves , gardens , walks and fountains , tastefully disposed ; and such impressions may be regarded as among the most salutary that can be made upon the disordered mind . It will be unnecessary to allude particularly to the hospitals that have been erected within the last eight or ten years . While the most of them have each some particular merit of its own , they labor under the common defect of being more or less behind the times . Desirous of avoiding this fault , the Trustees of the Butler Hospital in Providence , R. I. , before erecting their building , engaged Dr. Bell , the superintendent of the McLean Asylum , to visit Europe , in 184* , and gather such information as would be available for their purpose . Guided by the results of his observations abroad , as well as of his own practical experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differing in many important features from any other among us , and differing , we believe , for the better . It was adopted by the Trustees , with a few unessential changes required by their pecuniary means , and we doubt not it has exerted a favorable influence upon the progress of hospital construelion in this country . Its lofty ceilings , its broad galleries with only a single range of bedrooms , its appropriate arrangements for attendants , its commodious associated dormitories , and its graceful elevation , have been more or less copied in subsequent establishments , which , but for this example , might have been only repetitions of the old model . These institutions have now become so numerous that their proper functions and true position will soon , we trust , be more correctly appreciated than they have been hitherto . For several years past , the medical gentlemen who have charge of them have met together annually , in different places , to confer upon the various subjects connected with their calling , to exchange ideas , and from their mutual communications to derive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their conclusions , especially when sanctioned by the unanimous voice of the association , are justly entitled to a degree of confidence that would scarcely be claimed for the views of any individual . At their convention in 1851 , they put forth unanimously a series of propositions relative to the construction of hospitals for the insane , embodying the results to // which the progress of knowledge had unquestionably led . These have aiready been regarded with some deference by building-committees , and it is to be hoped that their authority will soon be universally recognized . Availing ourselves of their suggestions as well as the results of our own experience , we shall describe the most prominent of those arrangements which are desirable , if not indispensable , in a hospital for the insane . The general form now usually adopted for these establishments , being unquestionably the best adapted to our circumstances , while it also combines the greatest number of advantages , is what is called the linear , - the different portions of the edifice joining one another at their extremities , in regular succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several quadrangles of a single story , though well enough in such regions as France and Italy , where much of the patients ' time can , and indeed must be , spent in the open air , is inadmissible with us , where many circumstances , especially facilities of warming and ventilation , require a more concentrated arrangement . Whether the different portions of the edifice should be placed on the same or parallel lines , or join one another at right angles , is a question of subordinate importance , for each has its advantages , and in neither is any important point sacrificed . In this country they have usually been three stories high , but in an establishment designed for two hundred or two hundred and fifty patients , - and that should be the exfreine limit of capacity , - every purpose of convenience , to say nothing of architectural effect , can be obtained with two stories , excepting in the projections and extremities , which might be carried up an additional story , to be used for dormitories , or work-rooms . The kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , for many reasons , they had better be in a separate structure , either joined to or a little remote from the main one . If the former plan is adopted , the communication may be sufficiently interrupted to prevent the transmission of odors , by discontinuing the masonry at the point of junction , and substituting a lattice of iron or stone , provided with shutters . A current of air would then pass from one side to the other , and thus prevent , in a 7 // great measure , an evil of no fifing magnitude in an establishment where pure air is a necessary of life . The cellar may be used for store-rooms , warming-apparatus , &amp;c. , but never for patients ' rooms . The association declares , in the propositions just referred to , that no lodgingroom for patients should be below the level of the ground . Such rooms must always be badly lighted , and often so damp as to be unhealthy . In one of our largest hospitals , where they were extensively provided , it was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diarrhcea and dysentery , and they were finally abandoned . A more unfortunate attempt at economy has seldom been made , and we trust that no future building-committee will be fool-hardy enough to repeat it . The space on which the bedrooms open , called by the vari** ous names of hall , gallery , and corridor , is , in most of our institutions , a passage-way eight or ten feet wide , between two ranges of bedrooms , and imperfectly lighted at one or both ends . This gallery is something more than a means of access to the bedrooms , for it usually serves as a day-room . It should never be less than twelve feet wide , and should have but one range of rooms opening upon it . On the other side , the light should be admitted through spacious windows , and thus the inmates should have constantly before their eyes the surrounding country , which is , certainly , a more agreeable object to behold , than a monotonous range of doors in a dreary expanse of brick wall . This form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have abandoned it solely from considerations of economy . It is always desirable that there should be connected with the gallery an apartment to be used especially as a day-room . Where the gallery is merely a walk between two ranges of rooms , this is indispensable ; and even where there is but one range , such a room is required for the inmates to retire to when the gallery is washed or swept . It has a more domestic look than a long gallery , and that alone makes an agreeable impression . Besides the single bedrooms , provision should be made for lodging a portion of the patients in associated dormitories. // They have been but recently introduced in this country , and form a very important improvement in our modes of accommodation . This has always been the method in general hospitals , but it was supposed to be improper for the insane , under the apprehension that they would disturb , if not injure , one another . This objection , however , is found in practice not to be well grounded . Disturbances may occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and the attendant is at hand , as he always should be , they must be exceedingly rare , and easily quieted . The apprehension of danger from sudden outbreaks or mischievous impulses is felt only by those who have had but little practical acquaintance with the insane , since accidents of this kind have seldom occurred . The advantages possessed by associated dormitories over single ones , in regard to some classes of patients , have been too clearly exhibited to those who have been conversant with their operation , to leave any room for doubt on the subject . To the timid , who fear to be alone , they are far more agreeable than single rooms , and for the suicidal , as well as many others who require some supervision in the night , they are preferable , because the necessary watching can be more easily and effectually performed . Not only so , but it is questionable whether the objections urged against these rooms are not actually outweighed by those which lie against single rooms . The proportion of inmates for which they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social condition ; and we can only say it should range from one fifth to one third of the whole number . They should be designed for not less than four nor more than twelve , and should always be contiguous to a water-closet and an attendant 's room . The attendants ' rooms , as usually located , present no facility for observation , nor any other advantage . In the Butler Hospital they are placed at the right angle formed by the junction of two galleries , and thus are equally accessible from both galleries , while the attendants are thus enabled the more readily to act in concert . The room too forming a thoroughfare between the two galleries , the attendants are themselves sub ject to an easy supervision , and this is no slight advantage . The common practice has been to provide every gallery // with a bathing-room ; but for the most part such rooms should be placed in the cellar or basement . We thus save room for more important purposes , and avoid the dampness and exposure which render the bathing operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with similar limitations , the dining-rooms , which are usually contiguous to the gallery , may be placed in some other part of the house . This is the arrangement at the Philadelphia Hospital , and though on some accounts approved , it is , we believe , open to objections that more than counterbalance all its advantages . But whichever plan may be adopted , each group of patients occupying a gallery should be kept distinct from the others , while at their meals , as well as at other times . The objects of a proper classification would be frustrated by intercourse there as effectually as any . where else . This result would seem to be quite obvious ; but in the new hospital at Taunton , all the patients upon each story , some forty in number , and occupying three different galleries , are brought to their meals in a common room . If such an arrangement do not prove highly inconvenient , to say the least of it , then , certainly , we shall have a new fact in the art of managing hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisy class has always been a subject of much diversity of opinion , because every practicable mode involves some unavoidable disadvantage . The course adopted to some extent in Europe , and generally here , is to place them in smaller buildings at a little distance from the main edifice . In this way , perhaps , their noise is not so audible to others , but there is reason to fear that this result is obtained by the sacrifice of more important considerations . Any arrangement which withdraws the patient from the easy and effectual supervision of the officers is inadmissible , except from the clearest necessity . No class requires such supervision more than the one in question . Being the least capable of caring for themselves , they most demand the interposition of the attendant , who , moreover , is most likely to abuse his power , under the trials of temper incident to the care of such patients . Their condition is not only more variable , but the superior discernment of the physician is often needed , to perceive the changes in their sanitary state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might otherwise sometimes escape observation . That the kind of supervision which is indispensably necessary to the welfare of these patients is prevented , in a great degree , where they are placed in separate buildings , none will deny who have been conversant with both arrangements . Can any one suppose that a part of the establishment which can be reached only by going into the open air , and encountering such weather as may happen to offer , will be as often and as closely inspected , as those which are under the same roof ? Besides , the transference of patients from the principal building to these outhouses can not always be effected , without improper exposure of the person and irritation of the feelings . To enter a patient 's room in the night , hastily put on his clothes , and bear him off to another place of confinement , is an act well adapted to excite his fears and to leave disagreeable impressions . By having the galleries designed for this class of patients component parts of the main building , we avoid all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need to encounter that which is most strongly apprehended , - the annoyance supposed to be inevitably caused by their proximity to others . Where these apartments are placed at the extremities of the building , the transmission of sound may be almost entirely prevented by interposing a range of closets and entries ; or , what is still better , by having the walls entirely separate , but connected by some lattice contrivance . Apartments for violent patients need differ but little , in appearance , from others , excepting one or two on the male side . It is of immense importance that the impressions made upon patients in the more active stage of the disease should be as little calculated as possible to excite the idea of imprisonment , or to connect their recolleCtions of this period with painful associations . In their calmer intervals , when capable of observing what is around them , they should not be reminded of a jail , nor even miss the little conveniences which they can appreciate . For the most part , their sleepingrooms should be provided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battened , and the walls plastered with mortar made of hydraulic lime , they will have all the necessary strength , without its being obtrusively apparent . // July , In furnishing them , as well as the halls on which they open , everything should be avoided that would tend to produce disagreeable impressions . The fixtures and the finishing should be strong , no doubt , but it does not follow , as the common practice among us would indicate , that no other consideration need be cared for . Nothing could more effectually nourish the suspicions and alarms that torment the insane mind , than the apartments too often allotted to the patients in question . We have seen some grievous specimens of this kind , which we were disposed to attribute to the imperfect notions that would naturally attend the earlier stages of this enterprise ; but it has been reserved for our own time and our own Commonwealth to outdo them all , in every quality capable of suggesting ideas of wretchedness and degradation . In the new hospital at Taunton , the apartments for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other term can give a better idea of their peculiar form and aspect - entirely surrounded by a narrow walk . To complete their resemblance to the cells of a jail , the walls are of brick neither plastered nor painted , the floors of stone , and the doors formed of round iron bars . They are lighted indirectly from the windows that open on the walk , and warmed , ostensibly , by hot air admitted through the door from the walk . How hot this air must be made in order to warm the stone floors , on which the inmates frequently lie entirely divested of clothing , is a question which was probably never considered by the buildingcommittee . We are also obliged to add , that in this part of the house , where , of all others , is required the amplest provision for cleanliness , not a bathing-room nor a water-closet is to be found . True , these accommodations are not far off but they are placed in a different gallery and designed for thirty or forty other patients . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the establishment as nearly like a jail as possible , - as strong and as repulsive , - the attempt could not have been more successful . Nothing in the arrangements of a hospital for the insane is more closely connected with the comfort and health of the inmates , than the method of warming and ventilation . Within a few years this has been a subject of much discussion and // experiment , and some diversity of opinion still prevails . Everybody understands that , in apartments occupied by a considerable number of persons , the air becomes vitiated by their respiration and perspiration , especially if they are sick ; and everybody admits that this vitiated air must somehow be expelled , and replaced by pure air . How this change can be best effected is the question sought to be answered in the various methods of ventilation which have been introduced or proposed . Next to the primitive method , which leaves the matter to the doors and windows , the oldest and most prevalent in our hospitals is to make flues in the walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vitiated air is supposed to rise , and thence to escape by openings in the roof ; while the fresh air is admitted from without into a chamber in the basement or cellar , and thence distributed , by flues in the walls , to the different apartments . In cold weather , the fresh air is first warmed by coming into contact with some heating apparatus . This contrivance is probably better than none , though very far from accomplishing the object . If the foul air would always rise , and the fresh air always follow it , this method would be tolerably satisfactory , though the current might not be rapid enough to maintain the purity of the air . But neither theory nor experiment shows that such is actually the fact . Whether the internal air ascends or not , must depend entirely on its temperature as compared with that of the external air . So long as the former is the warmest , as it often is , undoubtedly , it will rise and escape ; but otherwise the current is just as likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most favorable circumstances , there are always , in apartments arranged like those of a hospital , local or temporary draughts , sufficient to prevent the regular and uniform discharge of the vitiated air . This fact is sufficiently evident to the senses , in all those parts of the house where the condition of the patients requires the most active ventilation . It may now be regarded as one of the established facts of science , that no method of ventilating a hospital is really entitled to the name , which does not depend on some artificial force . By the arrangement which has proved most efficient and economical , the foul-air flues lead to a central shaft heated by // fire or steam , the rarefaction of the air thus produced becoming a strong exhaustive power . Several hospitals and prisons in England are ventilated in this way , and the principle has just been admirably applied in a part of the McLean Asylum and in the hospital at Taunton , although in the latter the foul-air flues are quite too few and small for the work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the halls . must pass through the sleeping-rooms in order to escape . Instead of a special structure for this purpose , the chimney which serves for the kitchen , bakery , laundry , &amp;c. may be constructed with a ventilating-flue so connected with the smoke-flue as to be warmed by its heat . Thus we obtain a sufficient power , day and night , summer and winter , without the slightest expense for maintenance . A method of warming the air in hospitals , almost universal until recently , is to introduce it into a chamber in the basement , where it is heated by a furnace or stove of some kind , and thence distributed by flues to the different parts of the house . By this means , the air is often vitiated by coming in contact with red-hot iron , the smoke and ashes escape through leaks in the apparatus , and find their way into the apartments , the moving of fuel and ashes is a noisy and dirty process , and the numerous fires increase the danger of conflagration . For these reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot water , circulating through pipes laid in the air-chamber , is used for imparting heat to the fresh air , the boiler being placed in a separate structure . The use of steam and of hot water for warming buildings is so recent , that their relative merits are not yet satisfactorily settled . Steam requires more expensive fixtures , and the cost of its production is greater . It needs to be managed by a person somewhat skilled in the apparatus , whose unexpected absence would be followed by great inconvenience , - a contingency not to be disregarded in a community not abounding in this class of men . The fixtures for hot water are much less expensive , , and its management can be easily learned . The only point open to doubt is the efficiency of this plan , for it has not been so extensively tried as to render its success in cold climates unquestionable . In a part of the McLean Asy* // mm it has been used for the last three years , with satisfactory results , and in the Maine Hospital at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These instances would seem to remove any reasonable doubt of the practical efficiency of hot water in any part of New England . In those states of the weather when a little , and but a little , warmth is required , and especially in our Southern States , in the coldest seasons , this method of warming seems to be peculiarly suitable , because the amount of heat can be more easily regulated than by any other mode . The external appearance of the hospital may be supposed to have but little , if any , connection with its principal objects , - the comfort and restoration of the patients . As it regards the greater part of them , certainly , this may be true , but there are some on whom the aspect of the building leaves a strong impression . This class of persons is steadily increasing with the general progress of refinement , and especially with the growing conviction of the superior advantages possessed by these institutions over every other method of managing the insane . It is a matter of duty , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect is adapted to excite , by giving to the buildings such forms , proportions , and arrangements as are calculated to gratify a correct taste . This has seldom been done among us , for most of our hospitals not only exhibit the mean and ungraceful appearance which characterizes our public buildings in general , but they have an additional ugliness peculiarly their own . It is one of our national fallacies to believe that the graceful and pleasing in architecture is necessarily expensive , under the impression that it depends entirely on costly decorations . Hence , with our proclivity to economy , it would seem as if we had determined to make our hospitals as unsightly as possible . With few exceptions , they weary the eye with their monotonous walk of brick or stone , three or four stories high , pierced with numerous apertures for letting in light , and unrelieved by hood-moulding or drip-stone , pilaster or arch , projection or recess . When , by chance , some outlay is decided upon for a mere matter of taste , it is lavished , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prinvoL . Lxxix. - NO. 164. 8 // principal entrance , or a dismal cupola perched like an incubus on the roof . Our people have yet to learn that such decorations , even when faultless in themselves , impart no architectural beauty to an edifice otherwise devoid of it . The ugliest pile of brick and stone among our lunatic hospitals needed only its row of noble columns in front , that cost enough to have made it one of the finest buildings in the country , to force its ugliness irresistibly upon the spectator . It needs to be impressed upon this generation , that a pleasing architectural effect can be produced , not by a special ornament thrust in here and there , as if to monopolize the admiration of the beholder , but only by the harmonious arrangement of the different parts , by correctness of proportion , by the graceful forms of the essential members , and especially by a unity of spirit and purpose pervading the whole structure . The enormities that have been committed on our public buildings , in the shape of unmeaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste than by any regard for economy . Not many months since , the most erninent architect in our country was requested to furnish a design for the elevation of a lunatic hospital about to be erected not far from this city . The design was prepared , and , as might have been expected , was peculiarly appropriate and beautiful . Nobody supposed that it would prove expensive , but the building-committee were more taken with that of the confractor , in which the ornamental work consisted of a series of pilasters projecting from the wall at intervals of some fifteen or twenty feet , and of a set of cupolas of assorted sizes ; and accordingly this plan was forthwith embodied in wood and brick . Insanity is bad enough at best ; but to oblige the unhappy sufferer , whose sense of the beautiful in nature or art may not be impaired , to behold , day after day , an exhibition of architectural ugliness , is to put a new element of bitterness into his bitter cup . In hospitals for the insane , the elevation must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter , if well adapted to its purpose , will admit of all the freedom the architect could wish . The style of building which will be found to meet the various ends of a hospital for the insane in the best manner , while it gratifies the most fastidious taste , is what is techni // cally called the Elizabethan . It has , both from association and use , a strongly domestic character , and therefore is peculiarly appropriate to these establishments , in which it is desirable to avoid whatever might suggest the idea of something special and public . Frequent interruptions in the line of the ground plan find no impediment in the elevation , the projections of which , by throwing large masses of the building into shadow , give it an air of dignity and grace not to be found in any considerable extent of unbroken surface . Towers , which belong to this style of construction , would be a convenient receptacle for stair-cases , water-closets , bathing-rooms , &amp;c. , and the diversity of size and shape admissible in the doors and windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they are required . The same kind of flexibility in regard to more important portions of the edifice , renders their enlargement easy when required , without affecting their mutual adaptation and dependence . The roofs too , which are apt to be unsightly objects , may be rendered quite pleasing by means of dormer windows and clustered chimneys . In England , the Surrey Asylum , near Wandsworth , and in our own country , the hospital just erected in Nashville , Tennessee , which in point of architectural merit may challenge comparison with any similar American building , show what a pleasing effect may be produced by the tasteful introduction of the distinctive features of the Tudor style . The Lombard style , recently brought into notice by Mr. Hope , is also beautifully appropriate to buildings which , like lunatic hospitals , are composed of several extensive ranges . An example of this kind may be seen in the railway station at Providence , designed by a rising artist , who has the rare merit of seeking to please , rather by investing the essential parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a profuse display of decoration having no reference to anything else . If any class of buildings in the world should be constructed with reference to security against fire , it certainly is hospitals for the insane , while , in fact , none are more deficient in this respect . The question is now beginning to be agitated , whether the public good does not require the exclusive employment of incombustible materials in the construction of stores and other // July , similar buildings in crow*led streets , and it is not improbable that , within a few years , wood will be but little used for this purpose . If the protection of property demands this kind of security against fire , much more should that of human life , under the extraordinary exposure to which it is subjected in a hospital for the insane . Iron , stone , or bricks could be substituted for wood in all parts , unless , perhaps , we except the flooring , which , in our cold climates , would be hardly comfortable if made of any other material than wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon bricks or tiles . Provision should be made for keeping a considerable quantity of water in the attics , for the exclusive purpose of arresting fires . It should be conducted to the cellar in metallic pipes connected with hydrants in every gallery , to which hose may be applied . By this means , the expense of which is trifling , every part of the building may be flooded , with scarcely a moment 's delay . It would , in all human probability , have prevented the deplorable conflagration which destroyed the lunatic hospital of a neighboring State , and with it a score or more of helpless beings . Other provisions should not be neglected , but they will vary with the circumstances of the different establishments . Where a steam-engine is used , it should be able , by means of a suitable contrivance , to draw water and throw it wherever it might be needed . At the Butler Hospital , in addition to both of these provisions , a rotary pump placed in front of the building and worked by horses , draws water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of hose , can throw it on any part of the roof . We are unwilling to leave the subject without a word upon the kind of supervision and direction usually provided for the building of lunatic hospitals . Here is the source of most of their deficiencies , and while it continues , it would be idle to expect a better class of institutions . The first step is the appointment of a building-committee , whose business it is to procure a plan , make the confracts , and superintend the work . Their most common qualification for the office is a little political notoriety ; their least common , a practical acquaintance with these institutions , and a familiarity with the details of construction . In fact , most of them , had they been appointed // to build a clipper-ship or to codify the laws of the State would have been as well fitted for the service by their pre . vious habits or pursuits . As a sort of preparatory exercise , they visit similar institutions within a few hours ' ride , look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps take notes of what they see and hear . Apparently , this is a very proper way of attaining their object ; but actually it is often useless , and sometimes worse . Not knowing exactly what to observe , or , rather , observing everything with equal attention , having no clew to the points most entitled to inquiry , incapable of distinguishing the essential from the accidental , or a defect from a merit , the result is only an accumulation of irrelevant and undigested facts . Puzzled and perplexed with conflicting views , unable to analyze the evidence before them , and to fix its relative value , completely bewildered in a maze of new and peculiar facts , they become ready at last to catch at any suggestion that promises , in any way , to exfricate them from their embarrassment ; and the conclusion of the whole matter is a patched-up plan for which nobody is willing to be responsible . The physician appointed to take charge of the institution , finding arrangements totally unsuitable for certain purposes , in addition to general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trustees , to whom the committee have given up the building , for alterations absolutely necessary , in his opinion , to render the inmates safe and comfortable . Of course , something is done , but an ungrateful work like this is never thoroughly effected , and thus every year brings with it a host of fresh wants which should have been provided for in the beginning , and many of which can never afterwards be properly met . Water-closets and wash-basins that would be torn up within a week can be easily replaced by more substantial fixtures ; but many a blunder embodied in brick or stone will always remain , defying every attempt at change . All this arises from a fundamental mistake of the building-committee , in supposing that the proper discharge of their duty requires that they should make themselves acquainted with points of a strictly professional nature . These personal investigations , as they are usually and almost necessarily pursued , may afford some gratification , 8* // but can never accomplish the object sought for . It is a very significant fact , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were preceded by the most diligent and extensive personal investigations on the part of the buildingcommittee . True , no other method would be likely to be followed by entire success , but flagrant and intolerable errors might be avoided . Let building-committees advertise for plans , submit them , when offered , to the examination of men practically conversant with these institutions , and obtain their views respecting the plans , and their reasons for or against each of them ; and then they are in a position to decide satisfactorily upon conflicting opinions . Their decision may be erroneous in many respects , but it will have the merit of being intelligent and well matured . This is the course adopted with regard to other edifices , and we see no reason to believe that it is not equally applicable to hospitals for the insane .
