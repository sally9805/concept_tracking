txt //I believe , about eleven o'clock , and found quite a number already in the drawing room . I had met Macaulay before , but as you have not , you will of course ask a lady 's first question , " How does he look ? " Well , my dear , so far as relates to the mere outward husk of the soul , our engravers and daguerreotypists have done their work as well as they usually do . The engraving that you get in the best editions of his works may be considered , I suppose , a fair representation of how he looks , when he sits to have his picture taken , which is generally very different from the way any body looks at any other time . People seem to forget , in taking likenesses , that the features of the face are nothing but an alphabet , and that a dry , dead map of a person 's face gives no more idea how one looks than the simple presentation of an alphabet shows what there is in a poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great strength and stamina of constitution . He has the kind of frame which we usually imagine as peculiarly English ; short , stout , and firmly knit . There is something hearty in all his demonstrations . He speaks in that full , round , rolling voice , deep from the chest , which we also conceive of as being more common in England than America . As to his conversation , it is just like his writing ; that is to say , it shows very strongly the same qualities of mind . I was informed that he is famous for a most uncommon memory ; one of those men to whom it seems impossible to forget any thing once read ; and he has read all sorts of things that can be thought of , in all languages . A gentleman told me that he could repeat all the old Newgate literature , hanging ballads , last speeches , and dying confessions ; while his knowledge of Milton is so accurate , that , if his poems were blotted out of existence , they might be restored simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin and Greek classics , and to much of the literature of modern Europe . Had nature been required to make a man to order , for a perfect historian , nothing better could have been put together , especially since there is enough of the poetic fire included in the composition , to fuse all these multiplied materials together , and color the historical crystallization with them . Macaulay is about fifty . He has never married ; yet there are unmistakable evidences in the breathings and aspects of the family circle by whom he was surrounded , that the social part is not wanting in his conformation . Some very charming young lady relatives seemed to think quite as much of their gifted uncle as you might have done had he been yours . Macaulay is celebrated as a conversationalist ; and , like Coleridge , Carlyle , and almost every one who enjoys this reputation , he has sometimes been accused of not allowing people their fair share in conversation . This might prove an objection , possibly , to those who wish to talk ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none to me . I must say , however , that on this occasion the matter was quite equitably managed . There were , I should think , some twenty or thirty at the breakfast table , and the conversation formed itself into little eddies of two or three around the table , now and then welling out into a great bay of general discourse . I was seated between Macaulay and Milman , and must confess I was a little embarrassed at times , because I wanted to hear what they were both saying at the same time . However , by the use of the faculty by which you play a piano with both hands , I got on very comfortably . Milman 's appearance is quite striking ; tall , stooping , with a keen black eye and perfectly white hair  --  a singular and poetic contrast . He began upon architecture and Westminster Abbey  --  a subject to which I am always awake . I told him I had not yet seen Westminster ; for I was now busy in seeing life and the present , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death and the past . Milman was for many years dean of Westminster , and kindly offered me his services , to indoctrinate me into its antiquities . Macaulay made some suggestive remarks on cathedrals generally . I said that I thought it singular that we so seldom knew who were the architects that designed these great buildings ; that they appeared to me the most sublime efforts of human genius . He said that all the cathedrals of Europe were undoubtedly the result of one or two minds ; that they rose into existence very nearly contemporaneously , and were built by travelling companies of masons , under the direction of some systematic organization . Perhaps you knew all this before , but I did not ; and so it struck me as a glorious idea . And if it is not the true account of the origin of cathedrals , it certainly ought to be ; and , as our old grandmother used to say , " I 'm going to believe it . " Looking around the table , and seeing how every body seemed to be enjoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties were a novelty to me ; that we never had them in America , but that I thought them the most delightful form of social life . He seized upon the idea , as he often does , and turned it playfully inside out , and shook it on all sides , just as one might play with the lustres of a chandelier  --  to see them glitter . He expatiated on the merits of breakfast parties as compared with all other parties . He said dinner parties are mere formalities . You invite a man to dinner because you must invite him ; because you are acquainted with his grandfather , or it is proper you should ; but you invite a man to breakfast because you want to see him . You may be sure , if you are invited to breakfast , there is something agreeable about you . This idea struck me as very sensible ; and we all , generally having the fact before our eyes that we were invited to breakfast , approved the sentiment . " Yes , " said Macaulay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never gets an invitation to breakfast . " " Rather hard on the poor bores , " said a lady . " Particularly , " said Macaulay , laughing , " as bores are usually the most irreproachable of human beings . Did you ever hear a bore complained of when they did not say that he was the best fellow in the world ? For my part , if I wanted to get a guardian for a family of defenceless orphans , I should inquire for the greatest bore in the vicinity . I should know that he would be a man of unblemished honor and integrity . " The conversation now went on to Milton and Shakspeare . Macaulay made one remark that gentlemen are always making , and that is , that there is very little characteristic difference between Shakspeare 's women . Well , there is no hope for that matter ; so long as men are not women they will think so . In general they lump together Miranda , Juliet , Desdemona , and Viola , " As matter too soft a lasting mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or fair . " It took Mrs. Jameson to set this matter forth in her Characteristics of Women ; a book for which Shakspeare , if he could get up , ought to make her his best bow , especially as there are fine things ascribed to him there , which , I dare say , he never thought of , careless fellow that he was ! But , I take it , every true painter , poet , and artist is in some sense so far a prophet that his utterances convey more to other minds than he himself knows ; so that , doubtless , should all the old masters rise from the dead , they might be edified by what posterity has found in their works . Some how or other , we found ourselves next talking about Sidney Smith ; and it was very pleasant to me , recalling the evenings when your father has read and we have laughed over him , to hear him spoken of as a living existence , by one who had known him . Still , I have always had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he put his wit , in abusing good old Dr. Carey , and the missionaries in India ; nay , in some places he even stooped to be spiteful and vulgar . I could not help , therefore , saying , when Macaulay observed that he had the most agreeable wit of any literary man of his acquaintance , " Well , it was very agreeable , but it could not have been very agreeable to the people who came under the edge of it , " and instanced his treatment of Dr. Carey . Some others who were present seemed to feel warmly on this subject , too , and Macaulay said ,  --  " Ah , well , Sidney repented of that , afterwards . " He seemed to cling to his memory , and to turn from every fault to his joviality , as a thing he could not enough delight to remember . Truly , wit , like charity , covers a multitude of sins . A man who has the faculty of raising a laugh in this sad , earnest world is remembered with indulgence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of note present at this breakfast , whose conversation I had not an opportunity of hearing , as they sat at a distance from me . There was Lord Glenelg , brother of Sir Robert Grant , governor of Bombay , whose beautiful hymns have rendered him familiar in America . The favorite one , commencing " When gathering clouds around I view , " was from his pen . Lord Glenelg , formerly Sir Charles Grant , himself has been the author of several pieces of poetry , which were in their time quite popular . The historian Hallam was also present , whose Constitutional History , you will remember , gave rise to one of Macaulay 's finest reviews ; a quiet , retiring man , with a benignant , somewhat sad , expression of countenance . The loss of an only son has cast a shadow over his life . It was on this son that Tennyson wrote his " In Memoriam . " Sir Robert H. Inglis was also present , and Mr. S. held considerable conversation with him . Knowing that he was both high tory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find him particularly gentle and bland in manners , earnest and devout in religious sentiment . I have heard him spoken of , even among dissenters , as a devout and earnest man . Another proof this of what mistakes we fall into when we judge the characters of persons at a distance , from what we suppose likely to be the effect of their sentiments . We often find the professed aristocrat gentle and condescending , and the professed supporter of forms spiritual . I think it very likely there may have been other celebrities present , whom I did not know . I am always finding out , a day or two after , that I have been with somebody very remarkable , and did not know it at the time . After breakfast we found , on consulting our list , that we were to lunch at Surrey parsonage . Of all the cities I was ever in , London is the most absolutely unmanageable , it takes so long to get any where ; wherever you want to go it seems to take you about two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city is a distance that seems all but interminable . London is now more than ten miles long . And yet this monster city is stretching in all directions yearly , and where will be the end of it nobody knows . Southey says , " I began to study the map of London , though dismayed at its prodigious extent . The river is no assistance to a stranger in finding his way ; there is no street along its banks , and no eminence from whence you can look around and take your bearings . " You may take these reflections as passing through my mind while we were driving through street after street , and going round corner after corner , towards the parsonage . Surrey Chapel and parsonage were the church and residence of the celebrated Kowland Hill . At present the incumbent is the Rev. Mr. Sherman , well known to many of our American clergy by the kind hospitalities and attentions with which he has enriched their stay in London . The church maintains a medium rank between Congregationalism and Episcopacy , retaining part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kindness of Mr. Sherman had assembled here a very agreeable company , among whom were Farquhar Tupper , the artist Cruikshank , from whom I received a call the other morning , and Mr. Pilatte , M. P. Cruikshank is an old man with gray hair and eyebrows , strongly marked features , and keen eyes . He talked to me something about the promotion of temperance by a series of literary sketches illustrated by his pencil . I sat by a lady who was well acquainted with Kingsley , the author of Alton Locke , Hypatia , and other works , with whom I had some conversation with regard to the influence of his writings . She said that he had been instrumental in rescuing from infidelity many young men whose minds had become unsettled ; that he was a devoted and laborious clergyman , exerting himself , without any cessation , for the good of his parish . After the company were gone I tried to get some rest , as my labors were not yet over , we being engaged to dine at Sir Edward Buxton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We never tried the experiment again of going to three parties in one day . By the time I got to my third appointment I was entirely exhausted . I met here some , however , whom I was exceedingly interested to see ; among them Samuel Gurney , brother of Elizabeth Fry , with his wife and family . Lady Edward Buxton is one of his daughters . All had that air of benevolent friendliness which is characteristic of the sect . Dr. Lushington , the companion and venerable associate of Wilberforce and Clarkson , was also present . He was a member of Parliament with Wilberforce forty or fifty years ago . He is now a judge of the admiralty court , that is to say , of the law relating to marine affairs . This is a branch of law which the nature of our government in America makes it impossible for us to have . He is exceedingly brilliant and animated in conversation . Dr. Cunningham , the author of World without Souls , was present . There was there also a master of Harrow School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several reasons ; that once , when the queen visited the school , she put to him the inquiry , " whether the educational system of England did not give a disproportionate attention to the study of the ancient classics . " His reply was , " that her majesty could best satisfy her mind on that point by observing what men the public schools of England had hitherto produced ; " certainly a very adroit reply , yet one which would be equally good against the suggestion of any improvement whatever . We might as well say , see what men we have been able to raise in America without any classical education at all ; witness Benjamin Franklin , George Washington , and Roger Sherman . It is a curious fact that Christian nations , with one general consent , in the early education of youth neglect the volume which they consider inspired , and bring the mind , at the most susceptible period , under the dominion of the literature and mythology of the heathen world ; and that , too , when the sacred history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divinity expend their forces in commenting on and teaching things which would be utterly scouted , were an author to publish them in English as original compositions . A Christian community has its young men educated in Ovid and Anacreon , but is shocked when one of them comes out in English with Don Juan ; yet , probably , the latter poem is purer than either . The English literature and poetry of the time of Pope and Dryden betray a state of association so completely heathenized , that an old Greek or Roman raised from the dead could scarce learn from them that any change had taken place in the religion of the world ; and even Milton often pains one by introducing second-hand pagan mythology into the very shadow of the eternal throne . In some parts of the Paradise Lost , the evident imitations of Homer are to me the poorest and most painful passages . The adoration of the ancient classics has lain like a dead weight on all modern art and literature ; because men , instead of using them simply for excitement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the classics have been used , I think , wonderful as have been the minds educated under them , there would have been more variety and originality without them . With which long sermon on a short text , I will conclude my letter . LETTER XX . Thursday , May 12 . My dear I. :  --  Yesterday , what with my breakfast , lunch , and dinner , I was , as the fashionable saying is , " fairly knocked up . " This expression , which I find obtains universally here , corresponds to what we mean by being " used up . " They talk of Americanisms , and I have a little innocent speculation now and then concerning Anglicisms . I certainly find several here for which I can perceive no more precedent in the well of " English undefiled , " than for some of ours ; for instance , this being " knocked up , " which is variously inflected , as , for example , in the form of a participial adjective , as a " knocking up " affair ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say " such a person has got quite a knocking up , " and so on . The fact is , if we had ever had any experience in London life we should not have made three engagements in one day . To my simple eye it is quite amusing to see how they manage the social machine here . People are under such a pressure of engagements , that they go about with their lists in their pockets . If A wants to invite B to dinner , out come their respective lists . A says he has only Tuesday and Thursday open for this week . B looks down his list , and says that the days are all closed . A looks along , and says that he has no day open till next Wednesday week . B , however , is going to leave town Tuesday ; so that settles the matter as to dining ; so they turn back again , and try the breakfasting ; for though you can not dine in but one place a day , yet , by means of the breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are strong enough . Then there are evening parties , which begin at ten o'clock . The first card of the kind that was sent me , which was worded , " At home at ten o'clock , " I , in my simplicity , took to be ten in the morning . But here are people staying out night after night till two o'clock , sitting up all night in Parliament , and seeming to thrive upon it . There certainly is great apology for this in London , if it is always as dark , drizzling , and smoky in the daytime as it has been since I have been here . If I were one of the London people I would live by gaslight as they do , for the streets and houses are altogether pleasanter by gaslight than by daylight . But to ape these customs under our clear , American skies , so contrary to our whole social system , is simply ridiculous . This morning I was exceedingly tired , and had a perfect longing to get but of London into some green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So kind Mrs. B. had the carriage , and off we drove together . By and by we found ourselves out in the country , and then I wanted to get out and walk . After a while a lady came along , riding a little donkey . These donkeys have amused me so much since I have been here ! At several places on the outskirts of the city they have them standing , all girt up with saddles covered with white cloth , for ladies to ride on . One gets out of London by means of an omnibus to one of these places , and then , for a few pence , can have a ride upon one of them into the country . Mrs. B. walked by the side of the lady , and said to her something which I did not hear , and she immediately alighted and asked me with great kindness if I wanted to try the saddle ; so I got upon the little beast , which was about as large as a good-sized calf , and rode a few paces to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gait , and if the creature were not so insignificantly small , as to make you feel much as if you were riding upon a cat , it would be quite a pleasant affair . After dismounting I crept through a hole in a hedge , and looked for some flowers ; and , in short , made the most that I could of my interview with nature , till it came time to go home to dinner , for our dinner hour at Mr. B. 's is between one and two ; quite like home . In the evening we were to dine at Lord Shaftesbury 's . After napping all the afternoon we went to Grosvenor Square . There was only a small , select party , of about sixteen . Among the guests were Dr. McAll , Hebrew professor in King 's College , Lord Wriothesley Russell , brother of Lord John , and one of the private chaplains of the queen , and the Archbishop of Canterbury . Dr. McAll is a millenarian . He sat next to C. at table , and they had some conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of progress in the English mind . While I was walking down to dinner with Lord Shaftesbury , he pointed out to me in the hall the portrait of his distinguished ancestor , Antony Ashley Cooper , Earl of Shaftesbury , whose name he bears . This ancestor , notwithstanding his sceptical philosophy , did some good things , as he was the author of the habeas corpus act . After dinner we went back to the drawing rooms again ; and while tea and coffee were being served , names were constantly being announced , till the rooms were quite full . Among the earliest who arrived was Mr.  --   --  , a mulatto gentleman , formerly British consul at Liberia . I found him a man of considerable cultivation and intelligence , evincing much good sense in his observations . I overheard some one saying in the crowd , " Shaftesbury has been about the chimney sweepers again in Parliament . " I said to Lord Shaftesbury , " I thought that matter of the chimney sweepers had been attended to long ago , and laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws , " said he , " but people wo n't keep them unless we follow them up . " He has a very prompt , cheerful way of speaking , and throws himself into every thing he talks about with great interest and zeal . He introduced me to one gentleman , I forget his name now , as the patron of the shoeblacks . On my inquiring what that meant , he said that he had started the idea of providing employment for poor street boys , by furnishing them with brushes and blacking , and forming them into regular companies of shoeblacks . Each boy has his ' particular stand , where he blacks the shoes of every passer by who chooses to take the trouble of putting up his foot and paying his twopence . Lord Shaftesbury also presented me to a lady who had been a very successful teacher in the ragged schools ; also to a gentleman who , he said , had been very active in the London city missions . Some very ingenious work done in the ragged schools was set on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . I talked a little while with Lord Wriothesley Russell . From him we derived the idea that the queen was particularly careful in the training and religious instruction of her children . He said that she claimed that the young prince should be left entirely to his parents , in regard to his religious instruction , till he was seven years of age ; but that , on examining him at that time , they were equally surprised and delighted with his knowledge of the Scriptures . I must remark here , that such an example as the queen sets in the education of her children makes itself felt through all the families of the kingdom . Domesticity is now the fashion in high life . I have had occasion to see , in many instances , how carefully ladies of rank instruct their children . This argues more favorably for the continuance of English institutions than any thing I have seen . If the next generation of those who are born to rank and power are educated , in the words of Fenelon , to consider these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of the poor , the problem of life in England will become easier of solution . Such are Lord Shaftesbury 's views , and as he throws them out with unceasing fervor in his conversation and conduct , they can not but powerfully affect not only his own circle , but all circles through the kingdom . Lady Shaftesbury is a beautiful and interesting woman , and warmly enters into the benevolent plans of her husband . A gentleman and lady with whom I travelled said that Lord and Lady Shaftesbury had visited in person the most forlorn and wretched parts of London , that they might get , by their own eyesight , a more correct gauge of the misery to be relieved . I did not see Lord Shaftesbury 's children ; but , from the crayon likenesses which hung upon the walls , they must be a family of uncommon beauty . I talked a little while with the Bishop of Tuam . I was the more interested to do so because he was from that part of Ireland which Sibyl Jones has spoken of as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How are you doing now , in that part of the country ? There has been a great deal of misery there , I hear . " He said " There has been , but we have just turned the corner , and now I hope we shall see better days . The condition of the people has been improved by emigration and other causes , till the evils have been brought within reach , and we feel that there is hope of effecting a permanent improvement . " While I was sitting talking , Lord Shaltesbury brought a gentleman and lady , whom he introduced as Lord Chief Justice Campbell and Lady Strathheden . Lord Campbell is a man of most dignified and imposing personal presence ; tall , with a large frame , a fine , high forehead , and strongly marked features . Naturally enough , I did not suppose them to be husband and wife , and when I discovered that they were so , expressed a good deal of surprise at their difference of titles ; to which she replied , that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of titles . She seemed quite interested to inquire into our manner of living and customs , and how they struck me as compared with theirs . The letter of Mrs. Tyler was much talked of , and some asked me if I supposed Mrs. Tyler really wrote it , expressing a little civil surprise at the style . I told them that I had heard it said that it must have been written by some of the gentlemen in the family , because it was generally understood that Mrs. Tyler was a very ladylike person . Some said , " It does us no harm to be reminded of our deficiencies ; we need all the responsibility that can be put upon us . " Others said , " It is certain we have many defects ; " but Lord John Campbell said , " There is this difference between our evils and those of slavery : ours exist contrary to law ; those are upheld by law . " I did not get any opportunity of conversing with the Archbishop of Canterbury , though this is the second time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most prepossessing man in his appearance  --  simple , courteous , mild , and affable . He was formerly Bishop of Chester , and is now Primate of all England . It is some indication of the tendency of things in a country to notice what kind of men are patronized and promoted to the high places of the church . Sumner is a man refined , gentle , affable , scholarly , thoroughly evangelical in sentiment ; to render him into American phraseology , he is in doctrine what we should call a moderate New School man . He has been a most industrious writer ; one of his principal works is his Commentary on the New Testament , in several volumes ; a work most admirably adapted for popular use , combining practical devotion with critical accuracy to an uncommon degree . He has also published a work on the Evidences of Christianity , in which he sets forth some evidences of the genuineness of the gospel narrative , which could only have been conceived by a mind of peculiar delicacy , and which are quite interesting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geology , which is highly spoken of by Sir Charles Lyell and others . If I may believe accounts that I hear , this mild and moderate man has shown a most admirable firmness and facility in guiding the ship of the establishment in some critical and perilous places of late years . I should add that he is warmly interested in all the efforts now making for the good of the poor . Among other persons of distinction , this evening , I noticed Lord and Lady Palmerston . A lady asked me this evening what I thought of the beauty of the ladies of the English aristocracy : she was a Scotch lady , by the by ; so the question was a fair one . I replied , that certainly report had not exaggerated their charms . Then came a home question  --  how the ladies of England compared with the ladies of America . " Now for it , patriotism , " said I to myself ; and , invoking to my aid certain fair saints of my own country , whose faces I distinctly remembered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women than I had in America . Grieved was I to be obliged to add , " But your ladies keep their beauty much later and longer . " This fact stares one in the face in every company ; one meets ladies past fifty , glowing , radiant , and blooming , with a freshness of complexion and fulness of outline refreshing to contemplate . What can be the reason ? Tell us , Muses and Graces , what can it be ? Is it the conservative power of sea fogs and coal smoke  --  the same cause that keeps the turf green , and makes the holly and ivy flourish ? How comes it that our married ladies dwindle , fade , and grow thin  --  that their noses incline to sharpness , and their elbows to angularity , just at the time of life when their island sisters round out into a comfortable and becoming amplitude and fulness ? If it is the fog and the sea coal , why , then , I am afraid we never shall come up with them . But perhaps there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most beautiful girls in the world produces so few beautiful women . Have not our close-heated stove rooms something to do with it ? Have not the immense amount of hot biscuits , hot corn cakes , and other compounds got up with the acrid poison of saleratus , something to do with it ? Above all , has not our climate , with its alternate extremes of heat and cold , a tendency to induce habits Of in-door indolence ? Climate , certainly , has a great deal to do with it ; ours is evidently more trying and more exhausting ; and because it is so , we should not pile upon its back errors of dress and diet which are avoided by our neighbors . They keep their beauty , because they keep their health . It has been as remarkable as any thing to me , since I have been here , that I do not constantly , as at home , hear one and another spoken of as in miserable health , as very delicate , &c.; Health seems to be the rule , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the most favorable omen that I know of for female beauty in America is , the multiplication of water cure establishments , where our ladies , if they get nothing else , do gain some ideas as to the necessity of fresh air , regular exercise , simple diet , and the laws of hygiene in general . There is one thing more which goes a long way towards the continued health of these English ladies , and therefore towards their beauty ; and that is , the quietude and perpetuity of their domestic institutions . They do not , like us , fade their cheeks lying awake nights ruminating the awful question who shall do the washing next week , or who shall take the chambermaid 's place , who is going to be married , or that of the cook , who has signified her intention of parting with the mistress . Their hospitality is never embarrassed by the consideration that their whole kitchen cabinet may desert at the moment that their guests arrive . They are not obliged to choose between washing their own dishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to the mercy of a foreigner , who has never done any thing but field work . And last , not least , they are not possessed with that ambition to do the impossible in all branches , which , I believe , is the death of a third of the women in America . What is there ever read of in books , or described in foreign travel , as attained by people in possession of every means and appliance , which our women will not undertake , single-handed , in spite of every providential indication to the contrary ? Who is not cognizant of dinner parties invited , in which the lady of the house has figured successively as confectioner , cook , dining-room girl , and , lastly , rushed up stairs to bathe her glowing cheeks , smooth her hair , draw on satin dress and kid gloves , and appear in the drawing room as if nothing were the matter ? Certainly the undaunted bravery of our American females can never enough be admired . Other women can play gracefully the head of the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hand , and foot , all at once ? As I have spoken of stoves , I will here remark that I have not yet seen one in England ; neither , so far as I can remember , have I seen a house warmed by a furnace . Bright coal fires , in grates of polished steel , are as yet the lares and penates of old England . If I am inclined to mourn over any defection in my own country , it is the closing up of the cheerful open fire , with its bright lights and dancing shadows , and the planting on our domestic hearth of that sullen , stifling gnome , the air-tight . I agree with Hawthorne in thinking the movement fatal to patriotism ; for who would fight for an airtight ! I have run on a good way beyond our evening company ; so good by for the present . LETTER XXI May 13 . Dear father :  --  To-day we are to go out to visit your Quaker friend , Mr. Alexander , at Stoke Newington , where you passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At half past nine we went into the Congregational Union , which is now in session . I had a seat upon the platform , where I could command a view of the house . It was a most interesting assemblage to me , recalling forcibly our New England associations , and impressing more than ever on my mind how much of one blood the two countries are . These earnest , thoughtful , intelligent-looking men seemed to transport me back to my own country . They received us with most gratifying cordiality and kindness . Most naturally Congregationalism in England must turn with deep interest and sympathy to Congregationalism in America . In several very cordial addresses they testified their pleasure at seeing us among them , speaking most affectionately of you and your labors , and your former visit to England . The wives and daughters of many of them present expressed in their countenances the deepest and most affectionate feeling . It is cheering to feel that an ocean does not divide our hearts , and that the Christians of America and England are one . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place is called Paradise , and very justly , being one more of those home Edens in which England abounds , where , without ostentation or display , every appliance of rational enjoyment surrounds one . We were ushered into a cheerful room , opening by one glass door upon a brilliant conservatory of flowers , and by another upon a neatly-kept garden . The air was fresh and sweet with the perfume of blossoming trees , and every thing seemed doubly refreshing from the contrast with the din and smoke of London . Our chamber looked out upon a beautiful park , shaded with fine old trees . While contemplating the white draperies of our windows , and the snowy robings of the bed , we could not but call to mind the fact , of which we were before aware , that not an article was the result of the unpaid oil of the slave ; neither did this restriction , voluntarily assumed , fetter at all the bountifulness of the table , where free-grown sugar , coffee , rice , and spices seemed to derive a double value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quakers carry the principle so far as to refuse money in a business transaction which they have reason to believe has been gained by the unpaid toil of the slave . A Friend in Edinburgh told me of a brother of his in the city of Carlisle , who kept a celebrated biscuit bakery , who received an order from New Orleans for a thousand dollars worth of biscuit . Before closing the bargain he took the buyer into his counting room , and told him that he had conscientious objections about receiving money from slaveholders , and that in case he were one he should prefer not to trade with him . Fortunately , in this case , consistency and interest were both on one side . Things like these can not but excite reflection in one 's mind , and the query must arise , if all who really believe slavery to be a wrong should pursue this course , what would be the result ? There are great practical difficulties in the way of such a course , particularly in America , where the subject has received comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am informed by the Friends here , that there has been for many years an association of Friends in Philadelphia , who have sent their agents through the entire Southern States , entering by them into communication with quite a considerable number scattered through the states , who , either from poverty or principle , raise their cotton by free labor ; that they have established a depot in Philadelphia , and also a manufactory , where the cotton thus received is made into various household articles ; and thus , by dint of some care and self-sacrifice , many of them are enabled to abstain entirely from any participation with the results of this crime . As soon as I heard this fact , it flashed upon my mind immediately , that the beautiful cotton lands of Texas are as yet unoccupied to a great extent ; that no law compels cotton to be raised there by slave labor , and that it is beginning to be raised there to some extent by the labor of free German emigrants . Footnote : One small town in Texas made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not something eventually grow out of this ? I trust so . Even the smallest chink of light is welcome in a prison , if it speak of a possible door which courage and zeal may open . I can not as yet admit the justness of the general proposition , that it is an actual sin to eat , drink , or wear any thing which has been the result of slave labor , because it seems to me to be based upon a principle altogether too wide in extent . To be consistent in it , we must extend it to the results of all labor which is not conducted on just and equitable principles ; and in order to do this consistently we must needs , as St. Paul says , go out of the world . But if two systems , one founded on wrong and robbery , and the other on right and justice , are competing with each other , should we not patronize the right ? I am the more inclined to think that some course of this kind is indicated to the Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are casting upon us , for patronizing their cotton . At all events , the Quakers escape the awkwardness of this dilemma . In the evening quite a large circle of friends came to meet us . We were particularly interested in the conversation of Mr. and Mrs. Wesby , missionaries from Antigua . Antigua is the only one of the islands in which emancipation was immediate , without any previous apprenticeship system ; and it is the one in which the results of emancipation have been altogether the most happy . They gave us a very interesting account of their schools , and showed us some beautiful specimens of plain needlework , which had been wrought by young girls in them . They confirmed all the accounts which I have heard from other sources of the peaceableness , docility , and good character of the negroes ; of their kindly disposition and willingness to receive instruction . After tea Mr. S. and I walked out a little while , first to a large cemetery , where repose the ashes of Dr. Watts . This burying ground occupies the site of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir T. Abney , with whom Dr. Watts spent many of the last years of his life . It has always seemed to me that Dr. Watts 's rank as a poet has never been properly appreciated . If ever there was a poet born , he was that man ; he attained without study a smoothness of versification , which , with Pope , was the result of the intensest analysis and most artistic care . Nor do the most majestic and resounding lines of Dryden equal some of his in majesty of volume . The most harmonious lines of Dryden , that I know of , are these :  --  " When Jubal struck the chorded shell , His listening brethren stood around , And wondering , on their faces fell , To worship that celestial sound . Less than a God they thought there could not dwell Within the hollow of that shell , That spoke so sweetly and so well . " The first four lines of this always seem to me magnificently harmonious . But almost any verse at random in Dr. Watts 's paraphrase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in melody and majesty . For instance , take these lines :  --  " Wide as his vast dominion lies , Let the Creator 's name be known ; Loud as his thunder shout his praise , And sound it lofty as his throne . Speak of the wonders of that love Which Gabriel plays on every chord : From all below and all above , Loud hallelujahs to the Lord . " Simply as a specimen of harmonious versification , I would place this paraphrase by Dr. Watts above every thing in the English language , not even excepting Pope 's Messiah . But in hymns , where the ideas are supplied by his own soul , we have examples in which fire , fervor , imagery , roll from the soul of the poet in a stream of versification , evidently spontaneous . Such are all those hymns in which he describes the glories of the heavenly state , and the advent of the great events foretold in prophecy ; for instance , this verse from the opening of one of his judgment hymns :  --  " Lo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears ; The sweet immortal morning sheds Its blushes round the spheres . " Dr. Johnson , in his Lives of the Poets , turns him off with small praise , it is true , saying that his devotional poetry is like that of others , unsatisfactory ; graciously adding that it is sufficient for him to have done better than others what no one has done well ; and , lastly , that he is one of those poets with whom youth and ignorance may safely be pleased . But if Dr. Johnson thought Irene was poetry , it is not singular that he should think the lyrics of Watts were not . Stoke Newington is also celebrated as the residence of De foe . We passed by , in our walk , the ancient mansion in which he lived . New River , which passes through the grounds of our host , is an artificial stream , which is said to have been first suggested by his endlessly fertile and industrious mind , as productive in practical projects as in books . It always seemed to me that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use the English language effectively should study ; and these are Shakspeare , Bunyan , and Defoe . One great secret of their hold on the popular mind is their being so radically and thoroughly English . They have the solid grain of the English oak , not veneered by learning and the classics ; not inlaid with arabesques from other nations , but developing wholly out of the English nationality . I have heard that Goethe said the reason for the great enthusiasm with which his countrymen regarded him was , that he did know how to write German , and so also these men knew how to write English . I think Defoe the most suggestive writer to an artist of fiction that the English language affords . That power by which he wrought fiction to produce the impression of reality , so that his Plague in London was quoted by medical men as an authentic narrative , and his Life of a Cavalier recommended by Lord Chatham as an historical authority , is certainly worth an analysis . With him , undoubtedly , it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our friends , brought to mind with new power the annoyances to which the Quakers have been subjected in England , under the old system of church rates . It being contrary to the conscientious principles of the Quakers to pay these church rates voluntarily , they allowed the officers of the law to enter their houses and take whatever article he pleased in satisfaction of the claim . On one occasion , for the satisfaction of a claim of a few pounds , they seized and sold a most rare and costly mantel clock , which had a particular value as a choice specimen of mechanical skill , and which was worth four or five times the sum owed . A friend afterwards repurchased and presented it to the owner . We were rejoiced to hear that these church rates are now virtually abolished . The liberal policy pursued in England for the last twenty-five years is doing more to make the church of England , and the government generally , respectable and respected than the most extortionate exactions of violence . We parted from our kind friends in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Burnard , the sculptor , who entertained me with various anecdotes . He had taken the bust of the Prince of Wales ; and I gathered from his statements that young princes have very much the same feelings and desires that other little boys have , and that he has a very judicious mother . In the afternoon , Mr. S. , Mrs. B. , and I had a pleasant drive in Hyde Park , as I used to read of heroines of romance doing in the old novels . It is delightful to get into this fairyland of parks , so green and beautiful , which embellish the West End . In the evening we had an engagement at two places  --  at a Highland School dinner , and at Mr. Charles Dickens 's . I felt myself too much exhausted for both , and so it was concluded that I should go to neither , but try a little quiet drive into the country , and an early retirement , as the most prudent termination of the week . While Mr. S. prepared to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. took me a little drive into the country . After a while they alighted before a new Gothic Congregational college , in St. John 's Wood . I found that there had been a kind of tea-drinking there by the Congregational ministers and their families , to celebrate the opening of the college . On returning , we called for Mr. S. , at the dinner , and went for a few moments into the gallery , the entertainment being now nearly over . Here we heard some Scottish songs , very charmingly sung ; and , what amused me very much , a few Highland musicians , dressed in full costume , occasionally marched through the hall , playing on their bagpipes , as was customary in old Scottish entertainments . The historian Sir Archibald Alison , sheriff of Lanarkshire , sat at the head of the table  --  a tall , fine-looking man , of very commanding presence . About nine o'clock we retired . May 15 . Heard Mr. Binney preach this morning . He is one of the strongest men among the Congregationalists , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , with a finely-built head , high forehead , piercing , dark eye , and a good deal of force and determination in all his movements . His sermon was the first that I had heard in England which seemed to recognize the existence of any possible sceptical or rationalizing element in the minds of his hearers . It was in this respect more like the preaching that I had been in the habit of hearing at home . Instead of a calm statement of certain admitted religious facts , or exhortations founded upon them , his discourse seemed to be reasoning with individual cases , and answering various forms of objections , such as might arise in different minds . This mode of preaching , I think , can not exist unless a minister cultivates an individual knowledge of his people . Mr. Binney 's work , entitled How to make the best of both Worlds , I have heard spoken of as having had the largest sale of any religious writing of the present day . May 16 . This evening is the great antislavery meeting at Exeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands before the public as the representation of the strong democratic , religious element of England . In Exeter Hall are all the philanthropies , foreign and domestic ; and a crowded meeting there gives one perhaps a better idea of the force of English democracy  --  of that kind of material which goes to make up the mass of the nation  --  than any thing else . When Macaulay expressed some sentiments which gave offence to this portion of the community , he made a defence in which he alluded sarcastically to the bray of Exeter Hall . The expression seems to have been remembered , for I have often heard it quoted ; though I believe they have forgiven him for it , and concluded to accept it as a joke . The hall this night was densely crowded , and , as I felt very unwell , I did not go in till after the services had commenced  --  a thing which I greatly regretted afterwards , as by this means I lost a most able speech by Lord Shaftesbury . The Duchess of Sutherland entered soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered . When we came in , a seat had been reserved for us by her grace in the side gallery , and the cheering was repeated . I thought I had heard something of the sort in Scotland , but there was a vehemence about this that made me tremble . There is always something awful to my mind about a dense crowd in a state of high excitement , let the nature of that excitement be what it will . I do not believe that there is in all America more vehemence of democracy , more volcanic force of power , than comes out in one of these great gatherings in our old fatherland . I saw plainly enough where Concord , Lexington , and Bunker Hill came from ; and it seems to me there is enough of this element of indignation at wrong , and resistance to tyranny , to found half a dozen more republics as strong as we are . A little incident that occurred gave me an idea of what such a crowd might become in a confused state of excitement . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policeman attempted to force a way through the densely-packed crowd . The services were interrupted for a few moments , and there were hoarse surgings and swellings of the mighty mass , who were so closely packed that they moved together like waves . Some began to rise in their seats , and some cried " Order ! order ! " And one could easily see , that were a sudden panic or overwhelming excitement to break up the order of the meeting , what a terrible scene might ensue . " What is it ? " said I to a friend who sat next to me . " A pickpocket , perhaps , " said she . " I am afraid we are going to have a row . They are going to give you one of our genuine Exeter Hall ' brays . ' " I felt a good deal fluttered ; but the Duchess of Sutherland , who knew the British lion better than I did , seemed so perfectly collected that I became reassured . The character of the speeches at this meeting , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had more to pain the national feelings of an American , than any I had ever attended . It was the real old Saxon battle axe of Brother John , swung without fear or favor . Such things do not hurt me individually , because I have such a radical faith in my country , such a genuine belief that she will at last right herself from every wrong , that I feel she can afford to have these things said . Mr. S. spoke on this point , that the cotton trade of Great Britain is the principal support to slavery , and read extracts from Charleston papers in which they boldly declare that they do not care for any amount of moral indignation wasted upon them by nations who , after all , must and will buy the cotton which they raise . The meeting was a very long one , and I was much fatigued when we returned . To-morrow we are to make a little run out to Windsor . LETTER XXII . May 18 . Dear M. :  --  I can compare the embarrassment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulants to curiosity and desire , only to that annual perplexity which used to beset us in our childhood on thanksgiving day . Having been kept all the year within the limits which prudence assigns to well-regulated children , came at last the governor 's proclamation , and a general saturnalia of dainties for the little ones . For one day the gates of license were thrown open , and we , plumped down into the midst of pie and pudding exceeding all conception but that of a Yankee housekeeper , were left to struggle our way out as best we might . So here , beside all the living world of London , its scope and range of persons and circles of thought , come its architecture , its arts , its localities , historic , poetic , all that expresses its past , its present , and its future . Every day and every hour brings its ' conflicting allurements , of persons to be seen , places to be visited , things to be done , beyond all computation . Like Miss Edgeworth 's philosophic little Frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man must want , and of what he may want ; and in our list of the former we set down , in large and decisive characters , one quiet day for the exploration and enjoyment of Windsor . We were solicited , indeed , to go in another direction ; a party was formed to go down the Thames with the Right Hon. Sidney Herbert , secretary at war , and visit an emigrant ship just starting for Australia . I should say here , that since Mrs. Chisholm 's labors have awakened the attention of the English public to the wants and condition of emigrants , the benevolent people of England take great interest in the departing of emigrant ships . A society has been formed called the Family Colonization Loan Society , and a fund raised by which money can be loaned to those desiring to emigrate . This society makes it an object to cultivate acquaintance and intimacy among those about going out by uniting them into groups , and , as far as possible , placing orphan children and single females under the protection of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan , can secure one passage . Each individual becomes responsible for refunding his own fare , and , furthermore , to pay a certain assessment in case any individual of the group fails to make up the passage money . The sailing of emigrant ships , therefore , has become a scene of great interest . Those departing do not leave their native shore without substantial proofs of the interest and care of the land they are leaving . In the party who were going down to-day were Mr. and Mrs. Binney , Mr. Sherman , and a number of distinguished names ; among whom I recollect to have heard the names of Lady Hatherton , and Lady Byron , widow of the poet . This would have been an exceedingly interesting scene to us , but being already worn with company and excitement , we preferred a quiet day at Windsor . For if we took Warwick as the representative feudal estate , we took Windsor as the representative palace , that which imbodies the English idea of royalty . Apart from this , Windsor has been immortalized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park the Herne oak , where the mischievous fairies played their pranks upon old Falstaff . And the castle still has about it the charm of the poet 's invocation :  --  " Search Windsor Castle , elves , within , without , Strew good luck , ouphes , on every sacred room , That it may stand till the perpetual doom In state as wholesome as in state ' t is fit , Worthy the owner , and the owner it . The several chairs of order , look you , scour With juice of balm and every precious flower , Each fair instalment , coat , and several crest , With loyal blazon evermore be blest . And nightly , meadow fairies , look you , sing Like to the garter 's compass , in a ring . The expressure that it bears , green let it be , More fertile , fresh , than all the field to see , And Honi soit qui mal y pense , write In emerald tufts , flowers , purple , blue , and white , Like sapphire , pearl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As if for the loyal purpose of recommending old Windsor , the English skies had cleared up into brightness . About nine o'clock we found ourselves in the cars , riding through a perpetual garden of blooming trees and blossoming hedges ; birds in a perfect fury of delight . Our spirits were all elated . Good , honest , cackling Mrs. Quickly herself was not more disposed to make the best of every thing and every body than were we . Mr. S. , in particular , was so joyous that I was afraid he would break out into song , after the fashion of Sir Hugh Evans ,  --  " Melodious birds sung madrigals : Whenas I sat in Babylon , " &c.; By the by , the fishing ground of Izaak Walton is one of the localities connected with Windsor . The ride was done all too soon . One should not whirl through such a choice bit of England in the cars ; one should rather wish to amble over the way after a sleepy , contemplative old horse , as we used to make rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all that 's bright must fade , and this among the rest . About eleven o'clock we found ourselves going up the old stone steps to the castle . It was the last day of a fair which had been holden in this part of the country , and crowds of the common people were flocking to the castle , men , women , and children pattering up the stairs before and after us . We went first through the state apartments . The principal thing that interested me was the ball room , which was a perfect gallery of Vandyke 's paintings . Here was certainly an opportunity to know what Vandyke is . I should call him a true court painter  --  a master of splendid conventionalities , whose portraits of kings are the most powerful arguments for the divine right I know of . Nevertheless , beyond conventionality and outward magnificence , his ideas have no range . He suggests nothing to the moral and ideal part of us . Here again was the picture of King Charles on horseback , which had interested me at Warwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm from its position at the end of that long , dim corridor , vis-a-vis with the masque of Cromwell , which did not accompany it here , where it was but one among a set of pictures . There was another , presenting the front side and three quarters face of the same sovereign , painted by Vandyke for Benini to make a bust from . There were no less than five portraits of his wife , Henrietta Maria , in different dresses and attitudes , and two pictures of their children . No sovereign is so profusely and perseveringly represented . The queen 's audience chamber is hung with tapestry representing scenes from the book of Esther . This tapestry made a very great impression upon me . A knowledge of the difficulties to be overcome in the material part of painting is undoubtedly an unsuspected element of much of the pleasure we derive from it ; and for this reason , probably , this tapestry appeared to us better than paintings executed with equal spirit in oils . We admired it exceedingly , entirely careless what critics might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hung with Gobelin tapestry representing the whole of the tragedy of Medea . First you have Jason cutting down the golden fleece , while the dragon lies slain , and Medea is looking on in admiration . In another he pledges his love to Medea . In a third , the men sprung from the dragon 's teeth are seen contending with each other . In another the unfaithful lover espouses Creusa . In the next Creusa is seen burning in the poisoned shirt , given her by Medea . In another Medea is seen in a car drawn by dragons , bearing her two children by Jason , whom she has stabbed in revenge for his desertion . Nothing can exceed the ghastly reality of death , as shown in the stiffened limbs and sharpened features of those dead children . The whole drawing and grouping is exceedingly spirited and lifelike , and has great power of impression . I was charmed also by nine landscapes of Zuccarelli , which adorn the state drawing room . Zuccarelli was a follower of Claude , and these pictures far exceed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The charm of them does not lie merely in the atmospheric tints and effects , as those of Cuyp , but in the rich and fanciful combination of objects . In this respect they perform in painting what the first part of the Castle of Indolence , or Tennyson 's Lotus Eaters , do in poetry  - -  evoke a fairyland . There was something peculiar about their charm for me . Who can decide how much in a picture belongs to the idiosyncrasies and associations of the person who looks upon it . Artists undoubtedly powerful and fine may have nothing in them which touches the nervous sympathies and tastes of some persons : who , therefore , shall establish any authoritative canon of taste ? who shall say that Claude is finer than Zuccarelli , or Zuccarelli than Claude ? A man might as well say that the woman who enchants him is the only true Venus for the world . Then , again , how much in painting or in poetry depends upon the frame of mind in which we see or hear ! Whoever looks on these pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time when soul and body are weary , and longing for retirement and rest , will receive an impression from them such as could never be made on the strong nerves of our more healthful and hilarious seasons . Certainly no emotions so rigidly reject critical restraints , and disdain to be bound by rule , as those excited by the fine arts . A man unimpressible and incapable of moods and tenses , is for that reason an incompetent critic ; and the sensitive , excitable man , how can he know that he does not impose his peculiar mood as a general rule ? From the state rooms we were taken to the top of the Hound Tower , where we gained a magnificent view of the Park of Windsor , with its regal avenue , miles in length , of ancient oaks ; its sweeps of greensward ; clumps of trees ; its old Herne oak , of classic memory ; in short , all that constitutes the idea of a perfect English landscape . The English tree is shorter and stouter than ours ; its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounding outline against the sky . Every thing here conveys the idea of concentrated vitality , but without that rank luxuriance seen in our American growth . Having unfortunately exhausted the English language on the subject of grass , I will not repeat any ecstasies upon that topic . After descending from the tower we filed off to the proper quarter , to show our orders for the private rooms . The state apartments , which we had been looking at , are open at all times , but the private apartments can only be seen in the queen 's absence , and by a special permission , which had been procured for us on this occasion by the kindness of the Duchess of Sutherland . One of the first objects that attracted my attention when entering the vestibule was a baby 's wicker wagon , standing in one corner ; it was much such a carriage as all mothers are familiar with ; such as figures largely in the history of almost every family . It had neat curtains and cushions of green merino , and was not royal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of interest . It is to my mind one of the providential signs of our times , that , at this stormy and most critical period of the world 's history , the sovereignty of the most powerful nation on earth is represented by a woman and a mother . How many humanizing , gentle , and pacific influences constantly emanate from this centre ! One of the most interesting apartments was a long corridor , hung with paintings and garnished along the sides with objects of art and virtu . Here C. and I renewed a dispute which had for some time been pending , in respect to Canaletto 's paintings . This Canaletto was a Venetian painter , who was born about 1697 , and died in London in 1768 , and was greatly in vogue with the upper circles in those days . He delighted in architectural paintings , which he represents with the accuracy of a daguerreotype , and a management of perspective , chiaro oscuro , and all the other mysteries of art , such as make his paintings amount to about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this corridor , we had him in full force . Here was Venice served up to order  --  its streets , palaces , churches , bridges , canals , and gondolas made as real to our eye as if we were looking at them out of a window . I admired them very warmly , but I could not go into the raptures that C. did , who kept calling me from every thing else that I wanted to see to come and look at this Canaletto . " Well , I see it , " said I ; " it is good  --  it is perfect  --  it can not be bettered ; but what then ? There is the same difference between these and a landscape of Zuccarelli as there is between a neatly-arranged statistical treatise and a poem . The latter suggests a thousand images , the former gives you only information . " We were quite interested in a series of paintings which represented the various events of the present queen 's history . There was the coronation in Westminster Abbey  --  that national romance which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads of all the sensible people on earth . Think of vesting the sovereignty of so much of the world in a fair young girl of seventeen ! The picture is a very pretty one , and is taken at the very moment she is kneeling at the feet of the Archbishop of Canterbury to receive her crown . She is represented as a fair-haired , interesting girl , the simplicity of her air contrasting strangely with the pomp and gorgeous display around . The painter has done justice to a train of charming young ladies who surround her ; among the faces I recognized the blue eyes and noble forehead of the Duchess of Sutherland . Then followed , in due order , the baptism of children , the reception of poor old Louis Philippe in his exile , and various other matters of the sort which go to make up royal pictures . In the family breakfast room we saw some fine Gobelin tapestry , representing the classical story of Meleager . In one of the rooms , on a pedestal , stood a gigantic china vase , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state rooms before we had seen a large malachite vase from the same donor . The toning of this room , with regard to color , was like that of the room I described in Stafford House  --  the carpet of green ground , with the same little leaf upon it , the walls , chairs , and sofas covered with green damask . Around the walls of the room , in some places , were arranged cases of books about three feet high . I liked this arrangement particularly , because it gives you the companionship of books in an apartment without occupying that space of the wall which is advantageous for pictures . Moreover , books placed high against the walls of a room give a gloomy appearance to the apartment . The whole air of these rooms was very charming , suggestive of refined taste and domestic habits . The idea of home , which pervades every thing in England , from the cottage to the palace , was as much suggested here as in any apartments I have seen . The walls of the different rooms were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and those of other European princes . After this we went through the kitchen department  --  saw the silver and gold plate of the table ; among the latter were some designs which I thought particularly graceful . To conclude all , we went through the stables . The man who showed them told us that several of the queen 's favorite horses were taken to Osborne ; but there were many beautiful creatures left , which I regarded with great complacency . The stables and stalls were perfectly clean , and neatly kept ; and one , in short , derives from the whole view of the economics of Windsor that satisfaction which results from seeing a thing thoroughly done in the best conceivable manner . The management of the estate of Windsor is , I am told , a model for all landholders in the kingdom . A society has been formed there , within a few years , under the patronage of the queen , Prince Albert , and the Duchess of Kent , in which the clergy and gentry of the principal parishes in this vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes in this region . The queen and Prince Albert have taken much interest in the planning and arranging of model houses for the laboring people , which combine cheapness , neatness , ventilation , and all the facilities for the formation of good personal habits . There is a school kept on the estate at Windsor , in which the queen takes a very practical interest , regulating the books and studies , and paying frequent visits to it during the time of her sojourn here . The young girls are instructed in fine needlework ; but the queen discourages embroidery and ornamental work , meaning to make practical , efficient wives for laboring men . These particulars , with regard to this school , were related to me by a lady living in the vicinity of Windsor . We went into St. George 's Chapel , and there we were all exceedingly interested and enchained in view of the marble monument to the Princess Charlotte . It consists of two groups , and is designed to express , in one view , both the celestial and the terrestrial aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying . For the visible part , you have the body of the princess in all the desolation and abandonment of death . The attitude of the figure is as if she had thrown herself over in a convulsion , and died . The body is lying listless , simply covered with a sheet , through every fold of which you can see the utter relaxation of that moment when vitality departs , but the limbs have not yet stiffened . Her hand and a part of the arm are hanging down , exposed to view beneath the sheet . Four figures , with bowed heads , covered with drapery , are represented as sitting around in mute despair . The idea meant to be conveyed by the whole group is that of utter desolation and abandonment . All is over ; there is not even heart enough left in the mourners to straighten the corpse for the burial . The mute marble says , as plainly as marble can speak , " Let all go ; ' t is no matter now ; there is no more use in living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Above this group rises the form of the princess , springing buoyant and elastic , on angel wings , a smile of triumph and aspiration lighting up her countenance . Her drapery floats behind her as she rises . Two angels , one carrying her infant child and the other with clasped hands of exultant joy , are rising with her , in serene and solemn triumph . Now , I simply put it to you , or to any one who can judge of poetry , if this is not a poetical conception . I ask any one who has a heart , if there is not pathos in it . Is there not a high poetic merit in the mere conception of these two scenes , thus presented ? And had we seen it rudely chipped and chiselled out by some artist of the middle ages , whose hand had not yet been practised to do justice to his conceptions , should we not have said this sculptor had a glorious thought within him ? But the chiselling of this piece is not unworthy the conception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , neck , and shoulders ; nothing more finely wrought than the triumphant smile of the angel princess ; nothing could be more artistic than the representation of death in all its hopelessness , in the lower figure . The poor , dead hand , that shows itself beneath the sheet , has an unutterable pathos and beauty in it . As to the working of the drapery ,  --  an inferior consideration , of course ,  --  I see no reason why it should not compare advantageously with any in the British Museum . Well , you will ask , why are you going on in this argumentative style ? Who doubts you ? Let me tell you , then , a little fragment of my experience . We saw this group of statuary the last thing before dinner , after a most fatiguing forenoon of sightseeing , when we were both tired and hungry ,  --  a most unpropitious time , certainly ,  --  and yet it enchanted our whole company ; what is more , it made us all cry  --  a fact of which I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , when I was expressing my admiration to an artist , who is one of the authorities , and knows all that is proper to be admired , I was met with ,  --  " O , you have seen that , have you ? Shocking thing ! Miserable taste  --  miserable ! " " Dear me , " said I , with apprehension , " what is the matter with it ? " " 0 , " said he , " melodramatic , melodramatic  --  terribly so ! " I was so appalled by this word , of whose meaning I had not a very clear idea , that I dropped the defence at once , and determined to reconsider my tears . To have been actually made to cry by a thing that was melodramatic , was a distressing consideration . Seriously , however , on reconsidering the objection , I see no sense in it . A thing may be melodramatic , or any other atic that a man pleases ; so that it be strongly suggestive , poetic , pathetic , it has a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If artists had had their way in the creation of this world , there would have been only two or three kinds of things in it ; the first three or four things that God created would have been enacted into fixed rules for making all the rest . But they let the works of nature alone , because they know there is no hope for them , and content themselves with enacting rules in literature and art , which make all the perfection and grace of the past so many impassable barriers to progress in future . Because the ancients kept to unity of idea in their groups , and attained to most beautiful results by doing so , shall no modern make an antithesis in marble ? And why has not a man a right to dramatize in marble as well as on canvas , if he can produce a powerful and effective result by so doing ? And even if by being melodramatic , as the terrible word is , he can shadow forth a grand and comforting religious idea  --  if he can unveil to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its triumph  --  who shall say that he may not do so because he violates the lines of some old Greek artist ? Where would Shakspeare 's dramas have been , had he studied the old dramatic unities ? So , you see , like an obstinate republican , as I am , I defend my right to have my own opinion about this monument , albeit the guide book , with its usual diplomatic caution , says , " It is in very questionable taste . " We went for our dinner to the White Hart , the very inn which Shakspeare celebrates in his Merry Wives , and had a most overflowing , merry time of it . The fact is , we had not seen each other for so long that to be in each other 's company for a whole day was quite a stimulant . After dinner we had a beautiful drive , passing the colleges at Eton , and seeing the boys out playing cricket ; had an excellent opportunity to think how true Gray 's poem on the Prospect of Eton is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were bent upon looking up the church which gave rise to his Elegy in a Country Churchyard , intending , when we got there , to have a little scene over it ; Mr. S. , in all the conscious importance of having been there before , assuring us that he knew exactly where it was . So , after some difficulty with our coachman , and being stopped at one church which would not answer our purpose in any respect , we were at last set down by one which looked authentic ; embowered in mossy elms , with a most ancient and goblin yew tree , an ivy-mantled tower , all perfect as could be . There had been a sprinkle of rain ,  --  an ornament which few English days want ,  --  and the westering beams of the sun twinkled through innumerable drops . In fact , it was a pretty place ; and I felt such " dispositions to melancholies , " as Sir Hugh Evans would have it , that I half resented Mr. S. 's suggestion that the cars were waiting . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , it was agreed he should leave us there to stroll , while he took the cars . So away he went ; and we , leaning on the old fence , repeated the Elegy , which certainly applies here as beautifully as language could apply . What a calm , shady , poetical nature is expressed in these lines ! Gray seems to have been sent into the world for nothing but to be a poem , like some of those fabulous , shadowy beings which haunted the cool grottoes on Grecian mountains ; creatures that seem to have no practical vitality  --  to be only a kind of voice , an echo , heard for a little , and then lost in silence . He seemed to be in himself a kind of elegy . From thence we strolled along , enjoying the beautiful rural scenery . Having had a kind invitation to visit Labouchere Park that day , which we were obliged to decline for want of time , we were pleased to discover that we had two more hours , in which we could easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our party became separated ; and , misunderstanding each other , we remained waiting for W. till it was too late for us to go , while he , on the other hand , supposing us to have walked before him , was redoubling his speed all the while , hoping to overtake us . In consequence of this , he accomplished the walk to Labouchere Park , and we waited in the dismal depot till it was too late to wait any longer , and finally went into London without him . After all , imagine our chagrin on being informed that we had not been to the genuine churchyard . The gentleman who wept over the scenes of his early days on the wrong doorstep was not more grievously disappointed . However , he and we could both console ourselves with the reflection that the emotion was admirable , and wanted only the right place to make it the most appropriate in the world . The genuine country churchyard , however , was that at Stoke Pogis , which we should have seen had not the fates forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SISTER :  --  The evening after our return from Windsor was spent with our kind friends , Mr. and Mrs. Gurney . Mr. Gurney is rector of Mary-le-Bone parish , one of the largest districts in London ; and he is , I have been told , one of the court chaplains ; a man of the most cultivated and agreeable manners , earnestly and devoutly engaged in the business of his calling . As one of the working men of the church establishment , I felt a strong interest in his views and opinions , and he seemed to take no less interest in mine , as coming from a country where there is and can be no church establishment . He asked many questions about America ; the general style of our preaching ; the character of our theology ; our modes of religious action ; our revivals of religion ; our theories of sudden and instantaneous conversion , as distinguished from the gradual conversion of education ; our temperance societies , and the stand taken by our clergy in behalf of temperance . He wished to know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of America . I told him one principal difference that struck me was , that the English preaching did not recognize the existence of any element of inquiry or doubt in the popular mind ; that it treated certain truths as axioms , which only needed to be stated to be believed ; whereas in American sermons there is always more or less time employed in explaining , proving , and answering objections to , the truths enforced . I quoted Baptist Noel 's sermon in illustration of what I meant . I asked him to what extent the element of scepticism , with regard to religious truth , had pervaded the mind of England ? adding that I had inferred its existence there from such novels as those of Kingsley . He thought that there was much of this element , particularly in the working classes ; that they were coming to regard the clergy with suspicion , and to be less under their influence than in former times ; and said it was a matter of much solicitude to know how to reach them . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had travelled in England , say , that dissenters were treated much as free negroes were in America , and added that my experience must have been very exceptional , or the remark much overstated , as I had met dissenting clergymen in all circles of society . He admitted that there might be a good deal of bigotry in this respect , but added that the infrequency of association was more the result of those circumstances which would naturally draw the two parties to themselves , than to superciliousness on the side of the establishment , adding that where a court and aristocracy were in the established church , there would necessarily be a pressure of fashion in its favor , which might at times bring uncomfortable results . The children were sitting by studying their evening lessons , and I begged Mrs. Gurney to allow me to look over their geographies and atlases ; and on her inquiring why , I told her that well-informed , and that I did not understand how it was that our children should know so much more about England than they about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a very excellent and authentic map of our country . I must say also that the most highly educated people I have met in England have never betrayed any want of information on this subject . The next morning we had at breakfast two clergymen , members of the established church . They appeared to be most excellent , devout , practical men , anxious to do good , and thoughtfully seeking for suggestions from any quarter which might assist them in their labors . They renewed many of the inquiries which Mr. Gurney had made the evening before . After breakfast I went with Mr. Gurney and Mr. S. to Richmond 's studio to sit for a likeness , which is to be presented to Mr. S. by several friends . Richmond 's name is one which in this London sphere has only to be announced to explain itself ; not to know him argues yourself unknown . He is one of the most successful artists in a certain line of portrait painting that the present day affords . He devotes himself principally to crayon and water-color sketches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his water-colors of a small size . He often takes full-lengths in this way , which render not merely the features , but the figure , air , manner , and what is characteristic about the dress . These latter sketches are finished up very highly , with the minuteness of a miniature . His forte consists in seizing and fixing those fleeting traits of countenance , air , and movement , which go so far towards making up our idea of a person 's appearance . Many of the engravings of distinguished persons , with which we are familiar , have come from his designs , such as Wilberforce , Sir Powell Buxton , Elizabeth Fry , and others . I found his studio quite a gallery of notabilities , almost all the distingues of the day having sat to him ; so I certainly had the satisfaction of feeling myself in good company . Mr. Richmond looks quite youthful , ( but I never can judge of any one 's age here , ) is most agreeable in conversation , full of anecdote in regard to all the moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation is one secret of his successful likenesses . Some portrait painters keep calling on you for expression all the while , and say nothing in the world to awaken it . From Richmond 's , Mr. S. , C. , and I drove out to call upon Kossuth . We found him in an obscure lodging on the outskirts of London . I would that some of the editors in America , who have thrown out insinuations about his living in luxury , could have seen the utter bareness and plainness of the reception room , which had nothing in it beyond the simplest necessaries . Here dwells the man whose greatest fault is an undying love of his country . We all know that if Kossuth would have taken wealth and a secure retreat , with a life of ease for himself , America would gladly have laid all these at his feet . But because he could not acquiesce in the unmerited dishonor of his country , he lives a life of obscurity , poverty , and labor . All this was written in his pale , worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me the unselfish patriot is more venerable for his poverty and his misfortunes . Have we , among the thousands who speak loud of patriotism in America , many men , who , were she enfeebled , despised , and trampled , would forego self , and suffer as long , as patiently for her ? It is even easier to die for a good cause , in some hour of high enthusiasm , when all that is noblest in us can be roused to one great venture , than to live for it amid wearing years of discouragement and hope delayed . There are those even here in England who delight to get up slanders against Kossuth , and not long ago some most unfounded charges were thrown out against him in some public prints . By way of counterpoise an enthusiastic public meeting was held , in which he was presented with a splendid set of Shakspeare . He entered into conversation with us with cheerfulness , speaking English well , though with the idioms of foreign languages . He seemed quite amused at the sensation which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . C. asked him if he had still hopes for his cause . He answered , " I hope still , because I work still ; my hope is in God and in man . " I inquired for Madame Kossuth , and he answered , " I have not yet seen her to-day , " adding , " she has her family affairs , you know , madam ; we are poor exiles here ; " and , fearing to cause embarrassment , I did not press an interview . When we parted he took my hand kindly , and said , " God bless you , my child . " I would not lose my faith in such men for any thing the world could give me . There are some people who involve in themselves so many of the elements which go to make up our confidence in human nature generally , that to lose confidence in them seems to undermine our faith in human virtue . As Shakspeare says , their defection would be like " another fall of man . " We went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon was fine , Mr. and Mrs. Gurney drove with us in their carriage to Pembroke Lodge , the country seat of Lord John Russell . It was an uncommonly beautiful afternoon , and the view from Richmond Hill was as perfect a specimen of an English landscape , seen under the most benignant auspices , as we could hope to enjoy . Orchards , gardens , villas , charming meadows enamelled with flowers , the silver windings of the Thames , the luxuriant outlines of the foliage , varied here and there by the graceful perpendicular of the poplars , all formed one of the richest of landscapes . The brow of the hill is beautifully laid out with tufts of trees , winding paths , diversified here and there with arbors and rustic seats . Richmond Park is adorned with clumps of ancient trees , among which troops of deer were strolling . Pembroke Lodge is a plain , unostentatious building , rising in the midst of charming grounds . We were received in the drawing room by the young ladies , and were sorry to learn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us her company at dinner . Two charming little boys came in , and a few moments after , their father , Lord John . I had been much pleased with finding on the centre table a beautiful edition of that revered friend of my childhood , Dr. Watts 's Divine Songs , finely illustrated . I remarked to Lord John that it was the face of an old friend . He said it was presented to his little boys by their godfather , Sir George Grey ; and when , taking one of the little boys on his knee , he asked him if he could repeat me one of his hymns , the whole thing seemed so New England-like that I began to feel myself quite at home . I hope I shall some day see in America an edition of Dr. Watts , in which the illustrations do as much justice to the author 's sentiments as in this , for in all our modern religious works for children there is nothing that excels these divine songs . There were only a few guests ; among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl Grey , of reform memory , and she is the eldest daughter of the pious and learned Bishop Ryder , of Lichfield . Sir George is a man of great piety and worth , a liberal , and much interested in all benevolent movements . There was also the Earl of Albemarle , who is a colonel in the army , and has served many years under Wellington , a particularly cheerful , entertaining , conversable man , full of anecdote . He told several very characteristic and comical stories about the Duke of Wellington . At dinner , among other things , the conversation turned upon hunting . It always seemed to me a curious thing , that in the height of English civilization this vestige of the savage state should still remain . I told Lord Albemarle that I thought the idea of a whole concourse of strong men turning out to hunt a poor fox or hare , creatures so feeble and insignificant , and who can do nothing to defend themselves , was hardly consistent with manliness ; that if they had some of our American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be something more dignified and generous . Thereupon they only laughed , and told stories about fox hunters . It seems that killing a fox , except in the way of hunting , is deemed among hunters an unpardonable offence , and a man who has the misfortune to do it would be almost as unwilling to let it be known as if he had killed a man . They also told about deer stalking in the highlands , in which exercise I inferred Lord John had been a proficient . The conversation reminded me of the hunting stories I had heard in the log cabins in Indiana , and I amused myself with thinking how some of the narrators would appear among my high-bred friends . There is such a quaint vivacity and droll-cry about that half-savage western life , as always gives it a charm in my recollection . I thought of the jolly old hunter who always concluded the operations of the day by discharging his rifle at his candle after he had snugly ensconced himself in bed ; and of the celebrated scene in which Henry Clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his aptness in turning into a political simile some points in the management of a rifle . Now there is , to my mind , something infinitely more sublime about hunting in real earnest amid the solemn shadows of our interminable forests , than in making believe hunt in parks . It is undoubtedly the fact , that these out-of-door sports of England have a great deal to do with the firm health which men here enjoy . Speaking of this subject , I could not help expressing my surprise to Lord John at the apparently perfect health enjoyed by members of Parliament , notwithstanding their protracted night labors . He thinks that the session of Parliament this year will extend nearly to August . Speaking of breakfasts , he said they often had delightful breakfasts about three o'clock in the day ; this is a total reverse of all our ideas in regard to time . After dinner Lord and Lady Ribblesdale came in , connections of Lord John by a former marriage . I sat by Lord John on the sofa , and listened with great interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working of the educational system in England ; a subject which has particularly engaged the attention of the English government since the reign of the present queen . I found a difficulty in understanding many of the terms they used , though I learned much that interested me . After a while I went to Lady Russell 's apartment , and had an hour of very pleasant conversation with her . It greatly enlarges our confidence in human nature to find such identity of feeling and opinion among the really good of different countries , and of all different circles in those countries . I have never been more impressed with this idea than during my sojourn here in England . Different as the institutions of England and America are , they do not prevent the formation of a very general basis of agreement in so far as radical ideas of practical morality and religion are concerned ; and I am increasingly certain that there is a foundation for a lasting unity between the two countries which shall increase constantly , as the increasing facilities of communication lessen the distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest after Prescott , our historian , and expressed the pleasure which she and Lord John had derived from his writings . We left early , after a most agreeable evening . The next day at eleven o'clock we went to an engagement at Lambeth Palace , where we had been invited by a kind note from its venerable master , the Archbishop of Canterbury . Lambeth is a stately pile of quaint , antique buildings , rising most magnificently on the banks of the Thames . It is surrounded by beautiful grounds , laid out with choice gardening . Through an ancient hall , lighted by stained-glass windows , we were ushered into the drawing room , where the guests were assembling . There was quite a number of people there , among others the lady and eldest son of the Bishop of London , the Earl and Countess Waldegrave , and the family friends of the archbishop . The good archbishop was kind and benign , as usual , and gave me his arm while we explored the curiosities of the palace . Now , my dear , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " this palace contains all the gradations of architecture from early English to late perpendicular , " you will certainly not expect me to describe it in one letter . It has been the residence of the archbishops of Canterbury from time immemorial , both in the days before the reformation and since . The chapel was built between the years 1200 and 1300 , and there used to be painted windows in it , as Archbishop Laud says , which contained the whole history of the world , from the creation to the day of judgment . Unfortunately these comprehensive windows were destroyed in the civil wars . The part called the Lollards ' Tower is celebrated as having been the reputed prison of the Lollards . These Lollards , perhaps you will remember , were the followers of John Wickliffe , called Lollards as Christ was called a " Nazarene , " simply because the word was a term of reproach . Wickliffe himself was summoned here to Lambeth to give an account of his teachings , and in 1382 , William Courtnay , Archbishop of Canterbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition is , that at various times these Lollards were imprisoned here . In order to get to the tower we had to go through a great many apartments , passages , and corridors , and terminate all by climbing a winding staircase , steeper and narrower than was at all desirable for any but wicked heretics , who ought to be made as uncomfortable as possible . However , by reasonable perseverance , the archbishop , the bishop 's lady , and all the noble company present found themselves safely at the top . Our host remarked , I think , that it was the second time he had ever been there . The room is thirteen feet by twelve , and about eight feet high , wainscotted with oak , which is scrawled over with names and inscriptions . There are eight large iron rings in the wall , to which the prisoners were chained ; for aught we know , Wickliffe himself may have been one . As our kind host moved about among us with his placid face , we could not but think that times had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and preside over grim , inquisitorial tribunals . We all agreed , however , that , considering the very beautiful prospect this tower commands up and down the Thames , the poor Lollards in some respects might have been worse lodged . We passed through the guard room , library , and along a corridor where hung a row of pictures of all the archbishops from the very earliest times ; and then the archbishop took me into his study , which is a most charming room , containing his own private library : after that we all sat down to lunch in a large dining hall . I was seated between the archbishop and a venerable admiral in the navy . Among other things , the latter asked me if there were not many railroad and steamboat accidents in America . O my countrymen , what trouble do you make us in foreign lands by your terrible carelessness ! I was obliged , in candor , to say that I thought there was a shocking number of accidents of that sort , and suggested the best excuse I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly thought my venerable friend had touched a very indefensible point . Among other topics discussed in the drawing room , I heard some more on dits respecting spiritual rappings . Every body seems to be wondering what they are , and what they are going to amount to . We took leave of our kind host and his family , gratefully impressed with the simplicity and sincere cordiality of our reception . There are many different names for goodness in this world ; but , after all , true brotherly kindness and charity is much the same thing , whether it show itself by a Quaker 's fireside or in an archbishop 's palace . Leaving the archbishop 's I went to Richmond 's again , where I was most agreeably entertained for an hour or two . We have an engagement for Playford Hall to-morrow , and we breakfast with Joseph Sturge : it being now the time of the yearly meeting of the Friends , he and his family are in town . LETTER XXIV . MY DEAR S. :  --  The next morning C. and I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . " And what 's Playford Hall ? " you say . " And why did you go to see it ? " As to what it is , here is a reasonably good picture before you . As to why , it was for many years the residence of Thomas Clarkson , and is now the residence of his venerable widow and her family . Playford Hall is considered , I think , the oldest of the fortified houses in England , and is , I am told , the only one that has water in the moat . The water which is seen girdling the wall , in the picture , is the moat : it surrounds the place entirely , leaving no access except across the bridge , which is here represented . After crossing this bridge , you come into a green court yard filled with choice plants and flowering shrubs , and carpeted with that thick , soft , velvet-like grass which is to be found nowhere else in so perfect a state as in England . The water is fed by a perpetual spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptible , but which yet has the vitality of a running stream . It has a dark and glassy stillness of surface , only broken by the forms of the water plants , whose leaves float thickly over it . The walls of the moat are green with ancient moss , and from the crevices springs an abundant flowering vine , whose delicate leaves and bright yellow flowers in some places entirely mantle the stones with their graceful drapery . Illustration : of Playford Hall . The picture I have given you represents only one side of the moat . The other side is grown up with dark and thick shrubbery and ancient trees , rising and embowering the entire place , adding to the retired and singular effect of the whole . The place is a specimen of a sort of thing which does not exist in America . It is one of those significant landmarks which unite the present with the past , for which we must return to the country of our origin . Playford Hall is peculiarly English , and Thomas Clarkson , for whose sake I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specimen of the very best kind of English mind and character , as this is of characteristic English architecture . We Anglo-Saxons have won a hard name in the world . There are undoubtedly bad things which are true about us . Taking our developments as a race , both in England and America , we may be justly called the Romans of the nineteenth century . We have been the race which has conquered , subdued , and broken in pieces other weaker races , with little regard either to justice or mercy . With regard to benefits by us imparted to conquered nations , I think a better story , on the whole , can be made out for the Romans than for us . Witness the treatment of the Chinese , of the tribes of India , and of our own American Indians . But still there is in Anglo-Saxon blood , a vigorous sense of justice , as appears in our habeas corpus , our jury trials , and other features of state organization ; and , when this is tempered , in individuals , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and indomitable perseverance which are characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon mind , they form a style of philanthropy peculiarly efficient . In short , the Anglo-Saxon is efficient , in whatever he sets himself about , whether in crushing the weak or lifting them up . Thomas Clarkson was born in a day when good , pious people imported cargoes of slaves from Africa , as one of the regular Christianized modes of gaining a subsistence and providing for themselves and their households . It was a thing that every body was doing , and every body thought they had a right to do . It was supposed that all the sugar , molasses , and rum in the world were dependent on stealing men , women , and children , and could be got in no other way ; and as to consume sugar , molasses , and rum , were evidently the chief ends of human existence , it followed that men , women , and children must be stolen to the end of time . Some good people , when they now and then heard an appalling story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was really too bad , sympathetically remarked , " What a sorrowful world we live in ! " stirred their sugar into their tea , and went on as before , because , what was there to do ?  --  " Had n't every body always done it ? and if they did n't do it , would n't somebody else ? " It is true that for many years individuals at different times had remonstrated , written treatises , poems , stories , and movements had been made by some religious bodies , particularly the Quakers , but the opposition had amounted to nothing practically efficient . The attention of Clarkson was first turned to the subject by having it given out as the theme for a prize composition in his college class , he being at that time a sprightly young man , about twenty-four years of age . He entered into the investigation with no other purpose than to see what he could make of it as a college theme . He says of himself , " I had expected pleasure from the invention of arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them together , and from the thought , in the interim , that I was engaged in an innocent contest for literary honor ; but all my pleasures were damped by the facts which were now continually before me . " " It was but one gloomy subject from morning till night ; in the daytime I was uneasy , in the night I had little rest ; I sometimes never closed my eyelids for grief . " It became not now so much a trial for academical reputation as to write a work which should be useful to Africa . It is not surprising that a work written under the force of such feelings should have gained the prize , as it did . Clarkson was summoned from London to Cambridge , to deliver his prize essay publicly . He says of himself , on returning to London , " The subject of it almost wholly engrossed my thoughts . I became at times very seriously affected while on the road . I stopped my horse occasionally , dismounted , and walked . " " I frequently tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true ; but the more I reflected on the authorities on which they were founded , the more I gave them credit . Coming in sight of Wade 's Mill , in Hertfordshire , I sat down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside , and held my horse . Here a thought came into my mind , that if the contents of the essay were true , it was time that somebody should see these calamities to an end . " These reflections , as it appears , were put off for a while , but returned again . This young and noble heart was of a kind that could not comfort itself so easily for a brother 's sorrow as many do . He says of himself , " In the course of the autumn of the same year , I walked frequently into the woods , that I might think of the subject in solitude , and find relief to my mind there ; but there the question still recurred , ' Are these things true ? ' Still , the answer followed as instantaneously , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely some person should interfere . I began to envy those who had seats in Parliament , riches , and widely-extended connections , which would enable them to take up this cause . " Finding scarcely any one , at the time , who thought of it , I was turned frequently to myself ; but here many difficulties arose . It struck me , among others , that a young man only twenty-four years of age could not have that solid judgment , or that knowledge of men , manners , and things , which were requisite to qualify him to undertake a task of such magnitude and importance ; and with whom was I to unite ? I believed , also , that it looked so much like one of the feigned labors of Hercules , that my understanding would be suspected if I proposed it . " He , however , resolved to do something for the cause by translating his essay from Latin into English , enlarging and presenting it to the public . Immediately on the publication of this essay he discovered , to his astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been interested in this subject . Being invited to the house of William Dillwyn , one of these friends to the cause , he says , " How surprised was I to learn , in the course of our conversation , of the labors of Granville Sharp , of the writings of Ramsey , and of the controversy in which the latter was engaged ! of all which I had hitherto known nothing . How surprised was I to learn that William Dillwyn had , two years before , associated himself with five others for the purpose of enlightening the public mind on this great subject ! " How astonished was I to find that a society had been formed in America for the same object ! These thoughts almost overpowered me . My mind was overwhelmed by the thought that I had been providentially directed to this house ; the finger of Providence was beginning to be discernible , and that the daystar of African liberty was rising . " After this he associated with many friends of the cause , and at last it became evident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice all other prospects in life , and devote himself exclusively to this work . He says , after mentioning reasons which prevented all his associates from doing this , " I could look , therefore , to no person but myself ; and the question was , whether I was prepared to make the sacrifice . In favor of the undertaking , I urged to myself that never was any cause , which had been taken up by man , in any country or in any age , so great and important ; that never was there one in which so much misery was heard to cry for redress ; that never was there one in which so much good could be done ; never one in which the duty of Christian charity could be so extensively exercised ; never one more worthy of the devotion of a whole life towards it ; and that , if a man thought properly , he ought to rejoice to have been called into existence , if he were only permitted to become an instrument in forwarding it in any part of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , I had to urge that I had been designed for the church ; that I had already advanced as far as deacon 's orders in it ; that my prospects there on account of my connections were then brilliant ; that , by appearing to desert my profession , my family would be dissatisfied , if not unhappy . These thoughts pressed upon me , and rendered the conflict difficult . " But the sacrifice of my prospects staggered me , I own , the most . When the other objections which I have related occurred to me , my enthusiasm instantly , like a flash of lightning , consumed them ; but this stuck to me , and troubled me . I had ambition . I had a thirst after worldly interest and honors , and I could not extinguish it at once . I was more than two hours in solitude under this painful conflict . At length I yielded , not because I saw any reasonable prospect of success in my new undertaking ,  --  for all cool-headed and cool-hearted men would have pronounced against it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher Power . And I can say , that both on the moment of this resolution and for some time afterwards , I had more sublime and happy feelings than at any former period of my life . " In order to show how this enterprise was looked upon and talked of very commonly by the majority of men in those times , we will extract the following passage from Boswell 's Life of Johnson , in which Bozzy thus enters his solemn protest : " The wild and dangerous attempt , which has for some time been persisted in , to obtain an act of our legislature to abolish so very important and necessary a branch of commercial interest , must have been crushed at once , had not the insignificance of the zealots , who vainly took the lead in it , made the vast body of planters , merchants , and others , whose immense properties are involved in that trade , reasonably enough suppose that there could be no danger . The encouragement which the attempt has received excites my wonder and indignation ; and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a love of temporary popularity when prosperous , or a love of general mischief when desperate , my opinion is unshaken . " To abolish a status which in all ages God has sanctioned , and man has continued , would not only be robbery to an innumerable class of our fellow-subjects , but it would be extreme cruelty to the African savages , a portion of whom it saves from massacre or intolerable bondage in their own country , and introduces into a much happier state of life ; especially now , when their passage to the West Indies , and their treatment there , is humanely regulated . To abolish this trade would be to '  --  shut the gates of mercy on mankind . ' " One of the first steps of Clarkson and his associates was the formation of a committee of twelve persons , for the collection and dissemination of information on the subject . The contest now began in earnest , a contest as sublime as any the world ever saw . The abolition controversy more fully aroused the virtue , the talent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other event or crisis which ever occurred . Wilberforce was the leader of the question in Parliament . The other members of the antislavery committee performed those labors which were necessary out of it . This labor consisted principally in the collection of evidence with regard to the traffic , and the presentation of it before the public mind . In this labor Clarkson was particularly engaged . The subject was hemmed in with the same difficulties that now beset the antislavery cause in America . Those who knew most about it were precisely those whose interest it was to prevent inquiry . An immense moneyed interest was arrayed against investigation , and was determined to suppress the agitation of the subject . Owing to this powerful pressure , many , who were in possession of facts which would bear upon this subject , refused to communicate them ; and often , after a long and wearisome journey in search of an individual who could throw light upon the subject , Clarkson had the mortification to find his lips sealed by interest or timidity . As usual , the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave trade was asserted to be the latest revised edition of philanthropy . It was said that the poor African , the slave of miserable oppression in his own country , was wafted by it to an asylum in a Christian land ; that the middle passage was to the poor negro a perfect Elysium , infinitely happier than any thing he had ever known in his own country . All this was said while manacles , and handcuffs , and thumbscrews , and instruments to force open the mouth , were a regular part of the stock for a slave ship , and were hanging in the shop windows of Liverpool for sale . For Clarkson 's attention was first called to these things by observing them in the shop window , and on inquiring the use of one of them , the man informed him that many times negroes were sulky , and tried to starve themselves to death , and this instrument was used to force open their jaws . Of Clarkson 's labor in this investigation some idea may be gathered from his own words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retire from the cause , he thus speaks :  --  " As far as I myself was concerned , all exertion was then over . The nervous system was almost shattered to pieces . Both my memory and my hearing failed me . Sudden dizzinesses seized my head . A confused singing in the ear followed me wherever I went . On going to bed the very stairs seemed to dance up and down under me , so that , misplacing my foot , I sometimes fell . Talking , too , if it continued but half an hour , exhausted me so that profuse perspiration followed , and the same effect was produced even by an active exertion of the mind for the like time . " These disorders had been brought on by degrees , in consequence of the severe labors necessarily attached to the promotion of the cause . For seven years I had a correspondence to maintain with four hundred persons , with my own hand ; I had some book or other annually to write in behalf of the cause . In this time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence , and a great part of these journeys in the night . All this time my mind had been on the stretch . It had been bent , too , to this one subject , for I had not even leisure to attend to my own concerns . The various instances of barbarity which had come successively to my knowledge , within this period , had vexed , harassed , and afflicted it . The wound which these had produced was rendered still deeper by those cruel disappointments before related , which arose from the reiterated refusals of persons to give their testimony , after I had travelled hundreds of miles in quest of them . But the severest stroke was that inflicted by the persecution , begun and pursued by persons interested in the continuance of the trade , of such witnesses as had been examined against them , and whom , on account of their dependent situation in life , it was most easy to oppress . As I had been the means of bringing these forward on these occasions , they naturally came to me , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ruin . From their supplications and wants it would have been ungenerous and ungrateful to have fled . These different circumstances , by acting together , had at length brought me into the situation just mentioned ; and I was , therefore , obliged , though very reluctantly , to be borne out of the field where I had placed the great honor and glory of my life . " I may as well add here that a Mr. Whitbread , to whom Clarkson mentioned this latter cause of distress , generously offered to repair the pecuniary losses of all who had suffered in this cause . One anecdote will be a specimen of the energy with which Clarkson pursued evidence . It had been very strenuously asserted and maintained that the subjects of the slave trade were only such unfortunates as had become prisoners of war , and who , if not carried out of the country in this manner , would be exposed to death or some more dreadful doom in their own country . This was one of those stories which nobody believed , and yet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was difficult legally to disprove it . It was perfectly well known that in very many cases slave traders made direct incursions into the country , kidnapped and carried off the inhabitants of whole villages ; but the question was , how to establish it . A gentleman whom Clarkson accidentally met on one of his journeys informed him that he had been in company , about a year before , with a sailor , a very respectable-looking young man , who had actually been engaged in one of these expeditions ; he had spent half an hour with him at an inn ; he described his person , but knew nothing of his name or the place of his abode ; all he knew was , that he belonged to a ship of war in ordinary , but knew nothing of the port . Clarkson determined that this man should be produced as a witness , and knew no better way than to go personally to all the ships in ordinary , until the individual was found . He actually visited every seaport town , and boarded every ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very last ship , which remained , the individual was found , and found to be possessed of just the facts and information which were necessary . By the labors of Clarkson and his contemporaries an incredible excitement was produced throughout all England . The pictures and models of slave ships , accounts of the cruelties practised in the trade , were circulated with an industry which left not a man , woman , or child in England uninstructed . In disseminating information , and in awakening feeling and conscience , the women of England were particularly earnest , and labored with that whole-hearted devotion which characterizes the sex . It seems that after the committee had published the facts , and sent them to every town in England , Clarkson followed them up by journeying to all the places , to see that they were read and attended to . Of the state of feeling at this time Clarkson gives the following account :  --  " And first I may observe , that there was no town through which I passed in which there was not some one individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smaller towns there were from ten to fifty , by estimation , and in the larger from two to five hundred , who made this sacrifice to virtue . These were of all ranks and parties . Hich and poor , churchmen and dissenters , had adopted the measure . Even grocers had left off trading in the article in some places . In gentlemen 's families , where the master had set the example , the servants had often voluntarily followed it ; and even children , who were capable of understanding the history of the sufferings of the Africans , excluded , with the most virtuous resolution , the sweets , to which they had been accustomed , from their lips . By the best computation I was able to make , from notes taken down in my journey , no fewer than three hundred thousand persons had abandoned the use of sugar . " It was the reality , depth , and earnestness of the public feeling , thus aroused , which pressed with resistless force upon the government ; for the government of England yields to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After years of protracted struggle , the victory was at last won . The slave trade was finally abolished through all the British empire ; and not only so , but the English nation committed , with the whole force of its national influence , to seek the abolition of the slave trade in all the nations of the earth . But the wave of feeling did not rest there ; the investigations had brought before the English conscience the horrors and abominations of slavery itself , and the agitation never ceased till slavery was finally abolished through all the British provinces . At this time the religious mind and conscience of England gained , through this very struggle , a power which it never has lost . The principle adopted by them was the same so sublimely adopted by the church in America in reference to the foreign missionary cause : " The field is the world . " They saw and felt that , as the example and practice of England had been powerful in giving sanction to this evil , and particularly in introducing it into America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her efforts till the wrong was righted throughout the earth . Clarkson , to his last day , never ceased to be interested in the subject , and took the warmest interest in all movements for the abolition of slavery in America . At the Ipswich depot we were met by a venerable lady , the daughter of Clarkson 's associate , William Dillwyn . She seemed overjoyed to meet us , and took us at once into her carriage , and entertained us all our way to the hall by anecdotes and incidents of Clarkson and his times . She read me a manuscript letter from him , written at a very advanced age , in which he speaks with the utmost ardor and enthusiasm of the first antislavery movements of Cassius M. Clay in Kentucky . She described him to me as a cheerful , companionable being , frank and simple-hearted , and with a good deal of quiet humor . It is remarkable of him that , with such intense feeling for human suffering as he had , and worn down and exhausted as he was by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be familiar , he never yielded to a spirit of bitterness or denunciation . The narrative which he gives is as calm and unimpassioned , and as free from any trait of this kind , as the narratives of the evangelists . Thus riding and talking , we at last arrived at the hall . The old stone house , the moat , the draw bridge , all spoke of days of violence long gone by , when no man was safe except within fortified walls , and every man 's house literally had to be his castle . To me it was interesting as the dwelling of a conqueror , as one who had not wrestled with flesh and blood merely , but with principalities and powers , and the rulers of the darkness of this world , and who had overcome , as his great Master did before him , by faith , and prayer , and labor . We were received with much cordiality by the widow of Clarkson , now in her eighty-fourth year . She has been a woman of great energy and vigor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is now quite feeble . I was placed under the care of a respectable female servant , who forthwith installed me in a large chamber overlooking the court yard , which had been Clarkson 's own room ; the room where , for years , many of his most important labors had been conducted , and from whence his soul had ascended to the reward of the just . The servant who attended me seemed to be quite a superior woman , like many of the servants in respectable English families . She had grown up in the family , and was identified with it ; its ruling aims and purposes had become hers . She had been the personal attendant of Clarkson , and his nurse during his last sickness ; she had evidently understood , and been interested in his plans ; and the veneration with which she therefore spoke of him had the sanction of intelligent appreciation . A daughter of Clarkson , who was married to a neighboring clergyman , with her husband , was also present on this day . After dinner we rode out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of Clarkson repose . It was just such a still , quiet , mossy old church as you have read of in story books , with the graveyard spread all around it , like a thoughtful mother , who watches the resting of her children . The grass in the yard was long and green , and the daisy , which , in other places , lies like a little button on the ground , here had a richer fringe of crimson , and a stalk about six inches high . It is , I well know , the vital influence from the slumbering dust beneath which gives the richness to this grass and these flowers ; but let not that be a painful thought ; let it rather cheer us , that beauty should spring from ashes , and life smile brighter from the near presence of death . The grave of Clarkson is near the church , enclosed by a railing , and marked by a simple white marble slab ; it is carefully tended , and planted with flowers . In the church was an old book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recording how a pious committee of old Noll 's army had been there , knocking off saints ' noses , and otherwise purging the church from the relics of idolatry . Near by the church was the parsonage , the home of my friends , a neat , pleasant , sequestered dwelling , of about the style of a New England country parsonage . The effect of the whole together was inexpressibly beautiful to me . For a wonder , it was a pleasant day , and this is a thing always to be thankfully acknowledged in England . The calm stillness of the afternoon , the seclusion of the whole place , the silence only broken by the cawing of the rooks , the ancient church , the mossy graves with their flowers and green grass , the sunshine and the tree shadows , all seemed to mingle together in a kind of hazy dream of peacefulness and rest . How natural it is to say of some place sheltered , simple , cool , and retired , here one might find peace , as if peace came from without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillest places may be the most turbulent hearts ; and there are hearts which , through the busiest scenes , carry with them unchanging peace . As we were walking back , we passed many cottages of the poor . I noticed , with particular pleasure , the invariable flower garden attached to each . Some pansies in one of them attracted my attention by their peculiar beauty , so very large and richly colored . On being introduced to the owner of them , she , with cheerful alacrity , offered me some of the finest . I do not doubt of there being suffering and misery in the agricultural population of England , but still there are multitudes of cottages which are really very pleasant objects , as were all these . The cottagers had that bright , rosy look of health which we seldom see in America , and appeared to be both polite and self-respecting . In the evening we had quite a gathering of friends from the neighborhood  --  intelligent , sensible , earnest people , who had grown up in the love of the antislavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The duty of English people to free themselves from any participation in American slavery , by taking means to encourage the production of free cotton in the British provinces . " It is no more impossible or improbable that something effective may be done in this way than that the slave trade should have been abolished . Every great movement seems an impossibility at first . There is no end to the number of things declared and proved impossible which have been done already , so that this may become something yet . Mrs. Clarkson had retired from the room early ; after a while she sent for me to her sitting room . The faithful attendant of whom I spoke was with her . She wished to show me some relics of her husband , his watch and seals , some of his papers and manuscripts ; among these was the identical prize essay with which he began his career , and a commentary on the Gospels , which he had written with great care , for the use of his grandson . His seal attracted my attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clasped hands , which was at first adopted as the badge of the cause , when every means was being made use of to arouse the public mind and keep the subject before the public . Mr. Wedgwood , the celebrated porcelain manufacturer , designed a cameo , with this representation , which was much worn as an ornament by ladies . It was engraved on the seal of the Antislavery Society , and was used by its members in sealing all their letters . This of Clarkson 's was handsomely engraved on a large , old-fashioned carnelian ; and surely , if we look with emotion on the sword of a departed hero ,  --  which , at best , we can consider only as a necessary evil ,  --  we may look with unmingled pleasure on this memorial of a bloodless victory . When I retired to my room for the night I could not but feel that the place was hallowed : unceasing prayer had there been offered for the enslaved and wronged race of Africa by that noble and brotherly heart . I could not but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere extinction of slavery in one land or country , and that their benign influence would not cease while a slave was left upon the face of the earth . LETTER XXV . DEAR C. :  --  We returned to London , and found Mr. S. and Joseph Sturge waiting for us at the depot . We dined with Mr. Sturge . It seems that Mr. S. 's speech upon the subject of cotton has created some considerable disturbance , different papers declaring themselves for or against it with a good deal of vivacity . After dinner Mr. Sturge desired me very much to go into the meeting of the women ; for it seems that , at the time of the yearly meeting among the Friends , the men and women both have their separate meetings for attending to business . The aspect of the meeting was very interesting  --  so many placid , amiable faces , shaded by plain Quaker bonnets ; so many neat white handkerchiefs , folded across peaceful bosoms . Either a large number of very pretty women wear the Quaker dress , or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in the mode of speaking among the Friends , particularly in their public meetings , which do not strike me agreeably , and to which I think it would take me some time to become accustomed ; such as a kind of intoning somewhat similar to the manner in which the church service is performed in cathedrals . It is a curious fact that religious exercises , in all ages and countries , have inclined to this form of expression . It appears in the cantilation of the synagogue , the service of the cathedral , the prayers of the Covenanter and the Puritan . There were a table and writing materials in this meeting , and a circle of from fifty to a hundred ladies . One of those upon the platform requested me to express to them my opinion on free labor . In a few words I told them I considered myself upon that subject more a learner than a teacher , but that I was deeply interested in what I had learned upon this subject since my travelling in England , and particularly interested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been quite amused with something which has happened lately . It always has seemed to me that distinguished people here in England live a remarkably out-door sort of life ; and newspapers tell a vast deal about people 's concerns which it is not our custom to put into print in America . Such , for instance , as where the Hon. Mr. A. is staying now , and where he expects to go next ; what her grace wore at the last ball , and when the royal children rode out , and what they had on ; and whom Lord Such-a-one had to dinner ; besides a large number of particulars which probably never happen . Could I have expected dear old England to make me so much one of the family as to treat my humble fortunes in this same public manner ? But it is even so . This week the Times has informed the United Kingdom that Mrs. Stowe is getting a new dress made !  --  the charming old aristocratic Times , which every body declares is such a wicked paper , and yet which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast ! What am I , and what is my father 's house , that such distinction should come upon me ? I assure you , my dear , I feel myself altogether too much flattered . There , side by side with speculations on the eastern question , and conjectures with regard to the secret and revealed will of the Emperor of Russia , news from her majesty 's most sacred retreat at Osborne , and the last debates in Parliament , comes my brown silk dress ! The Times has omitted the color ; I had a great mind to send him word about that . But you may tell the girls  --  for probably the news will spread through the American papers  --  that it is the brown Chinese silk which they put into my trunk , unmade , when I was too ill to sit up and be fitted . Mr. Times wants to know if Mrs. Stowe is aware what sort of a place her dress is being made in , and there is a letter from a dressmaker 's apprentice stating that it is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London , by poor , miserable white slaves , worse treated than the plantation slaves of America . Now , Mrs. Stowe did not know any thing of this , but simply gave the silk into the hands of a friend , and was in due time waited on in her own apartment by a very respectable woman , who offered to make the dress ; and lo , this is the result ! Since the publication of this piece , I have received earnest missives , from various parts of the country , begging me to interfere , hoping that I was not going to patronize the white slavery of England , and that I would employ my talents equally against oppression under every form . The person who had been so unfortunate as to receive the weight of my public patronage was in a very tragical state ; protested her innocence of any connection with dens , of any overworking of hands , &c.,; with as much fervor as if I had been appointed on a committee of parliamentary inquiry . Let my case be a warning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in London . Some of my correspondents seemed to think that I ought to publish a manifesto for the benefit of distressed Great Britain , stating how I came to do it , and all the circumstances , since they are quite sure I must have meant well , and containing gentle cautions as to the disposal of my future patronage in the dressmaking line . Could these people only know in what sacred simplicity I had been living in the State of Maine , where the only dressmaker of our circle was an intelligent , refined , well-educated woman , who was considered as the equal of us all , and whose spring and fall ministrations to our wardrobe were regarded a double pleasure ,  --  a friendly visit as well as a domestic assistance ,  --  I say , could they know all this , they would see how guiltless I was in the matter . I verily never thought but that the nice , pleasant person , who came to measure me for my silk , was going to take it home and make it herself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an establishment . And now , what am I to do ? The Times seems to think that , in order to be consistent , I ought to take up the conflict immediately ; but , for my part , I think otherwise . What an unreasonable creature ! Does he suppose me so lost to all due sense of humility as to take out of his hands a cause which he is pleading so well ? If the plantation slaves had such a good friend as the Times , and if every over-worked female cotton picker could write as clever letters as this dressmaker 's apprentice , and get them published in as influential papers , and excite as general a sensation by them as this seems to have done , I think I should feel that there was no need of my interfering in a work so much better done . Unfortunately , our female cotton pickers do not know how to read and write , and it is against the law to teach them ; and this instance shows that the law is a sagacious one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most embarrassing communications might be made . Nothing shows more plainly , to my mind , than this letter , the difference between the working class of England and the slave . The free workman or workwoman of England or America , however poor , is self-respecting ; is , to some extent , clever and intelligent ; is determined to resist wrong , and , as this incident shows , has abundant means for doing so . When we shall see the columns of the Charleston Courier adorned with communications from cotton pickers and slave seamstresses , we shall then think the comparison a fair one . In fact , apart from the whimsicality of the affair , and the little annoyance which one feels at notoriety to which one is not accustomed , I consider the incident as in some aspects a gratifying one , as showing how awake and active are the sympathies of the British public with that much-oppressed class of needlewomen . Horace Greeley would be delighted could his labors in this line excite a similar commotion in New York . We dined to-day at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of the family , the Duchess of Sutherland , Lord Carlisle , Lord and Lady Blantyre , &c.; The conversation flowed along in a very agreeable channel . I told them the more I contemplated life in Great Britain , the more I was struck with the contrast between the comparative smallness of the territory and the vast power , physical , moral , and intellectual , which it exerted in the world . The Duchess of Sutherland added , that it was beautiful to observe how gradually the idea of freedom had developed itself in the history of the English nation , growing clearer and more distinct in every successive century . I might have added that the history of our own American republic is but a continuation of the history of this development . The resistance to the stamp act was of the same kind as the resistance to the ship money ; and in our revolutionary war there were as eloquent defences of our principles and course heard in the British Parliament as echoed in Faneuil Hall . I conversed some with Lady Caroline Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theology . She is a member of the Free church , and attends , in London , Dr. Cumming 's congregation . I derived the impression from her remarks , that the style of preaching in Scotland is more discriminating and doctrinal than in England . One who studies the pictures given in Scott 's novels must often have been struck with the apparent similarity in the theologic training and tastes of the laboring classes in New England and Scotland . The hard-featured man , whom he describes in Rob Roy as following the preacher so earnestly , keeping count of the doctrinal points on his successive fingers , is one which can still be seen in the retired , rural districts of New England ; and I believe that this severe intellectual discipline of the pulpit has been one of the greatest means in forming that strong , self-sustaining character peculiar to both countries . The Duke of Argyle said that Chevalier Bunsen had been speaking to him in relation to a college for colored people at Antigua , and inquired my views respecting the emigration of colored people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him my impression was , that Canada would be a much better place to develop the energies of the race . First , on account of its cold and bracing climate ; second , because , having never been a slave state , the white population there are more thrifty and industrious , and of course the influence of such a community was better adapted to form thrift arid industry in the negro . In the evening , some of the ladies alluded to the dressmaker 's letter in the Times . I inquired if there was nothing done for them as a class in London , and some of them said ,  --  " O , Lord Shaftesbury can tell you all about it ; he is president of the society for their protection . " So I said to Lord Shaftesbury , playfully , " I thought , my lord , you had reformed every thing here in London . " " Ah , indeed , " he replied , " but this was not in one of my houses . I preside over the West End . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy ; said it was one of the most difficult he had ever attempted to regulate , and promised to send me a few documents , which would show the measures he had pursued . He said , however , that there was progress making ; and spoke of one establishment in particular , which had recently been erected in London , and was admirably arranged with regard to ventilation , being conducted in the most perfect manner . Quite a number of distinguished persons were present this evening ; among others , Sir David Brewster , famed in the scientific world . He is a fine-looking old gentleman , with silver-white hair , who seemed to be on terms of great familiarity with the duke . He bears the character of a decidedly religious man , and is an elder in the Free church . Lord Mahon , the celebrated historian , was there , with his lady . He is a young-looking man , of agreeable manners , and fluent in conversation . This I gather from Mr. S. , with whom he conversed very freely on our historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sharp controversy with whom he seems to bear with great equanimity . Lady Mahon is a handsome , interesting woman , with very pleasing manners . Mr. Gladstone was there also , one of the ablest and best men in the kingdom . It is a commentary on his character that , although one of the highest of the High church , we have never heard him spoken of , even among dissenters , otherwise than as an excellent and highly conscientious man . For a gentleman who has attained to such celebrity , both in theology and politics , he looks remarkably young . He is tall , with dark hair and eyes , a thoughtful , serious cast of countenance , and is easy and agreeable in conversation . On the whole , this was a very delightful evening . LETTER XXVI . DEAR C. :  --  I will add to this a little sketch , derived from the documents sent me by Lord Shaftesbury , of the movements in behalf of the milliners and dressmakers in London for seven years past . About thirteen years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission of inquiry into the employment of children and young persons in various trades and manufactures . This commission , among other things , was directed toward the millinery and dressmaking trade . These commissioners elicited the following facts : that there were fifteen hundred employers in this trade in London , and fifteen thousand young people employed , besides a great number of journeywomen who took the work home to their own houses . They discovered , also , that during the London season , which occupied about four months of the year , the regular hours of work were fifteen , but in many establishments they were entirely unlimited ,  --  the young women never getting more than six hours for sleep , and often only two or three ; that frequently they worked all night and part of Sunday . They discovered , also , that the rooms in which they worked and slept were overcrowded , and deficient in ventilation ; and that , in consequence of all these causes , blindness , consumption , and multitudes of other diseases carried thousands of them yearly to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , a society was formed in London in 1843 , called the Association for The Aid of Milliners and Dressmakers . The president of this society is the Earl of Shaftesbury ; the vice presidents are twenty gentlemen of the most influential position . Besides this there is a committee of ladies , and a committee of gentlemen . At the head of the committee of ladies stands the name of the Duchess of Sutherland , with seventeen others , among whom we notice the Countess of Shaftesbury , Countess of Ellesmere , Lady Robert Grosvenor , and others of the upper London sphere . The subscription list of donations to the society is headed by the queen and royal family . The features of the plan which the society undertook to carry out were briefly these :  --  First , they opened a registration office , where all young persons desiring employment in the dressmaking trade might enroll their names free of expense , and thus come in a manner under the care of the association . From the young people thus enrolled , they engaged to supply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommon pressure , so that they should not be under the necessity of overtaxing their workwomen . This assistance is extended only to those houses which will observe the moderate hours recommended by the association . In the second place , an arrangement is made by which the young persons thus registered are entitled to the best of medical advice at any time , for the sum of five shillings per year . Three physicians and two consulting surgeons are connected with the association . In the third place , models of simple and cheap modes of ventilation are kept at all times at the office of the society , and all the influence of the association is used to induce employers to place them in the work and sleeping rooms . Fourth , a kind of savings bank has been instituted , in which the workwomen are encouraged to deposit small earnings on good interest . This is the plan of the society , and as to its results I have at hand the report for 1851 , from which you can gather some particulars of its practical workings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association was established , during which a most gratifying change has been wrought in respect to the mode of conducting the dressmaking and millinery business . " Without overstepping the strict limits of truth , it may be affirmed that the larger part of the good thus achieved is attributable to the influence and unceasing efforts of this society . The general result , so far as the metropolis is concerned , may be thus stated : First , the hours of work , speaking generally , now rarely exceed twelve , whereas formerly sixteen , seventeen , and even eighteen hours were not unusual . " Second , the young persons are rarely kept up all night , which was formerly not an unusual occurrence . " Third , labor on the Lord 's day , it is confidently believed , has been entirely abrogated . " Under the old system the health and constitution of many of the young people were irretrievably destroyed . At present permanent loss of health is rarely entailed , and even when sickness does from any cause arise , skilful and prompt advice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In addition to these and similar ameliorations , other and more important changes have been effected . Among the heads of establishments , as the committee are happy to know and most willing to record , more elevated views of the duties and responsibilities , inseparable from employers , have secured to the association the zealous cooperation of numerous and influential principals , without whose aid the efforts of the last few years would have been often impeded , or even in many instances defeated . Nor have the young persons engaged in the dressmaking and millinery business remained uninfluenced amidst the general improvement . Finding that a strenuous effort was in progress to promote their physical and moral welfare , and that increased industry on their part would be rewarded by diminished hours of work , the assistants have become more attentive , the workrooms are better managed , and both parties , relieved from a system which was oppressive to all and really beneficial to none , have recognized the fundamental truth , that in no industrial pursuit is there any real incompatibility between the interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although not generally known , evils scarcely less serious than those formerly prevalent in the metropolis were not uncommon in the manufacturing towns and fashionable watering-places . It is obviously impracticable to ascertain to what extent the efforts of the association have been attended with success in the provinces ; but a rule has been established that in no instance shall the cooperation of the office , in providing assistants , be extended to any establishment in which the hours of work are known to exceed those laid down by the association . On these conditions the principals of many country establishments have for several years been supplied ; latterly , indeed , owing to the great efficiency of the manager , Miss Newton , and to the general satisfaction thus created , these applications have so much increased as to constitute a principal part of the business of the office ; and with the increase the influence of the association has been proportionally extended . " This , as you perceive , was the report for 1851 . Lord Shaftesbury has kindly handed me the first proof of the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few extracts . After the publication of the letter from the ladies of England to the ladies of America , much was said in the Times and other newspapers with regard to the condition of the dressmakers . These things are what are alluded to in the commencement of the report . They say ,  --  " In presenting their annual report , the committees would in the first place refer to the public notice that has lately been directed to the mode in which the dressmaking and millinery business is conducted : this they feel to be due both to the association and to those employers who have cooperated in the good work of improvement . It has been stated in former reports , that since the first establishment of this society , in the year 1843 , and essentially through its influence , great ameliorations have been secured ; that the inordinate hours of work formerly prevalent had , speaking generally , been greatly reduced ; that Sunday labor had been abolished ; that the young people were rarely kept up all night ; and that , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease of serious sickness . " At the present moment , in consequence of the statements that have appeared in the public journals , and in order to guard against misconceptions , the committees are anxious to announce that they perceive no reason for withdrawing any of their preceding statements  - -  the latest , equally with former investigations , indicating the great improvement effected in recent years . The manager at the office has been instructed to make express inquiries of the young dressmakers themselves ; and the result distinctly proves that , on the whole , there has been a marked diminution in the hours of work . " The report of Mr. Trouncer , the medical officer who has attended the larger number of the young persons for whom advice has been provided by the association , is equally satisfactory . This gentleman , after alluding to the great evils in regard to health inflicted in former years , remarks that these have , through the instrumentality of the association , been greatly ameliorated ; that as regards consumption ,  - -  although the nature of the employment itself , however modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the predisposition exists ,  --  he is happy to state that the average number of cases , even in the incipient stage , has not been so great as might , from the circumstances , have been anticipated ; that during the last two years , out of about two hundred and fifty cases of sickness , no death has occurred ; and that but in a few instances only has it been necessary to advise a total cessation of business . Mr. Trouncer adds  --  and this is a statement which the committees have much pleasure in announcing  --  that , in the majority of the West End houses , the principals have , in cases of sickness , acted the part of parents , evincing , in some instances , even more care than the young persons themselves . " In addition to these satisfactory and reliable statements , it is a matter of simple justice to state that many houses of business have cooperated with the association in reducing the hours of work , in improving the workrooms and sleeping apartments , and generally in promoting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also very creditably , and at considerable expense , exerted themselves to secure a good system of ventilation  --  a subject to which the committees attach great importance , both as regards the health and comfort of those employed . " It is not , by these statements , intended to be said that all requiring amendment has been corrected . In their last report the committees remarked that some few houses of business systematically persisted in exacting excessive labor from their assistants ; and they regret to state that this observation is still applicable . The important subject of ventilation is still much neglected , and there is reason to apprehend that the sleeping apartments are often much overcrowded . Another and a more prevailing evil relates to the time allowed for meals : this is often altogether insufficient , and strongly contrasted with the custom in other industrial pursuits , in which one hour for dinner , and half an hour for breakfast or tea , as the case may be , is the usual allowance . In an occupation so sedentary as dressmaking , and especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are a frequent cause of deranged health . It is also the painful duty of the committees to state that in some establishments , according to the medical report , the principals , in cases of sickness , will neither allow the young people an opportunity of calling on the medical officer for his advice , nor permit that gentleman to visit them at the place of business . The evils resulting from this absence of all proper feeling are so obvious that it is hoped this public rebuke will in future obviate the necessity of recurring to so painful a topic . " The committee after this proceed to publish the following declaration , signed by fifty-three of the West End dressmakers :  --  " ' We , the undersigned principals of millinery and dress-making establishments at the West End of London , having observed in the newspapers statements of excessive labor in our business , feel called upon , in self-defence , to make the following public statement , especially as we have reason to believe that some of the assertions contained in the letters published in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . During the greater portion of the year we do not require the young people in our establishments to work more than twelve hours , inclusive of one hour and a half for meals : from March to July we require them to work thirteen hours and a half , allowing during that time one hour 's rest for dinner , and half an hour 's rest for tea . " ' 2 . It has been our object to provide suitable sleeping accommodations , and to avoid overcrowding. " ' 3 . In no case do we require work on Sundays , or all night . " ' 4 . The food we supply is of the best quality , and unlimited in quantity . ' " Five of these dressmakers , whose names are designated by stars , signed with the understanding that on rare occasions the hours might possibly be exceeded . The remarks which the committee make , considering that it has upon its list the most influential and distinguished ladies of the London world , are , I think , worth attention , as showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear , both on the trade and on fashionable society , by this association . They first remark , with regard to those employers who signed with the reservation alluded to , that they have every reason to believe that the feeling which prompted this qualification is to be respected , as it originated in a determination not to undertake more than they honestly intended to perform . They say of the document , on the whole , that , though not realizing all the views of the association , it must be regarded as creditable to those who have signed it , since it indicates the most important advance yet made towards the improvement of the dressmaking and millinery business . The committees then go on to express a most decided opinion , first , that the hours of work in the dressmaking trade ought not to exceed ten per diem ; second , that during the fashionable season ladies should employ sufficient time for the execution of their orders . The influence of this association , as will be seen , has extended all over England . In Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to the principals of the establishments , desiring them to adopt the rules of the London association . I mentioned , in a former letter , that the lady mayoress of London , and the ladies of the city , held a meeting on the subject only a short time since , with a view of carrying the same improvement through all the establishments of that part of London . The lady mayoress and five others of this meeting consented to add their names to the committee , so that it now represents the whole of London . The Bishop of London and several of the clergy extend their patronage to the association . LETTER XXVII . DEAR S. :  --  The next day we went to hear a sermon in behalf of the ragged schools , by the Archbishop of Canterbury . The children who attended the ragged schools of that particular district were seated in the gallery , each side of the organ . As this was the Sunday appropriated to the exercise , all three of the creeds were read  --  the Apostles ' , Athanasian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the archbishop , with great decorum , and probably with the same amount of understanding that we , when children , had of the Assembly 's Catechism . The venerable archbishop was ushered into the pulpit by beadles , with gold lace cocked hats , striking the ground majestically with their long staves of office . His sermon , however , was as simple , clear , and beautiful an exposition of the duty of practical Christianity towards the outcast and erring as I ever heard . He said that , should we find a young child wandering away from its home and friends , we should instinctively feel it our duty to restore the little wanderer ; and such , he said , is the duty we owe to all these young outcasts , who had strayed from the home of their heavenly Father . After the sermon they took up a collection ; and when we went into the vestry to speak to the archbishop , we saw him surrounded by the church wardens , counting over the money . I noticed in the back part of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forlorn and wild appearance , and was told that these were those who had just been introduced into the school , and had not been there long enough to come under its modifying influences . We were told that they were always thus torn and forlorn in their appearance at first , but that they gradually took pains to make themselves respectable . The archbishop said , pleasantly , " When they return to their right mind they appear clothed , also , and sitting at the feet of Jesus . " The archbishop sent me afterwards a beautiful edition of his sermons on Christian charity , embracing a series of discourses on various topics of practical benevolence , relating to the elevation and christianization of the masses . They are written with the same purity of style , and show the same devout and benevolent spirit with his other writings . My thoughts were much saddened to-day by the news , which I received this week , of the death of Mary Edmonson . It is not for her that I could weep ; for she died as calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of her Savior . What I do weep for is , that under the flag of my country  --  and that country a Christian one  --  such a life as Mary 's could have been lived , and so little said or done about it . In the afternoon I went to the deanery of St. Paul 's  --  a retired building in a deep court opposite the cathedral . After a brief conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Milman , we went to the cathedral . I had never seen it before , and was much impressed with the majesty and grace of the interior . Nevertheless , the Italian style of architecture , with all its elegance , fails to affect me equally with the Gothic . The very rudeness of the latter , a something inchoate and unfinished , is significant of matter struggling with religious ideas too vast to be fully expressed . Even as in the ancient Scriptures there are ideas which seem to overtask the powers of human language . I sat down with Mrs. M. in one of the little compartments , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galleries are divided , and which are richly carved in black oak . The whole service was chanted by a choir expressly trained for the purpose . Some of the performers are boys of about thirteen years , and of beautiful countenances . There is a peculiar manner of reading the service practised in the cathedrals , which is called " intoning . " It is a plaintive , rhythmical chant , with as strong an unction of the nasal as ever prevailed in a Quaker or Methodist meeting . I can not exactly understand why Episcopacy threw out the slur of " nasal twang " as one of the peculiarities of the conventicle , when it is in full force in the most approved seats of church orthodoxy . I listened to all in as uncritical and sympathetic a spirit as possible , giving myself up to be lifted by the music as high as it could waft me . To one thus listening , it is impossible to criticize with severity ; for , unless positively offensive , any music becomes beautiful by the power of sympathy and association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rev. Mr. Villiers , fervent , affectionate , and evangelical in spirit , and much in the general style of sermonizing which I have already described . Monday morning , May 23 . We went to breakfast at Mr. Cobden 's . Mr. C. is a man of slender frame , rather under than over the middle size , with great ease of manner , and flexibility of movement , and the most frank , fascinating smile . His appearance is a sufficient account of his popularity , for he seems to be one of those men who carry about them an atmosphere of vivacity and social exhilaration . We had a very pleasant and social time , discussing and comparing things in England and America . Mr. Cobden assured us that he had had curious calls from Americans , sometimes . Once an editor of a small village paper called , who had been making a tour through the rural districts of England . He said that he had asked some mowers how they were prospering . They answered , " We ai n't prosperin ' ; we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , ' Now do n't you go home and publish that in your paper ; ' but he did , nevertheless , and sent me over the paper with the story in it . " I might have comforted him with many a similar anecdote of Americans , as for example , the man who was dead set against a tariff , " ' cause he knew if they once got it , they 'd run the old thing right through his farm ; " or those immortal Pennsylvania Dutchmen , who , to this day , it is said , give in all their votes under the solemn conviction that they are upholding General Jackson 's administration . The conversation turned on the question of the cultivation of cotton by free labor . The importance of this great measure was fully appreciated by Mr. Cobden , as it must be by all . The difficulties to be overcome in establishing the movement were no less clearly seen , and ably pointed out . On the whole , the comparison of views was not only interesting in a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profitable . We ventured to augur favorably to the cause from the indications of that interview . From this breakfast we returned to dine at Surrey parsonage ; and , after dinner , attended Miss Greenfield 's concert at Stafford House . Mr. S. could not attend on account of so soon leaving town . The concert room was the brilliant and picturesque hall I have before described to you . It looked more picture-like and dreamy than ever . The piano was on the flat stairway just below the broad central landing . It was a grand piano , standing end outward , and perfectly banked up among hothouse flowers , so that only its gilded top was visible . Sir George Smart presided . The choicest of the elite were there . Ladies in demi-toilet and bonneted . Miss Greenfield stood among the singers on the staircase , and excited a sympathetic murmur among the audience . She is not handsome , but looked very well . She has a pleasing dark face , wore a black velvet headdress and white carnelian earrings , a black mohr antique silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling sleeves and white gloves . A certain gentleness of manner and self-possession , the result of the universal kindness shown her , sat well upon her . Chevalier Bunsen , the Prussian ambassador , sat by me . He looked at her with much interest . " Are the race often as good looking ? " he said . I said , " She is not handsome , compared with many , though I confess she looks uncommonly well to-day . " Among the company present I noticed the beautiful Marchioness of Stafford . I have spoken of her once before ; but it is difficult to describe her , there is something so perfectly simple , yet elegant , in her appearance ; but it has cut itself like a cameo in my memory  --  a figure under the middle size , perfectly moulded , dressed simply in black , a beautiful head , hair a la Madonna , ornamented by a band of gold coins on black velvet : a band of the same kind encircling her throat is the only relief to the severe simplicity of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cultivated glee singers of London sang , among other things , " Spring 's delights are now returning , " and " Where the bee sucks there lurk I. " The duchess said , " These glees are peculiarly English . " It was indeed delightful to hear Shakspeare 's aerial words made vocal within the walls of this fairy palace . The duchess has a strong nationality ; and nationality , always interesting , never appears in so captivating a form as when it expresses itself through a beautiful and cultivated woman . One likes to see a person identifying one 's self with a country , and she embraces England , with its history , its strength , its splendor , its moral power , with an evident pride and affection which I love to see . Miss Greenfield 's turn for singing now came , and there was profound attention . Her voice , with its keen , searching fire , its penetrating vibrant quality , its " timbre " as the French have it , cut its way like a Damascus blade to the heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects , which showed that she had received no culture from art . She sang the ballad , " Old folks at home , " giving one verse in the soprano , and another in the tenor voice . As she stood partially concealed by the piano Chevalier Bunsen thought that the tenor part was performed by one of the gentlemen . He was perfectly astonished when he discovered that it was by her . This was rapturously encored . Between the parts Sir George took her to the piano , and tried her voice by skips , striking notes here and there at random , without connection , from D in alt to A first space in bass clef : she followed with unerring precision , striking the sound nearly at the same instant his finger touched the key . This brought out a burst of applause . After the concert we walked through the rooms . The effect of the groups of people sauntering through the hall or looking down from the galleries was picture-like . Two of the duke 's Highland pipers , in full costume , playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promenade the halls , playing . Their dress reminds me , in its effect , of that of our American Indians , and their playing is wild and barbaric . It had a striking effect among these wide halls and corridors . There is nothing poetic connected with the history and position of the family of which the fair owner of the halls does not feel the power , and which she can not use with artistic skill in heightening the enchantments of an entertainment . Rev. S. R. Ward attracted attention in the company , as a full-blooded African  --  tall enough for a palm tree . I observed him in conversation with lords , dukes , and ambassadors , sustaining himself modestly , but with self-possession . All who converse with him are satisfied that there is no native difference between the African and other men . The duchess took me to look at a model of Dunrobin  --  their castle on the Sutherland estate . It is in the old French chateau style in general architecture , something like the print of Glamis . It is curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace kindly invited me to visit Dunrobin on my return to Scotland in the autumn , taking it after Inverary . This will be delightful . That Scottish coast I love almost like my own country . Lord Shaftesbury was there . He came and spoke to us after the concert . Speaking of Miss Greenfield , he said , " I consider the use of these halls for the encouragement of an outcast race , a consecration . This is the true use of wealth and splendor when it is employed to raise up and encourage the despised and forgotten . " In the evening , though very weary , C. persuaded me to accept an invitation to hear the Creation , at Exeter Hall , performed by the London Sacred Harmonic Society . They had kindly reserved a gallery for us , and when we went in Mr. Surman , the founder and for twenty years conductor of the society , presented me with a beautifully bound copy of the Creation . Having never heard it before , I could not compare the performance with others . I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of the author 's ideas , and not of the style of reading . Haydn I was thinking of ,  --  the bright , brilliant , cheerful Haydn ,  --  who , when complained of for making church music into dancing tunes , replied , " When I think of God my soul is always so full of joy that I want to dance ! " This Creation is a descriptive poem  --  the garden parts unite Thomson and Milton 's style  --  the whole effect pastoral , yet brilliant . I was never more animated . I had had a new experience ; it is worth while to know nothing to have such a fresh sensation . The next day , Tuesday , May 24 , we went to lunch with Miss R. , at Oxford Terrace . Among a number of distinguished guests was Lady Byron , with whom I had a few moments of deeply interesting conversation . No engravings that ever have been circulated of her in America do any justice to her appearance . She is of a slight figure , formed with exceeding delicacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and air unite to make an impression of a character singularly dignified , gentle , pure , and yet strong . No words addressed to me in any conversation hitherto have made their way to my inner soul with such force as a few remarks dropped by her on the present religious aspect of England  --  remarks of such a quality as one seldom hears . Lady Byron 's whole course , I have learned , has been one made venerable by consistent , active benevolence . I was happy to find in her the patroness of our American outcasts , William and Ellen Crafts . She had received them into the schools of her daughter , Lady Lovelace , at Occum , and now spoke in the highest terms of their character and proficiency in study . The story of their misfortunes , united with their reputation for worth , had produced such an impression on the simple country people , that they always respectfully touch their hats when meeting them . Ellen , she says , has become mother of a most beautiful child , and their friends are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business by which they may obtain a support . I could not but observe with regret the evident fragility of Lady Byron 's health ; yet why should I regret it ? Why wish to detain here those whose home is evidently from hence , and who will only then fully live when the shadow we call life is passed away ? Here , also , I was personally introduced to a lady with whom I had passed many a dreamy hour of spiritual communion  --  Mrs. Jameson , whose works on arts and artists were for years almost my only food for a certain class of longings . Mrs. Jameson is the most charming of critics , with the gift , often too little prized , of discovering and pointing out beauties rather than defects ; beauties which we may often have passed unnoticed , but which , when so pointed out , never again conceal themselves . This shows itself particularly in her Characteristics of Shakspeare 's Women , a critique which only a true woman could have written . She seemed rather surprised to find me inquiring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to study that subject most profitably , and her answer was , in Munich . By her side was Mrs. Chisholm , the author of those benevolent movements for the emigrants , which I have mentioned to you . She is a stout , practical looking woman , who impresses you with the idea of perfect health , exuberant life , and an iron constitution . Her face expresses decision , energy , and good sense . She is a woman of few words , every moment of whose time seems precious . One of her remarks struck me , from the quaint force with which it was uttered . " I found , " said she , " if we want any thing done , we must go to work and do ; it is of no use to talk , none whatever . " It is the secret of her life 's success . Mrs. Chisholm first began by doing on a small scale what she wanted done , and people seeing the result fell in with and helped her , but to have convinced them of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration , would have been impossible . At this reunion , also , was Mr. George Thompson , whom I had never seen before , and many of the warmest friends of the slave . During this visit I was taken ill , and obliged to return to Mr. Gurney 's , where I was indisposed during the remainder of the day , and late in the evening drove home to Surrey parsonage . The next evening , Wednesday , May 29 , we attended an antislavery soiree , at Willis 's rooms , formerly known as Almack 's ; so at least I was told . A number of large rooms were thrown open , brilliantly lighted and adorned , and filled with throngs of people . In the course of the evening we went upon the platform in the large hall , where an address was presented by S. Bowley , Esq. , of Gloucester . It was one of the most beautiful , sensible , judicious , and Christian addresses that could have been made , and I listened to it with unmingled pleasure . In reply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to the free-grown cotton movement in England , and its bearings on the future progress of the cause of freedom . Footnote : We are happy to say that a large body of religious persons in Great Britain have become favorable to these views . A vigorous society has been established , combining India reform and free cotton with the antislavery cause . The Earl of Albemarle made , while we were in London , a vigorous India reform speech in the House of Lords , and Messrs . Bright and Cobden are fully in for the same object in the Commons . There is much hope in the movement . After the addresses we dispersed to different rooms , where refreshment tables were bountifully laid out and adorned . By my side , at one end of them , was a young female of pleasing exterior , with fine eyes , delicate person , neatly dressed in white . She was introduced to me as Ellen Crafts  --  a name memorable in Boston annals . Her husband , a pleasant , intelligent young man , with handsome manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my introduction I could never have fancied Ellen to have been any other than some English girl with rather a paler cheek than common . She has very sweet manners , and uses uncommonly correct and beautiful language . Let it not be supposed that , with such witnesses as these among them , our English brethren have derived their first practical knowledge of slavery from Uncle Tom 's Cabin . The mere knowledge that two such persons as William and Ellen Crafts have been rated as merchantable commodities , in any country but ours would be a sufficient comment on the system . We retired early after a very agreeable evening . LETTER XXVIII . May 28 . MY DEAR COUSIN :  --  This morning Lord Shaftesbury came according to appointment , to take me to see the Model Lodging Houses . He remarked that it would be impossible to give me the full effect of seeing them , unless I could first visit the dens of filth , disease , and degradation , in which the poor of London formerly were lodged . With a good deal of satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , previous to leaving London , had requested the police to take him over the dirtiest and most unwholesome parts of it , that he might see the lowest as well as the highest sphere of London life . After this , however , the policeman took him through the baths , wash houses , and model lodging houses , which we were going to visit , and he expressed himself both surprised and delighted with the improvement that had been made . Illustration : of the facade of " The Model Lodging House . " We first visited the lodging house for single men in Charles Street , Drury Lane . This was one of the first experiments made in this line , and to effect the thing in the most economical manner possible , three old houses were bought and thrown into one , and fitted up for the purpose . On the ground floor we saw the superintendent 's apartment , and a large , long sitting room , furnished with benches and clean , scoured tables , where the inmates were , some of them , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kept them from their work . In the kitchen were ample cooking accommodations , and each inmate , as I understand , cooks for himself . Lord Shaftesbury said , that  --  something like a common table had been tried , but that it was found altogether easier or more satisfactory for each one to suit himself . On this floor , also , was a bathing room , and a well-selected library of useful reading books , history , travels , &c.; On the next floor were the dormitories  --  a great hall divided by board partitions into little sleeping cells about eight feet square , each containing a neat bed , chair , and stand . The partition does not extend quite up to the wall , and by this means while each inmate enjoys the privacy of a small room , he has all the comfort of breathing the air of the whole hall . A working man returning from his daily toil to this place , can first enjoy the comfort of a bath ; then , going into the kitchen , make his cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clean , scoured tables in the sitting room , sip his tea , and look over a book . Or a friendly company may prepare their supper and sit down to tea together . Lord Shaftesbury said that the effect produced on the men by such an arrangement was wonderful . They became decent , decorous , and self-respecting . They passed rules of order for their community . They subscribed for their library from their own earnings , and the books are mostly of their own selection . " It is remarkable , " said his lordship , " that of their own accord they decided to reject every profane , indecent , or immoral work . It showed , " he said , " how strong are the influences of the surroundings in reforming or ruining the character . " It should be remarked that all these advantages are enjoyed for the same price charged by the most crowded and filthy of lodging houses , namely , fourpence per night , or two shillings per week . The building will accommodate eighty-two . The operation supports itself handsomely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to test more fully the practicability of the thing , this was accomplished in one of the worst neighborhoods in London . From these we proceeded to view a more perfect specimen of the same sort in the Model Lodging House of George Street , Bloomsbury Square , a house which was built de novo , for the purpose of perfectly illustrating the principle . This house accommodates one hundred and four working men , and combines every thing essential or valuable in such an establishment  --  complete ventilation and drainage ; the use of a distinct living room ; a kitchen and a wash house , a bath , and an ample supply of water , and all the conveniences which , while promoting the physical comfort of the inmates , tend to increase their self-respect , and elevate them in the scale of moral and intellectual beings . The arrangement of the principal apartments are such as to insure economy as well as domestic comfort , the kitchen and wash house being furnished with every requisite convenience , including a bath supplied with hot and cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each inmate . Under the care of the superintendent is a small , but well-selected library . The common room , thirty-three feet long , twenty-three feet wide , and ten feet nine inches high , is paved with white tiles , laid on brick arches , and on each side are two rows of tables with seats ; at the fireplace is a constant supply of hot water , and above it are the rules of the establishment . The staircase , which occupies the centre of the building , is of stone . The dormitories , eight in number , ten feet high , are subdivided with movable wood partitions six feet nine inches high ; each compartment , enclosed by its own door , is fitted up with a bed , chair , and clothes box . A shaft is carried up at the end of every room , the ventilation through it being assisted by the introduction of gas , which lights the apartment . A similar shaft is carried up the staircase , supplying fresh air to the dormitories , with a provision for warming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor are fitted up with slate , having japanned iron basins , and water laid on . During the fearful ravages of the cholera in this immediate neighborhood , not one case occurred in this house among its one hundred and four inmates . From this place we proceeded to one , if any thing , more interesting to me . This was upon the same principle appropriated to the lodgment of single women . When one considers the defenceless condition of single women , who labor for their own subsistence in a large city , how easily they are imposed upon and oppressed , and how quickly a constitution may be destroyed for want of pure air , fresh water , and other common necessaries of life , one fully appreciates the worth of a large and beautiful building , which provides for this oppressed , fragile class . The Thanksgiving Model Buildings at Port Pool Lane , Gray 's Inn , are so called because they were built with a thank-offering collected in the various religious societies of London , as an appropriate expression of their gratitude to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings has in it accommodations for twenty families , and one hundred and twenty-eight single women ; together with a public wash house , and a large cellar , in which are stored away the goods of those women who live by the huckster 's trade . The hundred and twenty-eight single women , of whom the majority are supposed to be poor needlewomen , occupy sixty-four rooms in a building of four stories , divided by a central staircase ; a corridor on either side forms a lobby to eight rooms , each twelve feet six inches long , by nine feet six inches wide , sufficiently large for two persons . They are fitted up with two bedsteads , a table , chairs , and a washing stand . The charge is one shilling per week for each person , or two shillings per room . Lord Shaftesbury took me into one of the rooms , where was an aged female partially bedridden , who maintained herself by sewing , The room was the picture of neatness and comfort ; a good supply of hot and cold water was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her upon the bed , together with her Bible and hymn book ; she looked cheerful and comfortable . She seemed pleased to see Lord Shaftesbury , whom she had evidently seen many times before , as his is a familiar countenance in all these places . She expressed the most fervent thankfulness for the quiet , order , and comfort of her pleasant lodgings , comparing them very feelingly with what used to be her condition before any such place had been provided . Illustration : of a four story rectangular brick/masonry structure . From this place we drove to the Streatham Street Lodging House for families , of which the following is an outside view . This building is , in the first place , fire proof ; in the second , the separation in the parts belonging to different families is rendered complete and perfect by the use of hollow brick for the partitions , which entirely prevents , as I am told , the transmission of sound .

By means of the sleeping closet adjoining the living room , each dwelling affords three good sleeping apartments . The meat safe preserves provisions . The dust flue is so arranged that all the sweepings of the house , and all the refuse of the cookery , have only to be thrown down to disappear forever ; while the sink is supplied to an unlimited extent with hot and cold water . These galleries , into which every tenement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the building encloses , and afford an admirable play-place for the little children , out of the dangers and temptations of the street , and in view of their respective mothers . The foregoing print , representing the inner half of the quadrangle , shows the arrangement of the galleries . " Now , " said Lord Shaftesbury , as he was showing me through these tenements , which were models of neatness and good keeping , " you must bear in mind that these are tenanted by the very people who once were living in the dirtiest and filthiest lodging houses ; people whom the world said , it did no good to try to help ; that they liked to be dirty better than clean , and would be dirty under any circumstances . " He added the following anecdote to show the effect of poor lodgings in degrading the character . A fine young man , of some considerable taste and talent , obtained his living by designing patterns for wall paper . A long and expensive illness so reduced his circumstances , that he was obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses already alluded to . From that time he became an altered man ; his wife said that he lost all energy , all taste in designing , love of reading , and fondness for his family ; began to frequent drinking shops , and was visibly on the road to ruin . Hearing of these lodging houses , he succeeded in renting a tenement in one of them , for the same sum which he had paid for the miserable dwelling . Under the influence of a neat , airy , pleasant , domestic home , the man 's better nature again awoke , his health improved , he ceased to crave ardent spirits , and his former ingenuity in his profession returned . " Now , this shows , " said Lord Shaftesbury , " that hundreds may have been ruined simply by living in miserable dwellings . " I looked into this young man 's tenement ; it was not only neat , but ornamented with a great variety of engravings tastefully disposed upon the wall . On my expressing my pleasure in this circumstance , he added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , to notice how soon they began to ornament their little dwellings ; some have cages with singing birds , and some pots of flowering plants ; some , pictures and engravings . " " And are these buildings successful in a pecuniary point of view ? " I said . " Do they pay their own way ? " " Yes , " he replied , " they do . I consider that these buildings , if they have done nothing more , have established two points : first , that the poor do not prefer dirt and disorder , where it is possible for them to secure neatness and order ; and second , that buildings with every proper accommodation can be afforded at a price which will support an establishment . " Said I , " Are people imitating these lodging houses very rapidly ? " " To a great extent they are , " he replied , " but not so much as I desire . Buildings on these principles have been erected in the principal towns of England and Scotland . The state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequence of the neglect of former days , when speculators and builders were allowed to do as they liked , and run up hovels , where the working man , whose house must be regulated , not by his choice , but by his work , was compelled then , as he is now , to live , however narrow , unhealthy , or repulsive the place might be . This was called ' the liberty of the subject . ' " It has been one of Lord Shaftesbury 's most arduous parliamentary labors to bring the lodging houses under governmental regulation . He told me that he introduced a bill to this effect in the House of Commons , while a member , as Lord Ashley , and that just as it had passed through the House of Commons , he entered the House of Lords , as Lord Shaftesbury , and so had the satisfaction of carrying the bill to its completion in that house , where it passed in the year 1851 . The provisions of this bill require every keeper of a lodging house to register @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalty of a fine of five pounds for every lodger received before this is done . After having given notice to the police , they are not allowed to receive lodgers until the officers have inspected the house , to see whether it accords with the required conditions . These conditions are , that the walls and ceilings be whitewashed ; that the floors , stairs , beds , and bed clothes are clean ; that there be some mode of ventilating every room ; that each house be provided with every accommodation for promoting decency and neatness ; that the drains and cesspools are perfect ; the yards properly paved , so as to run dry ; and that each house has a supply of water , with conveniences for cooking and washing ; and finally , that no person with an infectious disease is inhabiting the house . It is enacted , moreover , that only so many shall be placed in a room as shall be permitted by the commissioners of the police ; and it is made an indispensable condition to the fitness of a house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card , properly signed by the police inspector , stating the precise number who are allowed to be lodged there . The law also strictly forbids persons of different sexes occupying the same room , except in case of married people with children under ten years of age : more than one married couple may not inhabit the same apartment , without the provision of a screen to secure privacy . It is also forbidden to use the kitchens , sculleries , or cellars for sleeping rooms , unless specially permitted by the police . The keeper of the house is required thoroughly to whitewash the walls and ceilings twice a year , and to cleanse the drains and cesspools whenever required by the police . In case of sickness , notice must be immediately given to the police , and such measures pursued , for preventing infection , as may be deemed judicious by the inspector . The commissioner of police reports to the secretary of state systematically as to the results of this system . After looking at these things , we proceeded to view one of the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poor women . We entered a large hall , which was divided by low wood partitions into small apartments , in each of which a woman was washing . The whole process of washing clothes in two or three waters , and boiling them , can be effected without moving from the spot , or changing the tub . Each successive water is let out at the bottom , while fresh is let on from the top . When the clothes are ready to be boiled , a wooden cover is placed over them , and a stream of scalding steam is directed into the tub , by turning a stop cock ; this boils the water in a few moments , effectually cleansing the clothes ; they are then whirled in a hollow cylinder till nearly dry , after which they are drawn through two rollers covered with flannel , which presses every remaining particle of water out of them . The clothes are then hung upon frames , which shut into large closets , and are dried by steam in a very short space of time . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an arrangement of delicacy to save their feelings : their clothes are sometimes so old and shabby they do not want to show them , poor things . " I thought this feature worthy of special notice . In addition to all these improvements for the laboring classes , very large bathing establishments have been set up expressly for the use of the working classes . To show the popularity and effectiveness of this movement , five hundred and fifty thousand baths were given in three houses during the year 1850 . These bathing establishments for the working classes are rapidly increasing in every part of the kingdom . When we returned to our carriage after this survey , I remarked to Lord Shaftesbury that the combined influence of these causes must have wrought a considerable change in the city . He answered , with energy , " You can have no idea . Whole streets and districts have been revolutionized by it . The people who were formerly savage and ferocious , because they supposed themselves despised and abandoned , are now perfectly quiet and docile . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no attendant but a little child , through streets in London where , years ago , a well-dressed man could not have passed safely without an escort of the police . " I said to him that I saw nothing now , with all the improvements they were making throughout the kingdom , to prevent their working classes from becoming quite as prosperous as ours , except the want of a temperance reformation . He assented with earnestness . He believed , he said , that the amount spent in liquors of various kinds , which do no good , but much injury , was enough to furnish every laborer 's dwelling , not only with comforts , but with elegances . " But then , " he said , " one thing is to be considered : a reform of the dwellings will do a great deal towards promoting a temperance reformation . A man who lives in a close , unwholesome dwelling , deprived of the natural stimulus of fresh air and pure water , comes into a morbid and unhealthy state ; he craves stimulants to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy influences . " There is certainly a great deal of truth in this ; and I think that , in America , we should add to the force of our Maine law by adopting some of the restrictions of the Lodging House act . I have addressed this letter to you , my dear cousin , on account of the deep interest you have taken in the condition of the poor and perishing in the city of New York . While making these examinations , these questions occurred to my mind : Could our rich Christian men employ their capital in a more evangelical manner , or more adorn the city of New York , than by raiding a large and beautiful lodging house , which should give the means of health , comfort , and vigor to thousands of poor needlewomen ? The same query may be repeated concerning all the other lodging houses I have mentioned . Furthermore , should not a movement for the registration and inspection of common lodging houses keep pace with efforts to suppress the sale of spirits ? The poison of these dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break over and evade law . LETTER XXIX . DEAR FATHER :  --  I wish in this letter to give you a brief view of the movements in this country for the religious instruction and general education of the masses . If we compare the tone of feeling now prevalent with that existing but a few years back , we notice a striking change . No longer ago than in the time of Lady Huntington we find a lady of quality ingenuously confessing that her chief source of scepticism in regard to Christianity was , that it actually seemed to imply that the educated , the refined , the noble , must needs be saved by the same Savior and the same gospel with the ignorant and debased working classes . Traces of a similar style of feeling are discernible in the letters of the polished correspondents of Hannah More . Robert Walpole gayly intimates himself somewhat shocked at the idea that the nobility and the vulgar should be equally subject to the restraints of the Sabbath and the law of God  --  equally exposed to the sanctions of endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shall pleasures of a short duration chain A lady 's soul in everlasting pain ? " In broad contrast to this , all the modern popular movements in England are based upon the recognition of the equal value of every human soul . The Times , the most aristocratic paper in England , publishes letters from needlewomen and dressmakers ' apprentices , and reads grave lectures to duchesses and countesses on their duties to their poor sisters . One may fancy what a stir this would have made in the courtly circles of the reign of George II . Fashionable literature now arrays itself on the side of the working classes . The current of novel writing is reversed . Instead of milliners and chambermaids being bewitched with the adventures of countesses and dukes , we now have fine lords and ladies hanging enchanted over the history of John the Carrier , with his little Dot , dropping sympathetic tears into little Charlie 's wash tub , and pursuing the fortunes of a dressmaker 's apprentice , in company with poor Smike , and honest John Brodie and his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work people ; and if , occasionally , he laughs at them , it is rather in a kindly way than with any air of contempt . Then , Prince Albert visits model lodging houses , and commands all the ingenuity of the kingdom to expend itself in completing the ideal of a workman 's cottage for the great World 's Fair . Lords deliver lydeum lectures ; ladies patronize ragged schools ; committees of duchesses meliorate the condition of needlewomen . In short , the great ship of the world has tacked , and stands on another course . The beginning of this great humanitarian movement in England was undoubtedly the struggle of Clarkson , Wilberforce , and their associates , for the overthrow of the slave trade . In that struggle the religious democratic element was brought to bear for years upon the mind of Parliament . The negro , most degraded of men , was taken up , and for years made to agitate British society on the simple ground that he had a human soul . Of course the religious obligations of society to every human soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it educated the community . Parliament became accustomed to hearing the simple principles of the gospel asserted in its halls as of binding force . The community were trained in habits of efficient benevolent action , which they have never lost . The use of tracts , of committees , of female cooperation , of voluntary association , and all the appliances of organized reform were discovered and successfully developed . The triumphant victory then achieved , moreover , became the pledge of future conquests in every department of reform . Concerning the movements for the elevation of the masses , Lord Shaftesbury has kindly furnished me with a few brief memoranda , set down as nearly as possible in chronological order . In the first place , there has been reform of the poor laws . So corrupt had this system become , that a distinct caste had well nigh sprung into permanent existence , families having been known to subsist in idleness for five generations solely by means of skilful appropriation of public and private charities . The law giving to paupers the preference in all cases where any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good workmen might starve for want of work : by declaring themselves paupers they obtained employment . Thus , virtually , a bounty was offered to pauperism . His lordship remarks ,  --  " There have been sad defects , no doubt , and some harshness , under the new system ; but the general result has been excellent ; and , in many instances , the system has been reduced to practice in a truly patriarchal spirit . The great difficulty and the great failure are found in the right and safe occupation of children who are trained in these workhouses , of which so much has been said . " In the second place , the treatment of the insane has received a thorough investigation . This began , in 1828 , by a committee of inquiry , moved for by Mr. Gordon . An almost incredible amount of suffering and horrible barbarity was thus brought to light . For the most part it appeared that the treatment of the insane had been conducted on the old , absurd idea which cuts them off from humanity , and reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in private madhouses was such that Lord Shaftesbury remarked of them , in a speech on the subject , " I have said before , and now say again , that should it please God to visit me with such an affliction , I would greatly prefer the treatment of paupers , in an establishment like that of the Surrey Asylum , to the treatment of the rich in almost any one of these receptacles . " Instances are recorded of individuals who were exhumed from cells where they had existed without clothing or cleansing , as was ascertained , for years after they had entirely recovered the exercise of sound reason . Lord Shaftesbury procured the passage of bills securing the thorough supervision of these institutions by competent visiting committees , and the seasonable dismissal of all who were pronounced cured ; and the adoption for the pauper insane of a judicious course of remedial treatment . The third step was the passage of the ten hour factory bill . This took nearly eighteen years of labor and unceasing activity in Parliament and in the provinces . Its operation affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the families be included , nearly two millions of persons , young and old . Two thirds as many as the southern slaves . It is needless to enlarge on the horrible disclosures in reference to the factory operatives , made during this investigation . England never shuddered with a deeper thrill at the unveiling of American slavery than did all America at this unveiling of the white-labor slavery of England . In reading the speeches of Lord Shaftesbury , one sees , that , in presenting this subject , he had to encounter the same opposition and obloquy which now beset those in America who seek the abolition of slavery . In the beginning of one of his speeches , his lordship says , " Nearly eleven years have now elapsed since I first made the proposition to the house which I shall renew this night . Never , at any time , have I felt greater apprehension , or even anxiety . Not through any fear of personal defeat ; for disappointment is ' the badge of our tribe ; ' but because I know well the hostility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscretion on my part affecting the welfare of those who have so long confided their hopes and interests to my charge . " One may justly wonder on what conceivable grounds any could possibly oppose the advocate of a measure like this . He was opposed on the same ground that Clarkson was resisted in seeking the abolition of the slave trade . As Boswell said that " to abolish the slave trade would be to shut the gates of mercy on mankind , " so the advocates of eighteen hours labor in factories said that the ten hour system would diminish produce , lower wages , and bring starvation on the workmen . His lordship was denounced as an incendiary , a meddling fanatic , interfering with the rights of masters , and desiring to exalt his own order by destroying the prosperity of the manufacturers . In the conclusion of one of his speeches he says , " Sir , it may not be given me to pass over this Jordan ; other and better men have preceded me , and I entered into their labors ; other and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but this consolation I shall ever continue to enjoy  --  that , amidst much injustice and somewhat of calumny , we have at last ' lighted such a candle in England as , by God 's blessing , shall never be put out . ' " The next effort was to regulate the labor of children in the calico and print works . The great unhealthiness of the work , and the tender age of the children employed ,  --  some even as young as four years  --  were fully disclosed . An extract from his lordship 's remarks on this subject will show that human nature takes the same course in all countries : " Sir , in the various discussions on these kindred subjects , there has been a perpetual endeavor to drive us from the point under debate , and taunt us with a narrow and one-sided humanity . I was told there were far greater evils than those I had assailed  --  that I had left untouched much worse things . It was in vain to reply that no one could grapple with the whole at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the collieries ; when I invaded the collieries I was referred to the print works ; from the print works I know not to what I shall be sent ; for what can be worse ? Sir , it has been said to me , more than once , ' Where will you stop ? ' I reply , Nowhere , so long as any portion of this mighty evil remains to be removed . I confess that my desire and ambition are to bring all the laboring children of this empire within the reach and opportunities of education , within the sphere of useful and happy citizens . I am ready , so far as my services are of any value , to devote what little I have of energy , and all the remainder of my life , to the accomplishment of this end . The labor would be great , and the anxieties very heavy ; but I fear neither one nor the other . I fear nothing but defeat . " From the allusion , above , to the colliery effort , it would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalpits preceded the reform of the printworks . Concerning the result of these various enterprises , he says , " The present state of things may be told in few words . Full fifty thousand children under thirteen years of age attend school every day . None are worked more than seven , generally only six , hours in the day . Those above thirteen and under eighteen , and all women , are limited to ten hours and a half , exclusive of the time for meals . The work begins at six in the morning and ends at six in the evening . Saturday 's labor ends at four o'clock , and there is no work on Sunday . The printworks are brought under regulation , and the women and children removed from the coalpits . " His lordship adds , " The report of inspectors which I send you will give you a faint picture of the physical , social , and moral good that has resulted . I may safely say of these measures , that God has blessed them far beyond my expectation , and almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great benevolent movement is the ragged school system . From a miserable hole in Field Lane , they have grown up to a hundred and sixteen in number . Of these Lord Shaftesbury says , " They have produced  --  I speak seriously  --  some of the most beautiful fruits that ever grew upon the tree of life . I believe that from the teachers and from the children , though many are now gone to their rest , might have been , and might still be , selected some of the most pure , simple , affectionate specimens of Christianity the world ever saw . " Growing out of the ragged school is an institution of most interesting character , called " a place for repentance . " It had its origin in the efforts of a young man , a Mr. Nash , to reform two of his pupils . They said they wished to be honest , but had nothing to eat , and must steal to live . Though poor himself , he invited them to his humble abode , and shared with them his living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , and become honest too . Soon he had six . Now , the honest scholars in the ragged school , seeing what was going on , of their own accord began to share their bread with this little band , and to contribute their pennies . Gradually the number increased . Benevolent individuals noticed it , and supplies flowed in , until at last it has grown to be an establishment in which several hundreds are seeking reformation . To prevent imposition , a rigid probation is prescribed . Fourteen days the applicant feeds on bread and water , in solitary confinement , with the door unfastened , so that he can depart at any moment . If he goes through with that ordeal it is thought he really wants to be honest , and he is admitted a member . After sufficient time spent in the institution to form correct habits , assistance is given him to emigrate to some of the colonies , to commence life , as it were , anew . Lord Shaftesbury has taken a deep interest in this establishment ; and among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one to him , commencing , " Kind Lord Ashley , " in which the boy says , " I wish your lordship would send out more boys , and use your influence to convert all the prisons into ragged schools . As soon as I get a farm I shall call it after your name . " A little anecdote related by Mr. Nash shows the grateful feelings of the inmates of this institution . A number of them were very desirous to have a print of Lord Shaftesbury , to hang up in their sitting room . Mr. Nash told them he knew of no way in which they could earn the money , except by giving up something from their daily allowance of food . This they cheerfully agreed to do . A benevolent gentleman offered to purchase the picture and present it to them ; but they unanimously declined . They wanted it to be their own , they said , and they could not feel that it was so unless they did something for it themselves . Connected with the ragged school , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a system of simple , gratuitous religious instruction , which goes out to seek those who feel too poor and degraded to be willing to enter the churches . Another of the great movements in England is the institution of the Laborer 's Friend Society , under the patronage of the most distinguished personages . Its principal object has been the promotion of allotments of land in the country , to be cultivated by the peasantry after their day 's labor , thus adding to their day 's wages the produce of their fields and gardens . It has been instrumental , first and last , of establishing nearly four hundred thousand of these allotments . It publishes , also , a monthly paper , called the Laborer 's Friend , in which all subjects relative to the elevation of the working classes receive a full discussion . In consequence of all these movements , the dwellings of the laboring classes throughout Great Britain are receiving much attention ; so that , if matters progress for a few years as they have done , the cottages of the working people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great movement is the repeal of the corn laws , the benefit of which is too obvious to need comment . What has been doing for milliners and dressmakers , for the reform lodging houses , and for the supply of baths and wash houses , I have shown at length in former letters . I will add that the city of London has the services of one hundred and twenty city missionaries . There is a great multiplication of churches , and of clergymen to labor in the more populous districts . The Pastoral Aid Society and the Scripture Reading Society are both extensive and fruitful laborers for the service of the mass of the people . There has also been a public health act , by which towns and villages are to be drained and supplied with water . This has gone into operation in about one hundred and sixty populous places with the most beneficial results . In fine , Lord Shaftesbury says , " The best proof that the people are cared for , and that they know it , appeared in the year 1848 . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were as quiet and happy in England as the President of the United States in his drawing room . " It is true , that all these efforts united could not radically relieve the distress of the working classes , were it not for the outlet furnished by emigration . But Australia has opened as M new world of hope upon England . And confirmatory of all other movements for the good of the working classes , come the benevolent efforts of Mrs. Chisholm and the colonizing society formed under her auspices . I will say , finally , that the aspect of the religious mind of England , as I have been called to meet it , is very encouraging in this respect ; that it is humble , active , and practical . With all that has been done , they do not count themselves to have attained , or to be already perfect ; and they evidently think and speak more of the work that yet remains to be done than of victories already achieved . Could you , my dear father , have been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege to enter , from the humble cotter 's fireside to the palace of the highest and noblest , your heart would share with mine a sincere joy in the thought that the Lord " has much people " in England . Called by different names , Churchman , Puseyite , Dissenter , Presbyterian , Independent , Quaker , differing widely , sincerely , earnestly , I have still found among them all evidence of that true piety which consists in a humble and childlike spirit of obedience to God , and a sincere desire to do good to man . It is comforting and encouraging to know , that while there are many sects and opinions , there is , after all , but one Christianity . I sometimes think that it has been my peculiar lot to see the exhibition of more piety and loveliness of spirit in the differing sects and ranks in England than they can see in each other . And it lays in my mind a deep foundation of hope for that noble country . My belief is , that a regenerating process is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which contending parties themselves are not aware . Under various forms all are energizing together , I trust , under the guidance of a superior spirit , who is gently moderating acerbities , removing prejudices , inclining to conciliation and harmony , and preparing England to develop , from many outward forms , the one , pure , beautiful , invisible church of Christ . LETTER XXX . LONDON , June 3 . MY DEAR HUSBAND :  --  According to request I will endeavor to keep you informed of all our goings on after you left , up to the time of our departure for Paris . We have borne in mind your advice to hasten away to the continent . C. wrote , a day or two since , to Mrs. C. at Paris , to secure very private lodgings , and by no means let any one know that we were coming . She has replied , urging us to come to her house , and promising entire seclusion and rest . So , since you departed , we have been passing with a kind of comprehensive skip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening after you left , came off the presentation of the inkstand by the ladies of Surrey Chapel . Our kind Mr. Sherman showed great taste as well as energy in the arrangements . The lecture room of the chapel was prettily adorned with flowers . Lord Shaftesbury was in the chair , and the Duchess of Argyle and the Marquis of Stafford were there . Miss Greenfield sang some songs , and there were speeches in which each speaker said all the obliging things he could think of to the rest . Rev. Mr. Binney complimented the nobility , and Lord Shaftesbury complimented the people , and all were but too kind in what they said to me  --  in fact , there was general good humor in the whole scene . The inkstand is a beautiful specimen of silverwork . It is eighteen inches long , with a group of silver figures on it , representing Religion with the Bible in her hand , giving liberty to the slave . The slave is a masterly piece of work . He stands with his hands clasped , looking up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his feet . But the prettiest part of the scene was the presentation of a gold pen , by a band of beautiful children , one of whom made a very pretty speech . I called the little things to come and stand around me , and talked with them a few minutes , and this was all the speaking that fell to my share . Now this , really , was too kind of these ladies , and of our brotherly friend Mr. S. , and I was quite touched with it ; especially as I have been able myself to do so very little , socially , for any body 's pleasure . Mr. Sherman still has continued to be as thoughtful and careful as a brother could be ; and his daughter , Mrs. B. , I fear , has robbed her own family to give us the additional pleasure of her society . We rode out with her one day into the country , and saw her home and little family . Saturday morning we breakfasted at Stafford House , I wish you could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still there , as in some retreat deep in the country . We went first into the duchess 's boudoir ,  --  you remember ,  --  where is that beautiful crayon sketch of Lady Constance . The duchess was dressed in pale blue . We talked with her some time , before any one came in , about Miss Greenfield . I showed her a simple note to her grace in which Miss G. tried to express her gratitude , and which she had sent to me to correct for her . The duchess said , " 0 , give it me ! it is a great deal better as it is . I like it just as she wrote it . " People always like simplicity and truth better than finish . After entering the breakfast room the Duke and Duchess of Argyle , and Lord Carlisle appeared , and soon after Lord Shaftesbury . We breakfasted in that beautiful green room which has the two statues , the Eve of Thorwaldsen and the Venus of Canova . The view of the gardens and trees from the window gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me forget that we were in great , crowded London . A pleasant talk we had . Among other things they proposed various inquiries respecting affairs in America , particularly as to the difference between Presbyterians and Congregationalists , the influence of the Assembly 's Catechism , and the peculiarities of the other religious denominations . The Duke of Argyle , who is a Presbyterian , seemed to feel an interest in those points . He said it indicated great power in the Assembly 's Catechism that it could hold such ascendency in such a free country . In the course of the conversation it was asked if there was really danger that the antislavery spirit of England would excite ill feeling between the two countries . I said , were it possible that America were always to tolerate and defend slavery , this might be . But this would be self-destruction . It can not , must not , will not be . We shall struggle , and shall overcome ; and when the victory has been gained we shall love England all the more for her noble stand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to the duchess , and her beautiful face was lighted with such a strong , inspired , noble expression , as set its seal at once in my heart . Lord Carlisle is going to Constantinople to-morrow , or next day , to be gone perhaps a year . The eastern question is much talked of now , and the chances of war between Russia and Turkey . Lord Shaftesbury is now all-engaged upon the fete of the seven thousand charity children , which is to come off at St. Paul 's next Thursday . The Duchesses of Sutherland and Argyle were to have attended , but the queen has just come to town , and the first drawing room will be held on Thursday , so that they will be unable . His lordship had previously invited me , and this morning renewed the invitation . Our time to leave London is fixed for Friday ; but , as I am told , there is no sight more peculiar and beautiful than this fete , and I think I can manage both to go there and be forward with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went with Lord Shaftesbury over the model lodging houses , which I have described very particularly in a letter to Mr. C. L. B. On Thursday , at five P. M. , we drove to Stafford House , to go with her grace to the House of Parliament . What a magnificent building ! I say so , in contempt of all criticism . I hear that all sorts of things are said against it . For my part , I consider that no place is so utterly hopeless as that of a modern architect intrusted with a great public building . It is not his fault that he is modern , but his misfortune . Things which in old buildings are sanctioned by time he may not attempt ; and if he strikes out new things , that is still worse . He is fair game for every body 's criticism . He builds too high for one , too low for another ; is too ornate for this , too plain for that ; he sacrifices utility to aesthetics , or aesthetics to utility , and somebody is displeased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the architect through this arduous ordeal . She took pleasure and pride in his work , and showed it to me as something in which she felt an almost personal interest . For my part , I freely confess that , viewed as a national monument , it seems to me a grand one . What a splendid historic corridor is old Westminster Hall , with its ancient oaken roof ! I seemed to see all that brilliant scene when Burke spoke there amid the nobility , wealth , and fashion of all England , in the Warren Hastings trial . That speech always makes me shudder . I think there never was any thing more powerful than its conclusion . Then the corridor that is to be lined with statues of the great men of England will be a noble affair . The statue of Hampden is grand . Will they leave out Cromwell ? There is less need of a monument to him , it is true , than to most of them . We went into the House of Lords . The Earl of Carlisle made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he alluded very gracefully to a petition from certain ladies that England should enforce the treaties for the prevention of the slave trade there ; and spoke very feelingly on the reasons why woman should manifest a particular interest for the oppressed . The Duke of Argyle and the Bishop of Oxford came over to the place where we were sitting . Her grace intimated to the bishop a desire to hear from him on the question , and in the course of a few moments after returning to his place , he arose and spoke . He has a fine voice , and speaks very elegantly . At last I saw Lord Aberdeen . He looks like some of our Presbyterian elders ; a plain , grave old man , with a bald head , and dressed in black ; by the by , I believe I have heard that he is an elder in the National kirk ; I am told he is a very good man . You do n't know how strangely and dreamily this House of Lords , as seen to-day , mixed itself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very sheltered , comfortable parlor-like air . The lords in their cushioned seats seemed like men that had met , in a social way , to talk over public affairs ; it was not at all that roomy , vast , declamatory national hall I had imagined . Then we went into the House of Commons . There is a kind of latticed gallery to which ladies are admitted  --  a charming little oriental rookery . There we found the Duchess of Argyle and others . Lord Carlisle afterwards joined us , and we went all over the house , examining the frescoes , looking into closets , tea rooms , libraries , smoking rooms , committee rooms , and all , till I was thoroughly initiated . The terrace that skirts the Thames is magnificent . I inquired if any but members might enjoy it . No ; it was only for statesmen ; our short promenade there was , therefore , an act of grace . On the whole , when this Parliament House shall have gathered the dust of two hundred years ,  --  when Victoria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then venerate this building as one of the rare creations of old masters , and declare that no modern structure can ever equal it . The next day , at three o'clock , I went to Miss Greenfield 's first public morning concert , a bill of which I send you . She comes out under the patronage of all the great names , you observe . Lady Hatherton was there , and the Duchess of Sutherland , with all her daughters . Miss Greenfield did very well , and was heard with indulgence , though surrounded by artists who had enjoyed what she had not  --  a life 's training . I could not but think what a loss to art is the enslaving of a race which might produce so much musical talent . Had she had culture equal to her voice and ear , no singer of any country could have surpassed her . There could even be associations of poetry thrown around the dusky hue of her brow were it associated with the triumphs of art . After concert , the Duchess of S. invited Lady H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green library . Lady C. Campbell was there , and her Grace of Argyle . After tea I saw the Duchess of S. a little while alone in her boudoir , and took my leave then and there of one as good and true-hearted as beautiful and noble . The next day I lunched with Mrs. Malcolm , daughter-in-law of your favorite traveller , Sir John Malcolm , of Persian memory . You should have been there . The house is a cabinet of Persian curiosities . There was the original of the picture of the King of Persia in Ker Porter 's Travels . It was given to Sir John by the monarch himself . There were also two daggers which the king presented with his own hand . I think Sir John must somehow have mesmerized him . Then Captain M. showed me sketches of his father 's country house in the Himalaya Mountains : think of that ! The Alps are commonplace ; but a country seat in the Himalaya Mountains is something worth speaking of . There were two bricks from Babylon , and other curiosities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Carlisle . She spoke much of the beauty and worth of her character , and said that though educated in the gayest circles of court , she had always preserved the same unworldly purity . Mrs. M. has visited Dunrobin and seen the Sutherland estates , and spoke much of the Duke 's character as a landlord , and his efforts for the improvement of his tenantry . Lady Carlisle was very affectionate , and invited me to visit Castle Howard on my return to England . Thursday I went with Lord Shaftesbury to see the charity children . What a sight ! The whole central part of the cathedral was converted into an amphitheatre , and the children with white caps , white handkerchiefs , and white aprons , looked like a wide flower bed . The rustling , when they all rose up to prayer , was like the rise of a flock of doves , and when they chanted the church service , it was the warble of a thousand little brooks . As Spenser says ,  --  " The angelical , soft , trembling voices made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the services , when any little one was overcome with sleep or fatigue , he was carefully handed down , and conveyed in a man 's arms to a refreshment room . There was a sermon by the Bishop of Chester , very evangelical and practical . On the whole , a more peculiar or more lovely scene I never saw . The elegant arches of St. Paul 's could have no more beautiful adornment than those immortal flowers . After service we lunched with a large party , with Mrs. Milman , at the deanery near by . Mrs. Jameson was there , and Mrs. Gaskell , authoress of Mary Barton and Ruth . She has a very lovely , gentle face , and looks capable of all the pathos that her writings show . I promised her a visit when I go to Manchester . Thackeray was there with his fine figure , and frank , cheerful bearing . He spoke in a noble and brotherly way of America , and seemed to have highly enjoyed his visit in our country . After this we made a farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady mayoress returned from the queen 's drawing room . From her accounts I should judge the ceremonial rather fatiguing . Mrs. M. asked me yesterday if I had any curiosity to see one . I confessed I had not . Merely to see public people in public places , in the way of parade and ceremony , was never interesting to me . I have seen very little of ceremony or show in England . Well , now , I have brought you down to this time . I have omitted , however , that I went with Lady Hatherton to call on Mr. and Mrs. Dickens , and was sorry to find him too unwell to be able to see us . Mrs. Dickens , who was busy in attending him , also excused herself , and we saw his sister . To-morrow we go  --  go to quiet , to obscurity , to peace ; to Paris  --  to Switzerland : there we shall find the loneliest glen , and , as the Bible says , " fall on sleep . " For our adventures on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOURNAL LONDON TO PARIS June 4 , 1853 . Bade adieu with regret to dear Surrey parsonage , and drove to the great south-western station house . " Paris ? " said an official at our cab door . " Paris , by Folkestone and Boulogne , " was our answer . And in a few moments , without any inconvenience , we were off . Reached Folkestone at nine , and enjoyed a smooth passage across the dreaded channel . The steward 's bowls were paraded in vain . At Boulogne came the long-feared and abhorred ordeal of passports and police . It was nothing . We slipped through quite easily . A narrow ladder , the quay , gens-d'armes , a hall , a crowd , three whiskers , a glance at the passport , the unbuckling of a bundle , voila tout . The moment we issued forth , however , upon the quay again , there was a discharge of forty voices shouting in French . For a moment , completely stunned , I forgot where we were , which way going , and what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur veut aller a Pan 's , n'est ce pas ? " " Going to Paris , are you not , sir ? " " Oui . " " Is monsieur 's baggage registered ? " " Yes . " " Does monsieur 's wish to go to the station house ? " " Can one find any thing there to eat ? " " Yes , just as at a hotel . " We yielded at discretion , and garcon took possession of us . " English ? " said garcon , as we enjoyed the pleasant walk on the sunny quay . " No . American , " we replied . " Ah ! " ( his face brightening up , and speaking confidentially , ) " you have a republic there . " We gave the lad a franc , dined , and were off for Paris . The ride was delightful . Cars seating eight ; clean , soft-cushioned , nice . The face of the country , though not striking , was pleasing . There were many poplars , with their silvery shafts , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airy grace  --  a certain spirituelle expression  --  as if the trees knew they were growing in la belle France , and must be refined . Then the air is so different from the fog and smoke of London . There is more oxygen in the atmosphere . A pall is lifted . We are led out into sunshine . Fields are red with a scarlet white-edged poppy , or blue with a flower like larkspur . Wheat fields half covered with this unthrifty beauty ! But alas ! the elasticity is in Nature 's works only . The works of man breathe over us a dismal , sepulchral , stand-still feeling . The villages have the nightmare , and men wear wooden shoes . The day 's ride , however , was memorable with novelty ; and when we saw Mont Martre , and its moth-like windmills , telling us we were coming to Paris , it was almost with regret at the swiftness of the hours . We left the cars , and flowed with the tide into the Salle d'Attente , to wait till the baggage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The officer took my carpet bag first , and poked his hand down deep in one end . " What is this ? " " That is my collar box . " " Ah , ca " And he put it back hastily , and felt of my travelling gown . " What is this ? " " Only a wrapping gown . " " Ah , ca " After fumbling a little more , he took sister H. 's bag , gave a dive here , a poke there , and a kind of promiscuous rake with his five fingers , and turned to the trunk . There he seemed somewhat dubious . Eying the fine silk and lace dresses ,  --  first one , then the other ,  --  " Ah , ah ! " said he , and snuffed a little . Then he peeped under this corner , and cocked his eye under that corner ; then , all at once , plunged his arm down at one end of the trunk , and brought up a little square box . " What 's that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , when suddenly he seemed to be seized with an emotion of confidence . " Non , non " said he , frankly , and rolled it up , shoved it back , stuffed the things down , smoothed all over , signed my ticket , and passed on . We locked up , gave the baggage to porters , and called a fiacre . As we left the station two ladies met us . " Is there any one here expecting to see Mrs. C. ? " said one of them . " Yes , madam , " said I ; " we do . " " God bless you , " said she , fervently , and seized me by the hand . It was Mrs. C. and her sister . I gave He into their possession . Our troubles were over . We were at home . We rode through streets whose names were familiar , crossed the Carrousel , passed the Seine , and stopped before an ancient mansion in the Hue de Verneuil , belonging to M. le Marquis de Brige . This Faubourg St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived , and the houses exhibit marks of former splendor . The marquis is one of those chivalrous legitimists who uphold the claims of Henri VI . He lives in the country , and rents this hotel . Mrs. C. occupies the suite of rooms on the lower floor . We entered by a ponderous old gateway , opened by the concierge , passed through a large paved quadrangle , traversed a short hall , and found ourselves in a large , cheerful parlor , looking out into a small flower garden . There was no carpet , but what is called here a parquet floor , or mosaic of oak blocks , waxed and highly polished . The sofas and chairs were covered with a light chintz , and the whole air of the apartment shady and cool as a grotto . A jardiniere filled with flowers stood in the centre of the room , and around it a group of living flowers  --  mother , sisters , and daughters  --  scarcely less beautiful . In five minutes we were at home . French life is different from any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do as you please yourself . My spirits always rise when I get among the French . Sabbath , June 5 . Headache all the forenoon . In the afternoon we walked to the Madeleine , and heard a sermon on charity ; listened to the chanting , and gazed at the fantastic ceremonial of the altar . I had anticipated so much from Henry 's description of the organs , that I was disappointed . The music was fine ; but our ideal had outstripped the real . The strangest part of the performance was the censer swinging at the altar . It was done in certain parts of the chant , with rhythmic sweep , and glitter , and vapor wreath , that produced a striking effect . There was an immense audience  --  quiet , orderly , and to all appearance devout . This was the first Romish service I ever attended . It ought to be impressive here , if any where . Yet I can not say I was moved by it Rome-ward . Indeed , I felt a kind of Puritan tremor of conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We soon saw , however , as we walked home , across the gardens of the Tuileries , that there is no Sabbath in Paris , according to our ideas of the day . Monday , June 6 . This day was consecrated to knick-knacks . Accompanied by Mrs. C. , whom years of residence have converted into a perfect Parisienne , we visited shop after shop , and store after store . The politeness of the shopkeepers is inexhaustible . I felt quite ashamed to spend a half hour looking at every thing , and then depart without buying ; but the civil Frenchman bowed , and smiled , and thanked us for coming . In the evening , we rode to L'Arc de Triomphe d'Etoile , an immense pile of massive masonry , from the top of which we enjoyed a brilliant panorama . Paris was beneath us , from the Louvre to the Bois de Boulogne , with its gardens , and moving myriads ; its sports , and games , and light-hearted mirth  --  a vast Vanity Fair , blazing in the sunlight . A deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we gazed . All is vivacity , gracefulness , and sparkle , to the eye ; but ah , what fires are smouldering below ! Are not all these vines rooted in the lava and ashes of the volcano side ? Tuesday , June 7 . A la Louvre ! But first the ladies must " shop " a little . I sit by the counter and watch the pretty Parisian shopocracy . A lady presides at the desk . Trim little grisettes serve the customers so deftly , that we wonder why awkward men should ever attempt to do such things . Nay , they are so civil , so evidently disinterested and solicitous for your welfare , that to buy is the most natural thing imaginable . But to the Louvre ! Provided with catalogues , I abandoned the ladies , and strolled along to take a kind of cream-skimming look at the whole . I was highly elated with one thing . There were three Madonnas with dark hair and eyes : one by Murillo , another by Carracci , and another by Guido . It showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and given over by common sense to blindness of mind , as I had supposed . H. begins to recant her heresy in regard to Rubens . Here we find his largest pieces . Here we find the real originals of several real originals we saw in English galleries . It seems as though only upon a picture as large as the side of a parlor could his exuberant genius find scope fully to lay itself out . When I met II . at last  --  after finishing the survey  --  her cheek was flushed , and her eye seemed to swim . " Well , H. , " said I , " have you drank deep enough this time ? " " Yes , " said she , " I have been satisfied , for the first time . " Wednesday , June 8 . A day on foot in Paris . Surrendered H. to the care of our fair hostess . Attempted to hire a boat , at one of the great bathing establishments , for a pull on the Seine . Why not on the Seine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triton demurred . The tide marched too strong  --  " Il marche trop fort . " Onward , then , along the quays ; visiting the curious old book stalls , picture stands , and flower markets . Lean over the parapet , and gaze upon this modern Euphrates , rushing between solid walls of masonry through the heart of another Babylon . The river is the only thing not old . These waters are as turbid , tumultuous , unbridled , as when forests covered all these banks  --  fit symbol of peoples and nations in their mad career , generation after generation . Institutions , like hewn granite , may wall them in , and vast arches span their flow , and hierarchies domineer over the tide ; but the scorning waters burst into life unchangeable , and sweep impetuous through the heart of Vanity Fair , and dash out again into the future , the same grand , ungovernable Euphrates stream . I do not wonder Egypt adored her Nile , and Rome her Tiber . Surely , the life artery of Paris is this Seine beneath my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I gaze upward and downward , comprehending , in a glance , the immense panorama of art and architecture  --  life , motion , enterprise , pleasure , pomp , and power . Beautiful Paris ! What city in the world can compare with thee ? And is it not chiefly because , either by accident or by instinctive good taste , her treasures of beauty and art are so disposed along the Seine as to be visible at a glance to the best effect ? As the instinct of the true Parisienne teaches her the mystery of setting off the graces of her person by the fascinations of dress , so the instinct of the nation to set off the city by the fascinations of architecture and embellishment . Hence a chief superiority of Paris to London . The Seine is straight , and its banks are laid out in broad terraces on either side , called quais , lined with her stateliest palaces and gardens . The Thames forms an elbow , and is enveloped in dense smoke and fog . London lowers ; the Seine sparkles ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no point of view for the whole river panorama . Paris rises amphitheatrically , on either side the Seine , and the eye from the Pont d'Austerlitz seems to fly through the immense reach like an arrow , casting its shadow on every thing of beauty or grandeur Paris possesses . Rapidly now I sped onward , paying brief visits to the Palais de Justice , the Hotel de Ville , and spending a cool half hour in Notre Dame . I love to sit in these majestic fanes , abstracting them from the superstition which does but desecrate them , and gaze upward to their lofty , vaulted arches , to drink in the impression of architectual sublimity , which I can neither analyze nor express . Cathedrals do not seem to me to have been built . They seem , rather , stupendous growths of nature , like crystals , or cliffs of basalt . There is little ornament here . That roof looks plain and bare ; yet I feel that the air is dense with sublimity . Onward I sped , crossing a bridge by the Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow streets . Explored a quadrangular market ; surveyed the old church of St Genevieve , and the new  --  now the Pantheon ; went onward to the Jardin des Plantes , and explored its tropical bowers . Many things remind me to-day of New Orleans , and its levee , its Mississippi , its cathedral , and the luxuriant vegetation of the gulf . In fact , I seem to be walking in my sleep in a kind of glorified New Orleans , all the while . Yet I return to the gardens of the Tuileries and the Place Vendome , and in the shadow of Napoleon 's Column the illusion vanishes . Hundreds of battles look down upon me from their blazonry . In the evening I rested from the day 's fatigue by an hour in the garden of the Palais Royal . I sat by one of the little tables , and called for an ice . There were hundreds of ladies and gentlemen eating ices , drinking wine , reading the papers , smoking , chatting ; scores of pretty children were frolicking and enjoying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rope , while papa and mamma swung it for them . Pretty little things , with their flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes , how they did seem to enjoy themselves ! What parent was ever far from home that did not espy in every group of children his own little ones  --  his Mary or his Nelly , his Henry or Charlie ? So it was with me . There was a ring of twenty or thirty singing and dancing , with a smaller ring in the centre , while old folks and boys stood outside . But I heard not a single oath , nor saw a rough or rude action , during the whole time I was there . The boys standing by looked on quietly , like young gentlemen . The best finale of such a toilsome day of sightseeing was a warm bath in the Rue du Bac , for the trifling sum of fifteen sous . The cheapness and convenience of bathing here is a great recommendation of Paris life . They will bring you a hot bath at your house for twenty-five cents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually as an evening bath , as my experience testifies , cures fatigue and propitiates to dreamless slumber . Thursday , June 9 . At the Louvre . Studied three statues half an hour each  --  the Venus Victrix , Polyhymnia , and Gladiateur Combattant . The first is mutilated ; but if disarmed she conquers all hearts , what would she achieve in full panoply ? As to the Gladiator , I noted as follows on my catalogue : A pugilist ; antique , brown with age ; attitude , leaning forward ; left hand raised on guard , right hand thrown out back , ready to strike a side blow ; right leg bent ; straight line from the head to the toe of left foot ; muscles and veins most vividly revealed in intense development ; a wonderful petrifaction , as if he had been smitten to stone at the instant of striking . Here are antique mosaics , in which colored stones seem liquefied , realizing the most beautiful effects of painting  --  quadrigae , warriors , arms , armor , vases , streams , all lifelike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour in studying one picture  --  La Meduse , by Gericault . It is a shipwrecked crew upon a raft in mid ocean . I gazed until all surrounding objects disappeared , and I was alone upon the wide Atlantic . Those transparent emerald waves are no fiction ; they leap madly , hungering for their prey . That distended sail is filled with the lurid air . That dead man 's foot hangs off in the seething brine a stark reality . What a fixed gaze of despair in that father 's stony eye ! What a group of deathly living ones around that frail mast , while one with intense eagerness flutters a signal to some far-descried bark ! Coleridge 's Ancient Mariner has no colors more fearfully faithful to his theme . Heaven pities them not . Ocean is all in uproar against them . And there is no voice that can summon the distant , flying sail ! So France appeared to that prophet painter 's eye , in the subsiding tempests of the revolution . So men 's hearts failed them for fear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid the sea and the waves roaring ; and so mute signals of distress were hung out in the lurid sky to nations afar . For my part , I remain a heretic . Give to these French pictures the mellowing effects of age , impregnating not merely the picture , but the eye that gazes on it , with its subtle quality ; let them be gazed at through the haze of two hundred years , and they will  --  or I can not see why they will not  --  rival the productions of any past age . I do not believe that a more powerful piece ever was painted than yon raft by Gericault , nor any more beautiful than several in the Luxembourg ; the " Decadence de Rome , " for example , exhibiting the revels of the Romans during the decline of the empire . Let this Decadence unroll before the eyes of men the cause , that wreck by Gericault symbolize the effect , in the great career of nations , and the two are sublimely matched . After visiting the Luxembourg , I resorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about eighty degrees in the shade . From the number of people assembled one would have thought , if it had been in the United States , that some great mass convention was coming off . Under the impenetrable screen of the trees , in the dark , cool , refreshing shade , are thousands of chairs , for which one pays two cents apiece . Whole families come , locking up their door , bringing the baby , work , dinner , or lunch , take a certain number of chairs , and spend the day . As far as eye can reach you see a multitude seated , as if in church , with other multitudes moving to and fro , while boys and girls without number are frolicking , racing , playing ball , driving hoop , &c.,; but contriving to do it without making a hideous racket . How French children are taught to play and enjoy themselves without disturbing every body else , is a mystery . " C'est gentil " seems to be a talismanic spell ; and " Ce n'est pas gentil ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some savant would write a book and tell us how it is done ! I gazed for half an hour on the spectacle . A more charming sight my eyes never beheld . There were grayheaded old men , and women , and invalids ; and there were beautiful demoiselles working worsted , embroidery , sewing ; men reading papers ; and , in fact , people doing every thing they would do in their own parlors . And all were graceful , kind , and obliging ; not a word nor an act of impoliteness or indecency . No wonder the French adore Paris , thought I ; in no other city in the world is a scene like this possible ! No wonder that their hearts die within them at thoughts of exile in the fens of Cayenne ! But under all this there lie , as under the cultivated crust of this fair world , deep abysses of soul , where volcanic masses of molten lava surge and shake the tremulous earth . In the gay and bustling Boulevards , a friend , an old resident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bullet marks that scarred the houses  --  significant tokens of what seems , but is not , forgotten . At sunset a military band of about seventy performers began playing in front of the Tuileries . They formed an immense circle , the leader in the centre . He played the octave flute , which also served as a baton for marking time . The music was characterized by delicacy , precision , suppression , and subjugation of rebellious material . I imagined a congress of horns , clarinets , trumpets , &c.,; conversing in low tones on some important theme ; nay , rather a conspiracy of instruments , mourning between whiles their subjugation , and ever and anon breaking out in a fierce emeute , then repressed , hushed , dying away ; as if they had heard of Baron Munchausen 's frozen horn , and had conceived the idea of yielding their harmonies without touch of human lips , yet were sighing and sobbing at their impotence . Perhaps I detected the pulses of a nation 's palpitating heart , throbbing for liberty , but trodden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. C. had her salon , a fashion of receiving one 's friends on a particular night , that one wishes could be transplanted to American soil . No invitations are given . It is simply understood that on such an evening , the season through , a lady receives her friends . All come that please , without ceremony . A little table is set out with tea and a plate of cake . Behind it presides some fairy Emma or Elizabeth , dispensing tea and talk , bonbons and bon-mots , with equal grace . The guests enter , chat , walk about , spend as much time , or as little , as they choose , and retire . They come when they please , and go when they please , and there is no notice taken of entree or exit , no time wasted in formal greetings and leave takings . Up to this hour we had conversed little in French . One is naturally diffident at first ; for if one musters courage to commence a conversation with propriety , the problem is how to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third sentence . Said one of our fair entertainers , " When I first began I would think of some sentence till I could say it without stopping , and courageously deliver myself to some guest or acquaintance . " But it was like pulling the string of a shower bath . Delighted at my correct sentence , and supposing me au fait , they poured upon me such a deluge of French that I held my breath in dismay . Considering , however , that nothing is to be gained by half-way measures , I resolved upon a desperate game . Launching in , I talked away right and left , up hill and down ,  --  jumping over genders , cases , nouns , and adjectives , floundering through swamps and morasses , in a perfect steeple chase of words . Thanks to the proverbial politeness of my friends , I came off covered with glory ; the more mistakes I made the more complacent they grew . Nothing can surpass the ease , facility , and genial freedom of these soirees . Conceive of our excellent professor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked fairies , and laughing at their stories and swift witticisms till the tears roll down his cheeks . Behold yonder tall and scarred veteran , an old soldier of Napoleon , capitulating now before the witchery of genius and wit . Here the noble Russian exile forgets his sorrows in those smiles that , unlike the aurora , warm while they dazzle . And our celebrated composer is discomposed easily by alert and nimble-footed mischief . And our professor of Greek and Hebrew roots is rooted to the ground with astonishment at finding himself put through all the moods and tenses of fun in a twinkling . Ah , culpable sirens , if the pangs ye have inflicted were reckoned up unto you ,  --  the heart aches and side aches ,  --  how could ye repose o ' nights ? Saturday , June 11 . Versailles !

Describe visions of splendor and gorgeousness that can not be examined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall to hall until there was no more soul left within us . Then , late in the afternoon we drove away , about three miles , to the villa of M. Belloc , directeur de l'Ecole Imperials de Dessein . Madame Belloc has produced , assisted by her friend , Mademoiselle Montgolfier , the best French translation of Uncle Tom 's Cabin . At this little family party we enjoyed ourselves exceedingly , in the heart of genuine domestic life . Two beautiful married daughters were there , with their husbands , and the household seemed complete . Madame B. speaks English well ; and thus , with our limited French , we got on delightfully together . I soon discovered that I had been sinning against all law in admiring any thing at Versailles . They were all bad paintings . There might be one or two good paintings at the Luxembourg , and one or two good modern paintings at the Louvre  --  the Meduse , by Gericault , for example : ( How I rejoiced that I had admired it ! ) But all the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrug , are poor paintings . There is nothing safely admirable , I find , but the old masters . All those battles of all famous French generals , from Charles Hartel to Napoleon , and the battles in Algiers , by Horace Yernet , are wholly to be snuffed at . In painting , as in theology , age is the criterion of merit . Yet Vernet 's paintings , though decried by M. le Directeur , I admired , and told him so . Said I , in French as lawless as the sentiment , " Monsieur , I do not know the rules of painting , nor whether the picture is according to them or not ; I only know that I like it . " But who shall describe the social charms of our dinner ?

There a gay , red lobster was pulled in pieces among us , with infinite gout ; and Madame Belloc pathetically expressed her fears that we did not like French cooking . She might have saved herself the trouble ; for we take to it as naturally as ducks take to the water . And then , when we returned to the parlor , we resolved ourselves into a committee of the whole on coffee , which was concocted in a trim little hydrostatic engine of latest modern invention , before the faces of all .

LETTER XXXI . MY DEAR L. :  --  At last I have come into dreamland ; into the lotus-eater 's paradise ; into the land where it is always afternoon . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live in a house whose arrangements seem to me strange , old , and dreamy . In the heart of a great city I am as still as if in a convent ; in the burning heats of summer our rooms are shadowy and cool as a cave . My time is all my own . I may at will lie on a sofa , and dreamily watch the play of the leaves and flowers , in the little garden into which my room opens ; or I may go into the parlor adjoining , whence I hear the quick voices of my beautiful and vivacious young friends . You ought to see these girls . Emma might look like a Madonna , were it not for her wicked wit ; and as to Anna and Lizzie , as they glance by me , now and then , I seem to think them a kind of sprite , or elf , made to inhabit shady old houses , just as twinkling harebells grow in old castles ; and then the gracious mamma , who speaks French , or English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , the fairest of any of them ? And there is Caroline , piquant , racy , full of conversation  --  sharp as a quartz crystal : how I like to hear her talk ! These people know Paris , as we say in America , " like a book . " They have studied it aesthetically , historically , socially . They have studied French people and French literature ,  --  and studied it with enthusiasm , as people ever should , who would truly understand . They are all kindness to me . Whenever I wish to see any thing , I have only to speak ; or to know , I have only to ask . At breakfast every morning we compare notes , and make up our list of wants . My first , of course , was the Louvre . It is close by us . Think of it . To one who has starved all a life , in vain imaginings of what art might be , to know that you are within a stone 's throw of a museum full of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modern painting , all there ! I scarcely consider myself to have seen any thing of art in England . The calls of the living world were so various and exigeant , I had so little leisure for reflection , that , although I saw many paintings , I could not study them ; and many times I saw them in a state of the nervous system too jaded and depressed to receive the full force of the impression . A day or two before I left , I visited the National Gallery , and made a rapid survey of its contents . There were two of Turner 's masterpieces there , which he presented on the significant condition that they should hang side by side with their two finest Claudes . I thought them all four fine pictures , but I liked the Turners best . Yet I did not think any of them fine enough to form an absolute limit to human improvement . But , till I had been in Paris a day or two , perfectly secluded , at full liberty to think and rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had really come . It was , then , with a thrill almost of awe that I approached the Louvre . Here , perhaps , said I to myself , I shall answer , fully , the question that has long wrought within my soul , What is art ? and what can it do ? Here , perhaps , these yearnings for the ideal will meet their satisfaction . The ascent to the picture gallery tends to produce a flutter of excitement and expectation . Magnificent staircases , dim perspectives of frescoes and carvings , the glorious hall of Apollo , rooms with mosaic pavements , antique vases , countless spoils of art , dazzle the eye of the neophyte , and prepare the mind for some grand enchantment . Then opens on one the grand hall of paintings arranged by schools , the works of each artist by themselves , a wilderness of gorgeous growths . I first walked through the whole , offering my mind up aimlessly to see if there were any picture there great and glorious enough to seize and control my whole being , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artistic element . For any such I looked in vain . I saw a thousand beauties , as also a thousand enormities , but nothing of that overwhelming , subduing nature which I had conceived . Most of the men there had painted with dry eyes and cool hearts , thinking only of the mixing of their colors and the jugglery of their art , thinking little of heroism , faith , love , or immortality . Yet when I had resigned this longing ; when I was sure I should not meet there what I sought , then I began to enjoy very heartily what there was . In the first place , I now saw Claudes worthy of the reputation he bore . Three or four of these were studied with great delight ; the delight one feels , who , conscientiously bound to be delighted , suddenly comes into a situation to be so . I saw , now , those atmospheric traits , those reproductions of the mysteries of air , and of light , which are called so wonderful , and for which all admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Claude , and who every day creates around us , in the commonest scenes , effects far more beautiful . How much , even now , my admiration of Claude was genuine , I can not say . How can we ever be sure on this point , when we admire what has prestige and sanction , not to admire which is an argument against ourselves ? Certainly , however , I did feel great delight in some of these works . One of my favorites was Rembrandt . I always did admire the gorgeous and solemn mysteries of his coloring . Rembrandt is like Hawthorne . He chooses simple and everyday objects , and so arranges light and shadow as to give them a sombre richness and a mysterious gloom . The House of Seven Gables is a succession of Rembrandt pictures , done in words instead of oils . Now , this pleases us , because our life really is a haunted one ; the simplest thing in it is a mystery , the invisible world always lies round us like a shadow , and therefore this dreamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which it corresponds . There were no pictures in the gallery which I looked upon so long , and to which I returned so often and with such growing pleasure , as these . I found in them , if not a commanding , a drawing influence , a full satisfaction for one part of my nature . There were Raphaels there , which still disappointed me , because from Raphael I asked and expected more . I wished to feel his hand on my soul with a stronger grasp ; these were too passionless in their serenity , and almost effeminate in their tenderness . But Rubens , the great , joyous , full-souled , all-powerful Rubens !  --  there he was , full as ever of triumphant , abounding life ; disgusting and pleasing ; making me laugh and making me angry ; defying me to dislike him ; dragging me at his chariot wheels ; in despite of my protests forcing me to confess that there was no other but he . This Medici gallery is a succession of gorgeous allegoric paintings , done at the instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of that family . I was predetermined not to like them for two reasons : first , that I dislike allegorical subjects ; and second , that I hate and despise that Medici family and all that belongs to them . So no sympathy with the subjects blinded my eyes , and drew me gradually from all else in the hall to contemplate these . It was simply the love of power and of fertility that held me astonished , which seemed to express with nonchalant ease what other painters attain by laborious efforts . It occurred to me that other painters are famous for single heads , or figures , and that were the striking heads and figures with which these pictures abound to be parcelled out singly , any one of them would make a man 's reputation . Any animal of Rubens , alone , would make a man 's fortune in that department . His fruits and flowers are unrivalled for richness and abundance ; his old men 's Leads are wonderful ; and when he chooses , which he does not often , he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are his worst productions . It would seem that he had revolted with such fury from the meagre , pale , cadaverous outlines of womankind painted by his predecessors , the Van Eyks , whose women resembled potato sprouts grown in a cellar , that he altogether overdid the matter in the opposite direction . His exuberant soul abhors leanness as Nature abhors a vacuum ; and hence all his women seem bursting their bodices with fulness , like overgrown carnations breaking out of their green calyxes . He gives you Venuses with arms fit to wield the hammer of Vulcan ; vigorous Graces whose dominion would be alarming were they indisposed to clemency . His weakness , in fact , his besetting sin , is too truly described by Moses :  --  " But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked ; Thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , Thou art covered with fatness . " Scornfully he is determined upon it ; he will none of your scruples ; his women shall be fat as he pleases , and you shall like him nevertheless . In this Medici @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the faces are portraits , and there are specimens among them of female beauty , so delicate as to demonstrate that it was not from any want of ability to represent the softer graces that he so often becomes hard and coarse . My friend , M. Belloc , made the remark that the genius of Rubens was somewhat restrained in these pictures , and chastened by the rigid rules of the French school , and hence in them he is more generally pleasing . I should compare Rubens to Shakspeare , for the wonderful variety and vital force of his artistic power . I know no other mind he so nearly resembles . Like Shakspeare , he forces you to accept and to forgive a thousand excesses , and uses his own faults as musicians use discords , only to enhance the perfection of harmony . There certainly is some use even in defects . A faultless style sends you to sleep . Defects rouse and excite the sensibility to seek and appreciate excellences . Some of Shakspeare 's finest passages explode all grammar and rhetoric like skyrockets  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murillo , there are two splendid specimens of his style here , as exquisite as any I have seen ; but I do not find reason to alter the judgment I made from my first survey . Here is his celebrated picture of the Assumption of the Virgin , which we have seen circulated in print shops in America , but which appears of a widely different character in the painting . The Virgin is rising in a flood of amber light , surrounded by clouds and indistinct angel figures . She is looking upward with clasped hands , as in an ecstasy : the crescent moon is beneath her feet . The whole tone of the picture  - -  the clouds , the drapery , her flowing hair  --  are pervaded with this amber tint , sublimated and spiritual . Do I , then , like it ? No . Does it affect me ? Not at all . Why so ? Because this is a subject requiring earnestness ; yet , after all , there is no earnestness of religious feeling expressed . It is a surface picture , exquisitely painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how do I know Murillo has no earnestness in the religious idea of this piece ? How do I know , when reading Pope 's Messiah , that he was not in earnest  --  that he was only most exquisitely reproducing what others had thought ? Does he not assume , in the most graceful way , the language of inspiration and holy rapture ? But , through it all , we feel the satisfied smirk of the artist , and the fine , sharp touch of his diamond file . What is done from a genuine , strong , inward emotion , whether in writing or painting , always mesmerizes the paper , or the canvas , and gives it a power which every body must feel , though few know why . The reason why the Bible has been omnipotent , in all ages , has been because there were the emotions of GOD in it ; and of paintings nothing is more remarkable than that some preserve in them such a degree of genuine vital force that one can never look on them with indifference ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be met , inspire no strong emotion . Yet this picture is immensely popular . Hundreds stand enchanted before it , and declare it imbodies their highest ideal of art and religion ; and I suppose it does . But so it always is . The man who has exquisite gifts of expression passes for more , popularly , than the man with great and grand ideas who utters but imperfectly . There are some pictures here by Correggio  --  a sleeping Venus and Cupid  --  a marriage of the infant Jesus and St. Catharine . This Correggio is the poet of physical beauty . Light and shadow are his god . What he lives for is , to catch and reproduce fitting phases of these . The moral is nothing to him , and , in his own world , he does what he seeks . He is a great popular favorite , since few look for more in a picture than exquisite beauty understood between us that his sphere is to be earth , and not heaven ; were he to attempt , profanely , to represent heavenly things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Moore to write me a prayer book . A large saloon is devoted to the masters of the French school . The works of no living artists are admitted . There are some large paintings by David . He is my utter aversion . I see in him nothing but the driest imitation of the classics . It would be too much praise to call it reproduction . David had neither heart nor soul . How could he be and artist ?  --  he who coolly took his portfolio to the guillotine to take lessons on the dying agonies of its victims  --  how could he ever paint any thing to touch the heart ? In general , all French artists appear to me to have been very much injured by a wrong use of classic antiquity . Nothing could be more glorious and beautiful than the Grecian development ; nothing more unlike it that the stale , wearisome , repetitious imitations of it in modern times . The Greek productions themselves have a living power to this day ; but all imitations of them are cold and tiresome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not imitate . That mysterious vitality which still imbues their remains , and which seems to enchant even the fragments of their marbles , is the mesmeric vitality of fresh , original conception . Art , built upon this , is just like what the shadow of a beautiful woman is to the woman . One gets tired in these galleries of the classic band , and the classic headdress , and the classic attitude , and the endless repetition of the classic urn , and vase , and lamp , as if nothing else were ever to be made in the world except these things . Again : in regard to this whole French gallery , there is much of a certain quality which I find it very difficult to describe in any one word  --  a dramatic smartness , a searching for striking and peculiar effects , which render the pictures very likely to please on first sight , and to weary on longer acquaintance . It seems to me to be the work of a race whose senses and perceptions of the outward have been cultivated more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to have been the result of strong and profound feeling , of habits of earnest and concentrated thought . There is an abundance of beautiful little phases of sentiment , pointedly expressed ; there is a great deal of what one should call the picturesque of the morale ; but few of its foundation ideas . I must except from these remarks the very strong and earnest painting of the Meduse , by Gericault , which C. has described . That seems to me to be the work of a man who had not seen human life and suffering merely on the outside , but had felt , in the very depths of his soul , the surging and earthquake of those mysteries of passion and suffering which underlie our whole existence in this world . To me it was a picture too mighty and too painful  --  whose power I confessed , but which I did not like to contemplate . On the whole , French painting is to me an exponent of the great difficulty and danger of French life ; that passion for the outward and visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their social life , every thing in their art and literature , tends continually to cultivate and increase . Hence they have become the leaders of the world in what I should call the minor artistics  --  all those little particulars which render life beautiful . Hence there are more pretty pictures , and popular lithographs , from France than from any other country in the world ; but it produces very little of the deepest and highest style of art . In this connection I may as well give you my Luxembourg experience , as it illustrates the same idea . I like Paul de la Roche , on the whole , although I think he has something of the fault of which I speak . He has very great dramatic power ; but it is more of the kind shown by Walter Scott than of the kind shown by Shakspeare . He can reproduce historical characters with great vividness and effect , and with enough knowledge of humanity to make the verisimilitude admirably strong ; but as to the deep knowledge with which Shakspeare searches the radical elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death of Queen Elizabeth is a strong Walter Scott picture ; so are his Execution of Strafford , and his Charles I. , which I saw in England . As to Horace Vernet , I do not think he is like either Scott or Shakspeare . In him this French capability for rendering the outward is wrought to the highest point ; and it is outwardness as pure from any touch of inspiration or sentiment as I ever remember to have seen . He is graphic to the utmost extreme . His horses and his men stand from the canvas to the astonishment of all beholders . All is vivacity , bustle , dazzle , and show . I think him as perfect , of his kind , as possible ; though it is a kind of art with which I do not sympathize . The picture of the Decadence de Rome indicates to my mind a painter who has studied and understood the classical forms ; vitalizing them , by the reproductive force of his own mind , so as to give them the living power of new creations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson . The classical forms are evidently not introduced because they are classic , but in subservience to the expression of the moral . In the orgies of the sensualists here represented he gives all the grace and beauty of sensuality without its sensualizing effect . Nothing could be more exquisite than the introduction of the busts of the departed heroes of the old republic , looking down from their pedestals on the scene of debauchery below . It is a noble picture , which I wish was hung up in the Capitol of our nation to teach our haughty people that as pride , and fulness of bread , and laxness of principle brought down the old republics , so also ours may fall . Although the outward in this painting , and the classical , is wrought to as fine a point as in any French picture , it is so subordinate to the severity of the thought , that while it pleases it does not distract . But to return to the Louvre . The halls devoted to paintings , of which I have spoken , give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallery after gallery is filled with Greek , Roman , Assyrian , and Egyptian sculptures , coins , vases , and antique remains of every description . There is , also , an apartment in which I took a deep interest , containing the original sketches of ancient masters . Here one may see the pen and ink drawings of Claude , divided into squares to prepare them for the copyist . One compares here with interest the manners of the different artists in jotting down their ideas as they rose ; some by chalk , some by crayon , some by pencil , some by water colors , and some by a heterogeneous mixture of all . Mozart 's scrap bag of musical jottings could not have been more amusing . On the whole , cravings of mere ideality have come nearer to meeting satisfaction by some of these old mutilated remains of Greek sculpture than any thing which I have met yet . In the paintings , even of the most celebrated masters , there are often things which are excessively annoying to me . I scarcely remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or foot , or face , or feature so distorted , or coloring at times so unnatural , or something so out of place and proportion in the picture as very seriously to mar the pleasure that I derived from it . In this statuary less is attempted , and all is more harmonious , and one 's ideas of proportion are never violated . My favorite among all these remains is a mutilated statue which they call the Venus de Milon . This is a statue which is so called from having been dug up some years ago , piecemeal , in the Island of Milos . There was quite a struggle for her between a French naval officer , the English , and the Turks . The French officer carried her off like another Helen , and she was given to Paris , old Louis Philippe being bridegroom by proxy . Savans refer the statue to the time of Phidias ; and as this is a pleasant idea to me , I go a little further , and ascribe her to Phidias himself . The statue is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot . But there is a majesty and grace in the head and face , a union of loveliness with intellectual and moral strength , beyond any thing which I have ever seen . To me she might represent Milton 's glorious picture of unfallen , perfect womanhood , in his Eve :  --  " Yet when I approach Her loveliness , so absolute she seems , And in herself complete , so well to know Her own , that what she wills to do or say Seems wisest , virtuousest , discreetest , best . All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded ; wisdom , in discourse with her , Loses discountenanced , and like folly shows . Authority and reason on her wait , As one intended first , not after made Occasionally ; and to consummate all , Greatness of mind , and nobleness , their seat Build in her , loveliest , and create an awe About her , like a guard angelic placed . " Compared with this matchless Venus , that of Medici seems as inane and trifling as mere physical beauty always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacramental , as the symbol of that which alone is truly fair . With regard to the arrangements of the Louvre , they seem to me to be admirable . No nation has so perfectly the qualifications to care for , keep , and to show to best advantage a gallery of art as the French . During the heat of the outburst that expelled Louis Philippe from the throne , the Louvre was in some danger of destruction . Destructiveness is a native element of human nature , however repressed by society ; and hence every great revolutionary movement always brings to the surface some who are for indiscriminate demolition . Moreover there is a strong tendency in the popular mind , where art and beauty have for many years been monopolized as the prerogative of a haughty aristocracy , to identify art and beauty with oppression ; this showed itself in England and Scotland in the general storm which wrecked the priceless beauty of the ecclesiastical buildings . It was displaying itself in the same manner in Germany during the time of the reformation , and had not Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have wrought equal ruin there . So in the first burst of popular enthusiasm that expelled the monarchy , the cry was raised by some among the people , " We shall never get rid of kings till we pull down the palaces ; " just the echo of the old cry in Scotland , " Pull down the nests , and the rooks will fly away . " The populace rushed in to the splendid halls and saloons of the Louvre , and a general encampment was made among the pictures . In this crisis a republican artist named Jeanron saved the Louvre ; saved the people the regret that must have come over them had they perpetrated barbarisms , and Liberty the shame of having such outrages wrought in her name . Appointed by the provisional government to the oversight of the Louvre , and well known among the people as a republican , he boldly came to the rescue . " Am I not one of you ? " he said . " Am I not one of the people ? These splendid works of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride and glory of our country ? Shall we destroy our most glorious possession in the first hour of its passing into our hands ? " Moved by his eloquence the people decamped from the building , and left it in his hands . Empowered to make all such arrangements for its renovation and embellishment as his artistic taste should desire , he conducted important repairs in the building , rearranged the halls , had the pictures carefully examined , cleaned when necessary , and distributed in schools with scientific accuracy . He had an apartment prepared where are displayed those first sketches by distinguished masters , which form one of the most instructive departments of the Louvre to a student of art . The government seconded all his measures by liberal supplies of money ; and the Louvre is placed in its present perfect condition by the thoughtful and cherishing hand of the republic . These facts have been communicated to me from a perfectly reliable source . As an American , and a republican , I can not but take pleasure in them . I mention them because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first advent of democratic principles where they have to explode their way into existence through masses of ancient rubbish , that popular liberty is unfavorable to art . It never could be so in France , because the whole body of the people are more thoroughly artistic in their tastes and feelings than in most countries . They are almost slaves to the outwardly beautiful , taken captive by the eye and the ear , and only the long association of beauty with tyranny , with suffering , want , and degradation to themselves , could ever have inspired any of them with even a momentary bitterness against it . JOURNAL  --  ( CONTINUED . ) Monday , June 13 . Went this morning with H. and Mrs. C. to the studio of M. Belloc . Found a general assembly of heads , arms , legs , and every species of nude and other humanity pertaining to a studio ; also an agreeable jumble of old pictures and new , picture frames , canvas , brushes , boxes , unfinished sketches , easels , palettes , a sofa , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stove rusty and fireless , and all things most charmingly innocent of any profane " clarin ' up times " whatsoever . The first question which M. Belloc proposed , with a genuine French air , was the question of " pose " or position . It was concluded that as other pictures had taken H. looking at the spectator , this should take her looking away . M. Belloc remarked , that M. Charpentier said H. appeared always with the air of an observer  --  was always looking around on every thing . Hence M. Belloc would take her " en observatrice , mais pas en curieuse "  --  with the air of observation , but not of curiosity . At it he went . I stood behind and enjoyed . Rapid creative sketching in chalk and charcoal . Then a chaos of colors and clouds , put on now with brushes , now with fingers . " God began with chaos , " said he , quoting Prudhon . " We can not expect to do better than God . " With intensest enjoyment I watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gradually resolving themselves into shape , and lightening up with tints and touches , until a head seemed slowly emerging from amidst the shadows . Meanwhile , an animated conversation was proceeding . M. Belloc , in his rich , glorious French , rolling out like music from an organ , discussed the problems of his art ; while we ever and anon excited him by our speculations , our theories , our heresies . H. talked in English , and Mrs. C. translated , and I put in a French phrase sidewise every now and then . By and by , M. Charpentier came in , who is more voluble , more ore rotundo , grandiose , than M. Belloc . He began panegyrizing Uncle Tom ; and this led to a discussion of the ground of its unprecedented success . In his thirty-five years ' experience as a bookseller , he had known nothing like it . It surpassed all modern writers . At first he would not read it ; his taste was for old masters of a century or two ago . " Like M. Belloc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found his friend , M. Alfred de Musee , the first intelligence of the age , reading it . " What , you too ? " said he . " Ah , ah ! " said De Musee ; " say nothing about this book ! There is nothing like it . This leaves us all behind  --  all , all , miles behind ! " M. Belloc said the reason was because there was in it more genuine faith than in any book . And we branched off into florid eloquence touching paganism , Christianity , and art . " Christianity , " M. Belloc said , " has ennobled man , but not made him happier . The Christian is not so happy as the old Greek . The old Greek mythology is full of images of joy , of lightness , and vivacity ; nymphs and fauns , dryads and hamadryads , and all sportive creations . The arts that grow up out of Christianity are all tinged with sorrow . " " This is true in part , " replied H. , " because the more you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his quantity of being , the more you enlarge his capacity of suffering . A man can suffer more than an oyster . Christianity , by enlarging the scope of man 's heart , and dignifying his nature , has deepened his sorrow . " M. Belloc referred to the paintings of Eustache le Soeur , in the Louvre , in illustration of his idea  --  a series based on the experience of St. Bruno , and representing the effects of maceration and ghostly penance with revolting horrors . " This , " H. replied , " is not my idea of Christianity . Religion is not asceticism , but a principle of love to God that beautifies and exalts common life , and fills it with joy . " M. Belloc ended with a splendid panegyric upon the ancient Greeks , the eloquence of which I will not mar by attempting to repeat . Ever and anon H. was amused at the pathetic air , at once genuinely French and thoroughly sincere , with which the master assured her , that he was " desole " to put her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happier , methinks M. Belloc forgets that the old Greek tragedies are filled with despair and gloom , as their prevailing characteristic , and that nearly all the music of the world before Christ was in the minor scale , as since Christ it has come to be in the major . The whole creation has , indeed , groaned and travailed in pain together until now ; but the mighty anthem has modulated since the cross , and the requiem of Jesus has been the world 's birthsong of approaching jubilee . Music is a far better test , moreover , on such a point , than painting , for just where painting is weakest , namely , in the expression of the highest moral and spiritual ideas , there music is most sublimely strong . Altogether this morning in the painter 's studio was one of the most agreeable we ever spent . But what shall I say then of the evening in a salon musicale ; with the first violoncello playing in the world , and the Princess Czartoryski at the piano ? We were invited at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We arrived at the hotel of Mrs. Erskine , a sister of Lord Dundalk , and found a very select party . There were chairs and sofas enough for all without crowding . There was Frankomm of the Conservatoire , with his Stradivarius , an instrument one hundred and fifty years old , which cost six thousand dollars . There was his son , a little lad of twelve , who played almost as well as his father . I wish F. and M. could have seen this . He was but a year older than F. , and yet played with the most astonishing perfection . Among other things the little fellow performed a morceau of his own composition , which was full of pathos , and gave tokens of uncommon ability . His father gave us sonatas of Mozart , Chopin , &c.,; and a polonaise . The Princess Czartoryski accompanied on the piano with extraordinary ability . That was an evening to be remembered a lifetime . One heard , probably , the best music in the world of its kind , performed under prepared circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no whispering , no noise . All felt , and heard , and enjoyed . I conversed with the princess and with Frankomm . The former speaks English , the latter none . I interpreted for H. , and she had quite a little conversation with him about his son , and about music . She told him she hoped the day was coming when art would be consecrated to express the best and purest emotions of humanity . He had read Uncle Tom ; and when he read it he exclaimed , " This is genuine Christianity "  --  " Ceci est la vraie Christianisme ! " The attentions shown to H. were very touching and agreeable . There is nothing said or done that wearies or oppresses her . She is made to feel perfectly free , at large , at ease ; and the regard felt for her is manifested in a way so delicate , so imperceptibly fine and considerate , that she is rather strengthened by it than exhausted . This is owing , no doubt , to the fact that we came determined to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mrs. C. to that effect . Instead of trying to defeat her purpose , and force her into publicity , the few who know of her presence seem to try to help her carry it out , and see how much they can do for her , consistently therewith . Tuesday , June 14 . To-day we dined at six P. M. , and read till nine . Then drove to an evening salon  --  quite an early little party at Mrs. Putnam 's . Saw there Peter Parley and La Rochejaquelin , the only one of the old nobility that joined Louis Napoleon . Peter Parley is consul no longer , it seems . We discussed the empire a very little . " To be , or not to be , that is the question . " Opinions are various as the circles . Every circle draws into itself items of information , that tend to indicate what it wishes to be about to happen . Still , Peter Parley and I , and some other equally cautious people , think that this can not always last . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  this empire , so called . Sooner or later it must end in revolution ; and then what ? Said a gentleman the other day , " Nothing holds him up but fear of the RED . " Footnote : That is , fear of the Red Republicans . After chatting a while , Weston and I slipped out , and drove to the Jardin Mabille , a garden in the Champs Elysees , whither thousands go every night . We entered by an avenue of poplars and other trees and shrubs , so illuminated by jets of gas sprinkled amongst the foliage as to give it the effect of enchantment . It was neither moonlight nor daylight , but a kind of spectral aurora , that made every thing seem unearthly . As we entered the garden , we found flower beds laid out in circles , squares , lozenges , and every conceivable form , with diminutive jets of gas so distributed as to imitate flowers of the softest tints , and the most perfect shape . This , too , seemed unearthly , weird . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cave , infinitely beyond the common sights and sounds of every-day life . In the centre of these grounds there is a circle of pillars , on the top of each of which is a pot of flowers , with gas jets , and between them an arch of gas jets . This circle is very large . In the midst of it is another circle , forming a pavilion for musicians , also brilliantly illuminated , and containing a large cotillion band of the most finished performers . Around this you find thousands of gentlemen and ladies strolling singly , in pairs , or in groups . There could not be less than three thousand persons present . While the musicians repose , they loiter , sauntering round , or recline on seats . But now a lively waltz strikes the ear . In an instant twenty or thirty couples are whirling along , floating , like thistles in the wind , around the central pavilion . Their feet scarce touch the smooth-trodden earth . Round and round , in a vortex of life , beauty , and brilliancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheeks flushing , and gauzy draperies floating by ; while the crowds outside gather in a ring , and watch the giddy revel . There are countless forms of symmetry and grace , faces of wondrous beauty , both among the dancers and among the spectators . There , too , are feats of agility and elasticity quite aerial . One lithe and active dancer grasped his fair partner by the waist . She was dressed in a red dress ; was small , elastic , agile , and went by like the wind . And now and then , in the course of every few seconds , he would give her a whirl and a lift , sending her spinning through the air , around himself as an axis , full four feet from the ground . Then the music ceases , the crowd dissolves , and floats and saunters away . On every hand are games of hazard and skill , with balls , tops , wheels , &c.,; where , for five cents a trial , one might seek to gain a choice out of glittering articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the whirling dance renews its vortex ; and so it goes on , from hour to hour , till two or three in the morning . Not that we staid till then ; we saw all we wanted to see , and left by eleven . But it is a scene perfectly unearthly , or rather perfectly Parisian , and just as earthly as possible ; yet a scene where earthliness is worked up into a style of sublimation the most exquisite conceivable . Entrance to this paradise can be had for , gentlemen , a dollar ; ladies , free . This tells the whole story . Nevertheless , do not infer that there are not any respectable ladies there . It is a place so remarkable , that very few strangers stay long in Paris without taking a look at it . And though young ladies residing in Paris never go , and matrons very seldom , yet occasionally it is the case that some ladies of respectability look in . The best dancers , those who exhibit such surprising feats of skill and agility , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the impropriety inherent in the very nature of waltzing , there was not a word , look , or gesture of immorality or impropriety . The dresses were all decent ; and if there was vice , it was vice masked under the guise of polite propriety . How different , I could not but reflect , is all this from the gin palaces of London ! There , there is indeed a dazzling splendor of gas light . But there is nothing artistic , nothing refined , nothing appealing to the imagination . There are only hogsheads , and barrels , and the appliances for serving out strong drink . And there , for one sole end , the swallowing of fiery stimulant , come the nightly thousands  --  from the gay and well dressed , to the haggard and tattered , in the last stage of debasement . The end is the same  --  by how different paths ! Here , they dance along the path to ruin , with flowers and music ; there , they cast themselves bodily , as it were , into the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forenoon to M. Belloc 's studio , and read while H. was sitting . Then we drove to Madame Roger 's , who is one of the leaders of Paris taste and legislation in dress , and who is said to have refused to work for a duchess who neglected to return her husband 's bow . I sat in the outer courts while some mysterious affairs were being transacted in the inner rooms of state . Then we drove to the Louvre , and visited the remains from Nineveh . They are fewer in number than those in the British Museum , which I have not yet seen . But the pair of human-headed , winged bulls are said to be equal in size to any . I was very much impressed , not only by the solemn grandeur of the thought that thirty centuries were looking down upon me out of those stony eyes , but by what I have never seen noticed , the magnificent phrenological development of the heads . The brow is absolutely prodigious  --  broad , high , projecting , massive . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherub , which I am persuaded is the true designation of these creatures . They are to me but the earliest known attempts to preserve the cherubim that formed the fiery portals of the Eden temple until quenched in the Purges of the deluge . Out of those eyes of serene , benign , profound reflection , therefore , not thirty , but sixty centuries look down upon me . I seem to be standing at those mysterious Eden gates , where Adam and Eve first guided the worship of a world , amid the sad , yet sublime symbols of a previous existence in heavenly realms . After leaving the Louvre H. and I took a caleche , or open two-seat carriage , and drove from thence to the Madeleine , and thence the whole length of the Boulevards , circling round , crossing the Pont d'Austerlitz , and coming back by the Avenue de l'Observatoire and the Luxembourg . Then we saw theatres , the Port St. Denis , Port St. Martin , the site of the Bastille , and the most gay , beautiful , and bustling boulevards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulevard des Italiens , I saw the street beginning to line with people , the cabs and carriages drawing to either side and stopping ; police officers commanding , directing , people running , pushing , looking this way and that . " Qu ' y a-t-il ? " said I , standing up by the driver  --  " What 's the matter ? " " The emperor is coming , " said he . " Well , " said I , " draw to one side , and turn a little , so that we can see . " He did so , and H. and I both stood up , looking round . We saw several outriders in livery , on the full trot , followed by several carriages . They came very fast , the outriders calling to the people to get out of the way . In the first carriage sat the emperor and the empress  --  he , cold , stiff , stately , and homely ; she , pale , beautiful , and sad . They rode not two rods from us . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a " Vive l'Empereur ? Without a single token of greeting or applause , he rode through the ever-forming , ever-dissolving avenue of people  --  the abhorred , the tolerated tyrant . " Why do they not cry out ? " I said to the coachman , " Why do they not cry , ' Vive l'Empereur ' ? " A most expressive shrug was the answer , and " I do not know . I suppose , because they do not choose . " Thursday , June 16 . Immediately after breakfast we were to visit Chateau de Corbeville . The carriage came , and H. , Mrs. C. , and W. entered . I mounted the box with the " cocker , " as usual . To be shut up in a box , and peep out at the window while driving through such scenes , is horrible . By the way , our party would have been larger , but for the arrest of Monsieur F. , an intimate friend of the family , which took place at five o'clock in the morning . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife were to have joined our party . His arrest is on some political suspicion , and as the result can not be foreseen , it casts a shadow over the spirits of our household . We drove along through the bright , fresh morning  --  I enjoying the panorama of Paris exceedingly  --  to the Western Railway Station , where we took tickets for Versailles . We feel as much at home now , in these continental railroad stations , as in our own  --  nay , more so . Every thing is so regulated here , there is almost no possibility of going wrong , and there is always somebody at hand whose business it is to be very polite , and tell you just what to do . A very pleasant half hour 's ride brought us to Versailles . There we took a barouche for the day , and started for the chateau . In about an hour and a half , through very pleasant scenery , we came to the spot , where we were met by Madame V. and her daughter , and , alighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark with overarching trees . We were to have a second breakfast at about one o'clock in the day ; so we strolled out to a seat on the terrace , commanding a fine and very extensive prospect . Madame V. is the wife of an eminent lawyer , who held the office of intendant of the civil list of Louis Philippe , and has had the settlement of that gentleman 's pecuniary affairs since his death . At the time of the coup d'etat , being then a representative , he was imprisoned , and his wife showed considerable intrepidity in visiting him , walking on foot through the prison yard , amongst the soldiers sitting drunk on the cannon . At present Monsieur V. is engaged in his profession in Paris . Madame V. is a pleasant-looking French woman , of highly-cultivated mind and agreeable manners ; accomplished in music and in painting . Her daughter , about fifteen , plays well , and is a good specimen of a well-educated French demoiselle , not yet out . They are simply ciphers , except as developed in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful things beautifully , and then her mother played a duet with her . We took a walk through the groves , and sat on the bank , on the brow of a commanding eminence . A wide landscape was before us , characterized by every beauty of foliage conceivable , but by none more admirable , to my eye , than the poplars , which sustain the same relation to French scenery that spruces do to that of Maine . Reclining there , we could almost see , besides the ancient territory of the Duke d'Orsay , the celebrated valley of Chartreuse , where was the famous Abbey of Port Royal , a valley filled with historic associations . If it had not been for a hill which stood in the way , we should have seen it . At our leisure we discussed painting . Before us , a perfect landscape ; around us , a deep solitude and stillness , broken by the sighing of ancient aristocratic shades , and the songs of birds ; within us , emotions of lassitude and dreamy delight . We had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to exist was enough ; where the " to be " was , for a moment , disjoined from the inexorable " to do , " or " to suffer . " How agreeable to converse with cultivated and refined artistic minds ! How delightful to find people to whom the beautiful has been a study , and art a world in which they could live , move , and have their being ! And yet it was impossible to prevent a shade of deep sadness from resting on all things  --  a tinge of melancholy . Why ?  --  why this veil of dim and indefinable anguish at sight of whatever is most fair , at hearing whatever is most lovely ? Is it the exiled spirit , yearning for its own ? Is it the captive , to whom the ray of heaven 's own glory comes through the crevice of his dungeon walls ? But this is a digression . Returning , we examined the mansion , a fine specimen of the old French chateau ; square-built , with high Norman roof , and a round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden , curiously laid out in beds , and knots of flowers , with a fountain in the centre . This garden was enclosed on all sides by beech trees , clipped into lofty walls of green . The chateau had once been fortified , but now the remains of the fortifications are made into terraces , planted with roses and honeysuckles . Here we heard , for the first time in our lives , the nightingale 's song ; a gurgling warble , with an occasional crescendo , a la Jenny Lind . At five we dined ; took carriage at seven , cars at nine , and arrived in Paris at ten . Friday , June 17 . At twelve o'clock I started for Versailles to visit the camp at Sartory , where I understood the emperor was to review the troops . At Versailles I mounted the top of an omnibus with two Parisian gentlemen . As I opened my umbrella one of them complimented me on having it . I replied that it was quite a necessary of life . He answered , and we were soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and whether the emperor was to be there . He said he had heard so . He then asked me if we had not a camp near London , showing that he took me for an Englishman . I replied that there was a camp there , though I had not seen it , and that I was an American . In reply he congratulated me that the Americans were far ahead of the English . I complimented him then in turn on Versailles and its galleries , and told him there was not a nation on earth that had such monuments of its own history and greatness . They were highly elated at this , and we rode along in the best possible humor together . Nothing will make a Frenchman thoroughly your friend sooner than heartily to praise his country . It is for this I love them . Arrived at Sartory I had a long walk to reach the camp ; and instead of inquiring , as I ought to have done , whether the review was to take place , I took it for granted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers galloping about , and flying artillery trundling along , and heard drums , trumpets , and bands , and thought it was all right . A fifteen minutes ' walk brought me to the camp , where tents for some twenty-five thousand whiten the plain far as the eye can reach . There , too , I saw distant masses of infantry moving . I might have known by their slouchy way that they were getting home from parade , not preparing for it . But I thought the latter , and lying down under a tree , waited for the review to begin . It was almost three o'clock . I waited and waited . The soldiers did not come . I waited , and waited , and waited . The soldiers seemed to have gone more and more . The throne where the emperor was to sit remained unoccupied . At last it was four o'clock . Thought I , I will just ask these redcaps here about this . " Messieurs , " said I , " will you be so good as to inform me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " they replied , " he comes on Sunday . " " And what is to be done here , then ? " I asked . " Here , " they replied , " to-day ? Nothing ; c'est fini  --  it is all over . The review was at one o'clock . " There I had been walking from Versailles , and waiting for a parade some two hours after it was all over , among crowds of people who could have told me at once if I had not been so excessively modest as not to ask . About that time an American might have been seen precipitately seeking the railroad . I had not seen the elephant . It was hot , dusty , and there was neither cab nor caleche in reach . I arrived at the railroad station just in time to see the train go out at one end as I came in at the other . This was conducive to a frame of mind that scarcely needs remark . Out of that depot ( it was half past four , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision I pitched into a cab . " A l'autre station , vite , vite ! "  --  To the other station , quick , quick ! He mounted the box , and commenced lashing his Rosinante , who was a subject for crows to mourn over , ( because they could hope for nothing in trying to pick him , ) and in an ambling , scrambling pace , composed of a trot , a canter , and a kick , we made a descent like an avalanche into the station yard . There Richard was himself again . I assumed at once the air of a gentleman who had seen the review , and walked about with composure and dignity . No doubt I had seen the emperor and all the troops . I succeeded in getting home just in the middle of dinner , and by dint of hard eating caught up at the third course with the rest . That I consider a very white day . Some might call it green , but I mark such days with white always . In the evening we attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostess . Found there the Marquis de M. , whose book on the spiritual rappings comes out next week . We conversed on the rappings ad nauseam . By the way , her ladyship rents the Hotel de la Rochefoucauld , in the Rue de Varenne , Faubourg St. Germain . St. Germain is full of these princely , aristocratic mansions . Mournfully beautiful  --  desolately grand . Out of the stern , stony street , we entered a wide , square court , under a massive arched gateway , then through the Rez-de-Chaussee , or lower suite of rooms , passed out into the rear of the house to find ourselves in the garden , or rather a kind of park , with tall trees , flooded in moonlight , bathed in splendors , and with their distant , leafy arches ( cut with artistic skill ) reminding one of a Gothic temple . Such a magnificent forest scene in the very heart of Paris ! Saturday , June 18 . After breakfast rode out to Arc de Triomphe  --  de l'Etoile , and thence round the exterior barriers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city past the barriers , ( which are now only a street , ) there is a gate , and a building marked " Octroi , " which means customs . No carriage can pass without being examined , though the examination is a mere form . Pere la Chaise did not interest me much , except that from the top of the hill I gained a good view of the city . It is filled with tombs and monuments , and laid out in streets . The houses of the dead are smaller than the houses of the living , but they are made like houses , with doors , windows , and an empty place inside for an altar , crucifix , lamps , wreaths , &c.; Tombs have no charm for me . I am not at all interested or inspired by them . They do not serve with me the purpose intended , viz. , of calling up the memory of the departed . On the contrary , their memory is associated with their deeds , their works , the places where they wrought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , in the charnel house is commemorated but the event of their deepest shame and degradation , their total vanquishment under the dominion of death , the triumph of corruption . Here all that was visible of them is insulted by the last enemy , in the deepest , most humiliating posture of contumely . From Pere la Chaise I came home to dinner at six . H. , meanwhile , had been sitting to M. Belloc . After dinner H. and the two Misses C. rode out to the Bois de Boulogne , the fashionable drive of Paris . We saw all the splendid turnouts , and all the not splendid . Our horse was noted for the springhalt . It is well to have something to attract attention about one , you know . Sabbath , June 19 . After breakfast went with Miss W. to the temple St. Marie , to hear Adolphe Monod . Was able to understand him very well . Gained a new idea of the capabilities of the French language as the vehicle of religious thought and experience . I had thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hebrew mind and feeling of Scripture . I think differently . The language of Canaan can make its way through all languages , and in the French it has a pathos , point , and simplicity which are wonderful . There were thoughts in the sermon which I shall never forget . I feel myself highly rewarded for going . The congregation was as large as the church could possibly hold , and composed of very interesting and intelligent-looking people . His subject was , " If any man lack wisdom , let him ask of God , who giveth willingly , and without upbraiding , " &c.; It was most touchingly adapted to the wants of the unhappy French , and of all poor sinners ; and it came home to me in particular , as if it had been addressed to me singly , so that I could not help crying . The afternoon and evening spent at home , reading . H. went in the morning with Madame de T. to the Catholic service , at the church St. Germaine l'Auxerrois , and her companion pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was moved with compassion towards these multitudes , who seem so very earnest and solemn . Their prayer books contain much that is excellent , if it was not mixed with so much that is idolatrous . Monday , June 20 . Went to have our passport vised . The sky was black , and the rain pouring in torrents . As I reached the quay the Seine was rushing dark , and turbidly foaming . I crept into a fiacre , and was amused , as we rattled on , to see the plight of gay and glittering Paris . One poor organ grinder , on the Pont National , sat with his umbrella over his head , and his body behind the parapet , grinding away , in the howling storm . It was the best use for a hand organ I ever saw . The gardens of the Tuileries presented a sorry sight . The sentries slunk within their boxes . The chairs were stacked and laid on their sides . The paths were flooded ; and the classic statues looked as though they had a dismal time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport went through the office of the American embassy , prefecture of the police , and the bureau des affaires etrangeres , and the Swiss legation , and we were all right for the frontier . Our fair hostesses are all Alpine mountaineers , posted up in mountain lore . They make you look blank one moment with horror at some escape of theirs from being dashed down a precipice ; the next they run you a rig indeed over the Righi ; anon you shamble through Chamounix , and break your neck over the Col-de-balme , and , before you are aware , are among the lacking at Interlachen . Wednesday , June 22 . Adieu to Paris ! Ho for Chalons sur Saone ! After affectionate farewells of our kind friends , by eleven o'clock we were rushing , in the pleasantest of cars , over the smoothest of rails , through Burgundy that was ; I reading to H. out of Dumas ' Impressions de Voyage , going over our very route . We arrived at Chalons at nine in the evening , and were soon established in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers , looking out upon the steamboat landing . Thursday , 23 . Eight o'clock A. M. Since five we have had a fine bustle on the quay below our windows . There lay three steamers , shaped , for all the world , like our last night 's rolls . One would think Ichabod Crane might sit astride one of them and dip his feet in the water . They ought to be swift . L'Hirondelle ( the Swallow ) flew at five ; another at six . We leave at nine . Eleven o'clock . Here we go , down the Saone . Cabin thirty feet by ten , papered and varnished in invitation of maple . Ladies knitting , netting , nodding , napping ; gentlemen yawning , snoring ; children frolicking ; dogs whining . Overhead a constant tramping , stamping , and screeching of the steam valve . H. suggests an excursion forward . We heave up from Hades , and cautiously thread the crowded Al Sirat of a deck . The day is fine ; the air is filled with golden beams . More and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the river broader , hills more commanding , and architecture tinged with the Italian . Bradshaw says it equals the Rhine . At Lyons there was a scene of indescribable confusion . Out of the hold a man with a rope and hook was hauling baggage up a smooth board . Three hundred people were sorting their goods without checks . Porters were shouldering immense loads , four or five heavy trunks at once , corded together , and stalking off Atlantean . Hatboxes , bandboxes , and valises burst like a meteoric shower out of a crater . " A moi , a moi ! " was the cry , from old men , young women , soldiers , shopkeepers , and pretres , scuffling and shoving together . Careless at once of grammar and of grace , I pulled and shouted with the best , till at length our plunder was caught , corded and poised on an herculean neck . We followed in the wake , H. trembling lest the cord should break , and we experience a pre-Alpine avalanche . At length , however , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l'Univers . After dinner we drove to the cathedral . It was St. John 's eve . " At twelve o'clock to-night , " said H. , " the spirits of all who are to die this year will appear to any who will go alone into the dark cathedral and summon them " ! We were charmed with the interior . Twilight hid all the dirt , cobwebs , and tawdry tinsel ; softened the outlines , and gave to the immense arches , columns , and stained windows a strange and thrilling beauty . The distant tapers , seeming remoter than reality , the kneeling crowds , the heavy vesper chime , all combined to realize , H. said , her dreams of romance more perfectly than ever before . We could not tear ourselves away . But the clash of the sexton 's keys , as he smote them together , was the signal to be gone . One after another the tapers were extinguished . The kneeling figures rose ; and shadowily we flitted forth , as from some gorgeous cave of grammarye . Saturday , June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first experience in the diligence line , we noticed particularly every peculiarity . A diligence is a large , heavy , strongly-built , well-hung stage , consisting of five distinct departments ,  --  coupe , berline , omnibus , banquette , and baggage top . Illustration : of a diligence coach drawn by four horses . After setting up housekeeping in our berline , and putting all " to rights , " the whips cracked , bells jingled , and away we thundered by the arrowy Rhone . I had had the idea that a diligence was a rickety , slow-moulded antediluvian nondescript , toiling patiently along over impassable roads at a snail 's pace . Judge of my astonishment at finding it a full-blooded , vigorous monster , of unscrupulous railway momentum and imperturbable equipoise of mind . Down the macadamized slopes we thundered at a prodigious pace ; up the hills we trotted with six horses , three abreast ; madly through the little towns we burst , like a whirlwind , crashing across the pebbled streets , and out upon the broad , smooth road again . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lyons , we stopped to change horses . Done in a jiffy ; and whoop , crick , crack , whack , rumble , bump , whirr , whisk , away we blazed , till , ere we knew it , another change , and another . " Really , H. , " said I , " this is not slow . The fact is , we are going ahead . I call this travelling  --  never was so comfortable in my life . " " Nor I , " quoth she . " And , besides , we are unwinding the Rhone all along . " And , sure enough , we were ; ever and anon getting a glimpse of him spread mazily all abroad in some beautiful vale , like a midguard anaconda done in silver . At Nantua , a sordid town , with a squalid inn , we dined , at two , deliciously , on a red shrimp soup ; no , not soup , it was a potage ; no , a stew ; no , a creamy , unctuous mess , muss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panza never ate his olla podrida with more relish . Success to mine host of the jolly inn of Nantua ! Then we thunderbolted along again , shot through a grim fortress , crossed a boundary line , and were in Switzerland . Vive Switzerland ! land of Alps , glaciers , and freemen ! As evening drew on , a wind sprang up , and a storm seemed gathering on the Jura . The rain dashed against the panes of the berime , as we rode past the grim-faced monarch of the " misty shroud . " A cold wind went sweeping by , and the Rhone was rushing far below , discernible only in the distance as a rivulet of flashing foam . It was night as we drove into Geneva , and stopped at the Messagerie . I heard with joy a voice demanding if this were Monsieur Besshare . I replied , not without some scruples of conscience , " Oui , monsieur , c'est moi , " though the name did not sound exactly like the one to which I had been wont to respond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion of Monsieur Fazy . Geneve , Monday , June 27 . The day dawned clear over this palace of enchantment . The mountains , the lake , the entire landscape on every side revealed itself from our lofty windows with transparent brilliancy . This house is built on high ground , at the end of the lake near where the Rhone flows out . It is very high in the rooms , and we are in the fourth story , and have distant views on all four sides . The windows are very large , and open in leaves , on hinges , like doors , leaving the entire window clear , as a frame for the distant picture . In the afternoon we rode out across the Rhone , where it breaks from the lake , and round upon the ascending shore . It is seldom here that the Alps are visible . The least mist hides them completely , so that travellers are wont to record it in their diaries as a great event , " I saw Mont Blanc to-day . " Yesterday there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ridden far before H. sprang suddenly , as if she had lost her senses  --  her cheeks flushed , and her eye flashing . I was frightened . " There , " said she , pointing out of the side of the carriage across the lake , " there he is  --  there 's Mont Blanc . " " Pooh , " said I , " no such thing . " And some trees for a moment intervened , and shut out the view . Presently the trees opened , and H. cried , " There , that white ; do n't you see ?  --  there  --  there ! " pointing with great energy , as if she were getting ready to fly . I looked and saw , sure enough , behind the dark mass of the Mole , ( a huge blue-black mountain in the foreground , ) the granite ranges rising gradually and grim as we rode ; but , further still , behind those gray and ghastly barriers , all bathed and blazing in the sun 's fresh splendors , undimmed by a cloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , so white  --  so intensely , blindingly white ! against the dark-blue sky , the needles , the spires , the solemn pyramid , the transfiguration cone of Mont Blanc . Higher , and still higher , those apocalyptic splendors seemed lifting their spectral , spiritual forms , seeming to rise as we rose , seeming to start like giants hidden from behind the black brow of intervening ranges , opening wider the amphitheatre of glory , until , as we reached the highest point in our road , the whole unearthly vision stood revealed in sublime perspective . The language of the Revelation came rushing through my soul . This is , as it were , a door opened in heaven . Here are some of those everlasting mountain ranges , whose light is not of the sun , nor of the moon , but of the Lord God and of the Lamb . Here is , as it were , a great white throne , on which One might sit before whose face heaven and earth might flee ; and here a sea of glass mingled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows , some dim and veiled resemblances , which bring our earth-imprisoned spirits to conceive remotely what the disencumbered eye of the ecstatic apostle gazed upon . With solemn thankfulness we gazed  --  thankfulness to God for having withdrawn his veil of clouds from this threshold of the heavenly vestibule , and brought us across the Atlantic to behold . And as our eyes , blinded by the dazzling vision ,  --  which we might reside here years without beholding in such perfection ,  --  filled with tears , we were forced to turn them away and hide them , or fasten them upon the dark range of Jura on the other side of us , until they were able to gaze again . Thus we rode onward , obtaining new points of view , new effects , and deeper emotions ; nor can time efface the impressions we received in the depths of our souls . A lady , at whose door we alighted for a moment to obtain a particular point of view , told us that at sunset the mountain assumed a peculiar transparency , with most mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen irreligious natures , frivolous and light , when suddenly called out to look , stand petrified , or rather exalted above themselves , and irresistibly turning their faces , their thoughts , their breathings of adoration up to God . I do not wonder that the eternal home of the glorified should be symbolized by a Mount Zion . I do not wonder that the Psalmist should say , " I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills , from whence cometh my help ! " For surely earth can not present , nor unassisted fancy conceive , an object more profoundly significant of divine majesty than these mountains in their linen vesture of everlasting snow . Tuesday , June 28 . The morning dawned clear , warm , and cloudless . A soft haze rested on the distant landscape , without , however , in the least dimming its beauty . At about eleven we set off with two horses in an open carriage , by the left shore , to visit St. Cergue , and ascend the Jura . All our way was gradually ascending , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , stood the glorious New Jerusalem scene . We were highly favored . Every moment diminished the intervening mountains , and lifted the gorgeous pageant higher into the azure . Every step , every turn , presented it in some new point of view , and extended the range of observation . New Alps were continually rising , and diamond-pointed peaks glancing up behind sombre granite bulwarks . At noon cocher stopped at a village to refresh his horses . We proceeded to a cool terrace filled with trees , and lulled by the splash of a fountain , from whence the mountain was in full view . Here we investigated the mysteries of a certain basket which our provident hostess had brought with her . After due refreshment and repose we continued our route , ascending the Jura , towards the Dole , which is the highest mountain of that range . A macadamized road coiled up the mountain side , affording us at every turning a new and more splendid view of the other shore of the lake . At length we reached St. Cergue , and leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant girl , went through the woods to the highest point , where were the ruins of the ancient chateau . Far be it from me to describe what we saw . I feel that I have already been too presumptuous . We sat down , and each made a hasty sketch of Mont Blanc . We took tea at the hotel , which reminded us , by the neatness of its scoured chambers with their white bedspreads , of the apartments of some out-of-the-way New England farm house . The people of the neighborhood having discovered who H. was , were very kind , and full of delight at seeing her . It was Scotland over again . We have had to be unflinching to prevent her being overwhelmed , both in Paris and Geneva , by the same demonstrations of regard . To this we were driven , as a matter of life and death . It was touching to listen to the talk of these secluded mountaineers . The good hostess , even the servant maids , hung about H. , expressing such tender interest for the slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently been an era in their life 's monotony , for they said , " O , madam , do write another ! Remember , our winter nights here are very long ! " The proprietor of the inn ( not the landlord ) was a gentleman of education and polished demeanor . He had lost an Eva , he said . And he spoke with deep emotion . He thanked H. for what she had written , and at parting said , " Have courage ; the sacred cause of Liberty will yet prevail through the world . " Ah , they breathe a pure air , these generous Swiss , among these mountain tops ! May their simple words be a prophecy divine . At about six we returned , and as we slowly wound down the mountain side we had a full view of all the phenomena of color attending the sun 's departure . The mountain ,  --  the city rather ,  --  for so high had it risen , that I could imagine a New Jerusalem of pearly white , with Mont Blanc for the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-glow . The air behind , the sky , became of a delicate apple green ; the snow , before so incandescent in whiteness , assumed a rosy tint . We paused  - -  we sat in silence to witness these miraculous transformations . " Charley , " said H. , " sing that hymn of yours , the New Jerusalem . " And in the hush of the mountain solitudes we sang together ,  --  " We are on our journey home , Where Christ our Lord is gone ; We will meet around his throne , When he makes his people one In the New Jerusalem . We can see that distant home , Though clouds rise oft between ; Faith views the radiant dome , And a lustre flashes keen From the New Jerusalem . O , glory shining far From the never-setting sun ! O , trembling morning star ! Our journey 's almost done To the New Jerusalem . Our hearts are breaking now Those mansions fair to see : O Lord , thy heavens bow , And raise us up with thee To the New Jerusalem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , as slowly we wended our downward way . The rosy flush began to fade . A rich creamy or orange hue seemed to imbue the scene , and finally , as the shadows from the Jura crept higher , and covered it with a pall , it assumed a startling , deathlike pallor of chalky white . Mont Blanc was dead . Mont Blanc was walking as a ghost upon the granite ranges . But as darkness came on , and as the sky over the Jura , where the sun had set , obtained a deep , rosy tinge , Mont Blanc revived a little , and a flush of delicate , transparent pink tinged his cone , and Mont Blanc was asleep . Good night to Mont Blanc . Wednesday morning , June 29 . The day is intensely hot ; the weather is exceedingly fair , but Mont Blanc is not visible . Not a vestige  --  not a trace . All vanished . It does not seem possible . There do not seem to exist the conditions for such celestial pageant to have stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily and piercingly into the blue , into the seemingly fathomless azure  --  there , will they tell me , I saw that enraptured vision , as it were , the city descending from God out of heaven , as a bride adorned for her husband ? Incredible ! It must be a dream , a vision of the night . Evening . After the heat of the day our whole household , old and young , set forth for a boating excursion on the lake . Dividing our party in two boats , we pulled about a mile up the left shore . Lake Leman was before us in all its loveliness ; and we were dipping our oar where Byron had floated past scenes which scarce need to become classic to possess a superior charm . The sun was just gone behind the Jura , leaving a glorious sky . Mont Blanc stood afar behind a hazy veil , like a spirit half revealed . We saw it pass before our eyes as we moved . " It stood still , but we could not discern the form thereof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winged or many-footed , motionless or still , we softly sung ,  --  " Think of me oft at twilight hour , And I will think of thee ; Remembering how we felt its power When thou wast still with me . Dear is that hour , for day then sleeps Upon the gray cloud 's breast ; And not a voice or sound e'er keeps His wearied eyes from rest . " The surface of the lake was unruffled . The air was still . An occasional burst from the band in the garden of Rousseau came softened in the distance . Enveloped in her thick shawl H. reclined in the stern , and gave herself to the influences of the hour . Darkness came down upon the deep . And in the gloom we turned our prows towards the many-twinkling quays , far in the distance . We bent to the oar in emulous contest , and our barks foamed and hissed through the water . In a few moments we were passing through the noisy crowd on the quay towards our quiet home . LETTER XXXII . DEAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to commence at the commencement . Fancy me , on a broiling day in July , panting with the heat , gazing from my window in Geneva upon Lake Leman , which reflects the sun like a burning glass , and thinking whether in America , or any where else , it was ever so hot before . This was quite a new view of the subject to me , who had been warned in Paris only of the necessity of blanket shawls , and had come to Switzerland with my head full of glaciers , and my trunk full of furs . While arranging my travelling preparations , Madame F. enters . " Have you considered how cold it is up there ? " she inquires . " I am glad if it is cold any where , " said I. " Ah , you will find it dreadful ; you will need to be thoroughly guarded . " I suggested tippets , flannels , and furs , of which I already possessed a moderate supply . But no ; these were altogether insufficient . It was necessary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. , and one for myself . I assure you that such preparations , made with the thermometer between eighty and ninety , impress one with a kind of awe . " What regions must they be , " thought I to myself , " thus sealed up in eternal snows , while the country at their feet lies scorching in the very fire ! " A shadow of incredulity mingled itself with my reflections . On the whole , I bought but one fur coat . At this moment C. came up to tell me that W. , S. , and G. had all come back from Italy , so that our party was once more together . It was on the 5th of July that S. and I took our seats in the coupe of the diligence . Now , this coupe is low and narrow enough , so that our condition reminded me slightly of the luckless fowls which I have sometimes seen riding to the Cincinnati market in coupes of about equal convenience . Nevertheless , it might be considered a peaceable and satisfactory style of accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonders of the Alps in such a vehicle is something like contemplating infinity through the nose of a bottle . It was really very tantalizing and provoking to me till C. was so obliging as to resign his seat on top in my favor , and descend into Sheol , as he said . Then I began to live ; for I could see to the summit of the immense walls of rock under which we were passing . By and by we were reminded , by the examination of our passports , that we had entered Sardinia ; and the officers , being duly satisfied that we were not going to Chamouni to levy an army among the glaciers , or raise a sedition among the avalanches , let us pass free . The discretion and wisdom of this passport system can never be sufficiently admired . It must be entirely owing to this , that the Alps do not break out on Europe generally , and tear it in pieces . But the mountains  --  how shall I give you the least idea of them ? Old , sombre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pines , worn and furrowed with storms and avalanches , but not as yet crowned with snow . For many miles after leaving Geneva , the Mole is the principal object ; its blue-black outline veering and shifting , taking on a thousand strange varieties of form as you approach it , others again as you recede . It is a cloudy day ; and heavy volumes of vapor are wreathing and unwreathing themselves around the gaunt forms of the everlasting rocks , like human reasonings , desires , and hopes around the ghastly realities of life and death ; graceful , undulating , and sometimes gleaming out in silver or rosy wreaths . Still , they are nothing but mist ; the dread realities are just where they were before . It is odd , though , to look at these cloud caperings ; quite as interesting , in its way , as to read new systems of transcendental philosophy , and perhaps quite as profitable . Yonder is a great , whiteheaded cloud , slowly unrolling himself in the bosom of a black pine forest . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a bit of gauzy silver , which he is winding round his scraggy neck . And now , here comes a cascade right over our heads ; a cascade , not of water , but of cloud ; for the poor little brook that makes it faints away before it gets down to us ; it falls like a shimmer of moonlight , or a shower of powdered silver , while a tremulous rainbow appears at uncertain intervals , like a half-seen spirit . Illustration : of waterfalls . The cascade here , as in mountains generally , is a never-failing source of life and variety . Water , joyous , buoyant son of Nature , is calling to you , leaping , sparkling , mocking at you between bushes , and singing as he goes down the dells . A thousand little pictures he makes among the rocks as he goes ; like the little sketch which I send you . Then , the bizarre outline of the rocks ; well does Goethe call them " the giant-snouted crags ; " and as the diligence winds slowly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend . Now they close up like a wall in front , now open in piny and cloudy vistas : now they embrace the torrent in their great , black arms ; and now , flashing laughter and babbling defiance through rifted rocks and uprooted pines , the torrent shoots past them , down into some fathomless abyss . These old Alp mothers can not hold their offspring back from abysses any better than poor earth mothers . There are phases in nature which correspond to every phase of human thought and emotion ; and this stern , cloudy scenery answers to the melancholy fatalism of Greek tragedy , or the kindred mournfulness of the Book of Job . These dark channelled rocks , worn , as with eternal tears ,  --  these traces , so evident of ancient and vast desolations ,  --  suggest the idea of boundless power and inexorable will , before whose course the most vehement of human feelings are as the fine spray of the cataract . " For , surely , the mountain , falling , cometh to nought ; The rock is remored out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou washest away the things that grow out of the earth , And thou destroyest the hopes of man ; Thou prevailest against him , and he passeth ; Thou changest his countenance , and sendest him away . " The sceptical inquirer into the mysteries of eternal things might here , if ever , feel the solemn irony of Eliphaz the Temanite :  --  " Should a wise man utter vain knowledge ? Should he reason with unprofitable talk ? Or with speeches that can do no good ? Art thou the first man that ever was born ? Or wast thou made before the hills ? " There are some of my fellow-travellers , by the by , who , if they had been made before the hills , would never have been much wiser . All through these solemn passages and gorges , they are discussing hotels , champagne , wine , and cigars . I presume they would do the same thing at the gates of the Celestial City , if they should accidentally find themselves there . It is one of the dark providences that multitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come among these scenes , while many to whom they would be an inspiration , in whose souls they would unseal ceaseless fountains of beauty , are forever excluded by poverty and care . At noon we stopped at Sallenches , famous for two things ; first , as the spot where people get dinner , and second , where they take the char , a carriage used when the road is too steep for the diligence . Here S. , who had been feeling ill all the morning , became too unwell to proceed , so that we had to lie by an hour or two , and did not go on with the caravan . I sat down at the room window to study and sketch a mountain that rose exactly opposite . I thought to myself , " Now , would it be possible to give to one that had not seen it an idea of how this looks ? " Let me try if words can paint it . Right above the fiat roof of the houses on the opposite side of the street rose this immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulent swell of pasture land , rolling into every imaginable shape ; green billows and dells , rising higher and higher in the air as you looked upward , dyed here and there in bright yellow streaks , by the wild crocus , and spotted over with cattle . Dark clumps and belts of pine now and then rise up among them ; and scattered here and there in the heights , among green hollows , were cottages , that looked about as big as hickory nuts . Above all this region was still another , of black pines and crags ; the pines going up , and up , and up , till they looked no larger than pin feathers ; and surmounting all , straight , castellated turrets of rock , looking out of swathing bands of cloud . A narrow , dazzling line of snow crowned the summit . You see before you three distinct regions  --  of pasture , of pine , of bare , eternal sterility . On inquiring the name of the mountain , I was told that it was the " Aiguille " something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the peaks in this region of the Alps are called Aiguille , ( needle , ) I suppose from the straight , sharp points that rise at their summits . There is a bridge here in Sallenches , from which , in clear weather , one of the best views of Mont Blanc can be obtained  --  so they tell us . To-day it is as much behind the veil , and as absolutely a matter of faith as heaven itself . Looking in that direction you could not believe that there ever had been , or could be , a mountain there . The concealing clouds look as gray , as cool , and as absolutely unconscious of any world of glory behind them as our dull , cold , every-day life does of a heaven , which is , perhaps , equally near us . As we were passing the bridge , however , a gust of icy wind swept down the course of the river , whose chilly breath spoke of glaciers and avalanches . Our driver was one of those merry souls , to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I volunteered to share the outside seat with him , that I might see better , he inquired anxiously if " mademoiselle understood French , " that he might have the pleasure of enlightening her on the localities . Of course mademoiselle could do no less than be exceedingly grateful , since a peasant on his own ground is generally better informed than a philosopher from elsewhere . Our path lay along the banks of the Arve , a raving , brawling , turbulent stream of muddy water . A wide belt of drifted , pebbly land , on either side of it , showed that at times the torrent had a much wider sweep than at present . In fact , my guide informed me that the Arve , like most other mountain streams , had many troublesome and inconvenient personal habits , such as rising up all of a sudden , some night , and whisking off houses , cattle , pine trees ; in short , getting up sailing parties in such a promiscuous manner that it is neither safe nor agreeable to live in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the traces of such Kuhleborn pranks . We were now descending rapidly through the valley of Chamouni , by a winding road , the scenery becoming every moment more and more impressive . The path was so steep and so stony that our guide was well enough contented to have us walk . I was glad to walk on alone ; for the scenery was so wonderful that human sympathy and communion seemed to be out of the question . The effect of such scenery to our generally sleeping and drowsy souls , bound with the double chain of earthliness and sin , is like the electric touch of the angel on Peter , bound and sleeping . They make us realize that we were not only made to commune with God , but also what a God he is with whom we may commune . We talk of poetry , we talk of painting , we go to the ends of the earth to see the artists and great men of this world ; but what a poet , what an artist is God ! Truly said Michael Angelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine perfections  --  a shadow of his pencil . " I was sitting on a mossy trunk of an old pine , looking up admiringly on the wonderful heights around me  --  crystal peaks sparkling over dark pine trees  --  shadowy , airy distances of mountain heights , rising crystalline amid many-colored masses of cloud ; while , looking out over my head from green hollows , I saw the small cottages , so tiny , in their airy distance , that they seemed scarcely bigger than a squirrel 's nut , which he might have dropped in his passage . A pretty Savoyard girl , I should think about fifteen years old , came up to me . " Madame admires the mountains , " she said . I assented . " Yes , " she added , " strangers always admire our mountains . " " And do n't you admire them ? " said I , looking , I suppose , rather amused into her bright eyes . " No , " she said , laughing . " Strangers come from hundreds of miles to see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , no more than the dust of the road . " I could but half believe the bright little puss when she said so ; but there was a lumpish , soggy fellow accompanying her , whose nature appeared to be sufficiently unleavened to make almost any thing credible in the line of stupidity . In fact , it is one of the greatest drawbacks to the pleasure with which one travels through this beautiful country , to see what kind of human beings inhabit it . Here in the Alps , heaven above and earth beneath , tree , rock , water , light and shadow , every form , and agent , and power of nature , seem to be exerting themselves to produce a constant and changing poem and romance ; every thing is grand , noble , free , and yet beautiful : in all these regions there is nothing so repulsive as a human dwelling . A little further on we stopped at a village to refresh the horses . The auberge where we stopped was built like a great barn , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor and ground down , as if they had not a thought above the coarsest animal wants . The dirty children , with their hair tangled beyond all hope of combing , had the begging whine , and the trick of raising their hands for money , when one looked at them , which is universal in the Catholic parts of Switzerland . Indeed , all the way from the Sardinian frontier we had been dogged by beggars continually . Parents seemed to look upon their children as valuable only for this purpose ; the very baby in arms is taught to make a pitiful little whine , and put out its fat hand , if your eye rests on it . The fact is , they are poor  --  poor because invention , enterprise , and intellectual vigor  --  all that surrounds the New England mountain farmer with competence and comfort  --  are quenched and dead , by the combined influence of a religion and government whose interest it is to keep people stupid that they may be manageable . Yet the Savoyards , as a race , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not but hope that the liberal course lately adopted by the Sardinian government may at last reach them . My heart yearns over many of the bright , pretty children , whose little hands have been up , from time to time , around our carriage . I could not help thinking what good schools and good instruction might do for them . It is not their fault , poor little things , that they are educated to whine and beg , and grow up rude , uncultured , to bring forth another set of children just like themselves ; but what to do with them is the question . One generally begins with giving money ; but a day or two of experience shows that it would be just about as hopeful to feed the locusts of Egypt on a loaf of bread . But it is hard to refuse children , especially to a mother who has left five or six at home , and who fancies she sees , in some of these little eager , childish faces , something now and then that reminds her of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could stand them all , except the little toddling three-year olds  --  they fairly overcame me . So I supplied my pocket with a quantity of sugar lozenges , for the relief of my own mind . I usually found the little fellows looked exceedingly delighted when they discovered the nature of the coin . Children are unsophisticated , and like sugar better than silver , any day . In this auberge was a little chamois kid , of which fact we were duly apprised , when we got out , by a board put up , which said , " Here one can see a live chamois . " The little live representative of chamoisdom came skipping out with the most amiable unconsciousness , and went through his paces for our entertainment with as much propriety as a New England child says his catechism . He hopped up on a table after some green leaves , which were then economically used to make him hop down again . The same illusive prospect was used to make him jump over a stick , and perform a number of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper with which he took all this tantalizing , and the innocence with which he chewed his cabbage leaf after he got it , not harboring a single revengeful thought at us for the trouble we had given him . Of course the issue of the matter was , that we all paid a few sous for the sight  --  not to the chamois , which would have been the most equitable way , but to those who had appropriated his gifts and graces to eke out their own convenience . " Where 's his mother ? " said I , desiring to enlarge my sphere of natural history as much as possible . " On a tue sa mere "  --  " They have killed his mother , " was the reply , cool enough . There we had the whole story . His enterprising neighbors had invaded the domestic hearth , shot his mother , and eaten her up , made her skin into chamois leather , and were keeping him till he got big enough for the same disposition , using his talents meanwhile to turn a penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ; not a bit the less heartily did he caper ; never speculated a minute on why it was , on the origin of evil , or any thing of the sort ; or , if he did , at least never said a word about it . I gave one good look into his soft , round , glassy eyes , and could see nothing there but the most tranquil contentment . He had finished his cabbage leaf , and we had finished our call ; so we will go on . It was now drawing towards evening , and the air began to be sensibly and piercingly cold . One effect of this mountain air on myself is , to bring on the most acute headache that I ever recollect to have felt . Still , the increasing glory and magnificence of the scenery overcame bodily fatigue . Mont Blanc , and his army of white-robed brethren , rose before us in the distance , glorious as the four and twenty elders around the great white throne . The wonderful gradations of coloring in this Alpine landscape are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I describe it ? Imagine yourself standing with me on this projecting rock , overlooking a deep , piny gorge , through which flow the brawling waters of the Arve . On the other side of this rise mountains whose heaving swells of velvet green , cliffs and dark pines , are fully made out and colored ; behind this mountain , rises another , whose greens are softened and shaded , and seem to be seen through a purplish veil ; behind that rises another , of a decided cloud-like purple ; and in the next still the purple tint changes to rosy lilac ; while above all , like another world up in the sky , mingling its tints with the passing clouds , sometimes obscured by them , and then breaking out between them , lie the glacier regions . These glaciers , in the setting sun , look like rivers of light pouring down from the clouds . Such was the scene , which I remember with perfect distinctness as enchaining my attention on one point of the road . We had now got up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , lying in the lap of the green valley , a gigantic pile of icy pillars , which , seen through the trees , at first suggested the idea of a cascade . " What is that ? " said I to the guide . " The Glacier de Boisson . " I may as well stop here , and explain to you , once for all , what a glacier is . You see before you , as in this case , say thirty or forty mountain peaks , and between these peaks what seem to you frozen rivers . The snow from time to time melting , and dripping down the sides of the mountain , and congealing in the elevated hollows between the peaks , forms a half-fluid mass  --  a river of ice  --  which is called a glacier . As it lies upon the slanting surface , and is not entirely solid throughout , the whole mass is continually pushing , with a gradual but imperceptible motion , down into the valleys below . At a distance these glaciers , as I have said before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or where they press downward into the valley , like this Glacier de Boisson , they look like immense crystals and pillars of ice piled together in every conceivable form . The effect of this pile of ice , lying directly in the lap of green grass and flowers , is quite singular . The village of Chamouni itself has nothing in particular to recommend it . The buildings and every thing about it have a rough , coarse appearance . Before we had entered the valley this evening the sun had gone down ; the sky behind the mountains was clear , and it seemed for a few moments as if darkness was rapidly coming on . On our right hand were black , jagged , furrowed walls of mountain , and on our left Mont Blanc , with his fields of glaciers and worlds of snow ; they seemed to hem us in , and almost press us down . But in a few moments commenced a scene of transfiguration , more glorious than any thing I had witnessed yet . The cold , white , dismal fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose color . A bank of white clouds , which rested above the mountains , kindled and glowed , as if some spirit of light had entered into them . You did not lose your idea of the dazzling , spiritual whiteness of the snow , yet you seemed to see it through a rosy veil . The sharp edges of the glaciers , and the hollows between the peaks , reflected wavering tints of lilac and purple . The effect was solemn and spiritual above every thing I have ever seen . These words , which had been often in my mind through the day , and which occurred to me more often than any others while I was travelling through the Alps , came into my mind with a pomp and magnificence of meaning unknown before  --  " For by Him were all things created in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers ; all things are by him and for him ; and he is before all things , and by him all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that cold , distant , unfeeling fate , or that crushing regularity of power and wisdom , which was all the ancient Greek or modern Deist can behold in God ; but I beheld , as it were , crowned and glorified , one who had loved with our loves , and suffered with our sufferings . Those shining snows were as his garments on the Mount of Transfiguration , and that serene and ineffable atmosphere of tenderness and beauty , which seemed to change these dreary deserts into worlds of heavenly light , was to me an image of the light shed by his eternal love on the sins and sorrows of time , and the dread abyss of eternity . LETTER XXXIII . MY DEAR :  --  Well , I waked up this morning , and the first thought was , " Here I am in the valley of Chamouni , right under the shadow of Mont Blanc , that I have studied about in childhood and found on the atlas . " I sprang up , and ran to the window , to see if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , true enough , there it was ! right over our heads , as it were , blocking up our very existence ; filling our minds with its presence ; that colossal pyramid of dazzling snow ! Its lower parts concealed by the roofs , only the three rounded domes of the summit cut their forms with icy distinctness on the intense blue of the sky ! On the evening before I had taken my last look at about nine o'clock , and had mentally resolved to go out before daybreak and repeat Coleridge 's celebrated hymn ; but I advise any one who has any such liturgic designs to execute them over night , for after a day of climbing one acquires an aptitude for sleep that interferes with early rising . When I left last evening its countenance was " filled with rosy light , " and they tell us , that hours before it is daylight in the valley this mountain top breaks into brightness , like that pillar of fire which enlightened the darkness of the Israelites . I rejoice every hour that I am among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In it alone can I find vocabulary and images to express what this world of wonders excites . Mechanically I repeat to myself , " The everlasting mountains were scattered ; the perpetual hills did bow ; his ways are everlasting . " But as straws , chips , and seaweed play in a thousand fantastic figures on the face of the ocean , sometimes even concealing the solemn depths beneath , so the prose of daily existence mixes itself up with the solemn poetry of life , here as elsewhere . You must have a breakfast , and then you can not rush out and up Mont Blanc ad libitum ; you must go up in the regular appointed way , with mule and guides . This matter of guides is perfectly systematized here ; for , the mountains being the great overpowering fact of life , it follows that all that enterprise and talent which in other places develop themselves in various forms , here take the single channel of climbing mountains . In America , if a man is a genius he strikes out a new way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a genius he finds a new way of going up Mont Blanc . As a sailor knows every timber , rope , and spar of his ship , and seems to identify his existence with her , so these guides their mountains . The mountains are their calendar , their book , their newspaper , their cabinet , herbarium , barometer , their education , and their livelihood . In fine , behold us about eight o'clock , C. , S. , W. , little G. , and self , in all the bustle of fitting out in the front of our hotel . Two guides , Balmat and Alexandre , lead two mules , long-eared , slow-footed , considerate brutes , who have borne a thousand ladies over a thousand pokerish places , and are ready to bear a thousand more . Equipped with low-backed saddles , they stand , their noses down , their eyes contemplatively closed , their whole appearance impressing one with an air of practical talent and reliableness . Your mule is evidently safe and stupid as any conservative of any country ; you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas will ever lead him to desert the good old paths , and tumble you down precipices . The harness they wear is so exceedingly ancient , and has such a dilapidated appearance , as if held together only by the merest accident , that I could not but express a little alarm on mounting . " Those girths  --  wo n't they break ? " " O , no , no , mademoiselle ! " said the guides . In fact , they seem so delighted with their arrangements , that I swallow my doubts in silence . A third mule being added for the joint use of the gentlemen , and all being equipped with iron-pointed poles , off we start in high spirits . A glorious day ; air clear as crystal , sky with as fixed a blue as if it could not think a cloud ; guides congratulate us , " Qu'il fait tres beau ! " We pass the lanes of the village , our heads almost on a level with the flat stone-laden roofs ; our mules , with their long rolling pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their riders a facetious wag of the body that is quite striking . Now the village is passed , and see , a road banded with green ribands of turf . S. 's mule and guide pass on , and head the party . G. rides another mule . C. and W. leap along trying their alpenstocks ; stopping once in a while to admire the glaciers , as their brilliant forms appear through the pines . Here a discussion commences as to where we are going . We had agreed among ourselves that we would visit the Mer de Glace . We fully meant to go there , and had so told the guide on starting ; but it appears he had other views for us . There is a regular way of seeing things , orthodox and appointed ; and to get sight of any thing in the wrong way would be as bad as to get well without a scientific physician , or any other irregular piece of proceeding . It appeared from the representations of the guide that to visit Mer de Glace before we had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry Rachel before he had married Leah . Determined not to yield , as we were , we somehow found ourselves vanquished by our guide 's arguments , and soberly going off his way instead of ours , doing exactly what we had resolved not to do . However , the point being yielded we proceeded merrily . As we had some way , however , to trot along the valley before we came to the ascending place , I improved the opportunity to cultivate a little the acquaintance of my guide . He was a tall , spare man , with black eyes , black hair , and features expressive of shrewdness , energy , and determination . Either from paralysis , or some other cause , he was subject to a spasmodic twitching of the features , producing very much the effect that heat lightning does in the summer sky  --  it seemed to flash over his face and be gone in a wink ; at first this looked to me very odd , but so much do our ideas depend on association , that after I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked him better with , than I should without it . It seemed to give originality to the expression of his face ; he was such a good , fatherly man , and took such excellent care of me and the mule , and showed so much intelligence and dignity in his conversation , that I could do no less than like him , heat lightning and all . This valley of Chamouni , through which we are winding now , is every where as flat as a parlor floor . These valleys in the Alps seem to have this peculiarity  --  they are not hollows , bending downward in the middle , and imperceptibly sloping upward into the mountains , but they lie perfectly flat . The mountains rise up around them like walls almost perpendicularly . " Voila ! " says my guide , pointing to the left , to a great , bare ravine , " down there came an avalanche , and knocked down those houses and killed several people . " " Ah ! " said I ; " but do n't avalanches generally come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do . " " Why do people build houses in the way of them ? " said I. " Ah ! this was an unusual avalanche , this one here . " " Do the avalanches ever bring rocks with them ? " " No , not often ; nothing but snow . " " There ! " says my guide , pointing to an object about as big as a good-sized fly , on the side of a distant mountain , " there 's the auberge , on La Flegere , where we are going . " " Up there ? " say I , looking up apprehensively , and querying in my mind how my estimable friend the mule is ever to get up there with me on his back . " O yes , " says my guide , cheerily , " and the road is up through that ravine . " The ravine is a charming specimen of a road to be sure , but no matter  --  on we go . " There , " says a guide , " those black rocks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grands Mulets , where travellers sleep going up Mont Blanc . " We wind now among the pine tree still we come almost under the Mer de Glace . A most fairy-like cascade falls down from under its pillars of ice over the dark rocks ,  --  a cloud of feathery foam ,  --  and then streams into the valley below . " Voila , L'Arveiron ! " says the guide . " O , is that the Arveiron ? " say I ; " happy to make the acquaintance . " But now we cross the Arve into a grove of pines , and direct our way to the ascent . We begin to thread a zigzag path on the sides of the mountain . As mules are most determined followers of precedent , every one keeps his nose close by the heels of his predecessor . The delicate point , therefore , of the whole operation is keeping the first mule straight . The first mule in our party , who rejoiced in the name of Rousse , was selected to head the caravan , perhaps because he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better fitted to lead than to follow . A troublesome beast was he , from a habit of abstract meditation which was always liable to come on him in most inconvenient localities . Every now and then , simply in accordance with his own sovereign will and pleasure , and without consulting those behind him , he would stop short and descend into himself in gloomy revery , not that he seemed to have any thing in particular on his mind ,  --  at least nothing of the sort escaped his lips ,  --  but the idea would seem to strike him all of a sudden that he was an ill-used beast , and that he 'd be hanged if he went another step . Now , as his stopping stopped all the rest , wheresoever they might happen to be , it often occurred that we were detained in most critical localities , just on the very verge of some tremendous precipice , or up a rocky stairway . In vain did the foremost driver admonish him by thumping his nose with a sharp stick , and tugging and pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those long , India rubber necks that can stretch out indefinitely , so that the utmost pulling and jerking only took his head along a little farther , but left his heels planted exactly here they were before , somewhat after this fashion . His eyes , meanwhile , devoutly closed , with an air of meekness overspreading his visage , he might have stood as an emblem of conscientious obstinacy . Illustration : of two men trying to force forward a stubborn mule with a female rider . The fact is , that in ascending these mountains there is just enough danger to make one 's nerves a little unsteady ; not by any means as much as on board a rail car at home ; still it comes to you in a more demonstrable form . Here you are , for instance , on a precipice two thousand feet deep ; pine trees , which , when you passed them at the foot you saw were a hundred feet high , have dwindled to the size of pins . No barrier of any kind protects the dizzy edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very verge , no matter how wide the path may be . Now , under such circumstances , though your guide assures you that an accident or a person killed is a thing unknown , you can not help seeing that if the saddle should turn , or the girths break , or a bit of the crumbling edge cave away  --  all which things appear quite possible  --  all would be over with you . Yet I suppose we are no more really dependent upon God 's providence in such circumstances , than in many cases where we think ourselves most secure . Still the thrill of this sensation is not without its pleasure , especially with such an image of almighty power and glory constantly before one 's eyes as Mont Blanc . Our own littleness and helplessness , in view of these vast objects which surround us , give a strong and pathetic force to the words , " The eternal God is thy refuge , and underneath thee are the everlasting arms . " I like best these snow-pure glaciers seen through these black pines ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and see not the earthly base on which they rest . I recollect the same fact in seeing the Cataract of Niagara through trees , where merely the dizzying fall of water was visible , with its foam , and spray , and rainbows ; it produced an idea of something supernatural . I forgot to say that at the foot of the mountain a party of girls started to ascend with us , carrying along bottles of milk and small saucers full of mountain strawberries . About half way up the ascent we halted by a spring of water which gushed from the side of the mountain , and there we found the advantage of these arrangements . The milk is very nice , almost as rich as cream . I think they told me it was goat 's milk . The strawberries are very small indeed , like our field strawberries , but not as good . One devours them with great relish , simply because the keen air of the mountain disposes one to eat something , and there is nothing better to be had . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore the flat , Swiss hat , and carried their knitting work along with them , and knit whenever they could . When you asked them the price of their wares they always said , " Au plaisir " i. e. , whatever you please ; but when we came to offer them money , we found " au plaisir " meant so much at any rate , and as much more as they could get . There were some children who straggled up with the party , who offered us flowers and crystals " au plaisir " to about the same intent and purpose . This cortege of people , wanting to sell you something , accompanies you every where in the Alps . The guides generally look upon it with complacency , and in a quiet way favor it . I suppose that the fact was , these were neighbors and acquaintances , and the mutual understanding was , that they should help each other . It was about twelve o'clock , when we gained a bare board shanty as near the top of La Flegere as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraging reflection that one should travel three or four hours to get to such a desolate place as these mountain tops generally are ; nothing but grass , rocks , and snow ; a shanty , with a show case full of minerals , articles of carved wood , and engravings of the place for sale . In these show cases the Alps are brought to market as thoroughly as human ingenuity can do the thing . The chamois figures largely ; there are pouches made of chamois skin , walking sticks and alpenstocks tipped with chamois horn ; sometimes an entire skin , horns and all , hanging disconsolately downward . Then all manner of crystals , such as are found in the rocks , are served up  --  agate pins , rings , seals , bracelets , cups , and snuffboxes  --  all which are duly urged on your attention ; so , instead of falling into a rapture at the sight of Mont Blanc , the regular routine for a Yankee is to begin a bargain for a walking stick or a snuffbox . There is another curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being made definite . As long as we only see a thing by glimpses , and imagine that there is a deal more that we do not see , the mind is kept in a constant excitement and play ; but come to a point where you can fairly and squarely take in the whole , and there your mind falls listless . It is the greatest proof to me of the infinite nature of our minds , that we almost instantly undervalue what we have thoroughly attained . This sensation afflicted me , for I had been reining in my enthusiasm for two days , as rather premature , and keeping myself in reserve for this ultimate display . But now I stood there , no longer seeing by glimpses , no longer catching rapturous intimations as I turned angles of rock , or glanced through windows of pine  --  here it was , all spread out before me like a map , not a cloud , not a shadow to soften the outline  --  there was Mont Blanc , a great alabaster pyramid , with a glacier running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was the Arveiron , names most magical in song , but now literal geographic realities . But in full possession of the whole my mind gave out like a rocket that will not go off at the critical moment . I remember , once after finishing a very circumstantial treatise on the nature of heaven , being oppressed with a similar sensation of satiety ,  --  that which hath not entered the heart of man to conceive must not be mapped out ,  - -  hence the wisdom of the dim , indefinite imagery of the Scriptures ; they give you no hard outline , no definite limit ; occasionally they part as do the clouds around these mountains , giving you flashes and gleams of something supernatural and splendid , but never fully unveiling . But La Flegerc is doubtless the best point for getting a statistically accurate idea of how the Alps lie , of any easily accessible to ladies . This print you may regard more as a chart than as a picture . Our guide pointed out every feature with praiseworthy accuracy . Midmost is Mont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two or three little black peaks ' in it are the sleeping-place for travellers ascending  --  the zigzag line shows their path . On the left of the mountain lies Mer de Glace , with the Arveiron falling from it . The Arve crosses the valley below us ; the fall is not indicated in this view . The undulations , which , on near view , are fifty feet high , seem mere ripples . Its purity is much soiled by the dust and debris which are constantly blown upon it , making it look in some places more like mud than ice . Its soiled masses contrast with the dazzling whiteness of the upper regions , just as human virtue exposed to the wind and dust of earth , with the spotless purity of Jesus .

These mulets , which at this distance appear like black points , are needle cliffs rising in a desert of snow , thus  --  Illustration : of narrow jagged dark rocks about 70 feet across at the base and rising to about 80 feet from the base . Coming down I mentally compared Mont Blanc and Niagara , as one should compare two grand pictures in different styles of the same master . Both are of that class of things which mark eras in a mind 's history , and open a new door which no man can shut . Of the two , I think Niagara is the most impressive , perhaps because those aerial elements of foam and spray give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sublime . For this reason , while Niagara is equally impressive in the distance , it does not lose on the nearest approach  --  it is always mysterious , and , therefore , stimulating . Those varying spray wreaths , rising like Ossian 's ghosts from its abyss ; those shimmering rainbows , through whose veil you look ; those dizzying falls of water that seem like clouds poured from the hollow of God 's hand ; and that mystic undertone of sound that seems to pervade the whole being as the voice of the Almighty ,  --  all these bewilder and enchant the discriminative and prosaic part of us , and bring us into that cloudy region of ecstasy where the soul comes nearest to Him whom no eye hath seen , or can see . I have sometimes asked myself if , in the countless ages of the future , the heirs of God shall ever be endowed by him with a creative power , by which they shall bring into being things like these ? In this infancy of his existence , man creates pictures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler over many things , " will his Father intrust to him the building and adorning of worlds ? the ruling of the glorious , dazzling forces of nature ? At the foot of the mountain we found again our company of strawberry girls , with knitting work and goat 's milk , lying in wait for us . They knew we should be thirsty and hungry , and wisely turned the circumstance to account . Some of our party would not buy of them , because they said they were sharpers , trying to get all they could out of people ; but if every body who tries to do this is to be called a sharper , what is to become of respectable society , I wonder ? On the strength of this reflection , I bought some more goat 's milk and strawberries , and verily found them excellent ; for , as Shakspeare says , " How many things by season seasoned are . " We returned to our hotel , and after dining and taking a long nap , I began to feel fresh once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that one is able to do twice as much as any where else . S. was too much overcome to go with us , but the rest of us started with our guides once more at five o'clock . This time we were to visit the Cascade des Pelerins , which comes next on the orthodox list of places to be seen . It was a lovely afternoon ; the sun had got over the Mont Blanc side of the world , and threw the broad , cool shadow of the mountains quite across the valley . What a curious kind of thing shadow is ,  --  that invisible veil , falling so evenly and so lightly over all things , bringing with it such thoughts of calmness , of coolness , and of rest . I wonder the old Greeks did not build temples to Shadow , and call her the sister of Thought and Peace . The Hebrew writers speak of the " overshadowing of the Almighty ; " they call his protection " the shadow of a great rock in a weary land . " Even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this valley , so falls the sense of his presence across our weary life-road ! As we rode along under the sides of the mountain every thing seemed so beautiful , so thoughtful , and so calm ! All the goats and cows were in motion along the mountain paths , each one tinkling his little bell and filling the rocks with gentle melodies . You can trace the lines of these cattle paths , running like threads all along the sides of the mountains . We went in the same road that we had gone in the morning . How different it seemed , in the soberness of this afternoon light , from its aspect under the clear , crisp , sharp light of morning ! We pass again through the pine woods in the valley , and cross the Arve ; then up the mountain side to where a tiny cascade throws up its feathery spray in a brilliant jet d'eau . Every body knows , even in our sober New England , that mountain brooks are a frisky , indiscreet set , rattling , chattering , and capering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipices , and picking themselves up at the bottom , no whit wiser or more disposed to be tranquil than they were at the top ; in fact , seeming to grow more mad and frolicsome with every leap . Well , that is just the way brooks do here in the Alps , and the people , taking advantage of it , have built a little shanty , where they show up the capers of this child of the mountain , as if he tumbled for their special profit . Here , of course , in the shanty are the agates , and the carved work , and so forth , and so on , and you must buy something for a souvenir . I sat down on the rocks to take , not a sketch ,  --  for who can sketch a mountain torrent ?  --  but to note down on paper a kind of diagram , from which afterwards I might reconstruct an image of this feathery , frisky son of Kuhleborn . And while I was doing this , little G. seemed to be possessed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a series of leaps far safer for a waterfall than a boy . I was thankful when I saw him safely at the bottom . After sketching a little while , I rambled off to a point where I looked over towards Mont Blanc , and got a most beautiful view of the Glacier de Boisson . Imagine the sky flushed with a rosy light , a background of purple mountains , with darts of sunlight streaming among them , touching point and cliff with gold . Against this background rises the outline of the glacier like a mountain of the clearest white crystals , tinged with blue ; and against their snowy whiteness in the foreground tall forms of pines . I rejoiced in the picture with exceeding joy as long as the guide would let me ; but in all these places you have to cut short your raptures at the proper season , or else what becomes of your supper ? I went back to the cottage . A rosy-cheeked girl had held our mules , and set a chair for us to get off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messieurs " to the bearers of our purse . Half a dozen children had been waiting with the rose des Alps , which they wanted to sell us " au plaisir " but which we did not buy . These continual demands on the purse look very alarming , only the coin you pay in is of such infinitesimal value that it takes about a pocket full to make a cent . Such a currency is always a sign of poverty . We had a charming ride down the mountain side , in the glow of the twilight . We passed through a whole flock of goats which the children were driving home . One dear little sturdy Savoyard looked so like a certain little Charley at home that I felt quite a going forth of soul to him . As we rode on , I thought I would willingly live and die in such a place ; but I shall see a hundred such before we leave the Alps . JOURNAL  --  ( CONTINUED . ) Thursday , July 7 . Weather still celestial , as yesterday . But lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at breakfast that all the " tired " of yesterday was piled up into to-day . And S. actually pleaded inability , and determined to remain at the hotel . However , the Mer de Glace must be seen ; so , at seven William , Georgy , H. , and I , set off . When about half way or more up the mountain we crossed the track of the avalanches , a strip or trail , which looks from beneath like a mower 's swath through a field of tall grass . It is a clean path , about fifty rods wide , without trees , with few rocks , smooth and steep , and with a bottom of ice covered with gravel . " Hurrah , William , " said I , " let 's have an avalanche ! " " Agreed , " said he ; " there 's a big rock . " " Monsieur le Guide , Monsieur le Guide ! " I shouted , " stop a moment . H. , stop ; we want you to see our avalanche . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here you ask me to stop , right on the edge of this precipice , to see you roll down a stone ! " So , on she ambled . Meanwhile William and I were already on foot , and our mules were led on by the guide 's daughter , a pretty little lass of ten or twelve , who accompanied us in the capacity of mule driver . We found several stones of inferior size , and sent them plunging down . At last , however , we found one that weighed some two tons , which happened to lie so that , by loosening the earth before and under it with our alpenstocks , we were able to dislodge it . Slowly , reluctantly , as if conscious of the awful race it was about to take , the huge mass trembled , slid , poised , and , with a crunch and a groan , went over . At the first plunge it acquired a heavy revolving motion , and was soon whirling and dashing down , bounding into the air with prodigious leaps , and cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then first I began to realize the awful height at which we stood above the plain . Tracts , which looked as though we could almost step across them , were reached by this terrible stone , moving with frightful velocity ; and bound after bound , plunge after plunge it made , and we held our breath to see each tract lengthen out , as if seconds grew into minutes , inches into rods ; and still the mass moved on , and the microscopic way lengthened out , till at last a curve hid its further progress from our view . What other cliffs we might have toppled over the muse refuses to tell ; for our faithful guide returned to say that it was not quite safe ; that there were always shepherds and flocks in the valley , and that they might be injured . So we remounted , and soon overtook H. at a fountain , sketching a pine tree of special physiognomy . " Ah , " said I , " H. , how foolish you were ! You do n't know what a sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , " all C. thinks mountains are made for is to roll stones down . " " And all H. thinks trees made for , " said I , " is to have ugly pictures made of them . " " Ay , " she replied , " you wanted me to stand on the very verge of the precipice , and see two foolish boys roll down stones , and perhaps make an avalanche of themselves ! Now , you know , C. , I could not spare you ; first , because I have not learned French enough yet ; and next , because I do n't know how to make change . " " Add to that , " said I , " the damages to the bergers and flocks . " " Yes , " she added ; " no doubt when we get back to the inn we shall have a bill sent in , ' H. B. S. to A. B. , Dr. , to one shepherd and six cows ,  --  fr . ' " And so we chatted along until we reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , descended into the frozen sea . Here a scene opened upon us never to be forgotten . From the distant gorge of the everlasting Alpine ranges issued forth an ocean tide , in wild and dashing commotion , just as we have seen the waves upon the broad Atlantic , but all motionless as chaos when smitten by the mace of Death ; and yet , not motionless ! This denser medium , this motionless mass , is never at rest . This flood moves as it seems to move ; these waves are actually uplifting out of the abyss as they seem to lift ; the only difference is in the time of motion , the rate of change . These prodigious blocks of granite , thirty or forty feet long and twenty feet thick , which float on this grim sea of ice , do float , and are drifting , drifting down to the valley below , where , in a few days , they must arrive . We walked these valleys , ascended these hills , leaped across chasms , threw stones down the crevasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and philosophized and poetized till we were tired . Then we returned to the auberge , and rode down the zigzag to our hotel . LETTER XXXIV . MY DEAR :  --  The Mer de Glace is exactly opposite to La Flegere , where we were yesterday , and is reached by the ascent of what is called Montanvert , or Green Mountain . The path is much worse than the other , and in some places makes one 's nerves twinge , especially that from which C. projected his avalanche . Just think of his wanting to stop me on the edge of a little shelf over that frightful chasm , and take away the guide from the head of my mule to help him get up avalanches ! I warn you , if ever you visit the Alps , that a travelling companion who has not the slightest idea what fear is will give you many a commotion . For instance , this Mer de Glace is traversed every where by crevasses in the ice , which go to  --  nobody knows where , down into the under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and C. must needs jump across them , and climb down into them , to the mingled delight and apprehension of the guide , who , after conscientiously shouting out a reproof , would say to me , in a lower tone , " Ah , he 's the man to climb Mont Blanc ; he would do well for that ! " The fact is , nothing would suit our guides better , this clear , bright weather , than to make up a party for the top of Mont Blanc . They look longingly and lovingly up to its clear , white fields ; they show us the stages and resting-places , and seem really to think that it is a waste of this beautiful weather not to be putting it to that most sublime purpose . Why , then , do not we go up ? you say . As to us ladies , it is a thing that has been done by only two women since the world stood , and those very different in their physique from any we are likely to raise in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two were a peasant woman of Chamouni , called Marie de Mont Blanc , and Mademoiselle Henriette d'Angeville , a lady whose acquaintance I made in Geneva . Then , as to the gentlemen , it is a serious consideration , in the first place , that the affair costs about one hundred and fifty dollars apiece , takes two days of time , uses up a week 's strength , all to get an experience of some very disagreeable sensations , which could not afflict a man in any other case . It is no wonder , then , that gentlemen look up to the mountain , lay their hands on their pockets , and say , No . Our guide , by the way , is the son , or grandson , of the very first man that ascended Mont Blanc , and of course feels a sort of hereditary property and pride in it . C. spoke about throwing our poles down the pools of water in the ice . There is something rather curious about these pools . Our guide saw us measuring the depth of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored only by the refraction of the light . He took our long alpenstock , and poising it , sent it down into the water , as a man might throw a javelin . It disappeared , but in a few seconds leaped up at us out of the water , as if thrown back again by an invisible hand . A poet would say that a water spirit hurled it back ; perhaps some old under-ground gnome , just going to dinner , had his windows smashed by it , and sent it back with a becoming spirit , as a gnome should . It was a sultry day , and the sun was exercising his power over the whole ice field . I sat down by a great ice block , about fifty feet long , to interrogate it , and see what I could make of it , by a cool , confidential proximity and examination . The ice was porous and spongy , as I have seen it on the shores of the Connecticut , when beginning to thaw out under the influence of a spring sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thousand tiny streams through it , and dropping down on every side . Putting my ear to it , I could hear a fine musical trill and trickle , and that still small click and stir , as of melting ice , which showed that it was surely and gradually giving way , and flowing back again . Drop by drop the cold iceberg was changing into a stream , to flow down the sides of the valley , no longer an image of coldness and death , but bearing fertility and beauty on its tide . And as I looked abroad over all the rifted field of ice , I could see that the same change was gradually going on throughout . In every blue ravine you can hear the clink of dropping water , and those great defiant blocks of ice , which seem frozen with uplifted warlike hands , are all softening in that beneficent light , and destined to pass away in that benignant change . So let us hope that those institutions of pride and cruelty , which are colder than the glacier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may yet , like that , be slowly and surely passing away . Like the silent warfare of the sun on the glacier , is that overshadowing presence of Jesus , whose power , so still , yet so resistless , is now being felt through all the moving earth . Those defiant waves of death-cold ice might as well hope to conquer the calm , silent sun , as the old , frozen institutions of human selfishness to resist the influence which he is now breathing through the human heart , to liberate the captive , to free the slave , and to turn the ice of long winters into rivers of life for the new heaven and the new earth . All this we know is coming , but we long to see it now , and breathe forth our desires with the Hebrew prophet , " O that thou wouldst rend the heavens , that thou wouldst come down , that the mountains might flow down at thy presence . " I had , while upon this field of ice , that strange feeling which often comes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sublime , of wanting , in some way , to appropriate and make it a part of myself . I looked up the gorge , and saw this frozen river , lying cradled , as it were , in the arms of needle-peaked giants of amethystine rock , their tops laced with flying silvery clouds . The whole air seemed to be surcharged with tints , ranging between the palest rose and the deepest violet  --  tints never without blue , and never without red , but varying in the degrees of the two . It is this prismatic hue diffused over every object which gives one of the most noticeable characteristics of the Alpine landscape . This sea of ice lies on an inclined plane , and all the blocks have a general downward curve . I told you yesterday that the lower part of the glacier , as seen from La Flegere , appeared covered with dirt . I saw to-day the reason for this . Although it was a sultry day in July , yet around the glacier a continual high wind was blowing , whirling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great masses of ice were so completely coated with sand as to appear at a distance like granite rocks . The effect of some of these immense brown masses was very peculiar . They seemed like an army of giants , bending forward , driven , as by an invisible power , down into the valley . It reminds one of such expressions as these in Job :  --  " Have the gates of death been open to thee , or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death ? " One should read that sublime poem in such scenes as these . I remained on the ice as long as I could persuade the guides and party to remain . Then we went back to the house , where , of course , we looked at some wood work , agates , and all the et cetera . Then we turned our steps downward . We went along the side of the glacier , and I desired to climb over as near as possible , in order to see the source of the Arveiron , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cradle is a ribbed and rocky cavern of blue ice , and like a creature born full of vigor and immortality , it begins life with an impetuous leap . The cold arms of the glaciers can not retain it ; it must go to the warm , flowery , velvet meadows below . The guide was quite anxious about me ; he seemed to consider a lady as something that must necessarily break in two , or come apart , like a German doll , if not managed with extremest care ; and therefore to see one bounding through bushes , leaping , and springing , and climbing over rocks at such a rate , appeared to him the height of desperation . The good , faithful soul wanted to keep me within orthodox limits , and felt conscientiously bound to follow me wherever I went , and to offer me his hand at every turn . I considered , on the whole , that I ought not to blame him , since guides hold themselves responsible for life and limb ; and any accident to those under their charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I held some conversation with him on matters and things in general , and life in Chamouni in particular . He inquired with great interest about America ; which , throughout Europe , I find the working classes regard as a kind of star in the west , portending something of good to themselves . He had a son , he said , settled in America , near St. Louis . " And do n't you want to go to America ? " said I , after hearing him praise the good land . " Ah , no , " he said , with a smile . " Why not ? " said I ; " it is a much easier country to live in . " He gave a look at the circle of mountains around , and said , " I love Chamouni . " The good soul ! I was much of his opinion . If I had been born within sight of glorious Mont Blanc , with its apocalyptic clouds , and store of visions , not all the fat pork and flat prairies of Indiana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their native valleys ! I would if I were they . I asked him about education . He said his children went to a school kept by Catholic sisters , who taught reading , writing , and Latin . The dialect of Chamouni is a patois , composed of French and Latin . He said that provision was very scarce in the winter . I asked how they made their living when there were no travellers to be guided up Mont Blanc . He had a trade at which he wrought in winter months , and his wife did tailoring . I must not forget to say that the day before there had been some confidential passages between us , which began by his expressing , interrogatively , the opinion that " mademoiselle was a young lady , he supposed . " When mademoiselle had assured him , on the contrary , that she was a venerable matron , mother of a thriving family , then followed a little comparison of notes as to numbers . Madame he ascertained to have six , and he had four , if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters of figures . So you see it is not merely among us New Englanders that the unsophisticated spirit of curiosity exists as to one 's neighbors . Indeed , I take it to be a wholesome development of human nature in general . For my part , I could not think highly of any body who could be brought long into connection with another human being and feel no interest to inquire into his history and surroundings . As we stopped , going down the descent , to rest the mules , I looked up above my head into the crags , and saw a flock of goats browsing . One goat , in particular , I remember , had gained the top of a kind of table rock , which stood apart from the rest , and which was carpeted with lichens and green moss . There he stood , looking as unconscious and contemplative as possible , the wicked fellow , with his long beard ! He knew he looked picturesque , and that is what he stood there for . But , as they say in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictur ! " By the by , the girls with strawberries , milk , and knitting work were on hand on the way down , and met us just where a cool spring gushed out at the roots of a pine tree ; and of course I bought some more milk and strawberries . How dreadfully hot it was when we got down to the bottom ! for there we had the long , shadeless ride home , with the burning lenses of the glaciers concentrated upon our defenceless heads . I was past admiring any thing , and glad enough for the shelter of a roof , and a place to lie down . After dinner , although the Glacier de Boisson had been spoken of as the appointed work for the afternoon , yet we discovered , as the psalm book says , that " The force of nature could no farther go " Illustration : of an ice climbing party scaling a large serac . What is Glacier de Boisson , or glacier any thing else , to a person used up entirely , with no sense or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ; the Glacier de Boisson was given up , and I am sorry for it now , because it is the commencement of the road up Mont Blanc ; and , though I could not go to the top thereof , I should like to have gone as far as I could . In fact , I should have been glad to sleep one night at the Grands Mulets : however , that was impossible . To look at the apparently smooth surface of the mountain side , one would never think that the ascent could be a work of such difficulty and danger . Yet , look at the picture of crossing a crevasse , and compare the size of the figures with the dimensions of the blocks of ice . Madame d'Angeville told me that she was drawn across a crevasse like this , by ropes tied under her arms , by the guides . The depth of some of the crevasses may be conjectured from the fact stated by Agassiz , that the thickest parts of the glaciers are over one thousand feet in depth . JOURNAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamouni to Martigny , by Tete Noir . Mules en avant . We set off in a caleche . After a two hours ' ride we came to " those mules . " On , to the pass of Tete Noir , by paths the most awful . As my mule trod within six inches of the verge , I looked down into an abyss , so deep that tallest pines looked like twigs ; yet , on the opposite side of the pass , I looked up the steep precipice to an equal height , where giant trees seemed white fluttering fringe . A dizzy sight . We swept round an angle , entered a dark tunnel blasted out through the solid rock , emerged , and saw before us , on our right , the far-famed Tete Noir , a black ledge , on whose face , so high is the opposite cliff , the sun never shines . A few steps brought us to a hotel . William and I rolled down some avalanches , by way of getting an appetite , while dinner was preparing . Illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule . After dinner we commenced descending towards Martigny , alternately riding and walking . Here , while I was on foot , my mule took it into his head to run away . I was never more surprised in my life than to see that staid , solemn , meditative , melancholy beast suddenly perk up both his long ears , thus , and hop about over the steep paths like a goat . Not more surprised should I be to see some venerable D. D. of Princeton leading off a dance in the Jardin Mabille . We chased him here , and chased him there . We headed him , and he headed us . We said , " Now I have you , " and he said , " No , you do n't ! " until the affair began to grow comically serious . " Il se moque de vous ! " said the guide . But , at that moment , I sprang and caught him by the bridle , when , presto ! down went his ears , shut went the eyes , and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And down he plodded , slunging , shambling , pivotting round zigzag corners , as before , in a style which any one that ever navigated such a craft down hill knows without further telling . After that , I was sure that the old fellow kept up a " terrible thinking , " in spite of his stupid looks , and knew a vast deal more than he chose to tell . Illustration : of a mule 's head lowered , with ears flattened . At length we opened on the Rhone valley ; and at seven we reached Hotel de la Tour , at Martigny . Here H. and S. managed to get up two flights of stone stairs , and sank speechless and motionless upon their beds . I must say they have exhibited spirit to-day , or , as Mr. C. used to say , " pluck . " After settling with our guides ,  --  fine fellows , whom we hated to lose ,  --  I ordered supper , and sought new guides for our route to the convent . Our only difficulty in reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides were uncertain whether mules could get through so early in the season . Only to think ! To-day , riding broilingly through hay-fields  --  to-morrow , stuck in snow drifts ! LETTER XXXV . Dear Henry :  --  You can not think how beautiful are these Alpine valleys . Our course , all the first morning after we left Chamouni , lay beside a broad , hearty , joyous mountain torrent , called , perhaps from the darkness of its waters , Eau Noire . Charming meadows skirted its banks . All the way along I could think of nothing but Bunyan 's meadows beside the river of life , " curiously adorned with lilies . " These were curiously adorned , broidered , and inwrought with flowers , many and brilliant as those in a western prairie . Were I to undertake to describe them , I might make an inventory as long as Homer 's list of the ships . There was the Canterbury bell of our garden ; the white meadow sweet ; the blue and white campanula ; the tall , slender harebell , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide tells me is called " Les Clochettes , " or the " little bells "  --  fairies might ring them , I thought . Then there are whole beds of the little blue forget-me-not , and a white flower which much resembles it in form . I also noticed , hanging in the clefts of the rocks around Tete Noir , the long golden tresses of the laburnum . It has seemed to me , when I have been travelling here , as if every flower I ever saw in a garden met me some where in rocks or meadows . There is a strange , unsatisfying pleasure about flowers , which , like all earthly pleasure , is akin to pain . What can you do with them ?  --  you want to do something , but what ? Take them all up , and carry them with you ? You can not do that . Get down and look at them ? What , keep a whole caravan waiting for your observations ! That will never do . Well , then , pick and carry them along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better resource , I did . My good old guide was infinite in patience , stopping at every new exclamation point of mine , plunging down rocks into the meadow land , climbing to the points of great rocks , and returning with his hands filled with flowers . It seemed almost sacrilegious to tear away such fanciful creations , that looked as if they were votive offerings on an altar , or , more likely , living existences , whose only conscious life was a continued exhalation of joy and praise . These flowers seemed to me to be earth 's raptures and aspirations  --  her better moments  --  her lucid intervals . Like every thing else in our existence , they are mysterious . In what mood of mind were they conceived by the great Artist ? Of what feelings of his are they the expression  --  springing up out of the dust , in these gigantic , waste , and desolate regions , where one would think the sense of his almightiness might overpower the soul ? Born in the track of the glacier and the avalanche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very pitiful , and of tender compassion ; that , in his infinite soul , there is an exquisite gentleness and love of the beautiful , and that , if we would be blessed , his will to bless is infinite . The greatest men have always thought much of flowers . Luther always kept a flower in a glass , on his writing table ; and when he was waging his great public controversy with Eckius , he kept a flower in his hand . Lord Bacon has a beautiful passage about flowers . As to Shakspeare , he is a perfect Alpine valley  --  he is full of flowers ; they spring , and blossom , and wave in every cleft of his mind . Witness the Midsummer Night 's Dream . Even Milton , cold , serene , and stately as he is , breaks forth into exquisite gushes of tenderness and fancy when he marshals the flowers , as in Lycidas and Comus . But all this while the sun has been withering the flowers the guide brought me ; how they look ! blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wilted , like a young lady who has been up all night at a ball . " No , no , " say I to the guide ; " do n't pick me any more . I do n't want them . The fact is , if they are pretty I can not help it . I must even take it out in looking as I go by . " One thing is evident ; He who made the world is no utilitarian , no despiser of the fine arts , and no condemner of ornament ; and those religionists , who seek to restrain every thing within the limits of cold , bare utility , do not imitate our Father in heaven . Can not a bonnet cover your head , without the ribbon and the flowers , say they ? Yes ; and could not a peach tree bear peaches without a blossom ? What a waste is all this colored corolla of flowers , as if the seed could not mature without them ! God could have created the fruit in good , strong , homely bushel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turn off my eyes from beholding vanity , " says a good man , when he sees a display of graceful ornament . What , then , must he think of the Almighty Being , all whose useful work is so overlaid with ornament ? There is not a fly 's leg , nor an insect 's wing , which is not polished and decorated to an extent that we should think positive extravagance in finishing up a child 's dress . And can we suppose that this Being can take delight in dwellings and modes of life or forms of worship where every thing is reduced to cold , naked utility ? I think not . The instinct to adorn and beautify is from him ; it likens us to him , and if rightly understood , instead of being a siren to beguile our hearts away , it will be the closest affiliating band . If this power of producing the beautiful has been always so fascinating that the human race for its sake have bowed down at the feet even of men deficient in moral worth , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sculptor , how much more shall we love God , who , with all goodness , has also all beauty ! But all this while we have been riding on till we have passed the meadows , and the fields , and are coming into the dark and awful pass of the Tete Noir , which C. has described to you . One thing I noticed which he did not . When we were winding along the narrow path , bearing no more proportion to the dizzy heights above and below than the smallest insect creeping on the wall , I looked across the chasm , and saw a row of shepherds ' cottages perched midway on a narrow shelf , that seemed in the distance not an inch wide . By a very natural impulse , I exclaimed , " What does become of the little children there ? I should think they would all fall over the precipice ! " My guide looked up benevolently at me , as if he felt it his duty to quiet my fears , and said in a soothing tone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , I might have known that little children have their angels there , as well as every where else . " When they have funerals there , " said he , " they are obliged to carry the dead along that road , " pointing to a road that resembled a thread drawn on the rocky wall . What a strange idea  --  such a life and death ! It seemed to me , that I could see a funeral train creeping along ; the monks , with their black cloaks , carrying tapers , and singing psalms ; the whole procession together not larger in proportion than a swarm of black gnats ; and yet , perhaps , hearts there wrung with an infinite sorrow . In that black , moving point , may be a soul , whose convulsions and agonies can not be measured or counted by any thing human , so impossible is it to measure souls by space . What can they think of , these creatures , who are born in this strange place , half way between heaven and earth , to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can never see the sun above the top of the cliff on either side , till he really gets into the zenith ? What they can be thinking of I can not tell . Life , I suppose , is made up of the same prosaic material there that it is every where . The mother thinks how she shall make her goat 's milk and black bread hold out . The grandmother knits stockings , and runs out to see if Jaques or Pierre have not tumbled over the precipice . Jaques and Pierre , in return , tangle grandmother 's yarn , upset mother 's milk bucket , pull the goat 's beard , tear their clothes to pieces on the bushes and rocks , and , in short , commit incredible abominations daily , just as children do every where . In the night how curiously this little nest of houses must look , lighted up , winking and blinking at the solitary traveller , like some mysterious eyes looking out of a great eternity ! There they all are fast asleep , Pierre , and Jaques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night they hear a tremendous noise , as if all nature was going to pieces ; they half wake , open one eye , say , " Nothing but an avalanche ! " and go to sleep again . This road , through the pass of the Tete Noir , used to be dangerous ; a very narrow bridle-path , undefended by any screen whatever . To have passed it in those old days would have had too much of the sublime to be quite agreeable to me . The road , as it is , is wide enough , I should think , for three mules to go abreast , and a tunnel has been blasted through what seemed the most difficult and dangerous point , and a little beyond this tunnel is the Hotel de la Couronne . If any body wanted to stop in the wildest and lonesomest place he could find in the Alps , so as to be saturated with a sense of savageness and desolation , I would recommend this hotel . The chambers are reasonably comfortable , and the beds of a good quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our arrival . I thought I should like to stay there a week , to be left there alone with Nature , and see what she would have to say to me . But two or three hours ' ride in the hot sun , on a mule 's back , indisposes one to make much of the grandest scenes , insomuch that we were glad to go to sleep ; and on awaking we were glad to get some dinner , such as it was . Well , after our dinner , which consisted of a dish of fried potatoes and some fossiliferous bread , such as prevails here at the small hotels in Switzerland , we proceeded onward . After an intolerably hot ride for half an hour we began to ascend a mountain called the Forclaz . There is something magnificent about going up these mountains , appalling as it seems to one 's nerves , at particular turns and angles of the road , where the mule stops you on the very " brink of forever , " as one of the ladies said . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to descend ; and there , at our feet , as if we were looking down at it out of a cloud , lay the whole beautiful valley of the Rhone . I did not know then that this was one of the things put down in the guide book , that we were expected to admire , as I found afterwards it was ; but nothing that I saw any where through the Alps impressed me as this did . It seemed to me more like the vision of " the land that is very far off " than any thing earthly . I can see it now just as distinctly as I saw it then ; one of these flat , Swiss valleys , green as a velvet carpet , studded with buildings and villages that looked like dots in the distance , and embraced on all sides by these magnificent mountains , of which those nearest in the prospect were distinctly made out , with their rocks , pine trees , and foliage . The next in the receding distance were fainter , and of a purplish green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lilac ; while far in the fading view the crystal summits and glaciers of the Oberland Alps rose like an exhalation . The afternoon sun was throwing its level beams in between these many-colored ranges , and on one of them the ruins of an old Roman tower stood picturesquely prominent . The Simplon road could be seen , dividing the valley like an arrow . I had gone on quite ahead of my company , and as my mule soberly paced downward in the almost perpendicular road , I seemed to be poised so high above the enchanting scene that I had somewhat the same sensation as if I were flying . I do n't wonder that larks seem to get into such a rapture when they are high up in the air . What a dreamlike beauty there is in distance , disappearing ever as we approach ! As I came down towards Martigny into the pasture land of the great mountain , it seemed to me that the scenery might pass for that of the Delectable Mountains  --  such beautiful , green , shadowy hollows , amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were making their hay , which smelled so delightfully , while cozy little Swiss cottages stood in every nook . All were out in the fields , men , women , and children , and in one hayfield I saw the baby 's cradle  --  baby , of course , concealed from view under a small avalanche of a feather bed , as the general fashion in these parts seems to be . The women wore broad , flat hats , and all appeared to be working rather lazily , as it was coming on evening . This place might have done for Arcadia , or Utopia , or any other of those places people think of when they want to get rid of what is , and get into the region of what might be . I was very far before my party , and now got off my mule , and sat down on a log to wait till they came up . Then the drama enacted by C. 's mule took place , which he has described to you . I merely saw a distant commotion , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As they were somewhat slow coming down , I climbed over a log into a hayfield , and plucked a long , delicate , white-blossomed vine , with which I garlanded the top of my flat hat . One is often reminded of a text of Scripture in these valleys  --  " He sendeth springs into the valleys , which run among the hills . " Every where are these little , lively , murmuring brooks falling down the rocks , prattling through the hayfields , sociably gossiping with each other as they go . Here comes the party , and now we are going down into Martigny . How tired we were ! We had to ride quite through the town , then through a long , long row of trees , to come to the Hotel de la Tour . How delightful it seemed , with its stone entries and staircases , its bedrooms as inviting as cleanliness could make them ! The eating saloon opened on to a beautiful garden filled with roses in full bloom . There were little tables set about under the trees for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open air if they preferred it , a very common and pleasant custom of continental hotels . A trim , tidy young woman in a white cap , with a bunch of keys at her girdle , ushered us up two flights of stone stairs , into a very clean , nice apartment , with white muslin window curtains . Now , there is no feature of a room that speaks to the heart like white muslin window curtains ; they always shed light on the whole scene . After resting a while we were called down to a supper of strawberries and cream , and nice little rolls with honey . This honey you find at every hotel in Switzerland , as one of the inevitables of the breakfast or tea table . Here we were to part from our Chamouni guides , and engage new ones to take us to St. Bernard . I had become so fond of mine that it really went quite to my heart ; we had an affecting leave-taking in the dark stone entry , at the foot of the staircase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the change I had in my pocket , to buy souvenirs for his little folks at home , for you know I told you we had compared notes on sundry domestic points . I really flattered myself that I was doing something quite liberal ; but this deceitful Swiss coin ! I found , when I came to tell C. about it , that the whole stock only amounted to about twenty cents : like a great many things in this world , it looked more than it was . The good man , however , seemed as grateful as if I had done something , wished all sorts of happiness to me and my children , and so we parted . Peace go with him in his Chamouni cottage . JOURNAL  --  ( CONTINUED . ) Saturday , July 9 . Rose in a blaze of glory . Rode five mortal hours in a char-a-banc , sweltering under a burning sun . But in less than ten minutes after we mounted the mules and struck into the gorge , the ladies muffled themselves in thick shawls . We seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropics into the frigid zone . A fur cloak was suggested to me , but as it happened I was adequately calorified without . Chancing to be the last in the file , my mule suddenly stopped to eat . " Allez , allez ! " said I , twitching the bridle . " I wo n't ! " said he , as plainly as ears and legs could speak . " Allez ! " thundered I , jumping off and bestowing a kick upon his ribs which made me suffer if it did not him . " I wo n't ! " said he , stuffily . " Wo n't you ? " said I , pursuing the same line of inductive argument , with rhetorical flourishes of the bridle . " Never ! " he replied again , most mulishly . " Then if words and kicks wo n't do , " said I , " let us see what virtue there is in stones ; " and suiting the action to the word , I showered him with fragments of granite , as from a catapult . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose in the same relative position . I redoubled the logical admonition ; he jumped the more perceptibly ; finally , after an unusually affecting appeal from a piece of granite , he fairly budged , and I seized the bridle to mount . " Not at all , " said he , wheeling round to his first position , like a true proslavery demagogue . " Ah , " said I ; and went over the same line of argument in a more solid and convincing manner . At length the salutary impression seemed permanently fastened on his mind ; he fairly gave in ; and I rode on in triumph to overtake the party  --  having no need of a fur coat . Horeb , Sinai , and Hor ! What a wilderness ! what a sudden change ! Nothing but savage , awful precipices of naked granite , snowy fields , and verdureless wastes ! In every other place in the Alps , we have looked upon the snow in the remote distance , to be dazzled with its sheeny effulgence  --  ourselves , meanwhile , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrid desert  --  not a leaf , not a blade of grass  --  over the deep drifts of snow ; and we find our admiration turns to horror . And this is the road that Hannibal trod , and Charlemagne , and Napoleon ! They were fit conquerors of Rome , who could vanquish the sterner despotism of eternal winter . After an hour 's perilous climbing , we reached , at last , the hospice , and in five minutes were sitting at the supper table , by a good blazing fire , with a lively company , chatting with a gentlemanly abbe , discussing figs and fun , cracking filberts and jokes , and regaling ourselves genially . But ever and anon drawing , with a half shiver , a little closer to the roaring fagots in the chimney , I thought to myself , " And this is our midsummer nights ' dream " ! LETTER XXXVI . Dear :  --  During breakfast , we were discussing whether we could get through the snow to Mont St. Bernard . Some thought we could , and some thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweltering one hour , and plunging through snow banks the next .
