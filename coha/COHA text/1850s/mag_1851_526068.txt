JOURNALISM IN NEW*YORK. * THE appearance of three new dailies in one month in this city is sufficient to dispel all doubts as to the enterprise of New-York publishers or the capacity of New-York readers . If the establishment of newspapers depended solely on literary men , we should not be surprised at witnessing a much greater number of these too fascinating enterprises than exist among us at present . Writers as a class have not usually very much to lose . They are not particularly distinguished for a distaste to running in debt . They are not given to the calculation of probabilities in the matter of profit and loss , and are always ready for new schemes that may happen to consort with their ambition for fame or their desire of filling their pockets . But men of capital-and publishers now-a-days can not be otherwiseare more chary of their fortunes , and calculate before they embark in any new enterprise how much they may expect to " realize " from their venture . With them the " uncertainty of human affairs " is ever a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate the training which a firm disbelief in what is commonly called " good luck " has given them . We must admit , therefore , that the sudden production of three cheap daily papers in a city which we had imagined overstocked with journals , somewhat startled our confidence in the discernment of New-York publishers . Our established prints already form a portly catalogue . Of commercial sheets we have the Journal of Commerce , senior and junior , the Courier and Enquirer , the Evening Post , and the Commercial Advertiser ; among their cheaper and more popular brotherhood , the Express , the Tribune , the Herald , the Day Book , the Mirror , the Sun , the Morning Star , and the New-Yorker ; the three latter distributed at the low rate of one cent each . This , it will be seen , is a very large number of daily journals for a city of the size of New-York , and would seem sufficiently great to satisfy our wants and to deter capitalists from embarking in rival speculations . New-York , including Brooklyn and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of the European capitals , London , Paris , or Constantinople . We might therefore be contented if we did not support as many daily journals as either of the two first-mentioned cities . Yet we find that our newspapers , aided by their new reinforcement , actually outnumber those of Paris or London , or indeed of any other city of the world . And having already so many , we are far from supposing that we shall have no more . The gentlemen who are severally connected with the Times , the Verdict , and the National Democrat , have probably very good grounds for assuming their present responsibilities . We take pleasure in recognizing most of them , and we speak more particularly at present of the business department , as old hands at getting up newspapers ; and we feel sure that they would not have committed themselves to their recent undertakings without first sitting down and counting the cost . They can not have been deceived by false estimates , or by unfounded advice from interested parties . They can not be supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrariety of opinions and difficulty of tastes among the readers who are to furnish the ultimate means for the support of their journals . We are *ertain , therefore , that having allowed for all necessary and contingent expenses , they confidently reckon on paying all claims and dividing fair profits . No one will deny , in view of their enterprise and their reliance on themselves and the public , that they merit the success which they assure us they anticipate . Taking it into consideration that these new papers are published on the cheap * The Verdict . The National Democrat . The New-York Daily Times . ) New-York , September , 1851. // plan ; and that one of them in particular , with an amount of reading matter inferior only to that of two other New-York daily journals , is afforded at one cent a copy ; and that to obtain a remunerating circulation they must from the outset be equal at least to their rivals in point of news and literary merit ; we can not but see that they are surroanded by very imposing difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in which the publication of a newspaper is attended with so small a tax-expense from government , or in which the inhabitants are such general readers , as the city of New-York . Yet nowhere else does competition reduce the price of newspapers to so low a mark , or dictate so high a standard of literary excellence . The cost necessary to furnish one of our journals with early telegraphic intelligence , authentic correspondence from points of interest , full and reliable mails , and with that style of editorial writing which our improved taste begins to demand , is in itself immense , and seems to one who has never been at the pains to estimate its several items , positively overwhelming . And this aggregation of expense constitutes but one drawback from profits . Paper and ink may indeed be purchased at low rates , but rooms sufficiently large to accommodate the many fixtures of a newspaper are not to be procured in the heart of a city without the payment of a heavy rent , and printers will not be satisfied without they receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editors must be paid , punctually , if not liberally . Gentlemen of the press are not noted for economy , and genci ally live so close to their incomes that temporary suspensions of payments involve them in the most disagreeable embarrassments . Their claims at all events must be attended to , even if those of the paper merchant or the stockholders in the concern are suffered to lie over . And if returns come in but slowly  --  and when at the establishment of a new journal were they known to do otherwise ? - there must be a capacious reserve fund to meet expenses . In the history of every journal now prominently before the public there have been times when the most gloomy forebodings were rationally indulged by its proprietors ; when the hopes they had entertained of the responses of public sympathy seemed illusive and of doubtful realization ; and when the energy that had hitherto sustained them seemed to he deprived of its ultimate dependence . We can not be accused , then , of looking at these new enterprises with a discouraging aspect if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of their bold and cheerful tone , display themselves in the prefatory remarks of their conducters , and confess an anxious interest in their fate . And should any of them fail to survive the year of their birth , we shall attribute such misfortune rather to an inevitable opposition of circumstances than to a want of honest endeavor or of faithful study of popular needs . The press of New-York , whose recent enlargement we have thus chronicled , although it shares many of its characteristics with that of other cities and of the country at large , constitutes , from various causes , a subject of peculiar interest . Perhaps among the least of these may be noticed the especial consideration it enjoys abroad  --  a consideration which we have sometimes been puzzled fully to account for . As NewYorkers , although by no means unconscious of our advantages or our importance , we are certainly mindful of the existence of other cities near our own , but little inferior in point of size , possessing equal facilities of educatioi* and popular improvement , lying equally open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cultivation of pure literature and the arts . We do not forget that in this country circumstances render it impossible for any one city to be the focus of the intellect of all , or to monopolize the materials of any department of literary activity . A central capital and a jealous regard on the part of our rising cities for their own rights and reputation , combine to prevent the largest commercial emporium of America from ever assuming that position as  --  a dispe*iser of intelligence , and an authority for opinion , which is so unhesitatingly and ungrudgingly accorded to London by sister cities . For our own part we are content to regard ourselves as but one among many , and to prefer an exclusive claim to nothing which we can not prove to be peculiarly our own . But when the foreign press has occasion to speak of American journalism , it invariably selec* that of New-York as the representative of the whole , and according to the current tone of our own prominent sheets draws conclu // qwq surprise at home , we should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantity and quality of reading matter which we purchase for two cents in a copy of the Tribune , or in the frequent double sheet of the Herald , or for one cent in a copy of the Times . We dare say this cheapness is to be easily and satisfactorily accounted for . The Times is an experiment ; but as its proprietors know very well what they are doing , we see no reason why we may not speak of it as a fixed fact in New-York journalism , and rank it among the profitable sheets we have just mentioned . These papers have , then , in the first place , an immense circulation . The daily issue of the Tribune is about twenty thousand copies , and that of the Herald often equals twentyfive or thirty thousand . The Times , at its present low rates of subscription , may confidently reckon on an equal , and perhaps a greater circulation . One great element of cheapness , a wide sale of the manufactured article , is thus attained . Printing machinerSr has been brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for , so long as we doubt the possibility of obviating friction , or of discovering a more economical motive-power than steam . The labor of the composing and the press-room has been systematized , until human fingers have arrived at their ultimate capabilities . The philosophy of advertising has been ingeniously pushed to its ripest development . Editors and sub-editors have probably learned to compose sentences as rapidly as their fingers will transcribe them . All this facilitates economy , and goes very far towards doing away with what might otherwise seem an inexplicable wonder . A page of the Times is made up of six columns , each column containing one hundred and sixty-five lines of leaded type , or two hundred and ten lines of close type , or two hundred and fifty lines of newspaper minion . Of the twenty-four columns of the paper , from eighteen to twenty are filled with reading matter , two thirds of which is editorial , consisting of articles on political subjects and current affairs , reviews of new books , " city items , " and condensed paragraphs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over twelve hundred words ; and as much of its editorial is printed in smaller type than that on which we have based our estimate , we can safely reckon the quantity of editorial matter at 14,400 words , equal to eighteen pages of this Review . The remainder of the original matter , consisting of correspondence , reports , and financial intelligence , swells the amount to upwards of 24,000 words , equal to thirty pages of this Review . When . we consider that this quantity of matter is renewed daily , and can never be suffered to decrease ; that its preparation requires the constant services of a large force of sub-editors and reporters , who must be fairly remunerated for their labor ; that the quality of what is written must never fall below a standard which the taste of those readers at whose patronage a first-class paper should aim has already set very high ; and that the white paper on which it is printed costs about two thirds of a cent ; we can not but think that the science of newspaper production has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extreme cheapness we have no means of accurately determining , but we think it must at least equal twenty thousand copies . The Times probably reckons on thirty or forty thousand subscribers , and we do not see how it can divide fair profits on its invested capital with a less number . The Ttibune and the double-sheet Herald each consist of eight six-columned pages . Five of these pages are filled with reading matter , by far the largest part of which is editorial and correspondence . The price of these sheets is two cents each , and the paper on which either of them is printed can not cost less than one and a quarter cents . They are each liberal pay-masters to all in their employ , and afford handsome remuneration for accepted contributions . The number of advertisements in each by no means equals that of any one of several other city journals , while their snb*scription prices are much lower ; yet such is the largeness of their circulation , that they are yielding what may seem to some enormous profits . It was stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial gossip can ever lay claim to , that the dividend of the Tribune for the past year was over seventy thousand dollars . We have mentioned these examples of cheap journals in New-York , not for the purpose of comparing them with journals in other countries , beyond all of which they are vastly cheaper , but simply because they // are the most complete triumphs of capital and skill which we have thus far witnessed in the history of the American press . Leaving their qualitie*out of view , of which indeed it would be invidious to speak , in the matter of cheapness they are without rivals in our largest cities after New-York-Philadelphia , Boston and New-Orleans ; and we need hardly say , in the country at large . The wonder they excite abroad is perfectly natural . The Londoner who pays five pence for a copy of the Tunes may well be surprised at seeing the Tribune , containing nine tenths the quantity of reading matter of his favorite journal , sold for a penny . And his surprise is all the greater because he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Courier and Enquirer and Journal of Commerce , as prodigies of cheapness-papers which most of our citizens would think it decidedly extravagant to buy . A singular feature in the journalism of New-York is its political complexion . Most of our readers know that the two great parties are about evenly balanced in this city . From an acquaintance among our business men one would conclude that New-York was Whig , but the election returns show that we may safely calculate upon an equal number of ins and outs between the Whigs and Democrats . Our journals , however , would not seem to indicate this . Whig sheets crowd upon us as we write their namesthe Courier and Enquirer , the Tribune , the Express , the Commercial Advertiser , and others ; but until the appearance of our latest acquisition , the National Democrat , the Evening Post has represented the entire Democratic press of the city . As may be readily supposed , this state of things has not been quietly suffered , and numerous attempts have been made from time to time by our Democratic friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite expression , " the masses might rally . " Singularly enough in the history of a party that polls votes in this city by tens of thousands , these attempts , although backed , as we have reason to know , by a good deal of hard work , have uniformly been failures . Had we written this article a year ago , we should have been in time to chronicle the expiring issues of the " Globe , " a Democratic paper which , after struggling for a twelvemonth , was discontinued for lack of support . In sober verity we mourned over the death of the Globe , for it was a very well-disposed , well-conducted sheet , and seemed killed more by fatality than by bad management . It was very much better than any of its predecessors , and died much harder ; and ns its successor is decidedly better than all , we hope it may hold on to life with more tenacity . We like the tone in which the editor of the National Democrat speaks of his paper , and the causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some experience in writing the editorials of first numbers of new papers , and especially Democratic papers in this city . If they have failed , after we left them , to make their appearance daily , the fault was not ours . We never had any charge of them when it became necessary to write their valedictory ; nor have we ever mourned over their exit . They often did more good by dying than they did while living . The vitality that was in them was of that effeminate character that it would have been difficult to decide whether it did really belong to any active , intelligent , and living commodity . " But our thirty-odd thousand Democrats in this city have been so long without a daily morning sheet , that they will , undoubtedly , look upon a pure specimen of the article as quite a curiosity ; and will at least introduce it into their families just to see how it looks and what it says . We intend to furnish it to them , we hope , for many years to come . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others , having no care except to receive a certain number of dollars and cents for what we contribute to the columns of our journaL We wish to try the experiment with a view of ascertaining whether it is not possible to build up a permanent Democratic daily morning sheet in this great metropolitan city . Many are of opinion that it requires a large capital to accomplish this . This we have not got , nor do we expect to have . But we believe there is enterprise and means enough among our Democracy to give our project a fair triaL The majority of our city population is Democratic ; the majority of the people of the Union is Democratic ; and so is the majority of the people4f this State . When it is asserted that they will not support a well-conducted journal that advocates pure Democratic doctrine , a stigma is cast upon the intelligence and liberality of the Democratic party . It will be our object to prove that this disparaging assertion is untrue . We will labor with energy and zeal in our new vocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every Democratic journal which has been started of late years in this city has lingered out a brief and sickly existence , and then yielded up the ghost , without even a natural spasmodic struggle to prolong its life , and without much seeming disappointment on the part of the proprietors , or regret of the party to whose service its columns had been devoted , as the exponent of their principles . So common has been the failure of Democratie // journals in this city , that it is generally supposed that after the election is over the paper must go down . So often has this prediction been verified , without even a single exception , that the people appear to be anxiously awaiting the anticipated result , as though it were a fixed fact . We have no doubt that there are a great many honest and well-meaning Democrats who would , for the moment , feel disappointed if our paper did not break down immediately after the election . We can see no good reason why a Democratic paper should not succeed in a city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural majority of Democrats . At all events , we intend to try what industry , energy , and perseverance will do . " - Nationel Democrat , Vol . I. , No. 1 . It is even true that a city which yields to none other in the world in readiness to imbibe political feeling and foment political excitement , has for many years supported more or less neutral papers , while with a solitary exception those journals that have been devoted to one of its two great parties have languished and died . The " Sun , " a neutral sheet , possesses a larger daily circulation than any other journal in New-York , and perhaps than any other in the world . The Herald has never suffered from lack of patronage , and several smaller neutral papers within the shadow of the Sun and Herald establishments are enjoying the stimulus of very healthy incomes . We are not aware of any other city whose journalism presents so anomalous a feature . The weekly papers of New-York are many in number , and of various characteristics , exhibiting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They outnumber the dailies some two or three to one , and one who is disposed to ascertain their exact number by personal research will weary himself in stumbling through the intricacies of Nassau and Ann streets before he has half completed his task . Although English writers are apt to speak of their weekly journalism as the most perfect in the world , we are persuaded that our dignified and semi-naturalized " Albion " will not yield to the " Examiner , " memorable though it be in the name of Albany Fonblanque ; and that the " Spirit of the Times " may very well compare with " Bell 's Life in London . " We must , however , confess that our various hebdomadal imitations of inimitable " Punch " have been failures . We are of the opinion that a paper precisely like Punch can not be sustained by us at present . The experiment has been tried , often and faithfully , and " our first humorists " have been engaged to contribute , but such dismal sheets as " Yankee Doodle " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Punch 's wit is emphatically the wit of society ; society of long duration , complex institutions and clearly defined features , open alike to the most trenchant and the most delicate satire , and sufficiently rigid to be often attacked at the same points without losing those peculiarities that have provoked assailants . Foreigners are obtuse to the wit of Punch . It plays wholly on the national , and would cease to exist if it ceased to be English . But as a matter of fact , we have as yet no society , if we may in the term include those different conditions of ancestry , education , modes of thinking and modes of living which make up the social life of a body of people whose disposition of circumstances has not been broken in upon by revolutions or immigration . And so it results that when our pictorial satirists bave used up the " B'hoys " of the Bowery and the " Suckers " of the West , they have very little left to fall back upon . This may partly explain our lack of a national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at once change Brother Jonathan 's long face to a round one , or occupy ourselves in hunting up materials for laughter when cach one of us has quite enough to do at getting his dinner . Most of the New-York weeklies , like their contemporaries of Philadelphia and Boston , are intended expressly for country circulation , and are of large size and very heterogeneous contents . It is not uncommon to find one of them devoted to a dozen or twenty different objects of interest , taste or study , among which literature and the fine arts have hardly enough elbow room to make themselves visibfr . Very many of our cheap " blood and thunder novels , written by " Harry Hazel , " or " a distinguished naval officer , " or " the most eminent of our rising novelists , " have first appeared serially in the columns of certain of these weeklies , where , we doubt not , they gave great satisfaction . We have also seen in the columns of these identical sheets valuable disquisitions on the deepest matters of philosophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Doctor of Divinity , agricultural treatises whose perusal would benefit a thorough-bred farmer , and // candid reasonings on politics and the affairs of the nation . This versatility , or comprehensiveness , as Buiwer Lytton would style it , has been also profitably adopted by the Sunday press , in whose columns , in addition to their overwhelming mass of town gossip , theatrical criticism , and serial fiction , one often meets with sermons from our celebrated clergymen , appearing a little awkwardly , it must be owned , among their unwonted companions ; like a sober youth suddenly tossed into a party of gay roysterera whose amusements he is somewhat puzzled to share . Notwithstanding the reputation of hard work and inadequate remuneration attendant upon the profession of a journalist in a large city , and the precarious future which is ever represented as forming the bounding horizon of his path , there is no lack of recruits of all ages and of all degrees of talent to the great army of writers for the press who find subsistence in New-York . The advice constantly given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature by our leading editors and journalists , is reo'arded by them as fallacious and unfounded ; and never having been called on to undergo the difficulties against which they are cautioned , and from which it is in their own power to remain aloof , they feel very little hesitation in committing themselves to an undertaking which presents so many attractive features to the man of talent without capital , and yet in whose successful prosecution capital is so largely and vitally concerned . Upon the establishment of a new paper , therefore , in this city , offers of service in its various departments are sure to come in upon the proprietors with most perplexing obtrusiveness , and with a pertinacity that in most cases seems to admit of no denial . As an instance of this , we may mention that the conductors of the Times , in addition to the numberless negatives which they dispatched to applicants during the summer preceding the appearance of their journal , were obliged to let sixty or seventy applications lie over to be publicly answered in their first number , owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . And there is no one of our leading journals that does not daily receive offers of literary service from writers in various parts of the country , many of them proposing quantities of labor and terms of compensation which , it is not too much to say , would not be submitted to by one artisan or day laborer out of a hundred . To one of impulsive sentiments and little forethought , the profession of a writer for the city press is undoubtedly fascinating . In sober truth , and without arrogating to newspapers any purities of honor or dignities of thought which our common sense tells us they can never possess , the position of a journalist , and especially a journalist in a laro'e and influential city , is necessarily b even more than respectable , and can be made of eminent reputation if its incumbent practise those manly virtues which are deemed necessary to the integrities of private life . It disowns all circumstances of wealth and fashion , and bespeaks for the man who holds it a reception into the society of refined and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might seek after in vain , and which can only be forfeited by violations of good breeding , or derelictions from personal honor . It at once inducts him into the free-masonry of intellect and art . It throws him professionally among authors , painters , musicians , and the favored few whom for tune makes the M*cenases of current genius ; It gives him the entr*e of the concert roo** , the gallery , the senate chamber , and the studio . It spreads before him an array of privileges , whose purchase would demand a fortune , and which renders him for the time contented with what pecuniary recompense he may receive , and oblivious of all drawbacks which the future may have in store for him . Nor are the duties of the novitiate journalist so severe as to discourage his ambition , or his ardor for his vocation . Youth is strong and healtl*r , and the effects of the close atmosphere amid which he performs his work , and the sedentary constraints he is obliged to undergo , may be nullified by that exercise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation , which is common to most young men who are placed within reach of the stimulating activities of busy life . His duties have not yet palled upon him , and he has not reached those anxieties of existence , those murmurings at the superior success of others , those solicitous longings after better fortune , which pertain so invariably to men // of middle age . He sees other young men about him working harder than himself , and receiving less pay ; young lawyers drudging at copying for the mere privilege of a good " seat " newly-created M. D. 's toiling through hospitals and private sick-rooms in backstreets , with no other reward than " seeing practice ; " clerks in their third and fourth years barely clothing themselves from their salaries ; and he congratulates himself on his easy and profitable occupation . And at this time of life , while ahead in the race and feeling no diminution of vigor in view of the ground yet to be passed over , it would seem that at least an equality in social circumstance and possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one so highly favored at the commencement of his active life . But , unfortunately , men of the press rarely possess those habits of economy and calculation that attend the progress of rising business men , with whom it has at first been a matter of great difficulty to earn their living . Indeed , as a class , they are noted for extravagance , for disproportionate and heedless expenditure , for carelessness of the future , and for a constant enjoyment of empty pockets . Their habits of life are not calculated to produce caution in spending money or forethought in saving it . The younger employ*s of a newspaper establishment are paid weekly , and are in consequence exposed to the almost irresistible temptation of a small and constantly-recurring surplus ; in each case a trifle in itself , a few dollars more or less , yet a noticeable aggregate in the course of the year , and which if laid up would swell to a firm and useful capital by the time its owner possessed sufficient experience in his profession to make it available . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappears amid suppers , recreations of the turf and water , expensive presents , and importunate companions ; and the end of the year finds the journalist as poor as at the beginning . And such courses of life rarely fail to perpetuate themselves . If with abundant means of saving , you have accumulated nothing at the expiration of one year , the chances are that with increased facilities you will have saved nothing at the end of another . If for a length of time you have suffered irregular hours and irregular overflows of pocket to conquer your notions of steadiness and economy , you will find it difficult in future to be steady or to save . It is melancholy to see men growing old as hack-writers , as poor as when they commenced their career ; fortunate indeed if year by year they are permitted to retain their places , and are not ousted by fresher and younger rivals . And such is almost sure to be the destiny of men of the press in large cities , unless they overcome early in life the injurious influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They can not expect to be exempt from those conditions under which they live in common with other men . In our centres of civilization , capital is a rigorous deity , whose favor must be propitiated , no matter by how great sacrifices . Clerks , to be merchants , must have capital , must have saved , if they have not inherited it . We ask pardon for uttering so obvious a truism , but it is a text equally applicable to hired journalists , and we think pretty generally forgotten by them . The writer who has capital enjoys an advantage over his brother writer who has nothing but his salary to depend upon , precisely like that of the moneyed business man over the salesman or book-keeper whose expenditure constantly equals his income . One is independent , and the other dependent : One has it in his power to order ; the only option of the other is obedience . One , having the power to plan , finds pleasure in contemplating his future ; the other , possessing very little on which to build his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . The income of one is continually increasing in arithmetical ratio , while that of the other , after a certain lapse of time , remains invariably fixed . Spendthrift clerks do not often rise to the command of establishments ; and the writers who eventually become editors and proprietors of city journals will , in most cases , be found to have saved their money , and to have relied as much on their pecuniary as on their mental capital . We say " niost cases . " We would leave room for occasional triumphs of eminent talent over all drawbacks of extravagance , recklessness , and irregularity . But such triumphs , every practised observer will own , are rare . We think that intelligent industry is a better guide to success than spendthrift talent . And , in fact , to write well for the newspapers , does not require a very // November , large degree of native talent : it demands little more than that ability which moderate intelligence may acquire by faithful practice . " Men may think , " says Buiwer Lytton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the papers ; but if they try it once , they will see how much they were mistaken . " We agree with this remark . It is not an easy thing to write a creditable newspaper article . In our own observation , men of undoubted abilities , but of small experience in writing , have appeared very discreditably in print . But they would not have made a much better figure at laying brick , or at navigating vessels , or at any other craft with which they were not practically acquainted . Writing for the press is a profession-a craft . Men of ordinary abilities may labor at it to good advantage , and between the respective productions of any two newspaper writers , the eye may see no more difference than between two contiguous brick walls laid by different masons . And then it is not until after years of service , that journalists are allowed the privileges of the strictly editorial columns , where genius , and certain kinds of talent , native to but few men , and acquired only by infinite difficulty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better leader than another ; may be acquainted with more facts , and have a better faculty of drawing inferences from his stock of information ; may have a more copious fund of allusion ; may be better able to satirize a political enemy , or dignify a party friend ; may reason away prejudices more skilfully , and advance doubtful propositions with a better grace : but genius is not a better hand at the scissors than industry ; and " city items , " fatal accidents , military parades , freaks of mad oxen , personal rencontres , variations of the thermometer , and horse-thief committals , may be chronicled as well by unknown scribblers as by Messrs . Greeley or Bryant themselves . It is among such themes as these that young journalism finds its occupation , and those of its members are wise who seek in the exciting task of making them known to the public a source of pecuniary profit , as a backer in after years , rather than a fame , whose attainment is , to say the least , problematical . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstand the wearing effects of a long probation in duties which often lose their interest , and seem but drud gery in comparison with the higher labors of the press ; and sufficient forethought to save his money , while there are no special drafts upon his purse ; the eminence he will eventually gain in the journalism of a great city will be both honorable and profitable , and will seem not unworthy of the sacrifices that have purchased its attainment . For in no other country beside our own can the journalist-the editor-speak his mind fully oii the great topics of social and political welfare , and thus perform his real and whole duty . We would not lower the freedom of the American press , by comparing it with that of any of the continental monarchies ; and we shall look in vain among the servilities and the aristocracy-worship of London journals , for that independence and boldness which characterize our own . It will be difficult to find a foreign sheet that dare speak its real sentiments upon prominent national subjects , till it has first ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrath of government . London newspapers find it for their interest to be obsequious to court dictates ; the Parisian press , enjoying a larger liberty than any other in Europe , is constantly watched by the police . With us , it is needless to say , there are no such restraints . Our press , expected , and in most casus disposed , to observe the rules of decency and order , is privileged to speak its mind on all subjects with which it is concerned , with the assurance that its opinions will meet with such a reception as their honesty and value may bespeak . And although no one pretends that newspapers form public sentiment , or create creeds and systems of belief where none before existed , it is a grateful truth to the journalist , that he has the privilege of laying the results of extended information and practised reasoning powers before . a large audience of intelligent men and women , and of compelling the assent of candid minds to what is undeniably true , whether fact or theory , but which , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A well-informed , truth-loving , and independent editor has the satisfaction of knowing that his readers are predisposed to side with his views , regarding him as a closer student of public affairs than themselves , and as a better authority in doubtful and difficult questions* Thus , although they may think strongly and even obstinately for themselves , they // are inclined for the sake of bettering and fortifying their main conclusions , to square with the expressed views of one whose especial business it is to record and draw inferences from facts with which he is better acquainted than themselves . Perhaps their ideas are misty about certain matters not of every-day mention ; the refracting medium of editorial intelligence clears away the fog , and presents to them their former notions in definite and tangible form . And often , for the mere sake of convenience , they permit opinions , of whose ultimate issue they are careless , and whose paternity they would deny , if at any time proved to be unfounded or mischievous , to flow in such channels as the practised hand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New-York an influence over the thoughts of this nation greater than that enjoyed by the press of large and emulous cities on either side , it is not too much to say that it is vastly more influential abroad . A fact mentioned a few pages back readily explains this . The papers of New-York represent the American press throughout all Europe . The Philadelphia " North American " and the Boston " Atlas " may scarcely be known at London , at Paris , or at Berlin ; but the Tribune , the Herald , the Courier and Enquirer , are in all foreign reading rooms , on the tables of all literary men , whether German , English , French , or Italian ; read by diplomatists , scholars , politicians , merchants , and circulated to an astonishing extent among the common people . We need not enlarge upon the importance of the field thus open to the inculcation of republican opinion , or the privilege our journalism thus enjoys , of being the medium of free opinion from our highly favored nation to others less advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever striven to keep in obscurity . It will , indeed , be an unpardonable fault , if a press so peculiarly honored shall ever retrograde in honest thinking or honest speaking , or shall content itself with looking on while freedom is at war with oppression . In conclusion , we would congratulate the entire American press on its many improvements in style and tone which it has been our pleasure to witness of late years . That spirit of rancor , of jealousy , of low abusiveness , of unwillingness to see any thing of good in opponents , of blind subserviency to the basest uses of party , in which so many of our journals were steeped , has , we are glad to say , wonderfully diminished , and the courtesies and refinement of education and manliness are fast taking its place . We do not err in saying tn at scurrility is no longer at a premium , and that a reputation for political malice and personal abusiveness is bad capital on which to build up a newspaper . We are creating a name for national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens are unwilling should be perilled to gratify dishonest editors , or bribe-taking publishers . Foreign advances , too , are stimulating* our own ambition , and American journalists are mending their style as well as their spirit ; are learning to say what they have to say in the best manner , and with the aid of those graces of which their predecessors were ignoramt . And there are no reasons why we may not augur constant improvements in future , and predict a time when our journals shall be models to the world for courtesy and literary grace , as well as for independence , enterprise , and adaptation to popular wants .
