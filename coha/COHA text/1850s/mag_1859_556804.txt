txt ART . VI . - The Life and Remains of Douglas Jerrold . By his Son , BLANcHARD JERROLD . Boston : Ticknor and Fields . 1859. pp. 450 . DOUGLAS JERROLD has passed away forever from the earth ; but he has left behind him such memorials of his wit , genius , and intellectual ability , as the world will not willingly let die . Nor are these his only triumphs . Time and death have their separate , inalienable sovereignties , and exercise with remorseless despotism their conscriptive rights over individuals , and all personal and historic achievements , - often diminishing what seemed great in human character , and enlarging what at first sight , and in the common estimation , was regarded as mean and insignificant ; but neither time , death , nor eternity can change that which is essentially true in the soul of man , nor rob it of its moral grandeur and sublimity . For , as Cicero devoutly urges , " Truth is unchanged , and unchangeable ; not one thing to-day , and another to-morrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . " In truth , in stern loyalty to his principles and convictions lies the crowning glory of Jerrold . Higher trophy can no man have laid upon his tomb than this ; higher legacy can no man leave , and none more sacred and vitalizing . We have had many wits in the world , from and before Rabelais , to Swift and Sheridan ; but if we except the Frenchman , and can pardon // his continents of mud for the sake of his sincerity , his work as a reformer , and those seams of light and truth which burn and flash amidst the torpid corruption , the rotting sensual imagery of his mind , who among these naked and unnamed worthies can lay claim to the moral title of Jerrold ? Swift assuredly can make no such pretensions ; for he was at the bottom a man-hater , having the intellect and also the heart of Satan , to whom virtue and morality were an idle dream . Neither can Sheridan - welcome as he was and is to all Champagne circles , and , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time - put in credentials high enough to win this highest of all the noble styles of heraldry . Sydney Smith alone among moderns is worthy to compare with Jerrold , not only in the sudden promptness and keen edge of his retort , but in the fine morality of his humor and sarcasm . Jerrold exceeds him , however , in fancy , in the symbolism of truth , and in those grand attributes of intellect and imagination which render this wit equally a man of genius and of profound practical wisdom . It is true that the jovial and learned divine is also a man of genius , and that he possesses faculties and acquirements which can not be claimed for Jerrold , - elaborate humor , for example , and scholarship ; but , large and liberal as he was in mind and character , and ever ready , like his great compeer , to lend his lance for the succor of the oppressed and the punishment of the oppressor , he was necessarily , from his position and profession , walled round by many obstructions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we think , that keen , instinctive recognition and appreciation of truth in its absolute nature , which are so characteristic of Jerrold , in his graver and professedly artistic writings . Be this as it may , however , one thing is certain ; that the obscure player 's son has stamped the impress of his genius upon the literature and character of his age and country , with an authentic and royal seal . Like most men who have achieved permanent fame , and won for themselves a definite status in the republic of letters , in science , or in art , he had to struggle through long years of toil , poverty , and neglect , before he could command a platform high enough to compel // 488 the public to listen to him , and acknowledge the supremacy of his intellect . But bitter and cruel as oftentimes were his disappointments and wrongs , through the mercenary nature of theatrical lessees , and London publishers , with whom he had continual dealings , we nowhere find the record of any complaint from his brave and manly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , in the full consciousness of his own power , and the assurance of final triumph . Fortunately for him and for us , he had great popular talent , and faculty of popular adaptation , superadded to the solid basement of his mind . Hence , while yet unknown to fame , he was at no time in any imminent danger of vulgar want or downright starvation . He could write magazine articles , articles for the newspapers , and astounding quantities of plays and farces for the theatres . It was during these days of hardship and prolific labor , that Jerrold met his best and dearest friend , Laman Blanchard . They were both earnest and enthusiastic men , and events were transpiring abroad which are now imperishably interwoven with the history of Lord Byron . The poet had resolved upon the liberty of Greece , and had written to the London Greek Committee that he was ready to devote his fortune and his life to the enterprise , asking at the same time practical aid from them , as the hour for action had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateway , during a drizzling shower of rain : - " One is a dark-haired young man , with most sparkling eyes , a broad white brow , and color as delicate as any girl 's . He is taller than his companion , who has light , flowing hair , a marked aquiline nose , fiery eyes thatched with massive eyebrows , - a mouth that most expressively shapes itself in aid of the meanings expressed by the voice The noble was their idol of the hour Why should they not follow him , - join him in Greece ? The two friends were roused to frenzy with the idea , and the fair , blue-eyed one , suddenly seeing the ludicrous position of two Greek crusaders sneaking out of a shower of rain , dashed into the wet , saying , Come , Sam , if we re going to Greece , we must n't be afraid of a shower of rain . ' " - pp. 59 , 60 . This homely anecdote in the words of his son and biographer is especially interesting , because it presents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a young man who had not reached his majority , and because that " dashing into the wet " from a sudden perception of the ridiculousness of their position , opens to us at once the secret chambers of his mind and character . In the subsequent unfoldings of the history of these young men it also possesses the highest interest . Jerrold , from first to last , was the same leonine man who dashed heedlessly from the gateway cover into the rain ; a man qualified by his courage to lead a Balaklava charge , " Into the jaws of death , Into the mouth of hell ; " while poor Blanchard , gentle and unobtrusive , although possessed of the finest mental and moral qualities , had none of that iron resoluteness of will which disposes of difficulties as of straws , and bends the world to its purpose . Blanchard died , alas ! - we will not say how - in the spring of 1845 . He had been a successful litt*rateur , had edited " The Courier , " " The True Sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-editor of " The Examiner , " when he went unannounced into the presence of his Maker . The death of his friend was bluntly announced to Jerrold by one who could have had no sympathy with human affections . " I remember , " says his son , " finding my father in a room , alone , at the Punch ' office . His face was white as any paper , and his voice had lost all its clear , sharp ring . You have heard , I suppose ? ' he said to me presently . I nodded an assent . But though he twitched his mouth manfully , tried to look out of the window , and had resolved to bear the blow stoically , the effort was too much for him . He sank upon his chair , and , motioning me from the room , wept , as children weep . " At his friend 's grave his grief was so completely beyond control that he was carried from the ground ; and for months afterwards , alone in his study , this sarcastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing good nor true in the world - was heard by his frightened wife , calling aloud , in a voice nearly choked by tears , upon his lost companion to come to him . I ye called him . No , no ; he ca n't come , my boy , ' he said wildly to a friend who happened to drop in on one of these sad evenings . " - p. 82. // England , is , that he was a " bitter cynic , " whom no one could approach without being wounded by his sarcasm or transfixed by his wit , - that this cynicism was the normal condition of his mind , and rooted also in his moral nature . How far this popular estimate is just , the reader can judge from the affecting relation contained in the preceding paragraphs . Though wit was in him , and would play upon all occasions , like summer lightning in the atmosphere of his presence , there was not a particle of malice or ill-nature in his heart . Nor did he ever wantonly injure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the kindest and most affectionate of men . His heart overflowed with compassion for misery and suffering , which he was always ready to relieve , and with a stormy indignation against wrong and wrong-doers , which sometimes manifested itself in such terrible outpourings of fiery scorn , and such withering lava-streams of wit , as to become almost appalling . Thus , an extortionate Jewish money*. lender being the subject of conversation , Jerrold said of him : " He may die , Sir , like Judas , but he has no bowels to gush out ! The truth is , that Jerrold was an earnest and sincere man , having solid foundations within him , which reached far below the brilliant surface of his character . He had learned many dreadful lessons in the hard school of the world , which , happily for him , he wisely digested , so that he suffered no harm by them ; and he stored them up as experience not too dearly *purchased , because of the strength and wisdom which they brought him . This experience empowered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as a moral teacher , when the time had come for the people of England to listen to him . For he was not merely a wit ; nothing pained him more than to be so regarded and estimated . The central fires of a great Sinai of passion burned within him , afid what are called his " bitter sarcasms " and " scathing utterances , " so far from being the splenetic offspring of a sour , angry , and mocking nature , were the genuine expressions of a soul surcharged with the sense of human wrong and misery . These were the intellectual . weapons wherewith he fought so long and so bravely the social and moral battle of the people against their // rulers and oppressors . And it should be remembered to his honor that this savage Berserker " cynic , " without " love or pity in his heart , " was always to be found in the front rank on the side of virtue and freedom . All his writings in Punch , in the Illuminated Magazine , in his books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beyond doubt or question . Like a knight of the old chivalry , he kept his eye ever upon the broad field of the world , for a just occasion of combat . Let Lord Palmerston , who has been chargeable with so many and such atrocious crimes and treasons in England during the last forty years , or Sir Robert Peel , or Lord John Russell , or any other statesman , commit himself by speech or action , compromise the interests of the people at home , or the liberties of Europe abroad , Jerrold nails him to a shameful cross , and pierces him with wounds , whose gaping mouths no emollient can readily close . Let even so small a man as Sir Peter Laurie send a starving tailor to the treadmill for a month as a rogue and vagabond , for having attempted to commit suicide , and he can not escape the lash of the avenger . " I shall look after such cases in future , " quoth Sir Peter . And Jerrold , under the signature of Q. in Punch , ventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as regarded by the " famine-stricken multitudes of Bolton . " " Let Comfort , " Q. concludes , " paint a portrait of life , and now Penury take the pencil . Pooh , pooh ! ' cry the sage Lauries of the world , looking at the two pictures ; that scoundrel Penury has drawn an infamous libel . That life ! with that withered face , sunken eye , * and shrivelled lip ; and what is worse , with a suicidal scar in its throat ! That life ! The painter Penury is committed for a month as a rogue and vagabond . We shall look very narrowly into these cases . ' We agree with the profound Sir Peter Laurie that it is a most wicked , a most foolish act of the poor man , to end his misery by suicide . But we think there is a better remedy for such desperation than the treadmill . The surest way for the rich and powerful of the world to make the poor man more careful of his life is to render it of greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is curious to observe how the critics become themselves perplexed , while attempting to unravel the character of Jerrold . There is as little agreement about him anywhere , as // if he were some incarnate rune or hieroglyph . And yet there is nothing difficult in his case , which , indeed , is one of the simplest in biographical history . Notoriously , he " wore his heart on his sleeve , " and any competent person could read his last secret . For he had nothing to hide , and there was no guile nor disguise in him . A great , free , impulsive nature , hating restraints and the bondage of conventional life , lie was never so happy as when he had gathered his choice troops of friends around him at his own table . He was a man also of thorough , uncompromising independence , and , although he received daily invitations to the palaces of the aristocracy in London , he very rarely availed himself of the courtesy , looking upon them with feelings almost of suspicion , as if , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord John Russell gave one of his sons a government appointment , and , although Jerrold was an admirer and supporter of his Lordship and of most of his public measures , he accepted it with compunction , fearing that the time might one day come when he should half unconsciously spare the rod for the sake of this personal benevolence . He had no contempt for the aristocracy , nor did he undervalue the advantages of position and influence which spring from a long background of ancestry and good family connections . He was a radical , it is true , but not in the low Chartist sense . No one ever heard him , even in times of the most stormy political excitement , advocate any measures , save those of a peaceful reform , to be won gradually by the diffusion of intelligence and morality among the people . Indeed , he can scarcely be called a politician , though he wrote many political articles , some of which made Wellington , who stood firm amidst the flashings of Vittoria and the thunders of Waterloo , tremble in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his political theories , it is true , but he wrote on politics like a moral censor and a man of letters , not as an editor of the Times newspaper , or a leader in the House of Commons . Nor could he , by any possibility , have been converted into a politician . The drudgery would have repelled and disgusted him , and the bonds of party would have chafed his soul so painfully , that he would have cast them from him in open and defiant rebellion . 37* // Although a hard-working , laborious writer , Jerrold was a fragmentary man , and expressed himself best in fragments . Those short , piquant pieces in Punch , how admirable they are ! How he adapts himself to the space he has to occupy , and how well he fills it ! Some of his magazine articles , - those contributed to Blackwood , - tales , the incidents and machinery of which we feel , while we read , to be but secondary , and care only for the fine fancies and philosophical speculations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those in his own magazines appear to us to outweigh in value , as idiomatic and genuine performances , all his printed books , except " The Man Made of Money , " and " The Chronicles of Clovernook . " " The Story of a Feather , " so gentle and tender , so sincere and earnest , which appeared in Punch , is one of his highest achievements , although it is easy to see how rapidly it fell from his pen . A catalogue of his printed performances , including his plays , magazine articles , pamphlets , Punch contributions , and books , would be a startlingly voluminous affair , and we dare not attempt it in these pages . Nor indeed would it be worth the trouble , so far as the literary merit of many of them is concerned ; but it would illustrate better than many sounding sentences could the indomitable energy and industry of the author . Jerrold himself set small value upon his plays , although he naturally enough loved the saltwater smack of " Black-Eyed Susan , " the flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established him , while yet a very young man , as a solid power in the realm . " Time Works Wonders** is one of his most mature plays ; but we doubt if it will survive the present century . His prose writings are far better than his plays . There are whole poems of great beauty in his " Chronicles of Clovernook , " - a book in which is revealed , we think , more of his real nature than in any other of his works . It sparkles with poetic genius , - contains much profound thinking , imaginative suggestion , and wise practical teaching . The style , too , is more artistic than his usual method , which , while it pos - sesses sufficient originality , is sometimes crooked , distorted , and unmusical. // He hated cant and humbug , and hunted that kind of game straight down to death . He was merciless in all such cases , sparing neither high nor low , rich nor poor , when they were brought within the range of his vision . Perhaps he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was said of Pope , men who feared not God , feared him and trembled . Jerrold was born in London on the 3d of January , 1803 . He was the son of an actor and county manager , and his father , Samuel Jerrold , was long the lessee of the Sheerness and South End Theatres . His mother , Samuel Jerrold 's second wife , was a Miss Reid of Wirksworth in Derbyshire , a lady very much younger than her husband , and possessed of uncommon abilities . In and around Sheerness young Douglas William Jerrold , as he was christened , spent the greater part of his early youth , under the care and guidance chiefly of his grandmother . His earliest recollections , therefore , are associated with theatrical representation , although the good dame who had the charge of him took him on frequent excursions to the sea-coast and the surrounding pastoral country . While yet at Wilsby , and before his father had engaged the Sheerness Theatre , he remembered well a visit which he paid to the hills of Cranbrook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded in those rich and flowery dales . Ever afterward the thought or actual hearing of sheep-bells conjured up for him the vision of those Kentish hills , and the beautiful scenery which lay between them and his home . Sunny landscapes and old green lanes ; grasses studded with flowers , and hedges garlanded with wild roses and honeysuckles ; - such , we are assured , is the first vivid impression which young Jerrold received from nature . His father 's management at Sheerness proved successful and profitable . The theatre was a wooden building , situate on the High Street , Blue Town , bearing a rent charge of two hundred and fifty dollars per annum . " A formidable foe was on the opposite shore . England looked more than ever to her wooden walls , and had just added ten thousand men to her naval service . The Blue Town was crammed with sailors and their officers , " - who of course patronized Mr. Samuel Jer // rold 's theatre , and thus strengthened his enterprise . The old sexton of Sheerness , who was Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and remembers that " on the night when the Russian admiral was in port , and gave a bespeak , ' there was nearly two hundred and fifteen dollars in the house " ! Lord Cochrane also frequently visited the theatre , when he was at Sheerness in the Pallas , the old man said , and his Lordship always insisted upon paying double . Young Douglas , too , remembered the naval hero , and looked with admiration and awe upon him as on one scarcely mortal . And strangely enough it happened , long afterward , that the " little whitehaired . boy who ran about the theatre , " paying such reverence to the great lord , had occasion , when he also had won for himself the right of being reverenced , to do his Lordship so high a service as to call from him the following generous acknowledgment - " 5 Chesterfield Street , 10th May , 1847 . " SIR - " Your generous and very powerful advocacy of my claim to the investigation of my case has contributed to promote that act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after due deliberation , to recommend to her Majesty my immediate restoration to the Order of the Bath , in which recommendation her Majesty has been graciously pleased to acquiesce . " I would personally have waited on you , confidentially to communicate this ( not yet promulgated ) decree ; but as there is so little chance of finding you , and I am pressingly occupied , I shall postpone that pleasure and duty . " I am , Sir , your obliged and obedient servant , " DUNDONALD . " DOUGLAS JERROLD , Esq . " In the mean while , however , young Douglas has many notable things to do in the world ; and at present he is a mere child , whose future is blanketed by the dark . He appears on the stage when the occasion demands the presence of so small an infant , and more than once Edmund Kean , the best tragic interpreter of Shakespeare who has appeared in theatrical history , has borne him to the foot-lights in the play of Rolla . Kean himself was then unknown and unappreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years of age Douglas was // taught to read and write , and the first books which attracted him , when he was sufficiently master of the language to understand them , were the " Death of Abel " and " Roderick Random . " His good grandmother was afraid that he would overwork his brain by excessive devotion to these books , and such other literature as fell in his way ; but nothing could check his greed for knowledge , except for a short interval , when a proposed walk on the beach would tempt him to give up the enchantment of reading . He loved the sea , and the great ships , - the war ships , called the British fleet , then lying at anchor off the town . He loved , too , the stories which his grandmother told him of Prince William , the royal sailor , of Nelsoii , and Collingwood , and there gradually and naturally arose within him a strong desire to become a sailor . " It is certain , " says his biographer , " that the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passionate longing in his heart ; that , sitting prisoned on summer evenings in his bedroom , his blue eyes wandered from the well-thumbed Death of Abel ' to search over the water ; and that great visions of iNelsons afloat under victorious bunting , of flying Frenchmen , and gallant boarding-parties , of prizes in tow , and the grateful cheers from English shores , glowed in his heart . That ardent temper , that white-hot energy , which pulsed through him in after life , and made his utterances all vehement , whether right or wrong , showed in the boy whose daily walks were in the midst of gallant sailors scarred by war , come home to be glorified by their countrymen . " - pp. 17 , 18 . Accordingly , in 1813 , when young Douglas was eleven years of age , and his sea-fever was at its height , he was sent as midshipman on board the guard-ship Namur , then lying at the Nore , under the command of Captain Austen . Here for a time things went on pleasantly enough . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep pigeons , and to read Buffon 's Natural History in the cabin . On the whole , however , the few months which he seems to have spent here must have been very monotonous . At length , on the 24th of April , 1815 , he was transferred to his Majesty 's brig Ernest , with prospect of immediate actual sea-service . It was on the eve of Waterloo , and Napoleon 's star was already flickering , soon to sink forever . The Ernest was to convoy transports carrying troops and military stores to Ostend , - a commission which she faithfully // executed , - and then go to sea again on a cruise . Bad weather came on , and the brig , being now off Cuxhaven , put into the harbor and anchored there . The captain went on shore and took Douglas with him , leaving him in charge of the boat . Two of the men presently asked leave of absence for a short time , to purchase fruit . The unsuspecting midshipman readily granted it , and only once afterward did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , in London , when Jerrold , struck with the face of a baker who was looking in at a shop-window , paused to examine it . He recognized the man at once . He was one of the deserters ; and Jerrold , taking him by the shoulder and looking into his pasty eyes , said to him , with a most comieal expression : " I say , my friend , do n't you think you ye been rather a long time about that fruit ? " The last duty performed by the Ernest , while Douglas was in service , was conveying some of the soldiers who were wounded at Waterloo from the Downs to Sheerness ; for Napoleon 's star had now set , and Europe was rejoicing in the anticipation of a permanent peace . On the 21st of October , 1815 , Douglas William Jerrold , " volunteer of the first class , " recovered his freedom , and went on shore to fight the great battle of life . Unhappily , misfortunes had in the mean while beset his parents ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute want waiting to receive him on the hearthstone , he found a most pitiable poverty . His father , too , was old , and incapable of performing the duties of his profession , while his mother , still in the prime of life , had no occupation . Something , therefore , was to be done ; and Jerrold , now in his fourteenth year , resolved to do something . He would become a printer , and so earn his own living at all events , in the end . Accordingly he was apprenticed to Mr. Sidney , in the Strand ; not without hope , nay , assurance , that he should one day rise from the printer 's case to the author 's chair . We know of few things more touching and beautiful than his biographer 's account of the quiet and simple household festivity which accompanied his first earnings . The poor , weak old father , sitting there alone in the chimney-corner , // his wife and daughter absent on professional duties , shall , this day at least , have an ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joyous and affectionate son to cheer him . So young Douglas , after exhibiting his Golden Fleece with honest satisfaction to his father , sallies forth to the butcher 's to buy beef wherewithal to make a pie , returning with a volume of Sir Walter Scott in his pocket to read to his father while the pie is baking . " Yes , sir , " he would say emphatically , relating this anecdote long afterward to his friends ; " I earned the pie ; I made the pie ; I took it to the bake-house ; I fetched it home ; and my father said , Really , the boy made the crust remarkably well . ' " Political feeling at this time was of the fiercest and stormiest character . The monarch and the court were alike bankrupt both in purse and principle , reckless of their own conduct , careless of the public morality , heedless of the sufferings of the people . The Luddite insurrection had already shown its sorrowful doings in the manufacturing districts , broken costly machinery , demolished mills , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misguided proceedings . Reform was the universal cry of the liberal party , - freedom of speech , free institutions , fuller representation , and equal laws for all . Lord Sidmouth was the champion of Toryism against this cry , against the people , against the journalists . Hunt , Cobbett , and Hone fought manfully for the other party , and with what issues we now partly know , from the general course of English history . Young Jerrold , still at his case , is not unmindful of those seething , antagonistic elements ; nay , bravely throws himself on the liberal side . This bias never left him during his life . His sympathies were always with the people , never with their oppressors . He had long felt a desire to compose an original work ; and once , when Mr. Wilkinson , one of his father 's old subordinates , came to their home , he told him he would " write a piece " for him . And he kept his word ; for in his fifteenth year he composed his first play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the English Opera House , where it lay two years , and was finally , through the active interference and kindness of Mr. Wilkinson , brought out with " rapturous am // plause , " under the more attractive title of " More Frightened than Hurt . " It was subsequently translated into French , and , singularly enough , retranslated into English , and played at Madam Vestris 's Olympic Theatre , under the name of " Fighting by Proxy , " the manager thinking he had got a good thing from the French . Edmund Kean was now playing at Drury Lane , with the ear of the capital at his command , and with wealth flowing in upon him like a suddenly-loosened sea . He did not forget the poor Sheerness manager nor his son , and he gave Douglas orders to the theatre , which must have been of great value to him at this time . Mr. James Russell , also , the friend of Sir Walter Scott , and a fine scholar and critic , had discernment enough to see of what rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to encourage him to further efforts . " Russell , " he said , in after life , " was the only man , when I was a poor boy , who gave me hope ; " - and God bless him , we say , for throwing this sunbeam over the poor boy 's dark way ! Douglas was a great reader at this time , especially of Shakespeare , whom he reverently studied , and every line of whose plays he knew by heart , so that it was his pride to boast that no one could repeat a line from the great drama , . tist which he could not couple with the next following . When he was sixteen years old his master became a bankrupt , and he was transferred to the printing-office of Mr. Bigg , of Lombard Street , who was both editor and proprietor of " The Sunday Monitor , " where his first critical article - it was on Der Freischiitz - appeared . He dropped it anonymously into the editor 's letter-box , and had the pleasure of setting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correspondent , inviting further contributions . From the date of the success of his first play he resolved to devote himself to literature as a profession as soon as his engagements would permit . After twelve hours ' hard work in the printing-office , he retired at night to his chamber , and produced magazine articles and dramas in abundance ; and his subsequent life , for some years , was a dreadful struggle with sordid managers , who grew rich by his performances , and did not pay him the " wages of a carpenter . " In 1824 he married // 445 Miss Mary Swann , daughter of Thomas Swann , Esq. , of the ancient town of Wetherby , Yorkshire . His poor old father was dead , and he devoted himself to his family until his marriage , rendering them long afterward what help he could . It was not until the year 1829 that Fortune began to look with sunny eyes upon the struggling dramatist , He was now engaged by Mr. Elliston , of the Surrey Theatre , as dramatic writer to the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as the first instalment of his work , he handed over to the manager his nautical drama of " Black-E ed Susan ; or , All in the Downs . " y The immense success of this piece , which , though gradual , was surely and solidly accumulating day by day , gave Jerrold a popularity which no dramatist then living had ever obtained . Mr. T. P. Cooke personated the character of William . As " The Athenaeum " said , - " Cooke became a personage in society , as Garrick had been in the days of Goodman 's Fields . Covent Garden borrowed the play , and engaged the actor for an afterpiece . A hackney cab carried the triumphant William , in his blue jacket and white trousers , from the Obelisk to Bow Street ; and Mayfair maidens wept over the stirring situations , and laughed over the searching dialogue , which had moved , an hour before , the tears and merriment of the Borough . On the three-hundredth night of representation the walls of the theatre were illuminated , and vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane , it kept off ruin for a time even from that magnificent misfortune . Actors and managers throughout the country reaped a golden harvest . Testimonials were got up for Elliston and for Cooke on the glory of its success ; but Jerrold 's share of the gain was slight , - about seventy pounds of the many thousands which it realized for the management . " - p. 91 . This latter fact did not dishearten Jerrold . He was a brave , hopeful man , who would not be killed by the sordid wretches with whom he dealt . Nor did he sit down and rest upon his honors , but worked harder than ever , producing year after year a series of successful plays , unprecedented in the records of the drama . In 1836 he became joint manager of the Strand Theatre with his brother-in-law , Mr. W. J. Hammond , but with no great success . Nor was his attempt to impersonate // his own characters at this theatre very flattering to his pride as the creator of them . Not that he was without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects creditable , and in some instances appreciative and admirable . But acting was not his forte ; he could write dramas , but he could not play them . From this time to the year 1841 , when he became connected with Punch , he wrote not only plays , but whole volumes of fugitive pieces , which appeared for the most part in obscure journals . " The Monthly Magazine " was the chief vehicle through which he communicated with the public . But when Henry Mayhew , Mark Lemon , Henry Grattan , and others , started " Punch , or the London Charivari , " and wrote to Jerrold at Boulogne to join them , a field was opened to him , the value and importance of which he certainly could not then estimate , but which has subsequently proved to be second to that of no extant literary enterprise . It was not , however , until the periodical became the property of Messrs . Bradbury and Evans , that it was invested with the commercial facilities and attributes of success , or that it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , indeed , it took that high ground which it has since held against all competitors , and on which it stands alone in England , the oracle of wisdom and of wit . Jerrold set afloat many literary argosies during his long connection with Punch , among which were the " Shilling Magazine , " " The Illuminated Magazine , " and " Douglas Jerrold 's Weekly Newspaper . " None of these periodicals , however , were permanently successful . The " Shilling Magazine " gave the most promise ; but we suspect that it was mainly indebted for the large sale of its early numbers to the Radical reputation of the editor , and to his fine tale of " St. Giles and St. James 's . " In 1852 he became editor of " Lloyd 's Weekly Newspaper , " at a salary of five thousand dollars a year . The paper rose rapidly under his vigorous editorship , counting its weekly increase by thousands , until at last , in that fatal May of 1857 , he wrote for 182,000 subscribers . Jerrold was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from principle as from natural temperament . The only occasions when he appeared upon the platform as a speaker were the Conversazione of the Polytechnic Institution in Birmingham , the Athena*um Soir6e in Manchester , the formation of the Whittington Club in London , and the presentation of a copy of Shakespeare to Kossuth at the London Tavern . He made successful speeches at all these places , except at Birmingham , where he was so overpowered by nervousness that he was unable to utter more than a few broken sentences . Nature had not designed him for an orator . He had neither the presence , the voice , nor the nerve which are so necessary to rhetorical success . Nor had he the faculty of extemporaneous speech , although he possessed whole mines of material for speech . It is clear from the structure of the speeches already alluded to , which are preserved by his son in the Memoirs , that lie had carefully prepared them beforehand . They are like , and yet unlike , his usual style of writing . We see Jerrold in them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , does not sit well upon him , nor become him . His speeches cost him great effort , both in their composition and delivery . And now , having given an outline of Jerrold 's public career as an author , let us visit him at his own home , that we may see and know what manner of man he was in domestic life . The following picture , furnished by his son , from whose charming biography we have taken the main facts woven into this notice , will introduce him to us at once - " It is a bright morning , about eight o'clock , at West Lodge , Putney Lower Common . The windows at the side of the old house , buried in trees , afford glimpses of a broad common , tufted with purple heather and yellow gorse . Gypsies are encamped where the blue smoke curls amid the elms . A window-sash is shot sharply up . A clear , small voice is heard singing within . And now a long roulade , whistled softly , floats out . A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short shooting-jacket , the throat quite open , without collar or kerchief , and crowned with a straw hat , pushes through the gate of the cottage , and goes with short , quick steps , assisted by a stout stick , over the common . A little black and tan terrier follows , and rolls over the grass at intervals , as a response to a cheery word from its master . The Gypsy encampment // is reached . The Gypsies know their friend , and a chat and a laugh ensue . Then a deep gulp of the sweet morning air , a dozen branches pulled to the nose here and there in the garden , the children kissed , and breakfast , and the morning papers . " The breakfast is a jug of cold new milk , some toast , bacon , watercresses . Perhaps a few strawberries have been found in the garden . A long examination of the papers , - here and there a bit of news energetically read aloud , then cut , and put between clippers . Then silently , suddenly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . All about it are books . Crowning the shelves are Milton and Shakespeare . A bit of Shakespeare 's mulberry-tree lies upon the mantel-piece . Above the sofa are The Rent Day , ' and Distraining for Rent , ' Wilkie 's two pictures , in the corner of which is Wilkie 's kind inscription to the author of the drama called The Rent Day . Under the two prints laughs Sir Joshua 's sly Puck , perched upon a pulpy mushroom . Turner 's Heidelberg ' is here too , and the engraver thereof will drop in presently - he lives close at hand - to see his friend Douglas Jerrold . Ariadne and Dorothea decorate the chimney-piece . The furniture is simple , solid oak . The desk has not a speck upon it . The marble shell upon which the inkstand rests has no litter in it . Various notes lie in a row , between clips , on the table . The paper basket stands near the arm-chair , prepared for answered letters and rejected contributions . The little dog follows his master into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins . If it be a comedy , the author will now and then walk rapidly up and down the room , talking wildly to himself ; if it be Punch copy , you shall hear him laugh presently as he hits upon a droll bit . Suddenly the pen will be put down , and through a little conservatory , without seeing anybody , the author will pass out into the garden , where he will talk to the gardener , or watch , chuckling the while , the careful steps of the little terrier amid the gooseberry-bushes ; or pluck a hawthorn leaf and go nibbling it , and thinking , down the side-walks . " In again , and vehemently to work . The thought has come ; and , in letters smaller than the type in which they shall presently be set , it is unrolled along the little blue slips of paper . A simple crust of bread and a glass of wine are brought in by a dear female hand ; but no word is spoken , and the hand and dear heart disappear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly . The pen is dashed aside ; a few letters , seldom more than three lines in each , are written , and despatched to the post ; and then again into the garden . " - pp. 273 - 275. // Friends drop in , and join Jerrold in his tent on the lawn . They must stay to dinner of course ; for who ever went away empty from his hospitable gates ? Simple , hearty , big-boy dinners they were too , sometimes ; full of fun , and wit , and the roar of a mighty mirth , - all the merrier because sober guests were present , so that the rule seemed to be , the more intellect , the more noise and jollity . On one occasion Mr. Charles Dickens , Mr. Maclise , Mr. Macready , and Mr. John Forster , after a banquet in the tent , did outrageously perpetrate a practical game of leap-frog , knocking one another heels over head , stumbling , falling , and kicking the air as they lay on the greensward in all the agonies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slight , and active figure of Douglas Jerrold , his hair blowing wildly over his face , which was flushed with animation , and his blue eyes , like Carpathian violets , flashing joyously under the shaggy eyebrows . When there was dancing , although he had not educated legs , he would insist upon a jig , or a whirl , almost tiring his lady partner to death with his grotesque awkwardness , till finally , " convulsed with laughter , " he would lead her to her seat . " He was the most helpless among men . He never brushed his hat ; never opened a drawer to find a collar ; never knew where he had put his stick . Everything must be to his hand . His toilet was performed usually with his back to the glass . It mattered not to him that his kerchief was awry . Plain linen and country washirur ' he used to cite* containing all a man need care for in the matter of dress His evenings at home , when not devoted to writing ( and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , were spent usually alone in his study , with some favorite author . " - pp. 277 , 278 . He had many true , good friends ; but he loved Dickens , after poor Blanchard , best of all . Indeed , the friendship of Jerrold and Dickens , extending through the palmiest years of their lives , so full of mutual affections , good offices , and intellectual encouragements , is one of the most beautiful episodes in the recent history of letters . Jerrold was generous to a fault , and his check-book was always open to the wants of others . He was often swindled ; 38 * // but he went on , hoping for better fortune the next time , and believing to the last that human nature was great and good . " The last time , " says his son , " that he signed his check-book , was to oblige a friend ; the last letter he received was one in which the repayment of a loan was deferred . Now he heard of a friend who had lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drawn , and a tender letter was written . " - pp. 292 , 293 . Upon the whole , we find that this " heartless cynic " was not altogether heartless ; but , on the contrary , that he was a man to be loved and reverenced . On his death-bed he was deeply affected by the golden glory of the sunset . It was symbolical of his own sun , now lingering tremulously on the edge of life 's horizon . " The sun is setting , " he said , sorrowfully gazing at it . And then his great heart - all the flood-gates of its love broken loose - must give death-bed sureties of his affection . " Tell the dear boys , " he said , referring to his Punch associates , " that if I ye ever wounded any of them , I ye always loved them . " " You are friends with H ? " " Yes , yes ! God bless him ! " He was patient and resigned . " How do you feel ? " asked the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . " He died on the 8th of June , 185T , with his wife and children weeping around him , his hands in the clasped palms of his two sons , and his last words were , " This is as it should be . " Friends came and knelt reverently and lovingly by his bedside , kissed his poor , pale hands , and , with sobs of agony , cried aloud , " Good-by , dear Douglas ! " But he heard them not . Forever and forever the dark curtain had fallen over the drama of his life ; and on the 15th of June , 1857 , the cold mortality of this dear , great-hearted , high-souled Douglas was consigned to its last resting-place in Norwood , not far from the grave of his well-beloved Laman Blanchard .
