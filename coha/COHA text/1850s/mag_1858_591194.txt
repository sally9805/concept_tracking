*TERXATIONAL COPYRIGHT-THE CLAIMS OF LITERATURE . THE recent Literary Congress of Brussels ( having for its object the settlement of National and International Copyright , and the establishment of a fixed basis for the compensation of authors ) , has again drawn the attention of the public to a question which , though often discussed , has never been satisfactorily solved . When we consider the number of conflicting interests involved , and that those in whose name legislation is asked are not the only real parties interested , the maze of complication becomes still more intricate . Instead of one individual to arrest our sympathy and challenge our commiseration , we have four : all deserving , all complaining , all impossible to satisfy . First comes the Foreign Author , foreign only because divided from us by the trackless ocean , but nuited to us by the ties of a common origin , a common language , and mutual literature . He points to the garbled edition of his works , which we hold in our hand , and either entreats us to pay our fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out , cultivated , and enclosed ; or , taking higher ground , reproaches us for not giving him a fair hearing by requiring an unmutilated and certified edition of his works . Whilst we are on the point of yielding to the apparent justice of his claim , the American publisher hastens to explain that this plaintive author has already parted with all property in the fruits of his genius in favor of the foreign publisher , arid that any legislation on the subject whilst it would only add to the already boundless wealth of the latter , would be depriving hundreds of our own people of the honest and honorable support they now derive from the manufacture of paper , types , and the various appliances for the production of books . He tells of the millions of minds needing intellectual // culture and anxiously devouring the cheap editions of standard works , which his predatory excursions into the camp of his rival enable him to bring back , and feelingly asks , whether , to satisfy a few greedy cormorants , we would arrest the march of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rare instances , his reputation has become world-wide , complains that his works are unheeded , or scorned , by the reading public of Europe , and demands that vengeance be taken on the writers fdr the contempt of the readers ; whilst again the British publisher proclaims himself ready and anxious to introduce our literature to his countrymen provided he can do so without pecuniary loss . In spite of the vehemence of self-interest with which all parties uphold their claims , we can not lose sight of the great principle of justice which gives a man the reward of his labor . The time when a crown of leaves was a tribute worthy to repay the productions of Homer has passed away , and it has gone by from the fact that the march of civilization is always to be measured by the enhanced appreciation of the value of property , suggesting a different reward . This appreciation proves our superiority over the boasted nations of antiquity who were but one degree removed from the nomadic tribes whose achievements they sang , and we doubt not that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first yearning which civilized man experiences is the desire for property . Property may be defined as the right inherent in every man to the unrestricted possession and disposition of such evidences of value , as he has acquired by industry , inheritance , or purchase . Whilst all men agree that land , reduced to possession , is inalienable , without the consent of him to whom it belongs , except by process of law , and whilst barriers of every kind are set up to shut out every intrusion upon the ownership of the objects of material industry , the articles forged in the workshop of the brain , the hard-earned results of sleepless nights and hours of anxious study , have ever been subject to the predatory attacks of the avaricious and designing . // ile who invents some lThtle article of daily household use , is enabled , under the protection of the Patent Laws , to realize an ample fortune , and hunts with all the vengeance of outraged justice the intruder on his franchise . But he who spins out for the instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibres of his brain , if he escape scathing criticism , or unmerited abuse , is almost sure to be robbed of the material reward of his labors , and lose his reputation with succeeding ages , unless he possess sufficient capital , or established literary reputation , to command his own terms in the arena of letters . Should an author , whilst fortunate enough to secure in his own land the acknowledgment of those rights which he enjoys in common with every manufacturer , be anxious to avail himself of the benefits of a reputation extended beyond the sea , he is cried down as actuated by sordid motives , and pointed at as perverting his genius to mercenary ends . For nearly half a century after our Revolution had given us a political entity among the nations of the world , the IRepublic of Letters failed to acknowledge our existence , or to look upon us either as producers or consumers . When , however , the dense forests of the West had given place to thriving villages , and religious fanaticism had ceased to afford vent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply follows the demand was quickly carried out , and European publishers flooded our country with the refuse productions of their stores . Authors having no claim to consideration at home , looked eagerly forward to a new field , and became clamorous for laws , which should secure to them a portion of the ripening harvest abroad . We all remember how Dickens originally came , a self-constituted ambassador to America , to awaken our sense of the propriety of paying for the anrusements he had afforded to us-how we received him with a public ovation and toasted him in rivers of champagne , but allowed him to return home without any substantial advantages , to give vent to his indignation in a work charged with overdrawn pictures of our vanity and foibles , and swell // 1858 . The OZaim8 of Literatftre. 457 the list of foreign ant hors who have made us objects of ridicule and abuse . In a work called " Society in * published in 1837 , by a celebrated female writer ( Miss Martinean ) , we find the following : - " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superficial character of scholarship , of the depression , or rather of the non-existence of literature . Some hope that matters will be better hereafter , merely from the nation having grown older . The greaternumber ascribe the mischief to men having to work at their employments , and a few of these believe that America would have a literature if only she had a hereditary aristocracy . This being supposed the only method of leaving to individuals the leisure and freedom of spirit necessary for literary pursuits . It has been pointed out that this is a niistake . Nature and social economy do not so argue as that genius is usually given to those who have hereditary wealth ; the capability has so much more frequently shown itself among the busy and poor , than among the rich who have leisure , as to mock the human presumption which would dictate from whose lips the oracles of Heaven should issue . One needs but to glance over the array of geniuses , of philosophers , of scientific men , and even of the far lower order of scholars , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued from classic shades . " As long as we had little or nothing to proffer in exchange it was a matter of small moment to us to consider this subject in a national point of view ; but now that Stevens , Prescott , Motley , Bancroft , and Sparks , have brought up from the ashes of stagnation the memories of the past , and given a galvanic life to nations who have long since run their race , and Irving , Cooper , Brown , and Longfellow , have drawn upon their fertile fancy such rich drafts , we are in danger of losing more than we gain , by allowing this to remain a questio vexctta . The frequent intercourse produced by steam comrnunication , and the anticipated success of the telegraph , should have the effect of breaking down sectional distinctions and throwing all nations into one , and as no one hesitates to acknowledge the justice of a copyright as between the most 30 // 458 Irnerncgional Cop yrigkt- Dec. distant portions of our Union , so , should an international one be once established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have so long existed without it . In the days of Pope and Swift , Ireland was the great field for literary piracy , and proof sheets were often stolen from the printing office during the progress of work , so that a cheap counterfeit edition coming out simultaneously destroyed the sale of the original . Belgium supplies the travelling public with copies of French and English books at so cheap a rate as to defy competition , and induce a strict and vigilant search on the frontier . All reprints are forfeited both in France and England , even when in private hands , and evidently used to beguile the tedium of the road . A translation , partaking as it does of the nature of an original work ; might perhaps be considered as an exception from the law of exclusive ownership . Indeed there have been translations which have surpassed and superseded the works they were intended to reproduce . The question as to what classes of productions are entitled to copyright was often and elaborately argued in the case of Wheaton against Peters , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the f ) ecisious and Arguments in Courts of Law could not become so exclusively the property of the reporter , as to give him a monopoly in their reproduction . Since , then , originality is the basis of the right , it is certainly . j ust that every encouragement should be given to its development . Many a mute inglorious Milton is said to have gone down to the tomb , carrying with him ideas worthy of immortality , ideas to which he would have given vent had not the necessity of constant , daily , and unremitted , mechanical occupation confined and repressed his genius . Who can doubt that Lamb , had he been free from the servitnde of the India House , would have enriched our literature with many more classic gems ; or that Moore 's acceptance of an office in Bermuda , and its attendant pecuniary embarrassments , robbed us of many oriental tales ? Instances there are where men have risen superior to circumstances , as Gil Blas , composed by Le Sage to beguile // the tedium of a prison ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to procure the means to bury his mother ; Milton , and our own Prescott , contending against blindness ; and the remarkable case of the musical small coal man , who gave concerts in London over a stable , and , after carrying the bag all day , entertained with the productions of Mozart the 6lite of that metropolis . Pope had to struggle with ill-health , and De Quincey , whilst the dreams of opium form a great feature in his works , certainly enervated his powers by the use of that drug . Yet who can doubt that in each and every instance , had their native genius been fostered instead of repl ? essed , their productions would have been as superior to what they are in the state in which we now find them , as the fruit raised in the hot-house exceeds in size and beauty the wild grape of our swamps . The chief arguments against giving to literary men all the advantages they claim from their works , come from members of their own class . The modern historiographer of England recently stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humble Bunyan , or Walter Scott , could have left to their descendants the exclusive property in their works , their fortunes would be larger than those of the richest peers of the realm , and the men who derived their claims to hereditary legislation from the conquest of William . The debaucheries of Charles IL , or the peer-creating propensities of Pitt , trembled at the contamination and scouted the idea . Yet why should it be more absurd for a descendant of Shakespeare to be collecting his interest for the use of his manuscript than for a modern Percy to be living in luxury because a Smithson had chanced to marry the heiress of all the Korthumberlands , and merged his own name , rank , and fortune in a ducal title ; or the fact that very recently a Duke of Grafton received a million to compromise a perpetual rent-charge on the post-office , by which the merry monarch had provided for the offspring of a courtezan . When we see the lineal descendant of a girl who vended oranges at the door of that theatre where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and decked with the highest title a British subject can possess , may we not dispute the force of this objection , and of those sentiments which are so strongly expressed in the celebrated couplet by the literary son of an English duke " Let arts and commerce , arms and science die , But leave us still our o*d nobility , " It is our freedom from this bowing down to title , our disregard for the so-called " anointed of the Lord , " and our unflinching assertion , that the dignity of man is personal , and not trausmissive , which makes our people native orators , whilst the best educated Englishman trembles and hesitates in the presence of his audience ; and it is this element which will give a distinctive character to our literature , by enabling our historians to judge unprejudicedly as to the real merits of those sovereigns , who , like dead lions , are approached with awe by continental critics . When Shakespeare says that " Such a dignity doth hedge about a king that treason can but peer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished respect for hereditary rule , and great as he was as an author , is unable to conquer the force of habit ; and we find Johnson , the dogmatical , argumentative , and truthful - whose dictionary is the sheet-anchor of our language , and whose sayings rank as proverbs-trembling , and unable to utter three consecutive words when addressed by a sovereign , half of whose life was spent in the madhouse , and whose only attributes were those which have ever been hereditary in the House of Brunswick , viz. , obstinacy , imbecility , and gluttony . The same stern moralist declares , that whilst all men are entitled to a similar amount of respect , the money of the rich man should be respected also , and give him a double representation . So recently as the Congress , to which we allude in our opening , it is with shame we read that the yery men whom Scribe , one of their number , calls " the kings of intellect , " suspended their session to thank his Royal Highness the young Duke of Brabant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following extract from the works of that historian already alluded to , as hostile to perpetual copyright , shows that these exhibitions of humility were excelled by members of the same class a century and a half ago in England , and points out the cause : - " The recompense which the wits of that age could obtain from the public was so small , that they were under the necessity of eking out their incomes by levying contributions on the great . Every rich and good-natured lord was pestered by authors with a mendicancy so importunate , and a flattering so abject , as may in our time seem incredible . The ratron to whom a work was inscribed was expected to reward the writer with a purse of gold . The fee paid for the dedication of a book was often much larger than the sum which any bookseller would give for the copyright . Books were therefore often printed merely that they might be dedicated . This traffic in praise completed the degradation of the literary character . Adulation , pushed to the verge sometimes of nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poet . Independence , veracity , self-respect , were things not expected by the world from him ; in truth he was in morals something between a pander and a beggar . " The following resolutions , which were passed at the opening of the Brussels Congress , may , from the unanimity with which they were adopted , be taken as demonstrating the views of literary men throughout the world , with regard to the subject of which we treat " First Resolved : It is the sense of this Congress that the - principle of international recognition of property in works of literature and art in favor of their authors , ought to have place in the legislation of every civilized people . " Second , Resolved : The Congress is of opinion that the principle should be admitted between different countries even in the absence of reciprocity . " Third , Resolved : The assimnilati6n of foreign and national authors ought to be absolute and complete . " Fourth , Resolved : It is improper to subject foreign authors to particular formalities in admitting them to claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffices in order that the right should appertain to them that they should have observed the formalities required by the laws of the country . " Fifth , Resolved : It is desirable that every country should adopt for property in works of literature and art a legislation reposing on a uniform basis . " The great obstacle to the rendering of justice to authors has been the fact that interest rendered the publishers , with whom they had to treat , hostile and antagonistic , and that whilst they were , as a class , abject , mendacious , an4*J isolated , the publisher , possessed of that appearance of dignity and self-respect which prosperity bestows , enjoys , in the union of the trade , the power of closing the market against a recusant author and reducing him to subjection . When we look back in literary history , and see publishers insolent in success , rejecting books which now occupy choice places on our shelves , and striving to give a fictitious importance to trash decked out in costly binding-when we see them driving Goldsmith and Savage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Richardson or a Cibber-may we not justly ask that the author shall have such a title to his creations as shall enable him to maintain a hold upon them till they shall have stood the test of time ? When it is acknowledged that , without almost a single exception , the works now recognised as of unapproachable excellence were rejected at their birth , we do not wonder at the feverish excitement which takes possession of authors when arguing the point. * " The right which an author may be supposed to have in his own original literary compositions so that no other person without his leave may publish or make profit of the copies , is classed by Blackstone among the species of property acquired by occupancy , being grounded on labor and invention . When a man , by the exertion of his rational powers , has produced an original work , he seems to have a clear right to dispose of that identical work as he pleases ; and any attempt to vary the disposition he has made of it appears to be an invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man wrote anything on the paper or parchment of another , the writing should belong to the owner of the blank materials , meaning thereby the mechanical operation of writing , for which it directed the scribe to receive a satisfaction , for in works of genius and invention , as in painting on another man 's canvas , the same law gave the canvas to the painter . As to any other property in the works of the under- // 1858.1 The Claims of Literature . The march of civilization is naturally aggressive . No measure of public improvement can be proposed , but some private interest rises up to hamper and thwart it . In two forms of ' government alone , therefore , can progress have full scope , the pure republic and the absolute despotism . Opposite as are their natures , their workings are sometimes identical for good , from the power they possess to bring an overwhelming force to bear upon a given point . The theory of republics , that the private interest of the individual is merged in the good of the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent for what is wanted for public occupancy , a theory every day developed in the workings of our municipal government , sweeps down private opposition . The will of the all-powerful dictator of an empire decrees that nuisances shall be abated and disappear , and provides the arms to carry out its dicta . The last kingly government of France was , during its whole career , from factious opposition , unable to remove some paltry barriers to the extension and embellishment of Paris . The present Emperor spoke the word , and an army of masons came from the provinces , tore down , built up , and replaced , as by enchantment , dingy abortions and polluted . dens , with broad avenues , splendid palaces , and models of architectural beauty . If , then , the voice of the organ of popular sovereignty , raised in the just cause of a persecuted class , shall find a responsive echo in our legislative halls , the admirable resolutions of the Con- standing , the law is silent , though the sale of literary copies for the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times of Terence , Martial , and Statius .

A similar privilege is extended to the inventions of prints and engravings by 8 George .11 c. 13 ; 7 Geo . III . c. 35 ; 17 Geo . IlL c. 57 .
