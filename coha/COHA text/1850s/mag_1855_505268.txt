txt DARIEN EXPLORING EXPEDITION , * UNDER COMMAND OF LIEUT. iSAAC C. STRAIN . BY J. T. HEADLEY . I WILL now transfer the course of the narrative to the proceedings of the advanced party , which left the main body on the 13th of February . Breakfastless , but full of hope , the four adventurers set out , and after making a detour in the forest to avoid undergrowth , again struck the river , where the walking was good . Truxton 's camp was in sight , and Strain hailed it to bid the party keep the bank . Following this * Concluded from the April Number . // qwq The day following ( February 22 ) the marching a part of the time was tolerably easy , but Wilson and Golden began to show signs of debility . Strain , nearly naked , went ahead and cleared a way with his cutlass . On finding the bushes too thick , he would plunge into them head foremost to break them down , trampling them underfoot for those behind . During the day he killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men of it , lest they should become alarmed . Golden carrying no fire-arms , was often ordered forward to cut a path , but to-day he gave out completely , and when given the cutlass and directed to go to work , he laid the instrument down on the ground , then stretched himself beside it , and wept like a child . Destitution and toil were telling on him . He was a fine , splendid-looking young man , only twenty-two years of age , and brave as a lion ; but this was a form of evil he had never dreamed of . The next morning they proceeded on their journey through the woods and along the banks until one P.M. , making about five miles , when they halted , as Strain had a most painful boil on his right instep , which prevented him from marching or wearing any boot . He was , moreover , suffering severely from a fall into a deep ravine the day before . Near the camp , where the river runs S.S.W. , a small stream ( the Uporganti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might still be upon the Iglesias , as a small stream is shown on the map , coming into that river four miles from its mouth , and another about eleven miles above . About four o'clock , as they lay stretched around on the bank of the river , they were startled by a heavy booming sound , like that of a gun , which they thought at once came from Darien Harbor , the " El Dorado " of the expedition . The delusion for a moment made every heart bound . In the morning ( February 24 ) Strain made a moccasin from a leather legging which formerly belonged to Truxton , who had proposed to boil it down and eat it . The former , however , prevented him , saying they might yet need it for moccasins . So it turned out , and but for this very insignificant circumstance , it is very doubtful whether Strain could ever have got through at all , and consequently the whole party would have perished . On such simple suggestions , growing out of the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men often depends . Slinging his spare boot to his blanket for future service , Strain gave the order to march at half past six , fondly hoping to reach Darien Harbor before night , but having traveled with great pain some eight miles , and seeing no signs of tide-water , at five o'clock encamped on a sand-bank . Having passed during the day two or three rapids with some ten or twelve feet fall , they consoled themselves with the reflection that this accounted for the absence of tides . During the day Strain killed a bird about the size of a partridge , which they ate raw . I find the following recorded in the journal : " Saturday , February 25 . Slept well last night , the camp being free from mosquitoes . Se* out at eight A.M. , and found bad walking all day , both in the forest and on the beaches which we met . In the former we had to cut our way , while the beaches were so steep that we had sometimes to cut steps to crawl along , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , which I did on one occasion . " Encamped about six P.M. on a mud hank , having made about six miles . During the day 's march we found about thirty-two clams , which , divided , gave us something to support life , as the acid nut-skins are less ripe than some miles above , while their kernels are so hard as to be almost inedible in the existing state of our teeth , which have been deprived of their enamel by the use of the acid . " Saw several turkeys , but could obtain none , owing to the state of our fire-arms , which had become almost useless . My carbine , qvhich was the best in the party , being loaded with difficulty , and requiring two men to fire it , one to take aim and pull the trigger , and the other to pull the cock back , and let it go at the word , invariably destroying the aim ; under these circumstances I am not ashamed to say that I fired several times at turkeys without success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighing some 300 pounds , which came rushing toward us as if intending to attack , but paused about twenty yards distant . Considering the ferocity of this animal , and the state of our fire-arms , I should have hesitated in attacking him had we not been so pressed for food ; but it was a matter of life and death in either case . I took deliberate aim at his body behind the shoulders , and with the assistance of Wilson fired my carbine , wounding him severely . I feared firing at his head , lest I should miss him altogether . After receiving the ball he paused a moment , as if uncertain whether to attack , after which he rushed off rapidly some fifty yards , when he was seized with a coughing fit , and slackened his pace to a walk . Handing my carbine to Wilson to reload , I followed him into the jungle , but soon lost him in the darkness of the forest . I am inclined to believe that this animal was not the peccary or wild hog of tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either in his own generation or that of his progenitors had become wild , because I do not think the peccary ever grows so large . his color was black , with white spots . I passed an almost sleepless night in regretting that we had not obtained him , for at this time food was our only thought , except to push through and obtain assistance for those behind . " The next morning ( Sunday ) they started early , but the long absence of food had so debilitated them that the marching was slow and difficult . They could make but short distances without being compelled to halt for a long rest . This tattered , skeleton group of four , stretched silent and sad in the forest beside that mysterious , unknown river , presented a most piteous // spectacle . It is very doubtful whether the men ever would have started again but for the orders of their commander . As they staggered up to a jungle , Strain , after exhausting himself in clearing a path , would order the men to take their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that often nothing but threats of the severest flogging could rouse them to make another effort for their lives . At length their attention was arrested by the cry of a wild animal . It proved to be the howling of a monkey , and the men , elated at the prospect of food , cried out , " There 's a monkey , Captain , shoot him ! , " Cut away , " replied Strain , thinking that the noise would excite its curiosity to come nearer . He was right , for the creature kept leaping from tree to tree , until at length it sat crouched on a limb directly above Strain , who was lying upon his back on the ground . His carbine being damaged , he took the Sharpe 's rifle belonging to Avery , and shooting nearly perpendicularly , sent a ball through the monkey 's neck . The rifle , however , being loaded with stronger powder than usual , recoiled , cutting Strain 's eyebrow and seriously endangering the eye itself . The monkey , after receiving the wound , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His distrust of the rifle , however , distracted his aim , when he drew a pistol and shot the creature through the heart . She fell over dead , but her tail would not uncoil , and she hung suspended from the limb . Strain then turned to take care of his eye , saying to the men , " If you want that monkey you must cut down the tree . " Though tired and feeble , they attacked it with a will , and notwithstanding the trunk was three feet in circumference , and they had only a cutlass to work with , soon had it down . This monkey was a prize . She was soon cut up , and portions of her crammed into a tin kettle , wfiich was placed over a blazing fire . Each one took turns at the pot , and they kept it up till midnight , when the aninoal was nearly all devoured . Weighing some twenty pounds , she gave about five pounds to a man . The starved men , however , were not satisfied , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strain , with that foresight which again and again saved his little band , refused to give up , saying he should yet need it for lashings in making a raft . This feast was on Sunday night , and the next morning at ten o'clock they pushed on ; but the thick undergrowth was almost impassable , and after cutting for seven hours , making only three quarters of a mile per hour , they encamped on a damp clay bank . During the day they crossed several deep ravines , down the steep banks of which they were compelled to slide , and then cut steps in the opposite sides , up which to climb to the top . The course of march was generally southerly . The journal at this place remarks , that then , and for some time previous , " our bodies were literally covered with wood ticks , and we were obliged to pick them off morning and evening . " During the march Strain shot three small hawks , upon which they made their scanty supper . They suffered severely from mosquitoes during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again afoot ; and proceeding about two miles over some hills , discovered a considerable river ( the Iglesia ) , entering from the northeast . After making in all about six miles , they encamped at six in the evening. * Their only food this day consisted entirely of acid nuts , which were gradually wearing away the teeth . Having suffered less than usual from mosquitoes , Strain roused his little party at daybreak , and by six o'clock they were again cutting their slow and almost interminable path to the Pacific . After making some six miles they encamped on a bank of rock and indurated clay . During the day they had nothing whatever to eat , and when they halted the whole party were thoroughly worn out . They were too tired even to kindle a fire , but lay down in the darkness and slept on the cheerless bank of the stream . Strain now began to think of another raft , as all were so thoroughly debilitated , and so covered with boils , sores , and scratches that they could not much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost disabled , while the men were becoming daily more and more discouraged . Golden-who was a fine , hale young man when he left the Cyane-was fearfully attenuated , and his spirit so utterly broken , that when ordered to do the least work he would lie down and weep bitterly . For several days Strain could make him march only by threatening to tie him up and flog him : then his dread of physical pain overcame for the timebeing his debility . Had he not resorted to this expedient , he would have been obliged to leave him to perish , or remain and perish with him . Strain had once or twice thrown out a hint of his intention to build another raft ; but found the two men violently opposed to it , as the danger they had incurred on the last completely intimidated them . But finding the river bends deeper , free from rapids , and comparatively free from snags , he determined to carry out his design at all hazards , especially as he felt convinced that the condition of his foot would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days longer . The constant irritation , produced by contact with bushes and vines , was rapidly extending the inflammation from the ankle , down the instep and up the leg . At first the men were disheartened ; but when told that they need not get on the raft , but might keep along shore in sight , while lie and Mr. Avery managed it , they were better contented . That night being unmolested by mosquitoes Says Strata in his jonrual : " I may remark that our time was estimated , as my pocket-chronometerhad stopped soon after leaving the main body ; probably owing to the dampness of the climate , which affects every time-piece ant secured by a hunting case . Then , it simost appeared to me that time had refused to register the tedious hours which we passed in the wilderness . On some occasions almost all men become to a certain extent superstitious . " // they had a quiet rest , and , though without food , began early in the morning to collect sticks for the raft ; but the general debility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their progress very slow , and it was sunset before they had enough brought together and lashed to float two persons . In the evening Mr. Avery and Strain obtained some hard nuts and a small quantity of palmetto , which was all the food they had eaten for two days . Says Straia in his jonrnal : " This was the second time during the expedition that I really felt voracious ; and before obtaining the nuts and palmetto , I found myself casting my eyes around me to see if there was nothing that had been overlooked that could allay my hunger . Without a fire , which at this time we never lighted unless we had meat to cook , as we wished to economize our ammunition , we laid down and slept near our raft . " The next day Strain and Avery got on the raft , and the two floated slowly down the stream , while Golden and Wilson forced their way along the shore . Thus , two on the raft and two on shore , they proceeded day after day-an occasional halloo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotony of the hours . In making the bends sharp paddling was necessary , which , in their debilitated condition , was very exhausting . The second day they found a dead iguana , with the head eaten off . This they cooked and divided among them . The two men roasted the skin and chewed that . This miserable raft consisted of six half-decayed , broken trunks of trees lashed together with monkey skins and vines . Strain , half-naked , and with his legs dangling in the water , sat on the forward end to steer , while his companion occupied the hinder part to assist . Now a tree in the distance chock-full of white cranes , and again a panther gazing on them with a bewildered stare , or young tigers , were the only objects that relieved the noiseless and apparently endless solitude . To pass away the time , Strain one day made Avery tell his history ; at another time he would narrate from Don Quixotte some amusing story . At length starvation prodneed the same singular effect on them that it did on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describing all the good dinners they had ever eaten . For the last two or three days , when most redneed , Strain said that he occupied almost the whole time in arranging a magnificent dinner . Every luxury or curious dish that he had ever seen or heard of composed it , and he wore away the hours in going round his imaginary table , arranging and changing the several dishes . He could not force his mind from the contemplation of this , so wholly had one idea-food-taken possession of it . The animal nature , deprived of its support , was evidently closing with resistless force over the soul , and in a few days more would completely force it from its crumbling , falling tenement . On the 4th of March , however , as they sat on shore eating a portion of a dead , tainted lizard , Strain heard a sudden roaring behind , and on looking up stream saw a rapid which they had just passed in smooth water . He knew at once that they must have floated over it at high tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear they had at last reached tide-water . This was Strain 's birthday , and he was looking out for some good luck . He , however , ( lid not mention his discovery to the men , lest there might be some mistake . But they soon discovered it themselves , and cried out in transport , " Oh , 6laptein , here is tide ! here is tide ! " That night Strain could not sleep until the time for flood-tide again arrived , and at eleven o'clock he took a fire-brand and went down to the shore to see how it was going . The doubt was overthey had reached the swellings of the Pacific , and hope was rekindled in every bosom . The time after this passed wearily . When it was flood-tide they lashed to the shore , and as the ebb commenced cut loose and slowly drifted down stream . At every turn they strained eagealy forward , hoping to get some look-ou4 or see some signs of civilization ; but the same unbroken wilderness shut them in . Having ascertained how high the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gunge , and prove conclusively that there was no great occasion for hope , as they were yet probably at least a hundred and fifty miles from the sea . Anxious to get forward , they could not spend time to hunt ; and a half dozen kernels of the palm nut , hard as ivory , would often constitute a meal . At length , on the 9th , Strain saw that food must be obtained , or the men would sink and die without making farther progress . He therefore put Golden in his place with Avery on the raft , and taking Wilson with him struck into the woods to forage . Onlyfrur cartridges were left to them ; and as Strain turned jtway with the rifle , Avery exclaimed , " For God 's sake , Strain , do n't shoot at any thing less than a terke*-remeo6er there are only four cartridges left ! " After beating about for some time and finding nothing , he came upon a partridge sitting on a limb . The temptation was too strong to be resisted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the moment he had done so , as on that single cartridge might yet hang the lives of all the party . At length , however , he came upon a grove of palm nuts . By tightening his cartridge-belt around him , and filling his flannel shirt above it with nuts , he soon had all he could carry , and turned back to the river . But the two got entangled in a swamp , and were wholly exhausted before they could extricate themselves . Wilson then began to beg for the partridge ; hut Strain told him it was for the party , and must be divided equally . The man at length fell down , and said he could and would go no farther without that partridge . Strain then threw it to him , saying " Take it , " and sat down on a log to see him devour it . The starving wretch torc it asunder ; but still , feeling that his commander needed it as much as he did , said , " C*otain , do // you want the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter . " Do you wont the entrails ? " " No . " I-Jo then flung him a piece of the bird , and gorged the rest . At length they reached the river , and kept down the hank . Ahout three o'clock , Strain was startled hy Wilson 's exclaiming , " My God Sir , there is the raft ! " and sure enough , there it was , deserted and floatinu quietly in the middle of the river , awaiting the action of the tide ( it was then slack water ) to determine its course . The sight of that ahandoned structure at first struck like an ice-bolt to the heart of both , but a single glance showed Strain that the blankets , spare arms , etc. , had been taken away , and another , that about eight feet of rope , which had been used to lash the logs , was left untouched , while one of the paddles still remained , lie concluded at once that the party had either obtained assistance and left the raft-in which case they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or that they had been murdered by Indians , who had left the raft adrift for the purpose of entrapping the remainder . In answer to Wilson 's anxious inquiries , he frankly told him his conjectures . " Well , Sir , " replied Wilson , " if there be Indians ahout von have three cartridges left , and are certain of three men , and I think with my machete I can give an account of two more . " This was the ring of the true metal , and pleased Strain much . While awaiting the pra ess of the raft , which drifted slowly to*vard their side of the river , they passed their leisure time in eating nuts . Finally , seeing it foul of some drift-wood about one hundred yards below , they after some difficulty got upon it , and proceeded with the current down the river . Strain , however , first made a thorough examination , to see if there was any blood or other evidence of a struggle upon it , or a note from Mr. Avery which might unravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearing on the left bank ; and soon after , in passing the mouth of a small stream on the same side , discovered two canoes approaching raj ) idly front below . Not feeling assnre ( l that the three paddlers were not Indians , who might prm'e hostile , as they were colored and spoke loudly in a dialect which , at a distance , lie cotdd not understand , Strain determined to keep them at arms ' length until assured of their l ) eaceah ) he intentions , lie accordingly hailed when they came within rifleshot , and asked who they were and wI mere they were going . They replied , in Spanish , that they were friends , had just taken ott his coml ) anions , anmi brought a letter to himself . True to his naval princiPles , never to let an enemy apliroach too near without declaring his intentions , Strain sat across the log amul hailed as though he trod the deck of a man-of-war . These two skeletons on a mass of drift-wood thus demanding explanations , were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vessel stand off till sIte showed liar colors . When convinced , however , of the l ) eweal ) le intentions of the natives , they gladly abandoned the raft and entered the canoe . Finding that the boatmen had tobacco amid a p*pe , Strain immediately borrowed thieni , and , for time first time since the 4th of February , enjoyed the luxury of a snioke . It was just dark wlmemi they readied the village of Yavisa . TIme excitenment was over-the // immediate necessity of effort past , and Strain 's over-tasked nature gave way . He could no longer walk , and was helped by two men to the house of the Sub-Aleade , where he met Mr. Avery and Golden . When the commander of the United States Darien Exploring Expedition entered the Alcalde 's house , his uniform consisted of a blue flannel shirt , one boot , and a Panama hat , neither of which articles was in a very good condition . Perhaps , in justice to Mr. Strain , I ought to say that he does not accept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaring , by way of proof ; that , having often heard of the effect of sudden unexpected deliverance from death after a long and painful suspense , he had the curiosity , when the canoes were approaching the raft to take him oW to feel of his pnlse , and jbund it was not quickened by a beat ! He theretbre naturally enough concluded that it was his cramped position in the canoe that caused his weakness . I am not disposed to differ with a man who pursues knowledge under such difficulties ; but he evidently labors under the hallucination that he had some blood to quicken . The fact is , he was drained dry-soul had taken the place of blood , and kept the body alive . The terrible demands on this were now partially released ; and with the yielding of the will nature quietly sunk away . Having obtained from the Alcalde a petticoat , Strain sat down to supper , and ate as a man will who had f* forty days never but in one instance ceased to feel the pangs of hunger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he cautiously restrained the men . Wilson yielded to his wishes ; but poor Golden , after making most pathetic but vain appeals for more supl ) er , then another glass of brandy , and finally for a cigar , sobbed himself to sleep in the corner where a bed had been prepared for him . He exceedingly debilitated , and had become perfectly childish and almost idiotic from suffering , and Strain feared that bad effects might ensue if he was permitted to eat as much as he wished . But the latter probably could not perceive the propriety of this , especially when he saw his commander , after refusing him more food , turn from an enormous supply to refresh himself with five or six cups of chocolate . Before Strain 's arrival Mr. Avery had learned that Her Britannic Majesty 's steam-sloop Virago was at Darien Harbor , but would sail in two or three days for Panama , and suggested the great importance of the former proceeding at once and obtaining from her the necessary supply of provisions and money , offering at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main party . As he supposed that the men and officers with Truxton had followed his instructions and continued their downward march , Strain believed they could not be far distant ; and hence , though most anxious himself to relieve his party , assented to this proposal . Sending , therefore , for the Jefe Politico and Alcalde , he presented his passports , and requested that four canoes should be engaged as soon as possible , and that provisions , medicines , and all the minor luxuries of spirits , fruits , molasses , and tobacco , should be provided . Every thing was promised , though at such exorbitant prices as soon exhausted his limited means . Having done all he could that night , he was assisted by a Mr. Norriga to the house of his uncle , the priest who had offered beds to Mr. Avery and himself . Says the journal : " Friday , Marc/i 10 . At early daylight I was awakened by the crowing of numerous cocks which shared my apartment ; and this pleasing evidence of civilization soon recalled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done before my whole party could enjoy the same luxury . I arose at once , and went to visit the two men whom I had left at the Sub-Alcalde 's , *but soon found that I had yet a penalty to pay for outraging nature through my diet past and present . " He was seized with the most violent pains , and lay upon his hammock all day rolling in agony . Notwithstanding his severe sufferings , he still planned for his comrades , and aided by Mr. Avery , the Jefe Politico , and Mr. Norriga , managed to provision the party which was to return for the remainder . In the evening , somewhat relieved , though still exceedingly weak , Strain , assisted by the Padre , went down to the river , and took leave of Mr. Avery and Norriga , who , availing themselves of the coolness of the night and bright moonlight , soon after started up the river . canoe was to have been ready for himself at the same time , but could not be obtained , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mr. Strain 's journal : " March 11 . At early daylight I was awake and prepared for a start ; but hearing no intelligence of the canoes , I walked over to the SubAlcalde 's to see how the men had passed the night . I then met a Mr. Lucre , who had recently returned from Panama , and who had arrived during the night from Santa Maria de Real , a village some distance below . He was the first really white man I had met , and by his conduct certainly supported the dignity of his caste , and presented a strong contrast to the grasping , avaricious negroes , and half breeds of Yavisa , who , availing themselves of our necessities , had imposed upon us at every turn . " Finding it impossible to obtain a canoe in this village , he proposed to take me to Santa Maria in his own , which was very small , while the Jefe Politico , Mas Carinas , accompanied us in another small canoe , in which he carried my two men . Mas Carinas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclude from my heartfelt anathema , as I shook the dust from my feet and embarked at Yavisa , as the parish priest and his whole flock were the most arrant cheats I had ever met with in any part of the world . " It is true that we have no right to expect // the highest standard of morality in a frontier village in a wild conntry , but these people certainly carried the privilege of geographical position to an nnjustifiahle extent , and were , moreover , utterly devoid of the quality of personal courage , which is found elsewhere in similar situations . " During my protracted journey in the wilderness , I had frequently , in the spirit which actuated Alexander Selkirk , * wished myself once more in a position to he cheated , and if I had selected from a minute map of the world , I do not believe that I could have had any wish so thoroughly gratified as at Yavisa . " Our little canoes were laden to within a couple of inches of the water 's edge , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow progress , hut after some four hours ' hard paddling we arrived at the mouth of the river Tuyra of geographers , whence we ascended it about half a mile to Santa Maria , the residence of Mr. Lucre , where we were most hospitably entertained . As he had some medicines and ointment , our sores and boils were first treated ; after which a pretty little woman , the daughter of the Jefe Politico , Mas Carinas , to whom Mr. Lucre was allied , in accordance with the custom of the country , prepared fer us an excellent dinner , of which we partook thankfully . After dinner , finding that I could not be prevailed upon to pass the night , Mr. Lucre lent me his own canoe , and assisted by Mas Carinas and the Alcalde , I engaged three bogas on reasonable terms to convey me to Chapigana . " At 5.30 we embarked , and I found that attention to my comforts had extended beyond the door of my hospitable entertainer , as a phitform of boards was extended along the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared to us , luxuriously . Santa Maria de Real , as has been already mentioned , is about half a mile from the junction of the rivers Tnyra and Chuqunaqun , and contains , I should suppose , about six hundred inhabitants . The style of building is similar to that of the Indian villages on the Caledonia , which we passed on the second day of our journey , although the houses are inferior in size and stability . Two small rivers enter at this village , and the houses are irregularly scattered along their banks , and that of the Tuyra . Large canoes trade between this place and Panama , where they exchange live stock , timber , and plank , for cottons , Deift-ware , cooking utensils , and cutlery . The village has no priest , and the incumbent of Yavisa performs service there as well as in Chapigana and two other villages , Molineca and Pinogana , which are situated on the Tnyra above Santa Maria . With a strong ebb-tide we paddled rapidly down the Tuyra to its junction with the Chuqunaqua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place becomes very wide , though it retains the tortuous character which distinguishes its whole * " Better dwell in the midst ef alarms , Than reign in this herrible place . " VOL . X.-No. 60. -3 B length above Yavisa . At the junction there is a fine view of the Pine Mountain , which rises abruptly from the flat wooded plain which intervenes , to the height of some 2000 feet . After our long confinement in the forest , where onr view was constantly limited by the forest growth , it was an intense pleasure once more to see high land and enjoy a distant view , and I thought I should never tire of gazing on this high and isolated mountain . Beyond it , I was informed , there formerly existed an Inca city , or as the natives term it , a City of the King , while on this side was , during colonial tithes , a Spanish town of considerable importance , which sprang up rapidly near the mines of Espirito Santo , and as rapidly decayed when the mine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was found to have attracted the cupidity of the English Buccaneers . " In the beautiful moonlight , and with an occasional glimpse of the Pine Mountain , we drifted and paddled until about 10 P.M. , when meeting the flood-tide we tied up to a tree , and each of my bogas addressed themselves to sleep ; with me the attempt was nearly a failure , as I suffered such intense pain from my boils and the wood worms ( Guzanos de Monte ) , that until nearly morning I found sleep to be impossible . My two men , too , suffered from the same causes , and about midnight we abandoned the idea , and made a late supper on some boiled salt beef which I had prepared at Yavisa . " At the same place , in anticipation of this journey , and with direct reference to our ravenrsaa IUOUaTA5N. // qwq cowardice of the Dogas , whom he found great difficulty in keeping with him by threats and promises , but remarked that he hoped that day to find the party , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left them . At the same time he urged Strain to follow him up without delay . Upon the reception of this intelligence , he was somewhat undecided for a time as to how he ought to act , but finally determined to wait the return of Mr. Avery , or of his party , in the event they should return without him . As his letter stated that they were still advancing , and already near the point where they might reasonably expect to meet the main body in their downward progress , he had little doubt but Avery would be successful , which would make another party entirely unnecessary . Even if he did fit out another party of natives , they would be no more likely to advance than that now with Mr. Avery ; and should he accompany them up , and they insist upon returning before reaching the main body , a loss of time would be involved which might prove fatal to them . It was on this day that the Virago was expected at Darien Harbor from Panama , and , as a last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain men who would not be arrested by common obstacles . Still , while awaiting momentarily the arrival of Mr. Avery with intelligence , and perhaps with the missing party , he felt averse to leaving Yavisa , and determined to delay at least until next morning , before taking any definitive action . Upon one point he was determined-that if Mr. Avery was forced to return unsuccessful , the safety of his men should not be intrusted to the cowardly natives , but that he would obtain a party of English to accompany him , or , failing in that , would demand an escort of troops from the Granadian Presidio on the Savana , who by their muskets and bayonets might force the bogas to do their duty . The day passed most anxiously , hut as none of Avery 's men returned , he augured favorably . The journal says here : " Friday , March 17 . Before daylight I was awakened by the Padre , who announcedAvery 's return . In answer to my first question , Have you brought the party ? ' he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' He had passed the point where , on thel4th of February , the advance party had constructed the first raft , and discovered a cross on the bank , from whence wassuspended a letter from Mr. Truxton , to which allusion has already been made in the record of the main party , where a copy is given . Having read the letter , and discovered that the party were retrograding , he went into camp for the night , intending to follow them up the next day . This was the 14th of March , one month after the advance party had passed this point , and eight days before it was left by the main body under Mr. Truxton . On the morning of the 15th Mr. Avery , accompanied by Mr. Norriga and two bogas , in a small canoe , attempted to ascend the rivnr in pursuit of the party , but meeting a log , about two miles above Holmes 's grave , which extended across the river , as they erroneously supposed , they returned to the other men , who refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce the natives to proceed , but fear of the Indians had obtained such a firm hold of their minds , that no inducement could be offered sufficiently tempting . Double pay for every day 's additional service was offered them , double pay for the whole journey , with a handsome present to each hoga upon their return to Yavisa , if they would only proceed up the river one day longer . Their avarice , though great , appears not to have equaled their cowardice ; and with gloomy anticipations , Mr. Avery hastened down the river to report his failure , and to obtain more men and further instructions . They started on their return from No. 2 hospital Camp , and passing rapidly over the raft journey of the 15th of February , heard at meridian a call on the right bank of the river . Landing , they discovered Parks , who , it will be remembered , strayed from the main body on the 5th of March . He was unable to move , and slightly delirious , but gave what afterward proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party up to the 5th of March , when he lost himself in the forest . Of his own wanderings he gave no very distinct account , nor could he state how many days he had been absent from the party . From the 5th of March until the evening of the 14th he appeared to have been lost in the forest , and absent from the river ; upon his return to which , the evening before he was found , he stated that he had drank six quarts of water , and laid himself down to die . For want of food he said that he did not at first suffer , as he had palmetto when he separated from the other two men , and cut down the palm-nut trees with his knife . his knife he finally broke , after which he obtained no more food , but could not remember how long that was after he was lost . His , whole body was covered with wood-ticks , which were removed by Mr. Avery , after which he was oiled , to soften the skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small quantities , of which he at fiist wished to eat voraciously , but his hunger being soon appeased , he never asked again for it , although constant in his demands for water . He did not know Strain , hut called everybody Captain Strain . When brought into the presence of the latter , he got up by the side of the house , and , leaning against the wall , exclaimed , " Oh , Captain , Captain , give me some water " What do you want ? " replied Strain . " Oh , it is too late / " he replied , and sunk down and never spoke again , though , at the time , no one thought him dying . Thoroughly alarmed at hearing that the main body had attempted a return - which Strain feared would terminate in a perfect route , and most disastrously to the lives of all-he only // awaited until daylight to demand from the Alcalde a second force , to be placed under his own command , and with positive instructions , under the severest penalties known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him until they had overtaken the party . By dint of threats and exertions , he obtained the necessary orders from the Alcalde upon the local authorities of Yavisa , Pinogani , and Santa , to supply the requisite number with all dispatch , and immediately proceeded to the hire of five canoes . Says the journal : " While arranging this important business , I was shocked by receiving intelligence of the death of Parks . I had left him but a few minutes before , apparently asleep , and though dolirious he appeared strong , and was no more emaciated than the members of my own party . Ordering that a coffin should be made , and a grave dug , I charged Mr. Avery and the Padre with the care of his funeral , and prepared to set out immediately down the river to meet the Virago and ask their assistance , as I feared to intrust the safety of the party above to the cowardly natives , who might again return before reaching it . " The Virago , I knew , ought to have returned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any chance she should have been delayed , to ascend the Savana to the New Granadian Presidio , and demand from the officer in charge a sufficient guard of soldiers to insure the obedience of the bogas whom I had requested to be drafted for the expedition . I hoped that military discipline might have repaired to some extent inherent cowardice , and that the bayonets of the troops would appear more formidable than the remote danger from the Indians . Unwilling to delay one moment longer than necessary , I left instructions with Mr. Avery to embark the provisions and medicines which I had brought up , and set out as soon as the natives should arrive from the vnrious adjoining villages . Meanwhile the Jefe Politico , Mas Carinas , arrived , and a demand was made upon me by the bogas who had accompanied Mr. Avery , not only for the pay which had been promised them , but for the extra pay which he offered them on condition that they should accompany him until the party was relieved . " The additional pay he refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roguery in stealing nearly all the provisions which he had with great difficulty obtained and destined for his own men , whom they had so scandalously abandoned to their fate . The altercation waxed warm , and Strain 's life was threatened ; but he presented a sixbarreled pistol , and kept them back , while a threat from the Jefe Politico that he would consign them to prison finally restored order . Uneasy , vexed , and indignant , he finally threw himself into his canoe , and taking advantage of the remainder of the ebb-tide , swept rapidly down the river in search of assistance of such a character that he could risk the lives of his party upon it . Extra pay and constant urging induced the bogas to pull even after the tide had turned , and when they could no longer make any headway against the current , and were forced to anchor , they had already made some sixteen or eighteen miles . Immediately after anchoring , Strain was informed by a fisherman that an armed English boat was coming up the river ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his great joy , she made her appearance , moving rapidly with the tide . He immediately got under way to intercept her , and , upon hailing , found that she contained a party from the Virago , under Lieutenant W. C. Forsyth , which had been sent to his assistance by Captain Edward Marshall , who , in a very polite note , congratulated him upon his arrival , and requested him to hring his whole party on hoard his ship . Mr. W. C. Bennett also accompanied the detachment , and it was to his promptness and energy that this timely assistance was rendered ; for , as soon as he heard the Virago 's guns at the mouth of the Savana , he jumped into a canoe , and , paddling himself ; hurried down and stated Strain 's urgent necessities , which induced Commander Marshall to expedite his expedition so that it left the Virago at midnight on the night previous . It is true that the intention to send a party up the Chuqunaqua already existed ; hut the promptness of Mr. Bennett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus saved Strain the voyage to Darien Harbor . The latter immediately transferred his baggage from the canoe to the paddlebox boat , and arrived at Yavisa a short time after dark . He there learned that answers to the call for men had been received from neighboring villages , but that none had yet arrived , though they were expected in the morning . The next morning they were stirring early , and every effort was made to obtain canoes for the ascent , as they had determined not to wait the arrival of the natives , but to have them dispatched after by the Jefe Politico and the Alcalde . The constitutional tardiness of the natives , increased by a part*ily-concealed dissatisfaction at the arrival of the English officers and seamen , delayed them for some hours , and it was not till afternoon that , partly by entreaties , and partly by force , they obtained three canoes and put off . The tide and some fourteen English oarsmen propelled them rapidly up the stream , and they only halted when it became so dark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank , an incident occurred which had nearly proved fatal to the expedition and all engaged , and for a moment seemed to indicate that destiny was against them , and that the unfortunate party had been marked for destruction . At eleven o'clock at night , when all were asleep in the boat except the two sentries and Strain , the latter heard amidst the profound stillness a cracking and rending of timber in the woods , which he knew at once to proceed from a falling tree . He first thought it was some distance from the bank , but on looking up to see whether it was likely to strike and bring down any other timber nearer the shore , he saw against the starlit sky , directly over his head , the dark and swaying form of a tree gradually declining toward the spot where the unsuspecting boats lay moored . His first thought was , " My poor men will now be lost 1 " He , however , never opened his mouth , but watched the descending mass without moving , as it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some unseen hand , it inclined to the right , and fell with a feniful crash into the river , a few feet behind , tearing off a piece of the stern of one of the canoes which was moored alongside . Shouts and exclamations followed , and for a moment the greatest consternation prevailed among the seamen , who thought the Indians were upon them ; but the voices of the officers , and assurances that the danger bad passed , soon restored order . Mr. Avery , who slept in a canoe alongside , had a narrow escape ; but fortunately a good xvetting was all the inconvenience which any of them experienced . Next day was Sunday , and all were early at work and advancing up the river . About midday they were joined by two canoes containing eleven natives , who had been dispatched after them by the Jefe Politico in Yavisa . At two o'clock they arrived as far as the paddle-box boat could go , and after a hasty dinner , embarked the officers and a portion of the men in the canoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide-water on the 4th of March , during the downward journey . From this place . down to the harbor of Darien , a distance of fifty miles , there is no obstacle to the navigation , and even at the lowest stage of water about two fathoms can be carried . Above this salto the same draft might be carried during the rainy season ; but the immense quantities of floating timber at that time , combined with the narrowness of the stream and the frequent rapids , will probably prcvent the river being navigated even under the most favorable circumstances . The gunner of the Virago and eight men were left in the paddle-box boat , Avery and Wilson remaining with them , neither of them being in a condition to render much service , and requiring rest and diet . Still Mr. Avery , with an endurance and spirit which honored him , offered to go on , if it was thought he could afford the slightest assistance . Mr. Bennett had brought his own canoe , so that , with the two owned by the natives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these was given to William Ross , and was intended as a hospital . He was accompanied by the paymaster , W. H. Hills . Mr. Forsyth took charge of the canoe next hi size to that of the surgeon , Mr. Bennett of his own , while Strain selected the canoe of the lightest draft for himself . The remaining two were managed by the natives , who halted to dine , while the main party proceeded over the rapids , which-the tide being out-were passed with great difficulty . At night , when they encamped , the natives rejoined and encamped near them . The 12-pound howitzer in the paddle-box boat was heard distinctly at S P.31 . This was Sunday , and the next morning , March 20th , after a hearty breakfast , they started in the same order as on the previous day ; but before mid-day , Strain found that the exertion of paddling a canoe was too great for him , and that his feet had become // fearfully swollen . He accordingly ordered the Padron of the natives to put one man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while two English seamen were retained for the sole purpose of paddling . The officers having managed their own canoes thus far , it had a good moral effect , and convinced the natives that the whites were not so dependent on them as they supPosed . The dexterity which the English seamen displayed in the management of the boats surprised every one , but was accounted for by the fact that the Virago had been for some time under repair in Puget Sound , on the northwest coast of America , where the sailors had frequent opportunities of amusing themselves with the canoes of the Indians , which are much less stable even than those of the Isthmus . At dark they encamped on a shingle beach , and , after a hearty supper , set the watch , which consisted of one officer and two sentries . The remainder were soon asleep around the watchfires . As rapids were becoming frequent , one of the native canoes was detailed to assist the Enghsh to stem the strong current , which they did by dragging them over by hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hunting , in which the men were very expert . Passing several well-recognized camps of his downward progress , and intervals which it had cost him days of hard labor to accomplish , they encamped after sunset , the 21st , on the rocky beach upon which Strain had slept the 16th of February , after having abandoned his raft in the morning . The raft and paddles were still there , and one of the latter , which Strain made with a macheta , was secured as a memento by one of the English officers , and afterward proved useful when another was broken . The abundance of food , two fires , the bustle of many men , and the sound of many voices , was a pleasing contrast to the chilly , foodless , fireless nights which he had passed in the desert . Still there was a " plus ultra " which prevented enjoyment , and his silent exclamation was , " Oh that I could bring the remainder of the party to the same degree of comfort , and I should be content At ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main body , where , upon the cross over Holmes 's grave , Mr. Avery found the letter from Mr. Truxton , informing Strain of his intentions to go back . Landing , Strain examined it critically , but coulti find no indications of disorganization or route . An old hat and pieces of cloth lay about , but there were two regular camps , with their respective fires , and evidences of an attempt at comfort . The camp of the men was nearest the water , while a path had been cut to the officers ' camp , which was about forty feet distant . In the latter he discovered a tree that had served as a target for pistol-shooting , which convinced him that they were neither utterly dispirited or so short of ammunition as he and his party had been . Although the rude attempt to raise the evidence of Christian burial over one of the men who , in high health and spirits , had left the Atlantic coast , could not but produce the saddest reflections , yet he was already prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the evidences of continued discipline and organization which he had observed . The native canoe-men at this point remonstrated against proceeding further up the river , but as he indignantly refused even to listen to their representations , they postponed the discussion for a future occasion . Ascending rapidly , they arrived at the fallen tree which had barred Mr. Avery 's upward progress ; but , upon examination , it was found that , in falling , the roots had opened a narrow channel between it and the bank , through which the small canoes passed easily . The larger ones experienced more difficulty , but with a half hour 's cutting of the bank all got safely through , and the ascent was rapidly continued . As the day declined obstacles became more numerous , and much skill and dexterity were displayed by the natives in passing under and over fallen trees which eNtended across the river , near the level of the water . As they continued to ascend they saw small crosses along the banks , erected , according to previous arrangement , by the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their progress when he should return with assistance . But the signs soon ceased , and although they passed numerous return camps , there was no symbol from which it could he inferred that they had the remotest hope of relief from below . Worn-out belts and cartouche boxes , found in camps on the river , showed that the party were dispensing with all unnecessary weight , while pieces of leather cut from the latter gave evidence that their boots and shoes were nearly worn out . Quills and feathers of the loathsome buzzard scattered along , revealed the character of food to which stern necessity had at last driven them . In the afternoon they arrived at the camp from whence Strain had taken leave of the party , and found that it had been revisited by them , the evidence of which was the remains of a fire and some cartouche boxes which had been discarded . About sunset they encamped on a sloping bank , and passed a night of torture , owing to the myriads of mosquitoes which infested the camp . This was a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp it was evident his command had given him up for lost , and commenced the desperate undertaking of finding their way back to the Atlantic shore . The prospect now grew painfully alarming . Strain could not sleep , but agitated , anxious , and feverish , sat up all night fanning himself . The noble-hearted Bennett kept him company nearly the whole night , and cheered him with promise of assistance to the last . He told him that a fearful and trying day was before him on the morrow-alluding to the revelations which the camps of the men would make . He requested // him also to get a pair of boots of one of the men , and try by degrees to wear them ; for , said he , no one can tell how distant the party may be , and when we ascend as high as the boats can go , the natives , *you know , will refuse to advance , and , in all probability , the English seamen also as they have a mortal dread of the Indians . And as Strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you know , when all shall turn back , you and I must shoulder our haversacks and take to the woods alone , till we find your men . " This noble self-devotion of a stranger and foreigner-this grand , high purpose to cast his lot in with the distressed commander , and save his party , or perish with them-reveals one of those lofty , elevated characters which shed lustre on the race. * At early daylight , when the sand-flies relieved the night-guard of mosquitoes , 1*hey rose to prepare for a day of labor and excitement , as Strain had every reason to believe he should overtake the main body of his party before night . As they were now nearly in the heart of the Isthmus , and might possibly meet Indians , a regular order of sailing was adopted , and the canoes followed each other in close order . Strain led the van , accompanied by a canoe containing three natives , who , sailing close along the edge of the shore , examined each camp and searched the river bank step by step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cry from the Padron : " Here *e a dead body ! " For a moment he was intimidated , and shrank back as if smitten with a death-chill , and was on the point of asking some one to land and examine it in his place . He did not know which of his friends or comrades he might find stark upon the beach , and for a moment wished to escape the horrible spectacle . Reflection , however , soon convinced him that it was a necessity which must be met , perhaps even till he had counted up , one by one , all of his command , and , nerving himself for the worst , he shoved his canoe ashore . Birds of rapine and beasts of prey bad left little more than the skeleton , but a glance at the linen shirt under the blue uniform of the party showed at once that it was an officer . Upon a closer inspection of the bones and skull , he discerned that it was the remains of Mr. Polanco , the junior Granadian commissioner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and men who accompanied him to believe that the body had been buried and afterward disinterred by wild beasts ; but Strain read the history of the recent tragical events more accurately . The grave was too short for Mr. Polanco ; besides , there was not sufficient evidence that the ground had been torn up , while the clothing , flattened over the bones , showed plainly that they had never been covered with earth . He felt , therefore , rather than knew , that Mr. Castilla , his companion , lay beneath , and that he , faithful in death as he had been faithful and docile in life , had laid down and died upon his grave . Where he lay there they interred him , sacredly gathering together even the finger bones ; and , placing a cross over the joint remains of these unfortunate , educated , and talented young men , before whom but a few weeks previous a bright future appeared to be opening , they continued their journey saddened and subdued by the melancholy spectacle . The English officers could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not till after they had left the spot , that Strain mentioned his convictions concerning the grave , lest some one might propose a delay for the purpose of examining it . The dead were beyond reach of human assistance and human sympathy , but to those who remained of his party delay might be death . At about 10 A . M. , a tree was met extending entirely across the river , which had to be cut in two before a passage could be effected . Cheerfully and heartily the English seamen went to work ; but the natives , for a long time , hung back , and , after a consultation , declared that they would go no farther . Grieved and distressed beyond measure by the fearful sight he had just witnessed , and feeling that the skill and dexterity of the natives were becoming every hour more essential to his success , Strain was thoroughly enraged by this despicable conduct . He entreated , upbraided , and threatened by turns , and gave them to understand that , even should they escape alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose success depended in a great degree upon their assistance , the grape and cannister of the howitzer in the boat below would prevent their reaching Yavisa . He wound up his harangue by swearing , with the most solemn oath known to those barbarians-viz. , by the soul of God-that , even if they should escape these dangers , he would devote the remainder of his . life to their punishment . Sorrow and anger combined gave an impressiveness to . the solemn oath-especially as he presented a six-barreled revolver to their breasts , declaring that at least of them should never return . After a short and frightened consultation , they agreed to continue on the remainder of that day . Although Strain hoped confidently that the party would be overtaken before night , he did not accept of these conditions , as he was determined that they should never abandon to a fearful death men whose lives were of so much more value than their own , especially as they had embarked in the enterprise , and by their promises induced him to consume time which was beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they lost sight of the return camps , and the English party , officers as well as men , became apprehensive that the party had abandoned the river . But on this subject Strain felt no anxiety , as he knew that they would not dare to leave the The reader will be glad to hear that this noble stranger received , in a separate letter from the Secretary of the Navy , the thanks of our Government for his evotion and his sex-rices. // stream , which was their only guide and the only certain source from which they could obtain water . Nearly the whole of this day they fired their muskets and shouted at short intervals in order to attract their attention should they be pursuing their march in the forest , where it was generally more free from undergrowth than close to the river hank . Late in the afternoon a log across the river compelled them to leave the canoes , which were forced over by the united strength of the party . here a stench induced Strain to believe that one of his unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a brief search in the bushes , not finding any thing , he pushed on-feeling that , even if his suspicious were true , the poor creature was beyond human relief , and it was those who suffered and yet lived that demanded his utmost efforts . Soon after passing this barrier ashes were discovered , which the Padron , in his scout canoe , pronounced to be less than four days old . When Strain announced this intelligence to the party , three cheers were given by the English seamen , that made the forest ring , and they sprang to their paddles with such energy that the water foamed away from the prows of their canoes as they bounded onward . Signs of disorganization , however , now became more alarming , and the evidence of extreme debility and starvation more apparent . Buzzard 's quills , haversacks , fragments of clothing strewed along , together with the want of order in the camps , and their close proximity , attested that the little band had well-nigh reached the end of their march . With every fresh symptom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreadful fear that they had been compelled to resort to cannibalism haunted him , and made him tremble to proceed . But nerving himself to the worst , and keeping his forehodings to himself he pushed on , and soon after announced a camp less than three days old . This was responded to by a loud cheer and a discharge of fire-arms . Even the natives began to feel the excitement , and bent to their paddles with lustier strokes . They had not proceeded far before another camp was found , the ashes of which were declared to be warm ; and then the excitement reached the highest pitch . Shout after shout went up , shot after shot rang through the forest , and a common enthusiasm and ardor inspired every breast . At about sunset the natives , who were ahead in the scout canoe , announced a smoke in sight , and immediately after making a turn in the river Strain discovered five men standing on the shelving beach just out of the wood . He immediately discharged his musket to warn them of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fatal ; and then cheer after cheer echoed and re-echoed through the forest , as each canoe in succession swept round the point and caught sight of the motionless forms in the distance . When Strain saw hut five men his heart sank with dread , and he exclaimed , " My God , is that all ! " but*he next moment a faint cheer from the forest in the rear announced that others 5T*A* ' 5 LAST AUGUMENT. // still remained alive . His canoe swept with a bound to the shore ; but before its prow grated upon it he was on the land . His first inquiry of Maury was , " How many men have you lost ? " " Five , " replied Maury . " I ow , " responded Strain , " of four , who is the other ! " " Lombard , " said Maury . " By this time Truxton had staggered up , and , flinging his arms around Strain , exclaimed , " Oh , Strain , did I do right to turn back . " Joy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relief from suffering and suspense , were forgotten in the single question of duty . " Did I do right ? " was the only thought , the only question . How that involuntary exclamation honors him-exalts him above all eulogy ! Duty had governed him from first to last ; duty occupied him even in the extreme suffering of starvation . So long as we can have such officers to command our ships , our navy will retain her old renown , and whether flying or struck , our flag will still be covered with glory . One of the men , named M'Ginness , threw his arms around Strain , and bursting into tears , exclaimed , " Oh , Captain ! poor Boggs is hreaking his heart to see you . " As Bennett , the noble Irishman , jumped ashore , and saw the hideous spectacle of scarred and almost naked skeletons , he seized each one by the hand , while the tears poured like rain down his cheeks . The Scotch surgeon gazed around him a moment , apparently bewildered , then leaping back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each arm , and hastening from the one to the other , said , " Take a little of this , my poor/i ? llow ; take a little of this . " But this spectacle was nothing to that which awaited them at the camp . Several of the poor men there had heard the shouts of deliverance , but the joyful intelligence could not impart strength to their wasted frames . There they lay-lacerated , ulcerated frames of men half-covered with rags . Each turned his eye as his commander approached , but none could get up . Strain first came upon Yermilyea , stretched on his back and emaciated to such a dreadful degree that he did not know him . The latter , however , said , in a feeble voice , " how do you do , Captain * are glad to see you back again . lVe were qfraid you were lost . " Strain , with a breaking heart , gazed on him a moment when the poor man asked , " Wo n't you shake hands with me , Captain ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain , but Ica n't get up . " Strain then kneeled down beside him and tried to cheer him , saying he had brought along provisions , a doctor , and every thing needed , and he hoped to see him on his feet again soon . " Ia ? u afraid , Captain , " he faintly replied , " Ishall never march any more . " Alas ! it proved too true . As Strain rose to his feet he saw a figure sitting a little way off on the ground doubled up against his knees , his pantaloons off up to his thighs , while a part of a shirt , and a palm-leaf hat with but half a rim completed his costume . He was ghastly and frightful to look upon . As he caught Strain 's eye he touched the fragment of his hatbrim , and endeavored to smile . The contor Tax ILESCITE. // tions which the effort g*tve to his almost black and emaciated face rendered him still more horrible . " Who are you 7 " said Strain . " Henwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat in true naval discipline . " We were getting very uneasy about you , Sir , " he added ; " very glad to see you back . " Strain , horrified and struck almost dumb at the spectacle , replied mechanically , " Well , Henwood , how are yon getting along ? " " Oh , very well , Sir ; but we were very uneasy about you . We are very glad to see you back , because , if you had not come up to-night , there 's me , Harris , Miller , and poor Boggs , who could not have gone on to-morrow , Sir . The appellation " poor " was applied to Boggs , because he was an officer . The posture of this young man , his emaciated , half-naked appearance , the resigned manner in which he spoke of his fate , together with the ghastly attempt at a smile , combined to render him one of the most strange and frightful spectacles the human form ever presents . Beside him sat another in the same condition , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had by this time reached camp again , and exhausted lay down . Strain advanced a little farther to where Boggs - his old schoolmate and fellow-officer-was lying on a ragged counterpane which he had carried instead of a blanket . The poor man had at last yielded to despair , and the presence of his friend failed to rouse him . Strain knelt over him and exclaimed , " Good God ! my dear fellow do n't think of dying . I have brought plenty of provisions , medicine , doctor , etc . We will soon be on the Pacific . Cheer up , and we will take many a good glass of wine together yet in Springfield ! " Finding that he could not rally him , he spoke of the lady to whom he was engaged , of her anxiety and welfare , in order to rekindle hope and effort . " I do n't think 1 shall die yet , " replied the sufferer , in a low and feeble voice , but it is fortunate you came up as you did ; for they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resignation which reigned in that ghastly group , gave tenfold impressiveness to the scene . But no description can convey any adequate impression of its true character . The British officers were shocked beyond measure , and the surgeon declared that though he had seen much of suffering , in hospitals and elsewhere , he never before dreamed tbat men could live and march in such a state of emaciation and destitution . It is a little singnlar that every half-starved creature asked first for sugar , though this may be owing to the effect upon their system of the acid nuts , on which they had so long chiefly sustained life . Five pounds of sugar and five bottles of molasses were first served out . The doctor then went round with some soft biscuit . In arranging the camps that night , Strain ordered the natives to occupy the other side of the river , lest overcome by the importunities of the men , they might give them tobacco and food . After the first slight allowance of food all begged HARPER 'S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was maintained over them all night , and the wants of each attended to . Vermilyca was kept alive only by stimulants . The next mouiing the men awoke elated , and preparations were immediately made for breakfast . Food , of course , was given out in very small portions , as the least excess might prove fatal . Truxton , however , took Strain aside , and in a wheedling way said , confidentially : " Your restricting the men in their food , and even Maury , is exceedingly judicious , but , you know , with us officers it is very differentgive me a little nzeat . " But Strain refused , and in a little while Maury took him aside and said , in the same confidential manner : " It is all very well , Captain , to restrain men , and Truck too ( meaning Truxton ) , he is shaky , you k ow , but I am nearly as well as ever . " Strain could not repress a smile , still he refused to be coaxed . However , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full as good a condition to gorge himself as Strain was when he ate nearly half his weight at Yavisa . And in speaking of Lieutenant Maury here , it is right and proper to say , that from first to last of this fearful journey , he exhibited all the loftest qualities of an officer and true hero ; all the noble feelings of a genuine man , and richly deserves the eulogium pronounced upon him by Strain in his report to the Secretary of the Navy . The partywere three days in regainingthe paddle-box . As the men passed their old camps they would talk of the past , and contrast it with the present . Cheerfulness reigned throughout the little fleet of boats , and " Erin go Brugh , " " The White Squall , " and other naval songs , woke the echoes of the forest as they swept down the winding stream . On the wa*r Strain sounded Maury as to the fact whether they had eaten buzzards , The latter could not deny it ; but his disgnst at the unclean bird returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , and replied : " Yes , we did eat them , but perhaps you are not aware there is a great difference between the cock and hen . The one you killed , and we tried to eat and could not , was a cock , and they are very strong . Besides , after all , when men are in a starving condition , a buzzard is better than a turkey , for living on animal bod , it is necessarily more nutritious . " A hearty laugh exploded the excuse , and no after-defense was made of buzzards . As they approached the paddle-box , Strain wished to hoist the American ensign , and asked if the one they started with had been preserved . They answered yes . M'Ginness had been intrusted with it , and had carried it to the last . The only emblem of their nationality that remained to them , he had wrapped it round his breast , and though weapons , haversacks , and blankets had been thrown away , he would never part with it . Wounded feet that needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not induce a man to devote that cherished symbol to his own use . Without 9 // ( reflection Strain ordered M'Ginness to place it in his boat . The poor fellow hung hack a moment , and cast such an appealing look to Strain , that the latter asked him what was the matter . His eyes instantly filled with tears , and he replied : " Captain , I have never parted with this ensign a single instant since you trusted it to my care on the Atlantic coast , and do n't take it from me now . " Touched by the noble devotion of the man , he replied : " By no means , my brave fellow , shall it be taken from you ; display it yourself . " His face beamed a smile of thankfulness , and unbinding it with his skeleton hand from the rags that but hardly covered him , he gave it , tattered and torn , to the wind , and three cheers went up from the little fleet . There is a whole poem in this little incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach at Caledonia Bay , it was now unrolled to announce their deliverance . Once more only was it used , and then to shroud the coffin of one of their number . Vermilyea never rallied , and died soon after Uaeir arrival at Yavisa . On the 29th the party reached the Virago . The men were quartered on shore at their own request , and because Strain thought that they would recover much sooner on land than in the confined air of a ship . As soon as he had got them well established he took an open boat , some forty feet long , and three and a half feet wide , and started for Panama , ninety miles distant , in order to put himself in communicatiQn with Captain Hollins , and obtain funds to meet his expenses . Taking mules he proceeded across the Isthmus to Aspinwall , where the C'gane lay . The most touching scene followed his arrival on board , for he had long ago been given up as dead . Without stopping to obtain the rest and quiet he so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and set sail for Pat'ma , where he had left his party . He found all doing well except Boggs , who was evidently sinking . Strain 's presence roused him for awhile , and he listened attentively to a letter which the former had brought him . He , however , could not rally . The next day they arrived at Panama , and Mr. Boggs , after giving some directions respectin his affairs , quietly sunk away . Strain then hastened his departure for Aspinwall , and on the 25th of April reported himself and party on board the Cyane , which ten minutes afterward flung her canvas to the wind , and was sweeping out toward the Atlantic . The journal of the intermediate space I have thus briefly passed over is full of interest , and is necessary to the completion of the expedition , hut the length of the article has compelled me to omit it in this place . I will only insert the closing portion of Lieutenant Strain 's report to the Secretary of the Navy , in order to do justice BOUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ill-fated expedition , in which one-third of those who composed it died from starvation , or from the food they were compelled to resort to in their distress . Says the report : " This , Sir , terminates the narrative of the United States Expedition to the Isthmus of Darien , an expedition without brilliancy , because *vith*ut success , and whose reputation depends , in a high degree , upon the fact that it has only disproved a magnificent preconceived theory , whose rise and progress will merit an especial reference in the brief resume which I propose to append to the narrative . " In concluding my narrative I would most respectfully call your attention to the subordination and general good conduct of those employed upon the expedition . Greater difficulties , more intense physical suffering , and more discouraging circumstances , have seldom been encountered , and have never , I am assured , been met with greater equanimity , good-nature , and quiet endurance . Although suffering for long periods from scarcity of food , and even perishing for want of it , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those humiliating instances of selfishness which have so frequently distinguished periods of great distress . I am also happy in being able to report to you that the officers and seamen under my command adopted , and with apparent willingness , a principle of action which was suggested to them at an early period in the journey of the expedition , and that those who survived have nothing to regret or blush for . " In having the services of passed midshipman W. T* Truxton , 1st assistant-engineer , Mr. Maury , and midshipman H. M. Garland , I was especially fortunate , and to these officers I would respectfully direct the attention of the Department . " Mr. Truxton , while I was present , was an able and cheerful assistant , and while I was absent he sustained nobly the responsibility which his fearful position imposed upon him . Mr. Maury , owing to his physical endurance , which surpassed that of any member of the party , was enabled to render to the weak and debilitated assistance which entitles him to their and my gratitude , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generosity are characteristic , that few would have deserved so much the high compliment which was paid to him by Mr. Truxton , when making to me his verbal report of . the events which occurred in the main body of the party during my absence . " Maury , ' he said , is the only man in the whole circle of my acquaintance , who could have endured so much privation , and passed through so many trials , without displaying a single instance of selfishness . ' For my own part , acquainted as I am with all the circumstances , I am at a loss which to prefer , the magnanimity of Mr. Truxton , or the deportment of Mr. Maury , who richly deserved this handsome compliment from his.immediate com manding officer , whose own conduct was so deserving of eulogium . Probably there never was an instance in which an officer , while bestowing upon another the highest yet most richly-deserved eulogy that could be pronounced , unconsciously and unintentionally paid so high a tribute to his own character . The reader will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Navy , the gallant Lieutenant Forsyth , mentioned at the close of the report , has been promoted to the command of a ship  --  a reward well merited . " Mr. Garland suffered exceedingly in his own person , hut was at all times ready and willing to afford every assistance compatible with his own state of health , as I can testify , and as is fully set forth in the report of Mr. Truxton , which will be found in the appendix . " You , Sir , are already aware of the assistance rendered to my party by the officers and crew of Her Britannic Majesty 's steam-sloop Virago , which , pending the action of the Government , I recognized in a letter to Commander Edward Marshal , R. N. , which has already been published . " You , Sir , have already informed me that the thanks of the Navy Department have been communicated to those officers and seamen , and any additional national action which might be taken to call the attention of H. B. Majesty 's Government to the generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Ross , Paymaster W. H. Hills ( R. Navy ) , and Mr. W. C. Bennett , Civil Engineer , will be most gratefully received by my party and myself . The foregoing narrative will explain the extent of service which those gentlemen , and certain seamen of the Virago , rendered us at no small personal risk . " I would also respectfully call the attention of the Department to the fact that my entire party were transported on the Panama Railroad free of charge , I having crossed the Isthmus at that point three times , and that upon all occasions we received from Colonel Totten , the Superintendent , Messrs . Monroe , Green , Baldwin , and the various other employ*s of that Company the kindest possible attention . "
