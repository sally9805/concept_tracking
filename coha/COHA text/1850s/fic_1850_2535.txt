Mr. Harvey 's two sons , Thomas and John , were very anxious for their cousin , Samuel Reed , to spend the August holidays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when school was closed for the season , Samuel bade his father good bye , and was soon in the carriage , driving toward Uncle Harvey 's country seat . The boys had not seen each other since New Year 's day . It was a happy meeting when Samuel jumped out of the carriage , by the gate leading from the main road up to Mr. Harvey 's house ; for there his uncle , and two cousins , were waiting for him . Thomas and John , each grasped a hand , while their father led the way to the house . " We were afraid you were not coming , " said John . " How tall you have grown since Christmas , " exclaimed Thomas . " Were you not tired of being in the hot city such weather as this ? " Samuel said that he was ; and then they all entered the house , while the driver brought in Samuel 's baggage . It was about five o'clock in the afternoon when Samuel reached his uncle 's house . He was taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many flowers were in bloom . It was a warm day , but this room was cool and fragrant ; and on the table were several plates of fruit , and some cakes , which his uncle caused to be placed there , so that he might eat some as soon as he arrived , While Samuel was eating some of them John said : " We are so glad you have come , Samuel . Last winter you could see nothing but snow . " " What became of the snow-man we made last winter ? " asked Samuel . " It froze very hard for more than a week after you left , " replied Thomas ; " but John and I broke its head a great deal , with snow balls , and afterwards a warm rain fell , and washed it away . " " Is it warm in the city now ? " asked John . " Yes , " answered his cousin . " In the middle of the day the pavements seem to be about on fire , and people are afraid to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men died with the heat . There seems to be no air stirring from morning till night . Besides , there is much sickness in town , and many persons have left their houses , and gone into the country . " Father , " said Thomas , " how miserable we should be if we had no water to drink this weather , like those poor Arabs that you told us of the other day . " " Yes , " answered Mr. Harvey , " the sun must be burning hot in Arabia now . " " How can they live in such a place ? " asked John . " They are not all so miserable as the party I told you of the other day , " replied his father . " Besides , you know it is their country , and God has taught them to love it . If an Arab were brought here , he would , probably , think it a most dreary land , except in summer . " " But what do you do in town , Samuel , " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? " " It is very hot only in the middle of the day , " replied his cousin , " and then , you know , we are at school . In the afternoons , I sometimes rode out with father , or went on the steamboat . Last week a balloon went up , from the other side of the river . We had a fine view of it from the roof of our house . Two men were in it , and when they had risen so high that the balloon appeared quite small , they threw out a little machine , called a parachute . It looked something like an umbrella , and had a dog to it . The balloon sailed a great distance through the air , and came down safely . " It was now six o'clock , and Mr. Harvey told the boys that they might go to supper , which he had ordered to be ready earlier than usual . Illustration CHAPTER II . THE EVENING WALK . After supper , Samuel and his cousins took a walk in the meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool and pleasant , and as the boys moved through the narrow path , among the low grass , thousands of grasshoppers , and other insects , filled the air with their cheerful hum . Thomas , with his companions , passed round the mill , and then climbed a fence which led through a field of corn . The corn was not very high , so that they had to be careful not to tread upon it . When they reached the other side , Samuel saw that the fence was covered with raspberry vines , from one end to the other . He asked what they did with so many . " All that father wishes to use , or to eat , " replied Thomas , " he gathers out of the garden ; but these he leaves for two or three poor families , who live not far off , and who take them to town to sell . It helps them to pay their rent . " " And does he give away blackberries , too ? " asked Samuel . " Yes , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He has such large fields and orchards , that he can afford to give away great quantities of apples , peaches , currants , grain , and vegetables . " Illustration : THE OLD SOLDIER 'S HOUSE . The boys roamed about the fields , talking in this manner , until after sunset , when Thomas said it was time to return . They crossed into a bye path , and walked toward the house through a field in which wheat had been growing . Among the short straw , left by the reapers , Samuel saw many birds ' nests , and deep holes that had been dug by rabbits , field mice , and other small animals . In a short time they passed a very old house , whose sides appeared as if they would fall every moment . The roof was covered with moss and grass , and the boards had crumbled and separated from each other ; a number of bats and swallows were flying about it , and Thomas said that dozens of these little animals , beside rats and mice , lived inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " said his cousin ; " but father remembers very well when an old soldier , that the farmers called Jack , did live in this house . His leg had been shot off in battles with the Indians . After it healed he moved to this place , and lived on the vegetables he could raise in a little garden , besides what people gave him . Every night he came out and sat on the log by the door , playing on an old fiddle . Then the school children would collect around him , and give him pennies , or fruit , and such things . Sometimes he told them stories ; for he had travelled in many lands , and knew a great deal about them . In the summer nights , father says , he often heard poor old Jack singing the songs that he had learned when he was a boy ; and sometimes he could be seen hobbling down this lane , on his crutches , or sitting by the water catching some fish for his supper . One day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they waited till the next morning , and then a great crowd collected round the house , and called him . No one answered ; so some one lifted the latch and went in . Old Jack was not there , and the people began to get frightened . They hunted for him all that day , and many days afterward ; but he was never found . Some think that he was drowned ; others that he went away with strangers , and a few are foolish enough to believe , that he is still living , and will one day come back . Since that time , no one has ever lived in his house , and in a few years it will tumble down with old age . " While Thomas had been giving this account of Poor Jack , the Soldier , John was very busy moving round the old house , and peeping through the cracks in the boards . At last he motioned Thomas and Samuel , to come to him , and then whispered : " Stoop down -- do n't make a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest owl that ever you did see , in all your life . " Both of them looked through . It was very dark , but Samuel saw two great eyes , like balls of fire , and in a little while he could perceive the body of an owl , which , as John had said , was the largest he had ever seen . " Let us go in and catch him , " said John . But Thomas answered , that as it was now dark the owl could easily fly away ; and besides , as they did not wish to kill it , it could be of no use to them , if they should catch it . " It might do for cousin to look at , " replied John ; but he did not insist upon entering the house . As they were going away , Samuel asked his cousin if he did not think owls were ugly . " No , indeed , " answered John . " I would rather see an owl any time than these little birds that can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred and spotted with black and brown , which is more handsome than to be all over red or yellow . I know he ca n't sing ; but he 's got nice , long ears , and that no other bird has . And how nice and round his head is . Then he sits on a tree , and looks wise , as father says . The Canary , and the mocking bird , are good enough to keep in cages , but of all birds , give me an owl . " Thomas and Samuel laughed at this notion , but John continued : " Thomas , did not some people , who lived a long while ago , call the owl the ' bird of wisdom ? ' " " Yes , " replied Thomas . " I have heard father say that it was the Athenians . " " That shows how wise they were , " said John . " I seems to me as though that owl , which we saw , was keeping house for poor old soldier Jack . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they ran together through the gate , and into the yard . Illustration CHAPTER III . A VISIT TO DADDY HALL . Next morning , Mr. Harvey told his sons that they might go to see an old man , who lived in a small house , about two miles off , and who was so sickly that he could not work . This old man 's name was Hall , and the boys of the school called him Daddy Hall . He had once been rich ; but sickness and misfortune had reduced him to poverty , so that he now lived with his little son , in a small hut , near a hill . Every week he sent fruit and vegetables to market , in a cart , drawn by a donkey , which some of the neighbors had given to him . Every week Mr. Harvey sent either a servant , or one of the boys , to see how he was getting along , and to carry him something nice . The two boys , with their cousin , were soon off , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . They went by the road across the meadows , and through a small gate in the hedge . Samuel observed , that the hawthorn of the hedge grew very thick and close , so that a bird could scarcely get through it . The roots and branches were twisted into each other , appearing like strong , thick chains woven together ; and on the vines grew sharp thorns , longer than a needle . Mr. Harvey 's boys told their cousin , that neither man nor beast could get through such a hedge ; and that if a man were placed on the top , he could walk on the vines without sinking down , they were so strong and close . " It would be uneasy travelling , though , " added John ; " for his feet would be torn to pieces by these spiky thorns . " They now left the hedge , and went on through two wide fields , until they reached some hills that stood by themselves , and were steep and bare . Three of them had deep pits dug in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , were lying around . Samuel asked his cousins what place it was . " It is an iron mine , " said Thomas ; but it is not worked any more , because there is not enough of iron found to pay for the trouble . All these stones lying about here are pieces of ore ; but the quantity of iron in them is so small that it will not pay for the expense of taking it out from the ore . " " How is iron taken from the ore ? " asked Samuel . Thomas replied : " The ore is first crushed into coarse dust , and then washed . Afterwards this dust is melted in a hot furnace , and the iron is separated from the melted stone , or dross , in a manner which is very troublesome , and which father can explain to you better than I can . Sometimes the ore is almost all iron ; John and I have some pieces in our cabinets , in which you can not see any stone . " " But did men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ; they were lowered down in buckets . And the water was pumped out by a machine . The water was so cold , even in the middle of summer , that one could scarcely hold his hand in it . " The boys began to throw stones down one of the wells , so that they might guess by hearing them strike the bottom , how deep it was . The first stones were too small to be heard ; then they threw larger ones , and listened , but could hear no sound . At last , John took up a piece of rock as big as his head , and rolled it into the well . It fell with a hollow , rumbling noise , and all was then still . The boys thought it had reached the bottom ; but all at once they heard it splash into water . Then the boys knew that the well was very deep , for the stone had been falling several seconds . They then hunted among the piles of ore for some handsome pieces to give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hurried on toward Daddy Hall 's . On reaching his house , they found the old man sitting at the door , while his son , a good boy , was preparing to take the donkey to market , with a cart load of turnips , radishes , peas , beans , and cabbage . Daddy Hall was pale and thin ; but he arose to meet the boys , and seemed very glad to see Samuel . Although he was sick almost every day , and sometimes suffered great pain , yet no one ever heard him complain . He loved children , and was very fond of talking to them ; and before he grew so weak and feeble , many of the farmers sent their little ones to him , to learn to read . After they had been seated a little while , John asked him if he did not get tired of staying in the house . " Sometimes , " said the old man , " I wish I could go out , as I once could , and work for myself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best condition I can be placed in ; and if you ask me why , I will tell you . God , my children , has placed me in it ; and he knows what is best for each of us . He has given me many comforts , kind friends , plenty to eat and drink , and a son , who is one of the best of boys . There is nothing , John , more cheering to the heart of an old man than the kindness of a dutiful son ; and let me ask each of you , to listen to the advice of one who owns such a blessing , and always to show honor and respect to your parents . " Illustration CHAPTER IV . THE WALK THROUGH THE WOODS . The boys left their basket with Daddy Hall , and set out on their return to the house . " Let us go through the woods , " said Thomas , and they all walked toward a thick wood which stood not far from the hill , near which Daddy Hall 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool shade ; for the sun was now getting warm . Samuel saw a number of birds among the branches , that he did not know the names of ; and many bright little flowers were growing in the shade , among the roots of oak and beech trees . A little distance in the wood , they reach a small rock , near which some large stones were lying , as if they had been thrown together . Thomas stopped , and said , " Samuel , this is the place where we killed a big snake last spring . You can see his hole under this rock . John and I tried hard to move these loose stones , but we could not . I dare say there are snake nests underneath . " " Perhaps we three can move one of them , " replied his cousin . They all caught hold , and at last pulled the stone from its place . There was nothing underneath , but some old nut shells ; but John said he was sure they would find snakes if they could but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised another one ; and under it was a large land tortoise , with several little ones , no larger than a walnut . After examining these , they observed a hole running under another stone , into the ground . Samuel also found two or three snake skins , which his cousins told him the snakes threw off every spring , after which , a new and larger skin grew on them . They pulled hard at this third stone , but could not move it ; but while they were going away , Thomas said that they could bring an iron bar some day , and easily root it up . In the middle of the wood was a fine spring of water , which gushed from a rock , and then spread out into a little pool , so clear and quiet , that the smallest stones could be seen at the bottom . Samuel tasted the water , and found it cold and refreshing . He asked his cousin how so much water could come out of the rock . " It does not come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . Father says , that spring water often comes from the hills and mountains , running under the ground through cracks and holes in the rocks , until it finds some outlet . I suppose this water runs down from the tops of the hills near the iron mine . " " But this is not rain water , " said his cousin . " It neither tastes nor looks like it . " " It has become changed while passing under the ground , " replied Thomas . " After a heavy shower the water soaks into the earth until it reaches the sand , or rock underneath , then it runs through every little crack down the hill , and under the ground to some place like this where it can escape . The sand and gravel , which it meets with , make it pure and the lime and other substances of the rocks , alter its taste . " Illustration CHAPTER V WHAT UNCLE HARVEY SAID ABOUT RAIN . When the boys reached the house , Mr. Harvey was in his study . Samuel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not go up stairs to disturb him . But after dinner his uncle came into the parlor where the boys were , and then Samuel asked him where all the water comes from that flows in the rivers and other streams . " From the ocean , " answered Mr. Harvey . " I suppose you have seen water boiling , Samuel . " " Yes , sir . " " And have you seen the steam rise up from the water into the air ? " Samuel said that he had . His uncle continued : " Whenever water is heated , it is turned into steam , or vapor , as it is sometimes called . If there is enough of heat to make water boil , the vapor passes off very fast , until the water is gone . Now the sun is continually changing the water of rivers , ponds , lakes , and of the ocean , into vapor . This vapor rises . The air about a mile above the earth , is much colder than it is on the earth ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , it again becomes water , and forms clouds . I see you are ready with a question , John . " " Yes , sir , " said John . " I can not see , father , how the clouds can float in the air if they are nothing but water . Why do they not pour down ? " His father answered : " I expected this would be your question . The clouds , my son , are water , but not in a close mass , like that in a bucket or in the mill pond . You have seen soap bubbles , and know that a great many of them may be joined together without breaking . It is supposed by learned men , that clouds are nothing but many thousands of bubbles , which , being lighter than air , would , you know , float on it . " " But , father , " said John , " what makes it rain ? " " That is not certainly known , " replied Mr. Harvey ; " but , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show you , this evening , several pictures about clouds and springs of water , which will help you to understand what I have said . " " Uncle , " said Samuel , " there is one more question which I would like to ask . " " Ask it , my boy , " replied Mr. Harvey . " I have read , sir , that the water of the ocean is salt ; why , then , is not rain water salt , too ? " " Because , " said Mr. Harvey , " salt can not be changed to vapor , and it is too heavy to be raised , in any quantity , in the air with the water . Yet , I suppose , that a little salt is always mixed with the bubbles that form clouds . " CHAPTER VI . HOW THOMAS KILLED A HAWK . This afternoon was very hot , and the boys spent it in their room , arranging their books and pictures , and in reading . At five o'clock , while Thomas was standing by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawk ! " Both the boys ran to the window , and saw a large hawk , sailing slowly toward the barn . " He is the one that steals our chickens , " said John . " And see , he 's flying straight for the barn . Thomas , run and ask father for the gun . " Mr. Harvey kept two guns in his house ; but he used them only for shooting hawks , when they were flying about to steal the poultry . John and Thomas had learned to use them , and sometimes spent an afternoon in firing at a mark . But they never did so without their father 's consent . Illustration : THE HAWK . Thomas soon joined the other boys , having the gun in his hand ; and after Mr. Harvey had bidden them to be careful , they followed in the direction the hawk was flying . They kept close by the fence , so that it could not see them . In a short time it was over the barn yard , and sailing round and round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thomas , " said John ; and Thomas ran stooping along some bushes , followed by John and Samuel , on their hands and feet . The hawk was now quite low , and the boys could hear the hens screaming and running about . At last Thomas reached the barn fence , and his brother told him to fire . But he could not take aim , because the hawk was partly hidden by the corner of the barn . " I am afraid he 'll get that little chicken , " said Samuel . " See if you can take aim now , " whispered John . The hawk now made a sweep at one of the chickens ; but it ran under the barn , and the hawk flew up a little higher . Just then , Thomas fired . The hawk came down head foremost , and Thomas threw away his gun , and sprang over the wall . John and Samuel jumped after him , shouting as loud as they could . In a few moments the hawk was dead . It was the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached the house , Mr. Harvey was waiting for them ; and on seeing so large a hawk , promised to have it stuffed for them . The gun was then hung up in its place . Illustration CHAPTER VII . ABOUT BATS . This evening , while the boys were reading and talking to Mr. Harvey , several bats flew in at the window . John caught one of them in his hat , and placed it on the table for his cousin to examine . Samuel asked his uncle if it would not fly away . " No , " said Mr. Harvey , " it can not raise itself from the ground . What we call its wings , are , you see , nothing but two thin skins , or membranes , stretched from its hind legs to its fore ones , and fastened to its sides . When flying , it spreads out its toes , so as to unfold these membranes , and thus balances itself in the air . " " Do not some people think that the bat is a bird ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never examined a bat closely . You see that it looks nothing at all like a bird . " " Father , " said John , " where did those great bats come from , which you have in your cabinet ? " " From the island of Java , " said Mr. Harvey . " They are called Java bats . I have seen some with bodies as large as hens , and wings like umbrellas . Hundreds of these animals fly about the gardens and orchards of that island , every night , destroying great quantities of fruit . The people there , spread nets over the trees , to protect the fruit , and shoot the bats with guns , as you did the hawk . " " I have read , in a book of travels , " said Samuel , " that while persons are asleep , these bats , or some other large kind , suck their blood . Is that true , sir ? " " No , " said Mr. Harvey . " Such tales were long believed , even by writers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a monstrous bat sucking the blood from a man 's veins . But all this is now known to be fabulous . No kind of bat will attack an animal as large as itself , nor enter a house when there is an abundance of fruit and insects in the field . " " Shall we let this bat go now ? " said John . Mr. Harvey said yes ; and then John lifted it on a large sheet of paper , and threw it into the air . In a moment it spread out its thin wings , and after flying about the room two or three times , passed out of the window . Mr. Harvey told them , that although the bat was so feeble when on the ground , yet its strength of wing was greater than that of any bird . Illustration CHAPTER VIII . THE WALK TO THE CREEK . The next day there was a heavy thunder shower , in the morning , which compelled the boys to stay in the house ; and in the afternoon the teacher of the academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he staid , Thomas , with his brother and cousin , were told to remain in the house . But the next day was cool and pleasant , and they started early on a ramble through the fields . As they passed close to a farm house , Samuel saw a large dog chained to a tree , in the yard . It looked very fierce at them as they passed , and then began to growl and bark . Thomas told his cousin , that this dog had bitten several persons in the neighborhood , and that some of the school boys had tried to poison it ; but that the farmer was careful always to keep it chained , so that no body might get a chance to catch it in the road . About half a mile further onward was a fine stream of water . It began in the hills , and ran winding along , deeper and broader , to a great distance . Mr. Harvey owned several farms along this creek ; and here Thomas and John often came , in summer evenings , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hundreds of fish could be seen sporting around the shores . When the boys reached this creek , they sat down under a shady tree , to watch the fishes , and listen to the songs of the birds , on the bushes that hung over the water . In a short time , a number of eels came from under a large stone , one after the other , and after swimming about for a little while , buried themselves in the mud . Samuel asked Thomas where so many came from . " They live in the water , " replied his cousin . " On a pleasant evening you can see many more swimming among the stones , and the roots of trees , by the edge of the creek . But , do you know , that they sometimes come out of the water , and glide about the meadows . " " No , " said Samuel ; " do they ? " " Yes , " replied Thomas . " At night you may sometimes see a great many among the grass . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , going from the little creek , near Daddy Hall 's house , toward the mill pond . We thought , at first , that they were snakes , and so moved out of their road ; but by and by , we perceived that they were eels . The weather had been hot and dry for two weeks before , and these eels were travelling to find more water . So father told us afterwards . " The boys now walked on , down the creek , until they came to a small bridge . On this a boy , about as large as Samuel , was standing , throwing stones into the water . When Thomas , and the other two , got near enough , they saw he was stoning frogs . Every time one of these little animals put its head above the water , the boy pelted it with a stone ; and two or three had been mashed to death , as they sat on the broad stones , near the water 's edge . Illustration : STONING FROGS . Now , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say that this was a cruel boy -- and so he was . As soon as John saw what he was about , he called to him to stop . The boy said he would not , and stoned harder than before . Then John began to grow angry . You remember , children , I told you , that though John was a noble hearted fellow , yet he was quick of temper ; and when he saw boys doing wrong , he was apt to get angry very soon , if they did not stop when they were told . So , seeing that the boy still threw stones , he called to him again , louder than before . " What shall I stop for ? " said the boy . " Because , " said John , as he stepped on the bridge , " you have no business to stone frogs . What hurt do they do you ? " " A good deal , " said the boy ; and he threw another stone . " I tell you to stop , " replied John ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his frogs , too ; and you have no right here , if you ca n't behave yourself . " The boy now threw off his cap , as if to fight , and said : " I do n't care for you or your father either ; I 'll stone as long as I please , and no one shall hinder me , " and as he spoke , he shook his fist in John 's face . John was now very angry . " If you touch me , " he said , " I 'll throw you , head foremost , over the bridge . I tell you to quit stoning frogs , and you shall quit . " Thomas and Samuel now came forward ; for they were afraid that there would be some fighting . John and the boy stood looking at each other for a little while ; but at last , the boy seeing that John was not afraid of him , picked up his hat and walked off , muttering that he did not care for any body . " He had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow calm , Thomas told him that he ought not to get so angry , for he could have driven off the boy just as well , by speaking quietly to him . " I have seen him once or twice before , " added Thomas , " and I hear that he is a very bad boy . " Illustration CHAPTER IX . THE HARD BATTLE . In coming home by some cherry trees that stood near the fence , Samuel saw a little animal , larger than a bat , fly swiftly from one branch to another . He asked his cousins if it was not a flying squirrel . Thomas answered , " Yes . Several nests of them are in these trees . If you could examine one of these squirrels closely , you would see that its wings , as they are called , are not like bird 's wings . " " They seem more like a bat 's wings , " said Samuel . " So they are , " replied his cousin ; " only thin skins , stretched along the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these squirrels can not fly far , nor stay long in the air , as bats can . They merely dart swiftly from one branch to another . " " What other kinds of squirrels are there ? " asked Samuel . " The grey squirrel , " said Thomas , " much larger than this one . It is not often found about here . Then the ground squirrel , that lives in the ground , instead of on the trees . The common squirrel , such as you see running about the fences and woods ; and two or three other kinds . Some people eat squirrels ; but I have never tasted one . " The boys now heard some one screaming , and stopped to listen . " It comes from that field , " said John ; " let us run and see what is the matter . " They did so , and soon saw that the big dog they had passed in going to the creek , had got out , and was chasing a boy . This boy was screaming with fear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stoning frogs . But the boys ran with all their might to help him , picking up such stones and sticks as lay on the ground , in their way . When they reached the boy , he was pale with fear , for the dog was close to him . Samuel also felt a little afraid ; but he joined his two cousins in trying to beat the dog back . The fierce animal got John 's stick in his mouth , and wrenched it out of his hand ; but he kicked it in the jaws , and so kept it off with his feet , while Thomas and Samuel struck it over the head with all their might . As to the boy , he ran as hard as he could , until he was out of sight . Thomas 's stick now broke , but Samuel ran his down the dog 's throat , and John ran to bring a great pole which was lying a little distance off . With this they kept the dog from biting them , until some men came running down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen the dog run out of the farmer 's yard , and were anxious to kill it . So they threw a rope round its neck , and dragged it away . They said it should be shot . The boys were very warm , and could scarcely get their breath . They walked , therefore , to a tree which stood in the field , and sat down to get cool , and rest themselves . Thomas said he would be glad if the dog were killed , for such an animal was not fit to keep . " If we had each had a good stout club , " replied his brother , " he would never have run after any of us again . " They looked for the boy , but he could not be seen ; and after resting themselves , they walked home . When Mr. Harvey heard of their battle with the dog , he said that it was a great blessing they had not been bitten ; for that in summer the bite of a dog often caused madness , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USES OF ANIMALS . When Samuel had been at his uncle 's about two weeks . Mr. Harvey told him one morning , that he might go with his cousins to a field where early corn was growing and pull some to cook , if it was ripe . They had a merry time among the high corn . As they came back to the house , carrying their basket of ears , Samuel asked his cousins , why corn was sometimes called Indian corn . " It is because it formed the chief food of the Indians , before white men came to this country , " replied Thomas . " Father says its proper name is maize . It was first found in this country ; and there are some parts of America where it is used altogether instead of wheat or rye . Did you ever taste cakes made from it ? " " Yes , " said Samuel ; " they were sweeter than wheat bread ; but I would not like to eat them every day . " " Nor I either , " said John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs , and milk in it , and then baked brown in the oven . Do n't you , Samuel ? " " I never tasted it that way . But I think corn is best boiled on the ear , and eaten with meat and vegetables . " Mr. Harvey 's library , as I have already told you , was very large . He spent much time in the room where it was , either reading or writing . In the afternoon , after the boys had gathered the corn , he called them into this room , and showed them some beautiful pictures of animals and countries . While looking at them , Samuel asked him if he thought every animal had been made for some useful purpose . " Yes , my boy , " answered his uncle ; " we have reason to believe that even things which appear to be entirely useless , such as gravel stones , or weeds , have been made by God for some good end . The more we learn about animals and plants , the more plainly this appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious animal , called a Sloth . It looks a little like a bear . Now listen , boys , to a few words about this animal . It lives in thick , gloomy forests , so that it can scarcely ever be taken . When placed on the ground it can not walk , but drags itself forward , with its fore legs , crying all the time , as if in great pain . Its claws are long , and turn up under its feet . In the woods it lives all the time on the trees , hanging from a branch , with its back toward the ground . Tell me what you think of such an animal . " " I think it must be miserable all day long , " replied Samuel . " So every one thought , about fifty years ago , " said Mr. Harvey ; but men who have gone to the countries where sloths are , and seen them in the high trees , tell a very different story . They say that the sloth 's home is in the branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ; and he is there a strong and happy animal , although he looks so weak and miserable on the ground . He lives on fruit , and moves from one branch and one tree to another , with considerable swiftness . So you see that the sloth enjoys himself as well as any of us ; and I have no doubt that he was created for some good purpose , although we may not be able to understand precisely what it is . " But do not some animals eat each other ? " asked Thomas . " Yes , " replied Mr. Harvey ; " but this is of great use to man . What would the farmer do with all the insects that destroy his grain , if many of them were not eaten by little birds ; and how much of his fruit would these very birds destroy , if they , too , were not eaten by hawks ! If animals did not destroy each other , they would soon become so numerous as to crowd man from the earth . " CHAPTER XI . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken a pretty long walk , they came to a small cottage , standing by a garden , round which was a neat hedge . Part of this garden was planted with vegetables , and part with flowers , while many vines and sweet brier bushes stood before the cottage door . There were also large , white roses , which Samuel thought finer than any he had yet seen ; and in a corner of the garden farthest from the house , stood two bee hives . As the boys passed by , a young woman came out on the piazza , and asked them in . John and Thomas had often been here ; so they opened the gate and passed through with their cousin . The young woman , whose name was Alice , brought out chairs , and some new milk in bowls , for each of them to drink . Then she walked with them through the garden , showing them through the flowers , and telling their names . He was much pleased with the bee hives ; they were made of wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen at work . After watching them for some time , they returned through the garden to the cottage door . At this moment an old lady came to the door , and spoke to Mr. Harvey 's boys . Samuel observed that she was very feeble , and that her voice could scarcely be heard . She looked like one who had been often sick . When they left the cottage , he asked who she was . Illustration : ALICE GRAY . " Her name is Gray , " said Thomas . " Alice is her daughter . Mrs. Gray 's husband was a sailor , and when Alice was about three years old , he went on a voyage to catch whales , but was lost , with all the crew . Mrs. Gray was poor , and had four children ; and as no one in the town where she lived would help her , she opened a school for little boys and girls . The money she got by teaching , supported her family , until her two oldest children died . Soon after , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . Then she moved into this part of the country , and tried to make her living by weaving mats out of rushes . But in the fall , the child older than Alice , died ; and Mrs. Gray again grew sick . Her landlord was a hard hearted man : he turned her out of doors , and the poor woman would have died , if some neighbors had not taken her in , and provided for her until she could work for herself . At last she went to live on one of the hills that you can see near the iron mine . She did pretty well that winter ; but one day in the spring , a great freshet ruined every thing that she had , and almost carried away her house . Afraid to stay on the hill any longer , she was about to go to the city , and ask assistance from the societies which give help to poor people , when some persons , told her to move to the cottage she is in now , and that they would pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older , she worked hard to support her mother , and she it was who planted all the flowers and vegetables that you saw in the garden . Father made her a present of the bee hives . Every body loves her because she has so sweet a temper . " " And is the old lady still sick ? " asked Samuel . " Yes , " said his cousin , " she will never be well again . Yet she is happy in having a good daughter and kind friends , and loves to see the young people , who sometimes stop to talk or read to her . " At some distance from the cottage the boys met a bull in the road . It was standing still when they first saw it ; but in a little while it began to strike the ground with its feet , and toss about its head . Samuel was afraid to go on ; but his cousins told him to follow them , without attempting to run . As they passed , the bull looked fiercely at them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes steady on it , all the while . It continued to make a great noise , but did not follow them . After they had passed it , Thomas said they could then walk as fast as they chose , lest the bull might follow them . Samuel asked him , if bulls had not sometimes killed people . " Yes , " he replied , " bulls are dangerous when any thing makes them angry . And at such times , if you run from them they are sure to follow . They often fight with each other ; and farmer Smith had a bull killed by another one last spring . If you meet them in the road , it is best to face them , without showing any fear . It is not often that they will attack any one who has courage enough to look straight at them . " Illustration CHAPTER XII . LOCUSTS . Mr. Harvey 's boys had a very fine fig tree , which had been presented to them by a friend of their father , and of which they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that it might be placed in the house during the winter . The boys expected it would bear fruit next year . One day John burst into the room where Thomas , Samuel , and his father were sitting , and exclaimed with a doleful voice : " Oh , father , it is dead -- eaten by the locusts -- I found a dozen on it . " " What 's the matter , John ? " said Mr. Harvey . " What have the locusts eaten ? " " Our fig tree , " replied John . " It is gone past all remedy . Only come with me , and you 'll see it . " They followed him down the garden walk . On reaching the fig tree , Mr. Harvey saw that nearly all its leaves had been eaten off , with most of the bark and young branches . Thomas and Samuel were very sorry , and John said he would kill every locust he met , from that day forward . Mr. Harvey examined the tree , and found , that although much damage had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be restored . " We ought to have covered it with a net , " he said to the boys . While his father was talking with Thomas and his cousin , John was stooping on the ground , hammering something with a stone . At last Mr. Harvey turned round , and asked John what he was doing . " I am killing these fine locusts that I have caught , " replied John . " Stop , my son , " said Mr. Harvey , " that is foolish conduct , and very wicked . You are giving way to anger and revenge , two of the worst passions that a youth can indulge . " " But , father , they will eat more trees . " " The damage that a few locusts can do , is not much , " answered his father ; " and if we had taken proper care with the fig tree , they would not have reached it . Let those under your hat go , and when we go into the house , I will tell you about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill as many as you chose , if you were there . " John did as his father bade him , and said he was sorry for having acted so foolishly . Then Mr. Harvey trimmed the fig tree with his knife , and said he would send a servant to place a screen over it . When they came to the house , John reminded his father of his promise concerning the locusts . Mr. Harvey took from a shelf several large pictures of insects , and laying one on the table , asked his son what he thought it was . " It looks like a large grasshopper , " said John . " It is the locust of the East , " replied his father . " These locusts are shaped almost exactly like the long-winged grasshoppers that fly about our fields ; but they are two or three times larger . What do you think this picture is ? " " It seems to be a great cloud of dust . " " It is a swarm of Eastern locusts . Hundreds of thousands fly thus together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . When alighting they cover the earth for more than a mile round , and eat every green thing to the very roots . The noise of their wings is like thunder . They leave the country like a desert , so that the terrified people look forward to misery and famine . Men , women , and children , turn out with guns and stones , to kill them ; and sometimes large fires are kindled for the same purpose . The dead ones are taken by cart loads to markets , and sold for food . " " To be eaten , sir ! " said Samuel . " Yes , " replied Mr. Harvey , " mixed with butter , and fried in a pan , they form almost all the meat that the poorer classes in those countries get . " " Its a shocking meal " said John . " Not so bad as you suppose , " said his father . " Perhaps , if it were not the custom in this country to eat lobsters or hogs , we would look upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think of dining off of spiders ? " " Horrible , " said John . His father continued : " I have read of a man who ate nothing else , when he could get spiders . So you see that people 's tastes differ . You know that John Baptist 's food was locusts and wild honey . " " Do the people kill all the locusts in a swarm ? " asked Thomas . " No , " said his father , " a swarm is so large that after hundreds of cart loads are taken from it , it seems no smaller . Generally , the wind drives them into the sea , where they perish . But their dead bodies , cast upon shore , become corrupt , and produce plagues . " " I wish , " said John , " that the wind would drive all we have into the sea , or else a good distance from our fig tree . Who would think that such little animals could do so much mischief . " " Is it true that locusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " said Mr. Harvey ; " but not the common kind , such as ate the fig tree . All locusts come from eggs . In first coming from the egg , they are not winged , but look like grub worms . After a while these grubs cast off their skins , and become locusts . Now , there is a kind of locust which is seventeen years in changing from the egg to the full insect It is this kind which is so numerous every seventeen years . If you go into the field when they are coming from the ground , you will see the grass and plants covered with them . " " Father , " said John , " why did the locusts strip all the leaves from the fig tree , without touching any of the flowers or bushes around ? " " I suppose , " said Mr. Harvey , " it is because the fig tree is very tender . It comes , you know , from warm countries , and is there the proper food of the locust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , have been eaten also . " CHAPTER XIII . THE RETURN HOME . A few days after this conversation , a large fox came , in the evening , into Mr. Harvey 's barn yard ; but as a dog belonging to one of the farmers was near , he was driven off before he could catch any of the chickens . The boys heard the noise , and ran down . They saw the fox running very fast away , while the dog , which could not follow through the hole under the fence , had gone round the barn , to get into the field . Samuel and his cousins chased the fox as far as they could see it , and then returned to the barn yard to hunt for more . But none could be found , and they walked up to the house . Illustration : THE FOX . At last the month of August rolled around , and the holidays drew toward a close . I have told you only about a few things that Samuel saw in his walks around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enjoyed himself very much . He also learned a great deal . I hope , children , that you have also learned something by reading this book . Samuel tried to remember all that his uncle and cousins told him , and often thought of it when he was by himself . It would be well if you would do the same . Have you a little brother , or sister ? See if you can tell it what Mr. Harvey told Samuel about bats , locusts , rivers , the rain , and sloths . You may also tell the story of Alice Gray , and old Jack the Soldier . You remember that Samuel was to go home at the end of August . Thomas and John looked very sorrowful as the time drew near ; for they loved their cousin very much , and wished that he could stay with them altogether . On the last evening , Mr. Harvey took all the boys to a branch of the river about seven miles off , to enjoy a sail in a boat , on the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the place in a carriage . Samuel thought that the sight of the water , sparkling in the moon-beams , and stretching away so wide and still , with the dark bushes on each side , was the finest thing he had yet seen . When they were in the middle of the stream , and gliding slowly down it , Mr. Harvey and his sons joined in singing some simple song ; and as they had brought plenty of food with them , they staid on the water until midnight . Next morning , Samuel started for town , at nine o'clock . He had received many beautiful and useful things from his cousins , and as he pressed their hands , and again and again , bade them good bye , he felt how much he would miss their company when he would be in the city . But they promised to write to each other , and as often as they could , send presents from one to another . Then the horses trotted rapidly down the road , and Mr. Harvey , with his boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
