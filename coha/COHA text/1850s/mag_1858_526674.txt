CHESUNCOOK . Continued . How far men go for the material of their houses ! The inhabitants of the most civilized cities , in all ages , send into far , primitive forests , beyond the bounds of their civilization , where the moose and bear and savage dwell , for their pineboards for ordinary use . And , on the other hand , the savage soon receives from cities iron arrow-points , hatchets , and guns to point his savageness with . The solid and well-defined fir-tops , like sharp and regular spear-heads , black against the sky , gave a peculiar , dark , and sombre look to the forest . The spruce-tops have a similar , but more ragged outline ,  --  their shafts also merely feathered below . The firs were somewhat oftener regular and dense pyramids . I was struck by this universal spiring upward of the forest evergreens . The tendency is to slender , spiring tops , while they are narrower below . Not only the spruce and fir , but even the arbor-vitae and white pine , unlike the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all spire upwards , lifting a dense spear-head of cones to the light and air , at any rate , while th , eir branches straggle after as they may ; as Indians lift the ball over the heads of the crowd in their desperate game . In this they resemble grasses , as also palms somewhat . The hemlock is commonly a tent-like pyramid from the ground to its summit . After passing through some long rjps and by a large island , we reached an interesting part of tlrs river called the Pine-Stream Dead-Water , about six miles below Ragmuff , where the river expanded to thirty rods in width and had many islands in it , with elms and canoe-birches , now yellowing , along the shore , and we got our first sight of Katadn . Here , about two o'clock , we turned up a small branch three or four rods wide , which comes in on the right from the south , called Pine Stream , to look for moose signs . We had gone but a few rods before we saw very recent signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their feet being quite fresh , and Joe declared that they had gone along there but a short time before . We soon reached a small meadow on the east side , at an angle in the stream , which was for the most part densely covered with alders . As we were advancing along the edge of this , rather more quietly than usual , perhaps , on account of the freshness of the signs ,  --  the design being to camp up this stream , if it promised well ,  --  I heard a slight crackling of twigs deep in the alders , and turned Joe 's attention to it ; whereupon he began to push the canoe back rapidly ; and we had receded thus half a dozen rods , when we suddenly spied two moose standing just on the edge of the open part of the meadow which we had passed , not more than six or seven rods distant , looking round the alders at us . They made me think of great frightened rabbits , with their long ears and half . inquisitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I saw at once , ) filling a vacuum which now first I discovered had not been filled for me ,  --  moosemen , wood-eaters , the word is said to mean ,  --  clad in a sort of Vermont gray , or homespun . Our Nimrod , owing to the retrograde movement , was now the farthest from the game ; but being warned of its neighborhood , he hastily stood up , and , while we ducked , fired over our heads one barrel at the foremost , which alone he saw , though he did not know what kind of creature it was ; whereupon this one dashed across the meadow and up a high bank on the north-east , so rapidly as to leave but an indistinct impression of its outlines on my mind . At the same instant , the other , a young one , but as tall as a horse , leaped out into the July , // stream , in full sight , and there stood cowering for a moment , or rather its dispro-. portionate lowness behind gave it that appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an indistinct recollection of seeing the old one pause an instant on the top of the bank in the woods , look toward its shivering young , and then dash away again . The second barrel was levelled at the calf , and when we expected to see it drop in the water , after a little hesitation , it , too , got out of the water , and dashed up the hill , though in a somewhat different direction . All this was the work of a few seconds , and our hunter , having never seen a moose before , did not know but they were deer , for they stood partly in the water , nor whether he had fired at the same one twice or not . From the style in which they went oW and the fact that he was not used to standing up and firing from a canoe , I judged that we should not see anything more of them . The Indian said that they were a cow and her calf ; -a yearling , or perhaps two years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my part , I had not noticed much difference in their size . It was but two or three rods across the meadow to the foot of the bank , which , like all the world thereabouts , was densely wooded ; but I was surprised to notice , that , as soon as the moose had passed behind the veil of the woods , there was no sound of footsteps to be heard from the soft , damp moss which carpets that forest , and long before we landed , perfect silence reigned . Joe said , " If you wound em moose , me sure get em . " We all landed at once . My companion reloaded ; the Indian fastened his birch , threw off his hat , adjusted his waistband , seized the hatchet , and set out . He told me afterward , casually , that before we landed he had seen a drop of blood on the bank , when it was two or three rods off . He proceeded rapidly up the bank and through the woods , with a peculiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and left on the ground , and stepping in the faint tracks of the wounded moose , now and then pointing in silence to a single drop of blood on the handsome , shining leaves of the Clintonia Borealis , which , on every side , covered the ground , or to a dry fern-stem freshly broken , all the while chewing some leaf or else the spruce gum . I followed , watching his motions more than the trail of the moose . After following the trail about forty rods in a pretty direct course , stepping over fallen trees and winding betweert standing ones , he at length lost it , for there were many other moose-tracks there , and , returning once more to the last bloodstain , traced it a little way and lost it again , and , too soon , I thought , for a good hunter , gave it up entirely . He traced a few steps , also , the tracks of the calf ; but , seeing no blood , soon relinquished the search . I observed , while he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He did not communicate several observations of interest which he made , as a white man would have done , though they may have leaked out afterward . At another time , when we heard a slight crackling of twigs and he landed to reconnoitre , he stepped lightly and gracefully , stealing through the bushes with the least possible noise , in a way in which no white man does ,  --  as it were , finding a place for his foot each time . About half an hour after seeing the moose , we pursued our voyage up Pine Stream , and soon , coming to a part which was very shoal and also rapid , we took out the baggage , and proceeded to carry it round , while Joe got up with the canoe alone . We were just completing our portage and I was absorbed in the plants , admiring the leaves of the aster macrophyllus , ten inches wide , and plucking the seeds of the great round-leaved orchis , when Joe exclaimed from the stream that he had killed a moose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm , in the middle of the stream , which was so shallow that it rested on the bottom , with hardly a third oC its body above water . It was about an hour after it was // shot , and it was swollen with water . It had run about a hundred rods and sought the stream again , cutting off a slight bend . No doubt , a better hunter would have tracked it to this spot at once . I was surprised at its great size , horse-like , but Joe said it was not a large cow-moose . My companion went in search of the call ' again . I took hold of the ears of the moose , while Joe pushed his canoe down stream toward a favorable shore , and so we made out , though with some difficulty , its long nose frequently sticking in the bottom , to drag it into still shallower water . It was a brownish black , or perhaps a dark iron-gray , on the back and sides , but lighter beneath and in front I took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Joe 's assistance measured it carefully , the greatest distances first , making a knot each time . The painter being wanted , I reduced these measures that night with equal care to lengths and fractions of my umbrella , beginning with the smallest measures , and untying the knots as I proceeded ; and when we arrived at Chesuncook the next day , finding a two-foot rule there , I reduced the last to feet and inches ; and , moreover , I made myself a two-foot rule of a thin and narrow strip of black ash which would fold up conveniently to six inches . All this pains I took , because I did not wish to be obliged to say merely that the moose was very large . Of the various dimensions which I obtained I will mention only two . The distance from the tips of the hoofs of the fore-feet , stretched out , to the top of the back between the shoulders , was seven feet and five inches . I can hardly believe my own measure , for this is about two feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The extreme length was eight feet and two inches . Another cow-moose , which I have since measured in those woods with a tape , was just six feet from the tip of the hoof to the shoulders , and eight feet long as she lay . When afterward I asked an Indian at the carry bow much taller the male was , he answered , " Eighteen inches , " and made me observe the height of a crossstake over the fire , more than four feet from the ground , to give me some idea of the depth of his chest . Another Indian , at Oldtown , told me that they were nine feet high to the top of the back , and that one which he tried weighed eight hundred pounds . The length of the spinal projections between the shoulders is very great . A white hunter , who was the best authority among hunters that I could have , told me that the male was not eighteen inches taller than the female yet he agreed that he was sometimes nine feet high to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the male has horns , and they rise two feet or more above the shoulders ,  --  spreading three or four , and sometimes six feet ,  - -  which would make him in all , sometimes , eleven feet high ! According to this calculation , the moose is as tall , though it may not be as large , as the great Irish elk , Megaceros Hibernicus , of a former period , of which Mantell says that it " very far exceeded in magnitude any living , species , the skeleton " being " upward of ten feet high from the ground to the highest point of the antlers ! ' Joe said , that , though the moose shed the whole horn annually , each new horn has an additional prong but I have noticed that they sometimes have more prongs on one side than on the other . I was struck with the delicacy and tenderness of the hoofs , which divide very far up , and the one half could be pressed very much behind the other , thus probably making the animal surer-footed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . They were very unlike the stiff and battered feet of our horses and oxen . The four inches at the extremities . The moose is singularly grotesque and awkward to look at . Why should it stand so high at the shoulders ? Why have so long a head ? Why have no tail to speak of ? for ' in my examination I overlooked it entirely . Naturalists say // it is an inch and a half long . It reminded me at once of the camelopard , high before and low behind ,  --  and no wonder , for , like it , it is fitted to browse on trees . The upper lip projected two inches beyond the lower for this purpose . This was the kind of man that was at home there ; for , as near as I can learn , that has never been the residence , but rather the hunting-ground of the Indian . The moose will perhaps one day become extinct ; but how naturally then , when it exists only as a fossil relic , and unseen as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with similar branching and leafy horns ,  --  a sort of fucus or lichen in bone ,  --  to be the inhabitant of such a forest as this ! ' Here , just at the head of the murmuring rapids , Joe now proceeded to skin the moose with a pocket-knife , while I looked on ; and a tragical business it was ,  --  to see that still warm and palpitating body piereed with a knife , to see the warm milk stream from the rent udder , and the ghastly naked red carcass appearing from within its seemly robe , which was made to hide it . The ball had passed through the shoulder-blade diagonally and lodged under the skin on the opposite side , and was partially flattened . My companion keeps it to show to his grandchildren . He has the shanks of another moose which be has since shot , skinned and stuffed , ready to be made into boots by putting in a thick leather sole . Joe said , if a moose stood fronting you , you must not fire , but advance toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair shot . In the bed of this narrow , wild , and rocky stream , between two lofty walls of spruce and firs , a mere cleft in the forest which the stream had made , this work went on . At length Joe had stripped off the hide and dragged it trailing to the shore , declaring that it weighed a hundred pounds , though probably fifty would have been nearer the truth . He cut off a large mass of the meat to carry along , and another , together with the tongue and nose , he put with the hide on the shore to lie there all night , or till we returned . I . was surprised that he thought of leaving this meat thus exposed by the side of the carcass , as the simplest course , not fearing that any creature would touch it ; but nothing did . This could hardly have happened on the bank of one of our rivers in the eastern part of Massachusetts ; but I suspect that fewer small wild animals are prowling there than with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of a species of large mouse . This stream was so withdrawn , and the moose-tracks were so fresh , that my companions , still bent on hunting , concluded to go farther up it and camp , and then hunt up or down at night . Half a mile above this , at a place where I saw the aster puniceus and the beaked hazel , as we paddled along , Joe , hearing a slight rustling amid the alders , and seeing something black about two rods off , jumped up and whispered , " Bear ! " but before the hunter had discharged his piece , he corrected himself to " Beaver ! " " Hedgehog ! " The bullet killed a large hedgehog , more than two feet and eight inches long . The quills were rayed out and flattened on the hinder part of its back , even as if it had lain on that part , but were erect and long between this and the tail . Their points , closely examined , were seen to be finely bearded or barbed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concave , to give the barbs effect . After about a mile of still water , we prepared our camp on the right side , just at the foot of a considerable falL Little chopping was done that night , for fear of ' scaring the moose . We had moose-meat fried for supper . It tasted like tender beeg with perhaps more flavor ,  --  sometimes like veal . After supper , the moon having risen , we proceeded to hunt a mile up this stream , first " carrying " about the falls . We made a picturesque sight , wending single-file along the shore , climbing over rocks and logs ,  --  Joe , who brought up the rear , twirling his canoe in his hands as if it were a feather , in places where it was difficult to get along without a burden . // We launched the canoe again from the ledge o*er which the stream fell , but after half a mile of still water , suitable for hunting , it became rapid again , and we were compelled to make our way along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birch alone , though it was still very difficult for him to pick his way amid the rocks in the night . We on the shore found the worst of walking , a perfect chaos of fallen and drifted trees , and of bushes projecting far over the water , and now and then we made our way across the mouth of a small tributary on a kind of net-work of alders . So we went tumbling on in the dark , being on the shady side , effectually scaring all the moose and bears that might be thereabouts . At length we came to a standstill , and Joe went forward to reconnoitre ; but he reported that it was still a continuous rapid as far as he went , or half a mile , with no prospect of improvement , as if it *ere coming down from a mountain . So we turned about , hunting back to the camp through the still water . It was a splendid moonlight night , and I , getting sleepy as it grew late ,  --  for I had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . This stream was much more unfrequented than the main one , lumbering operations being no longer carried on in this quarter . It was only three or four rods wide , but the firs and spruce through which it trickled seemed yet taller by contrast . Being in this dreamy state , which the moonlight enhanced , I did not clearly discern the shore , but seemed , most of the time , to be floating through ornamental grounds ,  --  for I associated the fir-tops with such scenes ; - very high up some Broadway , and beneath or between their tops , I thought I saw an endless succession of porticos and columns , cornices and facades , verandas and churches . I did not merely fancy this , but in my drowsy state such was the illusion . I fairly lost myself in sleep several times , still dreaming of that architecture and the nobility that dwelt behind and might issue from it ; but all at once .1 would be aroused and brought back to a sense of my actual position by the sound of Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling the moose , ugh , ugh , oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo , and I prepared to hear a furious moose come rushing and crashing through the forest , and see hin*i burst out on to the little strip of meadow by our side . But , on more accounts than one , I had had enough of moose-hunting . I had not come to the woods for this purpose , nor had I foreseen it , though I had been willing to learn how the Indian manmuvred ; but one moose killed was as good , if not as bad , as a dozen . The afternoon 's tragedy , and my share in it , as it affected the innocence , destroyed the pleasure of my adventure . It is true , 1 came as near as is possible to come to being a hunter and miss it , myself ; and as it is , I think that I could spend a year in the woods , fishing and hunting , justenough to sustain myself , with satisfaction . This would be next to living like a philosopher on the fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracts me . But this hunting of the moose merely for the satisfaction of killing him ,  --  not even for the sake of his hide ,  --  without making any extraordinary exertion or running any risk yourself , is too much like going out by night to some wood-side pasture and shooting your neighbor 's horses . These are God 's own horses , poor , timid creatures , that will run fast enough as soon as they smell you , though they are nine feet high . Joe told us of some hunters who a year or two before had shot down several oxen by night , somewhere in the Maine woods , mistaking them for moose . - And so might any of the hunters ; and what is the difference in the sport , but the name ? In the former case , having killed one of God 's and your own oxen , you strip off its hide ,  --  because that is the common trophy , and , moreover , you have heard that it may be sold for moccasins ,  --  cut a steak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell to heaven for you . It is no better , at least , than to assist at a slaughter-house . This afternoon 's experience suggested to me how base or coarse are the motives // which commonly carry men into the wilderness . The explorers and lumberers generally are all hirelings , paid so much a day for their labor , and as such they kive no more love for wild nature than wood-sawyers have for forests . Other white men and Indians who come here are for the most part hunters , whose object is to slay as many moose and other wild animals as possible . But , pray , could not one spend some weeks or years in the solitude of this vast wilderness with other employments than these ,  --  employments perfectly sweet and innocent and ennobling ? For one that comes with a pencil to sketch or sing , a thousand come with an axe or rifle . What a coarse and imperfect use Indians and hunters make of Nature ! No wonder that their race is so soon exterminated . I already , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this part of my woodland experience , and was reminded that our life should be lived as tenderly and daintily as one would pluck a flower . With these thoughts , when we reached our camping-ground , I decided to leave my companions to continue moose-hunting down the stream , while I prepared the camp , though they requested me not to chop much nor make a large fire , for fear I should scare their game . In the midst of the damp fir-wood , high on the mossy bank , about nine o'clock of this bright moonlight night , I kindled a fire , when they were gone , and , sitting on the fir-twigs , within sound of the falls , examined by its light the botanical specimens which I had collected that afternoon , and wrote down some of the reflections which I have here expanded ; or I walked along the shore and gazed up the stream , where the whole space above the falls was filled with mellow light . As I sat before the fire on my fir-twig seat , without walls above or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wilderness stretched , before you came to cleared or cultivated fields , and wondered if any bear or moose was watching the light of my fire ; for Nature looked sternly upon me on account of the murder of the moose . Strange that so few ever come to the woods to see how the pine lives and grows and spires , lifting its evergreen arms to the light ,  --  to see its perfect success ; but most are content to behold it in the shape of many broad boards brought to market , and deem that its trne success ! But the pine is no more lumber than man is , and to be made into boards and houses is no more its true and highest use than the trnest use of a man is to be cut down and made into manure . There is a higher law affecting our relation to pines as well as to men . A pine cut down , a dead pine , is no more a pine than a dead human carcass is a man . Can he who has discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to have discovered the true use of the whale ? Can he who slays the elephant for his ivory be said to have " seen the elephant " ? These are petty and accidental uses ; just as if a stronger race were to kill us in order to make ' buttons and fiageolets of our bones ; for everything may serve a lower as well as a higher use . Every creature is better alive than dead , men and moose and pine-trees , and he who understands it aright will rather preserve its life than destroy it . Is it the lumberman , then , who is the friend and lover of the pine , stands nearest to it , and understands its nature best ? Is it the tanner who has barked it , or he who has boxed it for turpentine , whom posterity will fable to have been changed into a pine at last ? No ! no ! it is the poet ; he it is who makes the truest use of the pine ,  --  who does not fondle it with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke it with a plane ,  --  who knows whether its heart is false without cutting into it ,  --  who has not bought the stumpage of the township on which it stands . All the pines shudder and heave a sigh when that man steps . on the forest floor . No , it is the poet , who loves them as his own shadow in the air , and lets them stand . I have been into the lumber-yard , and the carpenter 's shop , and the tannery , and the lamphlack-factory , and the turpentine // clearimr ; but when at length I saw the tops of the pines waving and reflecting the light at a distance high over all the rest of the forest , I realized that the former were not the highest use of the pine . It is not their bones or hide or tallow that I love most . It is the living spirit of the tree , not its spirit of turpentine , with which I sympathize , and which heals my cuts . Ere long , the hunters returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my suggestions , bringing a quarter of the dead one , which , with ourselves , made quite a load for the canoe . After breakfasting on moose-meat , we returned down Pine Stream on our way to Chesuncook Lake , which was about five miles distant . We could see the red carcass of the moose lying in Pine Stream when nearly half a mile off . Just below the mouth of this stream were the most considerable rapids between the two lakes , called f'ine-Stream Falls , where were large flat rocks washed smooth , and at this time you could easily wade across above them . Joe ran down alone while we walked over the portage , my companion collecting spruce gum for his friends at home , and I looking for flowers . Near the lake , which we were approaching with as much expectation as if it had been a university ,  --  for it is not often that the stream of our life opens into such expansions ,  --  were islands , and a low and meadowy shore with scattered trees , birches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maples ,  --  many of the white birches killed , apparently by inundations . There was considerable native grass ; and even a few cattle - whose movements we heard , though we did not see them , mistaking them at first for moose-were pastured there . On entering the lake , where the stream runs southeasterly , and for some time before , we had a view of the mountains about Katadn , ( Katakdinauquok one says they are called , ) like a cluster of blue fungi of rank growth , apparently twenty-five or thirty miles distant , in a southeast direction , their summits concealed by clouds . Joe called some of them the Souadneunlc mountains . This is the name of a stream there , which another Indian told us meant " Running between mountains . " Though some lower summits were afterward uncovered , we got no more complete view of Katada while we were in the woods . The clearing to which we were bound was on the right of the mouth of the river , and was reached by going round a low point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shore . Chesuncook Lake extends northwest and southeast , and is called eighteen miles long and three wide , without an island . We had entered the northwest corner of it , and when near the shore could see only part way down it . The principal mountains visible from the land here were those already mentioned , between southeast and east , and a few summits a little west of north , but generally the north and northwest h6rizon about the St. John and the British boundary was comparatively level . Ansell Smith 's , the oldest and principal clearing about this lake , appeared to be quite a harbor for bateaux and ca* noes ; seven or eight of the former were lying about , and there was a small scow for hay , and a capstan on a platform , now high and dry , ready to be floated and anchored to tow rafts with . It was a very primitive kind of harbor , where boats were drawn up amid the stumps ,  --  . such a one , methought , as the Argo might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small clearings on the opposite side of the lake , all at this end and visible from this point . One of the Smiths told me that it was so far cleared that they came here to live and built the present house four years before , though the family had been here but a few months . I was interested to see how a pioneer lived on this side of the country . His life is in some respects more adventurous than that of his brother in the West ; for he contends with winter as well as the wilderness , and there is a greater interval of // time at least between him and the army which is to follow . Here immigration is a tide which may ebb when it has swept away the pines ; there it is not a tide , but an inundation , and roads and other improvements come steadily rushing after . As we approached the log-house , a dozen rods from the lake , and considerably elevated above it , the projecting ends of the logs lapping over each other irregularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picturesque look , far removed from the meanness of weather-boards . It was a very spacious , low building , about eighty feet long , with many large apartments . The walls were well clayed between the logs , which were large and round , except on the upper and under sides , and as visible inside as out , successive bulging cheeks gradually lessening upwards and tuned to each other with the axe , like Pandean pipes . Probably the musical forest-gods had not yet cast them aside ; they never do till they are split or the bark is gone . It was a style of architecture not described by Vitruvms , I suspect , though possibly hinted at in the biography of Orpheus ; none of your frilled or fluted columns , which have cut such a false swell , and support nothing but a gable end and their builder 's pretensions ,  --  that is , with the multitude ; and as for " ornamentation , " one of those words with a dead tail which architects very properly use to describe their flourishes , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nobody troubled himself about . We certainly leave the handsomest paint and clapboards behind in the woods , when we strip off the bark and poison ourselves with whitelead in the towns . We get but half the spoils of the forest . For beauty , give me trees with the fur on . This house was designed and constructed with the freedom of stroke of a forester 's axe , without other compass and square than Nature uses . Wherever the logs were cut off by a window or door , that is , were not kept in place by alternate overlapping , they were held one upon another by very large pins driven in diagonally on each side , where branches might have been , and then cut off so close up and down as not to project beyond the bulge of the log , as if the logs clasped each other in their arms . These logs were posts , studs , boards , clapboards , laths , . plaster , and nails , all in one . Where the citizen uses a mere sliver or board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The house had large stone chimneys , and was roofed with spruce-bark . The windows were imported , all but the casings . One end was a regular logger 's camp , for the boarders , with the usual fir floor and log benches . Thus this house was but a slight departure from the hollow tree , / which the bear still inhabits ,  --  being a hollow made with trees piled up , with a coating of bark like its originaL The cellar was a separate building , like an ice-house , and it answered for a refrigerator at this season , our moose-meat being kept there . It was a potato-hole with a permanent roof . Each ' structure and institution here was so primitive that you could at once refer it to its source ; but our buildings commonly suggest neither their origin nor their purpose . There was a large , and what farmers would call handsome , barn , part of whose boards had been sawed by a whip-saw ; and the saw-pit , with its great pile of dust , remained before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn were laid a foot to the weather , suggesting what kind of weather they have there . Grant 's barn at Caribou Lake was said to be still larger , the biggest ox-nest in the woods , fifty feet by a hundred . Think of a monster barn in that primitive forest lifting its gray back above the tree-tops ! Man makes very much such a nest for his domestic animals , of withered grass and fodder , as the squirrels and many other wild creatures do for themselves . There was also a blacksmith 's shop , where plainly a good deal of work was done . The oxen and horses used in lumbering operations were shod , and all the iron-work of sleds , etc. , was repaired or made here . I saW them load a bateau at the Moosehead carry , the next Tuesday , // July , with about thirteen hundred weight of bar iron for this shop . This reminded me how primitive and honorable a trade was Vulcan 's . I do not hear that there was any carpenter or tailor among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every other mechanic at Chesuncook as well as on Olympus , and his family is the most widely dispersed , whether he be christened John or Ansell . Smith owned two miles down the lake by half a mile in width . There were about one hundred acres cleared here . He cut seventy tons of English hay this year on this ground , and twenty more on another clearing , and he uses it all himself in lumbering operations . The barn was crowded with pressed hay and a machine to press it . There was a large garden full of roots , turnips , beets , carrots , potatoes , etc. , all of great size . They said that they were worth as much here as in New York . I suggested some currants for sauce , especially as they had no apple-trees set out , and showed how easily they could be obtained . There was the usual long-handled axe of the primitive woods by the door , three and a half feet long ,  --  for my new blackash rule was in constant use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , report said , was full of porcupine quills . I can testify that he looked very sober . This is the usual fortune of pioneer dogs , for they have to face the brunt of the battle for their race , and act the part of Arnold Winkelried without intending it . If he should invite one of his town friends up this way , suggesting moose*meat and unlimited freedom , the latter might pertinently inquire , " What is that sticking in your nose ? " When a generation or two have used up all the enemies ' darts , their successors lead a comparatively easy life . We owe to our fathers analogous blessings . Many old people receive pensions for no other reason , it seems to me , but as a compensation for having lived a long time ago . No doubt , our town dogs still talk , in a snuffling way , about the days that tried dogs ' noses . How they got a cat up there I do not know , for they are as shy as my aunt about entering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree on the way ; but perhaps she was bewildered by the very crowd of opportunities . Twenty or thirty lumberers , Yankee - and Canadian , were coming and going ,  - -  Aleck among the rest ,  --  and from time to time an Indian touched here . In the winter there are sometimes a hundred men lodged here at once . The most interesting piece of news that circulated among them appeared to be , that four horses belonging to Smith , worth seven hundred dollars , had passed by further into the woods a week before . The white-pine-tree was at the bottom or further end of all this . It is a war against the pines , the only real Aroostook or Penobscot war . I have no doubt that they lived pretty much the same sort of life in the Homeric age , for men have always thought more of eating than of fighting ; then , as now , their minds ran chiefly on the " hot bread and sweet cakes " ; and the fur and lumber trade is an old story to Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade of heroism . In the days of Achilles , even , they delighted in big barns , and perchance in pressed hay , and he who possessed the most valuable team was the best fellow . We had designed to go on at evening up the Caucomgomoc , whose mouth was a mile or two distant , to the lake of the same name , about ten miles off ; but some Indians of Joe 's acquaintance , who were making canoes on the Caucomgomoc , came over from that side , and gave so poor an account of the moose-hunting , so many had been killed there lately , that my companions concluded not to go there . Joe spent this Sunday and the night with his acquaintances . The lumberers told me that there were many moose hereabouts , but no caribou or deer . A man from Oldtown had killed ten or twelve moose , within a year , so near the house that they heard all his guns . His name may have been Hercules , for aught // I know , though I should rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , no doubt , he keeps pace with the improvements of the age , and uses a Sharpe 's rifle now ; probably he gets all his armor made and repaired at Smith 's shop . One moose had been killed and another shot at within sight of the house within two years . I do not know whether Smith has yet got a poet to look after the cattle , which , on account of the early breaking up of the ice , are compelled to summer in the woods , but I would suggest this office to such of my acquaintances as love to write verses and go a-gunning . After a dinner , at which apple-sauce was the greatest luxury to me , but our moose-meat was oftenest called for by the lumberers , I walked across the clearing into the forest , southward , returning along the shore . For my dessert , J helped myself to a large slice of the Chesuncook woods , and took a hearty draught of its waters with all my senses . The woods were as fresh and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained many interesting plants ; but unless they are of white pine , they are treated with as little respect here as a mildew , and in the other case they are only the more quickly cut down . The shore was of coarse , flat , slate rocks , often in slabs , with the surf beating on it . The rocks and bleached drift-logs , extending some way into the shaggy woods , showed a rise and fall of six or eight feet , caused partly by the dam at the outlet . They said that in winter the snow was three feet deep on a level here , and sometimes four or five , - that the ice on the lake was two feet thick , clear , and four feet , including the snow-ice . Ice had already formed in vessels . We lodged here this Sunday night in a comfortable bed-room , apparently the best one ; and all that I noticed unusual in the night-for I still kept taking notes , like a spy in the camp-was the creaking of the thin split boards , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude beginnings of a town . They spoke of the practicability of a winter-road to the Moosehead carry , which would not cost much , and would connect them with steam and staging and all the busy world . I almost doubted if the lake would be there ,  --  the self-same lake ,  --  preserve its form and identity , when the shores should be cleared and settled ; as if these lakes and streams which explorers report never awaited the advent of the citizen . The sight of one of these frontier-houses , built of these great logs , whose inhabitants have unflinchingly maintained their ground many summers and winters in the wilderness , reminds me of famous forts , like Ticonderoga , or Crown Point , which have sustained memorable sieges . They are especially winter-quarters , and at this season this one had a partially deserted look , as if the siege were raised a little , the snow-banks being melted from before it , and its garrison accordingly reduced . I think of their daily food as rations ,  --  it is called " supplies " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and a single man seen about the premises is a sentinel on duty . You expect that he will require the countersign , and will perchance take you for Ethan Allen , come to demand the surrender of his fort in the nmne of the Continental Congress . It is a sort of ranger service . Arnold 's expedition is a daily experience with these settlers . They can prove that they were out at almost any time ; and I think that all the first generation of them deserve a pension more than any that went to the Mexican war .
