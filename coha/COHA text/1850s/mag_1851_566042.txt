NEW ENGLANDER . No . XXXIV . MAY , 1851 . ART . 1. - THE LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF ANCIENT GREECE . . d Critical History of the Language and Literature of . /lntient Greece . By WILLIAM MURE of Caidwell . London : Longman &amp; Co. 1850. 3 vols. 8vo . IN looking at the three substantial octavos of which this work consists , and thinking then how scanty are the extant relics of the literature which it describes , the general reader may be pardoned if he feels that there is a want of proportion between text and commentary . The poems of Homer and of Hesiod , with a few thousand lines of epic and lyric fragments-such is all that remains to us from the ante-Pisistratic literature of Greece . Of the imposing edifice we find two noble halls still in tolerable preservation ; a few entire columns more or less defaced : and a multitude of dispersed and mutilated fragments . And some ' will feel , that , however magnificent may have been the original structure , it is scarcely worth while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruins . The wreck , however , is not so complete and hopeless , as might , at first view , be imagined . Many works , which have been lost , are more or less known to us in their general character and contents . In many instances , where Snly the title , the subject of a piece , has been handed down to us , the analogy of surviving pieces enables us to divine the treatment of the author . We must own indeed that much is left in the dark : many puzzling questions present themselves , which we are not able , and in all human probability , never shall be able to answer . Yet on the whole it is not too much to affirm , that we are in condition to obtain , as regards all the main // points , a tolerable conception of this ancient and ill-preserved literature . The scope and compass of its subjects , the modes in which they were handled , the forms and styles that distinguished it , the ideas that informed it , the spirit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical scholar . He has the means of knowledge in his hands it is his own fault , if he does not use them rightly . We do not mean to represent the literary historian of this period as proposing to himself an easy task . His materials lie scattered up and down through the whole range of ancient literature . Many are to be sought in the arid pages of grammarians and scholiasts , on which no man would think of entering , unless prompted by the selfsacrificing spirit of scientific adventure . Much patient diligence is necessary to collect them : and much judicious combination to elicit from them , when collected , the results which they are capable of yielding . Nor is it to be wondered at , if the inquirer , after arriving at his conclusions by this tedious process , should estimate their value by the trouble they have cost him , and reproduce in his report the slow prolixity of his investigation . The literature discussed in this work is one which eminently deserves a full and thorough study . Though exclusively poetical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epic , didactic , and lyrical , it was yet wonderful for its variety and richness . The epic style of Homer is everywhere distinguished for its dramm tic character , and in many parts is little more than a continuous dialogue . The didactic poetry embraced many subjects of religion , morals , social order and the economy of life , which at a later period were regarded as falling more properly within the province of prose composition . As to the lyric poetry of the early time , there is no end to its varieties , of matter and of form . It is elegiac , autobiographical , satirical , sentimental , political , and everything else , according to the mood of the writer and the circumstances that environ him . But apart from its intrinsic interest , this primitive literature has claims on our regard , as . being the starting point and the basis of all Grecian culture . If we wish to understand any phenomenon , we must study it in its beginnings . And this is the more necessary in the literature of Greece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , like a house , built up with materials gathered from different quarters , but shooting up , like a tree , by steady natural growth , on its own soil and from its own roots . Thus it happens , that even works , which we mourn as lost , are not completely lost to us : they have disappeared from the world , yet they have not perished altogether though dead , they did not wholly die : they survive in their results . Something of Archilochus and Sappho yet remains to us in Pindar and Sophocles , in Plato and Aristotle , even in Herodotus and Thucydides and Demosthenes . The earlier author still addresses us through the eloquent lips of his successors : // he acts upon us still through that general Grecian culture , to which he has contributed a substantive portion of elements and influences , and which , in its integral form , is destined to exert an indestructible influence on the thinking of the world . To study his works , whether in the fragments that remain to us , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned restorations of modern scholars , is no more than an act of natural piety on our part : it is tracing our own intellectual genealogy-going back to the authentic ancestors of our own minds . The obscurity , which hangs over the subjects of this work , makes it difficult to treat them with succinctness . History here must often give place to discussion . Instead of concise , perspicuous statements of undoubted truth , we are forced to content ourselves with uncertain estimations of conflicting probabilities . Discussions of this nature , if not drawn out with fullness , are liable to become unintelligible and repulsive to all but the scientific reader . And whatever may be the subject of a work , time is always an essential element of its effect . That which is held up to view for an instant , to be as instantly withdrawn , can take but little hold upon the reader 's interest , and will make no permanent impression on his memory . It is only where an author can assume a previous familiarity with his subject , or expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can safely go to the extreme of brevity . The History of Greek Literature , written by K. 0 . Muller , and published by the Useful Knowledge Society , may be mentioned as an illustration of this remark . Though a most original and valuable work , its conciseness must preclude it from gaining general popularity . Unfortunately too it was never completed . The untimely , though not inappropriate death of its lamented author , in Greece , and in the cause of Greek arch√¶ology , interrupted this with many other plans , which promised fair for the advancement of classical learning . The work now before us , is evidently not addressed exclusively to an audience of scholars . In presenting the results of his long continued and widely extended rese*rches , the author has endeavored to set them forth in a popular form , such as may command the interest and attention of the general reader . If in this attempt he has sometimes failed between two scarcely compatible objects-if he should seem too learned for the general reader , and too popular for the scholar-it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has perhaps surmounted it as well as could have been expected . He has not the brilliant declamation with which Bulwer has illustrated the literature of Athens : nor has he that freshness of thought and honest strength of expression which give a singular charm to the literary chapters of Grote . His style is carefully elaborated , but lacks force and point . The thought does not always fill the words that invest it , and moves tardily and cumbrously // under the burthen of its draperies . The reader may grow weary with the slow progression and the measured uniformity of his author ; and in his impatience may stigmatize him as tedious and long winded . But the most impatient reader will not deny that he is clear , sensible , ingenious , and in general fair-minded . At times , we seem to detect something that looks like special pleading  --  a disposition to press into his service all that can be said in favor of his proposition . Yet on the whole he impresses us strongly as an honest , diligent and successful seeker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thoroughly accomplished scholar , a standard authority on the subject which it treats . The author appears perhaps to least advantage in the higher department of literary criticism ; which , however , does not occupy any very large space in his work . Thus , his comparative estimate of ancient and modern literature is exceedingly superficial and unsatisfactory . He confines himself to two points , the greater variety of modern , the greater originality and formal beauty of ancient literature . So far he is in the main right enough ; but he has left out of view many most characteristic and important points of difference . He says nothing as to the diverse treatment of external nature : nothing as to the greater complexity of form , which distinguishes the literature of modern times : and nothing as to its greater depth of spiritual life and feeling . In point of taste , he prefers Racine to Shakspeare , as being more chaste ; that is , as he explains it , conforming more perfectly to the ideal laws of art . He maintains , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared as incompatible qualities , the one diminishing with the progress of the other . It must not be supposed , however , that he condemns indiscriminately every departure from the ancient models . He draws a just distinction between the principles and the rules of composition-principles of universal truth and application-rules for particular cases which vary with the different data and conditions of each different case . And in this sense he affirms , what in this sense no one would think of denying , that the classic and the romantic are both alike subject to the same principles of beauty . The difficulty would be to determine in each instance whether a given form were to be referred to the class of special rules , or brought under the category of general principles . Mure insists , that the genuine principles of dramatic art , as recognized by the Grecians , and valid for all time , exclude the mixture of the serious and burlesque : and we may presume , though he does not expressly say it , that this is one of the particulars in which Shakspeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not attempted to prove , that the contrast of these elements must always be offensive , and can never subserve the purposes of art . And this he hardly seems to hold : for the same principle must extend , we should suppose , to // epic composition yet he dwells at considerable length and with apparent approbation on the comic element of the Homeric poems . It is not easy to apprehend distinctly the views and principles of criticism developed in the chapter to which we refer , as they present themselves vaguely amid profuse words and indefinite generalities . In the literature of Greece , no less than in its history , the beginnings are mythical . Our author , therefore , very properly commences by setting forth his views , as to the nature , formation and credibility of mythic narrative . In doing this , he takes ground against the extreme skepticism of Grote . This very able writer has given in his first volume the legendary tales of early Greece , in their primitive marvelous form , without endeavoring to interpret them historically , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt he holds to be illusory and futile . He does not deny , that the legends may contain an element of fact he believes that they often do so ; but regards it as impossible to determine from the legend itself , in the absence of other evidence , whether it contains any such element or not . Still more then must it be impossible to distinguish that element , even if admitted as existing , from the fictions , with which it is mixed and blended . The legend supplies no test by which we can analyze it , so as to separate the true from the false , to drive off the poetical admixtures and retain in our crucible a residuum of genuine history . He , therefore , gives the myths only as a curious and important part of the popular mind ; as illustrating the social , political and religious principles of the nation ; and as exercising a very sensible influence on their national development and progress . The myth may be criticised by the light of any authentic documents , belonging to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield historical results , possessing a greater or less degree of probability . But where no such documents are known to exist  --  and this he holds to be the case for the whole period before the first Olympiad in B.C. ThT6*he confesses himself unable to distinguish in the myth its basis of reality , or even to assert with confidence , that it rests on any basis of the kind . Thus in regard to the war of Troy , he tells the old Homeric story , as he finds it , with its gods , heroes , and Helen , its manifold miracles and marvels but when the question comes as to the real war , apart from these incredible adjuncts , he declares that we have no good evidence that there was any , and it is therefore absurd to say anything as known and sure concerning it . So too , in the legendary fictions of the middle ages , he shows that it would be impossible to make a history of Charlemagne or King Arthur from the poems and romances of chivalry , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only authorities , we might reasonably doubt whether any such // persons had ever existed . The mythical on this view is separated by a broad and definite distinction from the historical . The latter designation is confined to that which rests , immediately or ultimately , on documentary evidence , belonging to the time of the events themselves , or following them at no . great distance . Everything appearing in the form of history , but counter-checked by no such evidence , is treated as mythical , unhistorical , useless in historyuseless at least as regards its subjects , and only useful from what it shows concerning its believers . Mure acknowledges the absurdity of attempting to convert legendary story into regular history . Yet at the same time he attributes more of fixity and substance to the myths . Without denying that they are subject to great alterations from an allegorizing spirit , and still more from a propensity to fanciful embellishment , he contends that they never arise out of nothing : that they must always have a foundation in reality : that this vast and various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleus of fact . The great fact in the story of the Trojan war is the combined movement of many Grecian tribes against a Tencrian kingdom in the northwestern part of Asia Minor . And more than this , he sees no reason to doubt , that many of Homer 's heroes , as Agamemnon , Achilles , and others , were really existing men : and that many of the exploits ascribed to them were founded in reality . In support of these views , he urges , that the Homeric poems impress us strongly with a feeling of the real-as also , that they would lose much of their interest and charm for the reader , if he should refer th&amp;m wholly to the sphere of pure invention . These arguments , however , are by no means strong enough to satisfy an objector : they could hardly even confirm a previously established faith . A much stronger argument is founded on the IEolian settlements in Asia Minor , planted before the opening of authentic history , among the very sites and scenes of the Iliad , which presuppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war of Troy , in some form or other . This is a consideration of real weight , resting on a substantial basis of history , and one which the principles of Grote by no means required him to set aside : when we connect it with the natural , prima *facie presumption in favor of an existing story , we feel compelled to consider that writer 's skepticism as in this case overstrained and unreasonable . In regard to the general subject of mythic narrative , though we should agree with Grote in giving up the legend , where we can not in any way confront or compare it with authentic history , yet it by no means follows , in our judgment , that such a comparison , where it is possible , may not yield reliable results , such as neither the history nor the legend by itself could have furnished . Something like this Grote himself appears to admit , in respect to the traditions concerning the Return of the Heraclid*ie , or the Dorian occu // pation of the Peloponnesus : and there is no sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same category . The warmest partisan of myths must allow , that in some cases they are utterly and completely'untrue : that they contain no fact , but falsehood only . Such myths are not fictions which spring up spontaneously from the soil of the popular mind they are intentional , perhaps interested fabrications . When the Greeks , in the sixth century before our era , began to be acquainted with Egypt and its people , the Egyptian literati were not content with impressing on their new visitors the high antiquity of their own civilization : they sought also to show that the elements of Greek civilization were borrowed directly from their country . With this view , they contrived to give an Egyptian turn to many of the old popular fables of Greece ; for instance , those of the Trojan war : and at the same time added others flattering to their national vanity , which were drawn entirely from the stores of their own invention . The Greeks were not disposed to be very critical or skeptical about these stories . Egypt to them was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own beginnings with that most ancient country , seemed probable in themselves , and not dishonorable to the younger land : they were received accordingly with ready faith . Modern scholars are not so easily convinced* Even Mure denies all authority to the legends , which tell of Egyptian colonies planted in Athens and Argos , and bringing with them the elements of civil and social life , which were before unknown to the primitive inhabitants . The manners and customs and religion of Greece are so wholly different from those of Egypt , as to show that they could never have been subjected to any powerful or permanent Egyptian influence . The Greek language shows no trace of Coptic elements , except in the names of a few objects or ideas borrowed from the East . Besides , the people of the Nile were never a sea-faring people , nor ever disposed to enter upon maritime enterprise or adventure . r* he utmost , which our author will allow , is the possibility , that , on the expulsion of the so-called shepherd-princes from Egypt , a few individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuge , probably in Phcenician vessels , to the coasts of Greece . The stories of Phcenician settlement and influence , on the contrary , are regarded by our author , as possessing a good degree of historic probability . The Phcenicians were a maritime people from a very early period : their commerce extended to all the shores of the IVlediterranean , and led to the establishment of posts or colonies for trade in many places . It was natural , that they should come into contact and intercourse with the Greeks : and that they actually did so , is attested by one great fact , the existence of the Greek alphabet , which is shown to be Phcenician , not only by the legends about Cadmus , but more certainly by the Phoenician forms of its // characters , and by the purely Phoenician names , which they never ceased to bear . The Phoenicians , however , though they introduced letters into Greece , do not appear to have been at any time a literary people . There is no reason to suppose , that they exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , the independent originality of Greek literature . If this were modified by any considerable infusion of foreign , n elements , they must have come from Thrace . For it is a remarkable circumstance , that Orpheus , Musinus , Thamyris and others , the principal bards of the legendary time , are in the legends designated as Thracians . There is n* reason , however , for believing , that the country , generally known as Thrace , was ever occupied by a Greek population : still less is there reason to suppose , that the barbarian tribes , which the first light of history shows us in possession of that country , were the descendants of ancestors , who enjoyed a higher culture . We find , too , that when the legends mention any particular places in connection with these so-called Thracians , they are places belonging either to Pieria on the Macedonian sea-coast , or to the mountain region about Helicon and Parnassus in Central Greece . Muller , therefore , has pronounced these Thracians to be a Hellenic people , originally settled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some unknown period , left their native seats and emigrated to Pieria . Mure adopts the same theory , at least so far as regards the primitive home of this people : he seems to think that the legends do not require us to give them a Pierian location . As we follow the course of dim tradition , we pass through a long series of legendary bards-shadowy figures , uncertainly discerned in the twilight of remote antiquity-until , after journeying we know not how far , and reaching we know not what point , we emerge at last into a blaze of light . We have before us two unrivaled monuments of early epic art , the Iliad and the Odyssey . The very form and pressure of the heroic age appear revealed to us in these magnificent compositions . But when we inquire concerning their author , we find ourselves again in the dark . The poems are known and clear , as those of Virgil , or Dante , or Milton : but the author is scarcely less obscure than Amphion or Orpheus . We have indeed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the fabric of his biography dissolves before the lightest breath of historical criticism ; and it is evident , that Herodotus and Pindar had little , if any , information concerning the poet of the Iliad , which was fitted to command the assent of the historical inquirer . Homer , in fact , was little more than a common designation for the authors of the early Epos . The voice of tradition ascribed to him not only the poems , which we call Homeric , but many others , which were extant down to a late period of Grecian history , though now unfortunately // lost . Intelligent critics , it is true , dissented from the popular belief : they saw the superiority of the Iliad and the Odyssey , and set them apart as the only genuine productions of Homer . But they did so , not on external grounds of history , but on the internal evidence of character and style ; and for us also this must be the principal reliance in the various questions relating to the authorship of the Homeric poems . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general skepticism . The fact , that a proposition had received unquestioning assent for ages , was then regarded as in some sort proof presumptive against its truth . Tradition no longer fortified the doctrine which it inclosed : it was a ruined wall that only encouraged and provoked attack . Nor was it alone the reverence for authority that suffered : the feeling of unity , at the same time and from the action of the same causes , became impaired and indistinct . The discord , which rent the political and moral world , extended to literature , and even here nothing could be perceived but discords . The highest artistic unity was unobserved or went for nothing , while a discrepancy in the merest matters of detail was carefully rioted and exalted into paramount importance . Hence a general disposition to challenge the authenticity or unity of ancient works , where they were not shielded by the most formidable array of external testimonies . All are familiar with the results of this tendency in Biblical criticism . Its influence was less conspicuous perhaps , yet no less real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Homeric poems should not run the gauntlet through such a time without suffering keen attack . The traditional belief concerning Homer had been impugned by Bentley at the commencement of the last century , and soon afterwards by Giambattista Vico , the ingenious and eccentric philosopher of Naples . It was Wolf , however , who first directed the batteries of skepticism effectively against the old established doctrine . In his famous Prolegomena  --  a work distinguished for its elegance of style not less than its originality and erudition-he boldly denies the existence of a personal Homer . He commences with a large number of epic lays , the work of many different bards , and relating to a great variety of subjects , among which , however , the war of Troy , and the mythical events connected with it , furnished the favorite themes . These lays are handed down , generally in an unwritten form , for several ages : during this time they are constantly rehearsed by professional reciters , rhapsodists , who wandered from place to place in the exercise of their vocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chiefs and at the festivals of the gods . Thus composed and transmitted , through many changes , additions and diminutions , they reach at length the middle of the sixth century . At this juncture , they fall into the hands of certain literary artisans , acting under the orders // of the great Athenian tyrant Pisistratus , who conceive the happy idea of constructing long continuous poems out of the raw material which they supply . Accordingly they select from the great mass at their disposal , the pieces which relate to the Wrath of Achilles , and the Return of Ulysses from Troy to Ithaca , and combining them ingeniously together , with the necessary insertions , alterations and retrenchments , they produce at last the Iliad and the Odyssey , such as we now have them . This theory appears in our rough outline somewhat more positive and definite than should be . Its author evidently felt himself strongest on the negative side , and to that directed his chief attention . He could criticise the popular view , and oppose it with many doubts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to setting forth the real facts in the case , and explaining the actual genesis of the poems , his language was often vague and ambiguous . Yet in this respect he only fell in with the temper of a time more intent on pulling down than building up . His theory , therefore , was received with general acceptance , and for some time was in substance the prevailing doctrine of the German scholars . Its advocates agreed in denying the primitive unity of the poems  --  and they agreed in little else . The original elements of which they were composed ; the amount of change and interpolation to which they were subjected by the redactors : the relation in which they stood to the other epic poems of the early time : on these and many other points the varieties of opinion could hardly be enumerated . We find the same discrepancy in the field of Biblical criticism . Many scholars have agreed in rejecting the Mosaic origin of the Pentateuch , and in asserting its fragmentary character : but in regard to the fragments , their number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any two can be found agreeing with each other . In the case of the Bible , all know that there has been a great reaction from the skepticism of the last century . The current of opinion has come to set in the opposite direction . The general mind of scholars gravitates again towards the old established doctrine . We are not to conclude , however , that all this skepticism and criticism , these long processes of questioning , challenging , searching , have been entirely in vain . For though the older formulas are restored , they are placed upon more solid grounds , and propped by firmer buttresses , than heretofore . If then we appear to have come round to the point from which we started , it is in appearance only , not in reality : we have actually made a most important advance . We do not now simply believe : we believe rationally , intelligently-not from want of contradiction , but from preponderant weight of evidence . The reaction is equally evident in the Homeric question . Our author is himself an instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his studies , he was , like most young scholars , a zealous disciple of // the Wolfian school ; but by twenty years ' study of its doctrines has become thoroughly convinced of their fallacy . It is perhaps the natural effect of such a change , that he should pass from one extreme to the other , and assert the views , which he has now embraced , in a somewhat cramped and inflexible form . And yet , as regards his principal conclusions-that the Iliad and the Odyssey are each the workofasingleauthor , andbothprobablyof the sameauthor , and that they are not largely interpolated nor otherwise essentially changed from their primitive form-we have no doubt , that these propositions express what is now the prevailing opinion of the best scholars , and likely to become in the end all but universal . The theory of Wolf himself , as we have just described it , is clearly untenable . It is demonstrably absurd to suppose , that there should not have been an Iliad and an Odyssey existing in their substantial integrity auring the seventh and eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any scholar of respectable standing should ever have been found to question it . The works of the Epic cycle are decisive on that point . This name is given to a series of epic poems , composed by various authors , from 776 to 550 B.C. , on legendary subjects more or less closely connected with the war of Troy . They are all now lost , with the exception of the scantiest fragments . We have , however , a tolerable synopsis of their plan and contents , made out while they were yet extant . And from this it is evident , that they avoided the themes of the Iliad and the Odyssey that they aimed to supplement the action of those poems that they rested upon them , in such a way , as to imply not only their previous existence , but their general notoriety and recognized preeminence . Here then we find sure traces of these poems long before the age of Pisistratus , at a time when the Wolfian theory represents them as unconnected lays , undistinguished from a multitude of others , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this age of Pisistratus , if too late for the indications of the Cyclic poems , is much too early for that book-making process , which the theory of Wolf attributes to it . Such feats of literary jobwork belong to a later period . We can not imagine them in the middle of the sixth century , in the fresh spring-time of Grecian literature , when it was putting forth the most splendid original productions , with a fertility that seemed to be inexhaustible . As to the agency of Pisistratus , Mure does not go to the length of denying it altogether . But he puts a new face upon the matter , by assuming , with great appearance of probability , that this Athenian redaction was not confined to our Homer , the author of the Iliad and Odyssey , but extended to Homer , in the wider sense of the name , the common father of the early Epos . He conjectures that this may have been the origin of the Epic cycle : that the poems composing it were then for the first time brought together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of their legendary chronology . It is not sufficient , however , to prove that the Iliad and the Odyssey existed in an integral form as early as the first Olympiad . We only put farther back the question of their original unity . For it is still supposable , though certainly not very probable , that they may have been produced in that early time , by an artificial combination of distinct and isolated pieces . In the absence of positive historical testimony , the question must depend on the internal evidence , the indications of the poems themselves . It would be absurd to imagine , that a patch-work process of composition could result in a well ordered proportion of the parts , and an ideal symmetry of the whole . One might as well expect to make beautiful statues by piecing together the isolated heads , limbs and torsos of the Elgin collection . rrhe separate parts of such a work could not fail to appear in their separate intention and character . Now , there are not wanting critics , who profess to distinguish in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poeta ? . Thus Lachmann , after having dissected the 2200 lines of the Iliad , between the beginning of the eleventh book and the 590th line of the fifteenth , into four distinct songs , declares , that , if any man thinks their difference of spirit inconsiderable , or fails to feel it at once when pointed out , " he will do well not to trouble himself any more either with my criticisms , or with epic poetry , because he is too weak to understand anything about it . " If these critics agreed with each other , making the same separations and the same connections , we should pay more regard to their authority for we might then believe , that their judgments , though to us apparently groundless , were founded on some real objective test . But when we find , that each of them has a scheme of his own , and that each regards the arrangements of his predecessors as little less absurd than the old unitarian belief , we begin to doubt the validity of their criteria : and we claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially as ours connects us with that great body of readers , who have in all times recognized the one personal Homer . We would not be understood as resting the unity of these poems on purely subjective grounds : we think it a truth susceptible of demonstration . The contents of each may be presented in such a form , as to show its leading aim , and to show that this aim was kept in view throughout-that the parts were arranged and composed with reference to the whole . This is strongly urged by Grote in regard to the Odyssey , to which he justly attributes a more conspicuous and striking coherence , than is to be found in the Iliad . He accepts , therefore , without hesitation , the original unity of the former poem : as to the latter , he receives it with considerable reservations though these are far from sufficient to justify Mure in classing him // among the supporters of the Wolfian theory . He regards the Iliad as made by the enlargement of a primitive Achilleid . This poem , he supposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was of simple structure , being occupied wholly with the anger of Achilles and its consequences . The books from the second to the seventh , the ninth , the tenth , the twenty-third , and twentyfourth , he looks upon as the addition of later hands ,  --  not independently composed , as in the hypothesis of Wolf  --  but constructed for incorporation into a previously existing poem . This theory of the Iliad he defends with great ingenuity ; but he can not guard it against the fatal improbability , that the original Homer should have been followed close by poets of equal genius , who , however , instead of composing independent works , were content with interpolating the work of their predecessor . Mure has taken great pains to develop the unity of plan in the Iliad and Odyssey , both by elaborate analyses of the text , and by particular criticism of the parts , which have sometimes been regarded as excrescences upon the action . Our author does not deny the discordances and contradictions , which have been relied upon in arguing the fragmentary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are numerous and irreconcilable . He goes farther even than his opponents , and shows that they exist side by side in the same current of narrative or description . But he denies , that they can fairly be regarded as proving diversity of authorship . The best poets , writing under the most favorable circumstances , are not infallible they are subject to forgetfulness and error they are liable to contradict themselves , to cross their own track , and incur the censure of a lynx-eyed critic intent on absolute consistency . If self-contradiction were incompatible with unity of authorship , hardly any great work could prove its claim to be the production of a single author . Mure has taken the pains to examine a number of works , by the most celebrated writers-such as Virgil , Milton , Cervantes and Walter Scott  --  and has collected out of them a curious anthology of contradictions . Those of the iEneid will surprise the reader , who considers the amount of patient thought and toil expended on that work by a poet who has the reputation of being eminently " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " its self-contradictions equal , or probably exceed in number those of the Iliad , Odyssey and IEneid united . Of the seventy chapters comprised in the second part of the work , there are few but contain statements totally irreconcilable with others occurring in previous or subsequent portions of the narrative . " These writers all enjoyed facilities for correct consistent composition , which were denied to Homer . The manuscript or printed sheets lay continually beside them , to supply the deficiencies and rectify the slips of memory . But the Grecian poet , though he may not have been unable to reduce his work to writing , had certainly much less command of that re // source , and was so much the more subject to the accidents , against which it is a safeguard . It is still more important to remember , that whether his work were written or not , it was intended for hearers and not for readers . An uncultivated audience , charmed by the musical enunciation of the rhapsodist , and inspired by the epic glories of his song , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare part with part , so as to expose and censure every appearance of contradiction . The dread of minute criticism , which now-a-days is always present for good or for evil to the mind of the author , was unknown to the poet of that early time . We can not suppose then , that an individual Homer would guard himself very carefully on this side-that he would trouble himself much about securing absolute consistency and probability of narrative . His objects were poetical and not historical . He would care little for a contradiction that was not striking and offensive to a circle of enthusiastic hearers-especially , if it enabled him to secure some interesting dramatic effect , or some beauty of poetical description . Mure has shown that serious discrepancies are to be found woven into the same texture of discourse , where the very extremity of subdividing criticism can not assume a difference of authors . These inconsistencies , which could not be made available in support of the Wolfian hypothesis , have been generally overlooked by its partisans . Yet they demonstrate principles and habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument founded on the more remote discordances . It is interesting to observe in some cases a sort of conventional probability , according to which people are allowed to see and know only so much of what takes place in their presence , as may happen to be convenient for the purposes of the poet  --  a convention , which Mure compares to the asides of the modern theater. rrhe skillful and consistent delineation of human character has always been recognized as one of the crowning excellencies of the Iliad and Odyssey . Pervading , as it does , both poems , with the same peculiarities of thought and handling , and the same conception of individual persons , it furnishes a very strong argument for unity of authorship . Mure has dwelt upon it at great length , and his minute researches bring out much that is novel and interesting . We take an instance from the character of Agamemnon . This " king of men , " with all his splendid qualities , is represented as one who yields blindly to his own ungoverned passions , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crime . For this character the poet has an appropriate word-Ate . It denotes sometimes the state of a mind thus befooled and led astray by passion and presumption ; and sometimes the divinity to whose malign influence that state of mind was attributed . Now it is remarkable that " out of about thirty occasions in which the term occurs in the Iliad , it // has been used no less than twenty-four with especial reference to Agamemnon 's conduct , while of the remaining examples it has been but rarely and quite incidentally connected with the name of any other person or object . " This is owing , no doubt , in part to the fact that the wrath of Achilles , the great subject of the poem , is provoked by an act of unreasonable violence , to which Agamemuon is instigated by the influence of Ate . It is natural that the deed should be often referred to , and as often described in somewhat similar terms . In the character of iDiomed we find heroic fortitude and promptitude , united with equal modesty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conjuncture which arises repeatedly during the inaction of Achilles . The council of chiefs is thrown into extreme perplexity by a disastrous turn of affairs : the most experienced counselors are at a loss what to propose . Diomed waits until it is plain that no one else will speak . He then comes forward , and in few words urges some energetic action , which receives at once the unanimous applause and approbation of the assembly . This situation recurs not less than four times , and is described every time in nearly the same words . It is hazardous to attribute these consistencies in the representation of character to a common stock of epic tradition . We know that some of the chiefs , as Diomed and Menelaus , were represented in a very different and far less flattering way by authors of the Epic cycle . Still more was this the case with Uiysses , in whom " die valiant soldier was transformed into the skulking poltroon , the sagacious politician into the plotting traitor , the man of honor into the low-minded villain . " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cyclic poems , is this , that many things are now ascribed to a common epic genius , which would appear , if we had those works , as the exclusive property of Homer . As it is , they lessen the glory of their predecessor by sharing it . Could we see them , they would probably heighten his splendor by the contrast of their own darkness . In the compositions of a single author we look for unity of style . Yet the demand may be pressed too far . The productions of the same mind will vary with times , circumstances , moods , subjects , and inspiration . He who dashes on at one time in the full tide of thought , pouring out his resources with lavish profusion , will be seen at another urging on a flagging spirit to the treatment of an uncongenial theme . Absolute equality of excellence is not to be required in any writer : least of all , perhaps , in one of preeminent genius . The ancient critics and grammarians stigmatized many passages as spurious , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence may have been just in some cases : but the ground on which it rested is entitled to little confidence . The // truer principle appears in the Horatian " quandoque bonus dormitat * Much that is uniform and pervading in the style of these poems is attributed often to the common genius and the current forms of early epic poetry  --  to what Mure calls epic commonplace . To this head we may refer numerous formulas of constant recurrence , such as those which introduce the words of a speaker , or those which describe the hurling of the spear and the falling of the slain . Yet in regard to these we can easily believe with Mure that many of the most striking and felicitous owe their origin or their peculiar form to the inventive genius of the single Homer . On this point the Cyclic poems , if we had them , would perhaps give us little satisfactory information : for of things common to all , we should still be in doubt , how many were borrowed by the Cyclic poets directly from Homer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of epic tradition . However this may be , it is certain that there are peculiarities of treatment and expression , which from their nature can never have been common to a whole class of poets . This is true of that dramatic management , already referred to , by which the description of the author is as far as possible superseded by the language of his persons . We see this not only in the dialogue which abounds throughout the poems , but in other cases also , where we should less expect to find it . The feeling of a multitude is expressed in the language of its leader : or in words supposed to be addressed by each or any individual to his nearest companion . The succession of thought in a single mind is represented , as on the stage , by a soliloquy or monologue : which sometimes appears under the form of a debate in the mind itself ; and sometimes even as an address of the actor to his own mind . Something of this might be attributed to the vivacity of an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not thus account for the whole phenomenon . Aristotle could not have noticed this as a peculiar excellence of Homer if he had found it equally in other epic authors . It is a striking and distinctive feature of the individual poet . The argument drawn by the author from the identity of moral feeling and opinion throughout the poems , is not without its weight . But the so-called comic element is more doubtful . Mure regards this as a discovery of his own , and thinks that critics have fallen into serious difficulties from overlooking it . We can not help feeling , however , that his conception of the subject is more original than satisfactory . He seems to have mistaken a lively simplicity and na*vet* for intentional comicality . It is certain that Homer describes every kind of life with great minuteness and exactness . He gives us a daguerreotype of the heroic period , in which all its varied scenes are successively brought before our view . Like the sun , he // 177 portrays each scene as it comes , whether mean or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidelity . It is clear too , that he has a ready sympathy with the scenes which he represents ; that he treats some with deep tragic pathos , others with a careless and light-hearted humor . All this , we can readily allow . But we can not so easily admit that he has introduced long passages , whole books even , for the sale of burlesque effect . Still less can we concede , that the poet designedly parodies his own heroics , balances his own tragedy with a farce at the conclusion . But most improbable of all is it , that he should appear as a sort of Archilochus-Ho mer , wielding the lash of the professed satirist . For so our author regards him in the episode of the Ph*eacians in the Odyssey ,  --  a piece designed , as he supposes , to ridicule the luxurious habits and the boastful vanity of some people , Jonian or Phoenician , with which the poet was familiarly acquainted . As to the puns , which Mure refers to , as evidencing the spirit of comedy , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as occur not seldom in the tragic passages of Shakspeare-such as are found even in many parts of the Hebrew Scriptures . The only instance , in which anything like comedy could be imagined , is in the trick practiced by Ulysses upon Polyphemus , when he gives his name as Outis or No-man . But here the comedy , if such it be , is of the serious kind . The device is in the poet 's view perfectly natural for the man of many arts under such circumstances nor is there any hint that he regards it as derogating in the least from the dignity of the heroic character . Mure discovers an intentional drollery in the question , which recurs several times in the Odyssey , addressed to a stranger recently arrived in the island of Ithaca- " What ship brought you ? for I think you came not here by land . " The expression strikes us certainly as quaint and strange : but it is used to honored guests without anything jocular before or after it . If regarded as burlesque it must appear misplaced or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly addressed to travelers , whether " they are journeying on business , or wandering without definite aim , as buccaneers , over the sea , that rove about and risk their lives , in bringing harm to men of other lands . " If such freebooting expeditions were not looked upon as dishonorable , there is no occasion for imagining a jest : if they were held as dishonorable , the jest would have been an insult in any state of society . And why should we suppose anything , ludicrous in asking a man , whether he was engaged in that which Ulysses is represented as having practiced-which he avows his intention of practicing again ? The detailed and familiar descriptions . of Alcinous and his court are given as examples of the burlesque .. But what shall we say then as to the particulars of Homeric , cookery in the Iliad ? Mure himself recognizes the pleasure , which . VOL. ix . 12 // the Homeric man ( to use an expression of Grote 's ) must have taken in the metrical description of familiar objects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this was so with the trivial , why not so with that which borders close upon it , and can not always be distinguished from it , the ridiculous ? There are many critics , such as Payne Knight , Nitzsch , and Grote , who hold to the substantial unity of the Iliad and the Odyssey , but refer the two to different authors . This view has no ground of external evidence in its favor ; yet neither has it any decidedly against it . The early tradition of antiquity ascribed not only these poems , but many others , to Homer : if these two have been distinguished from the rest , it has been solely on grounds of internal evidence : and on such grounds we could with equal right separate one of these two from the other . Yet with Mure , we should attach considerable weight to the nearly unanimous opinion of the ancient critics in favor of a common authorship . They showed their independence by denying the Homeric origin of the Thebais , the Epigoni and several other works . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odyssey , as regards style , or genius , or manners , no deference to current tradition would have prevented them from giving it full weight . We do not know , what were the arguments relied upon by the few Separatists of ancient times . The modern advocates of this doctrine have not generally denied the equality of poetic merit in the two poems , but have pointed out many supposed diversities in language , in customs and in ideas . They have commonly assumed the Odyssey as the later work , and have sought to show that it represents a more advanced culture , and a more perfectly organized condition of society . It can not be denied that there are noticeable differences in tone and contents between the two poems : this results of necessity from the difference of subject . But there seems to be no marked or important diversity , which is not fairly referrible to this cause . The mythic story , so far as it appears in both poems , is in both the same . And Mure has shown the value of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Epic cycle , or what little we have of them , and pointing out the variations and discrepancies of fable which they present . For the manifold coincidence and resemblance of the two poems , the Separatist theory has no explanation , except either in epic commonplace , which is not sufficient to account for the phenomena  --  or in a designed imitation of the earlier bard by the later , which is contradicted by the general ease , freedom and spirit of the Odyssey . Perhaps after all the strongest reason with the supporters of this doctrine has been the difficulty of supposing , that any one man could have produced two works of such magnitude , and such variety of subject and of style : and especially that this should have occurred in the infancy of literature , and at a time // when the art of writing , if not unknown to the Greeks , was probably a rare and difficult process . This is almost the only reason urged by Grote , who indeed does not express himself very confidently upon the question . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see that it is materially lessened by the Separatist view . It is strange that one man should have been able to produce the Iliad and Odyssey : hut it is scarcely less strange that one man should have been found who was able to produce the Iliad . The genius , which was sufficient for one , was not inadequate for both . The faculty of memory or the resources of writing , which were requisite to originate and perpetuate the Iliad with its sixteen thousand lines , would need no great extension to take in the Iliad and Odyssey with their twenty-seven thousand . There is great weight also in a consideration urged by Mure on the opposite side  --  the improbability that two poets of such transcendent genius should have flourished at the same or nearly the same time . This is the more striking , when we consider that these two poets must have been not only equal in genius , but remarkably alike in style and treatment . Minds of the highest order , equally distinguished for depth and originality , could hardly fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyclic poets are numerous and extend over a period of two centuries : yet of their voluminous and elaborate productions , not one , if we may trust to the best judgment of antiquity , was worthy to be placed in the same rank with the Iliad and the Odyssey . Two first-rate geniuses is the same age and country would be scarcely less miraculous than two suns in the same heavens . Nature is not so prodigal of her* noblest gifts . She reserves them for High souls , like those far stars that come to sight Once in a century . Recognizing thus a personal Homer , the single author of these two great epics , we naturally inquire concerning his personal history . The traditional accounts of antiquity are obviously legendary : it does not , however , follow , that no conclusions of probable truth can be extracted from them . What is most remarkable about them , is , that in all the earlier and purer forms they connect the poet with the *Eolian race in Asia Minor . Cyme and Smyrna , the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the honor of his origin . Mure thinks it impossible to determine his native place any further than as belonging to IEolia . Mdller decides confidently in favor of Smyrna . He follows the lonian story , according to which that city was founded by Jonian colonists from Ephesus , who were joined soon after by a body of IEoiians from Cyme . The two races dwelt side by side for some // time , until the ZEolians becoming predominant expelled their lonian fellow-citizens , and forced them to take refuge in Colophon . At a later period , as is well known , the city was wrested from the ZEolians by a Colophonian invasion , and continued ever after in possession of the lonians . Now the theory of Mfiller refers Homer to the earlier time when the two races were united in the walls of Smyrna : the poet belonged to one of the Jonian families , which were subsequently driven out to Colophon : he may himself have been among the refugees . This hypothesis is recommended by its author , as accounting remarkably well for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks , a mixture of elements belonging to the two races . Their subjects are ZEolian : for these colonies inherited the mythic glories of the Pelopid*e , their legendary founders , and especial1y the tales of the Trojan war , which had its scene in their country , and was probably connected in some way with their own primitive establishment in Asia . The style and language of the poems , on the other hand , he refers to the Jonians , and he supposes that the poet identifies himself with that people by the preferences and partialities , which here and there make their appearance . These indications , however , will hardly stand the test of a thorough examination , and are more than balanced by others of an opposite character . It is certain , that , in spite of the primitive form of the legend , the opinion gained currency in ancient times , and in modern times has been almost universal , that Homer was an Jonian . Hence the phrases , " Jonian poet , " " bard of Chios , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly against these formulas , and vindicates for the IEolian race the Homer whom they had nearly lost . He takes his stand upon the legend in its oldest form , which is the less to be suspected in this particular case , as it comes to us through Jonians : they have engrafted much upon it , which was intended to procure honor for themselves ; but they have not obliterated its primitive features , or ' nullified the testimony which they give . The local knowledge of the poet confirms his Eolian origin . The lonian places in Asia Minor are scarcely mentioned while those of IEolia are enumerated with great minuteness . The ZEolian predilections of the poet are seen in other ways . In the Catalogue of the Ships , which Mure defends as Homeric , he begins with Boeotia , the recognized head of the IEolian race . " The protagonist of each poem is an . ZEolian , as are four of the seven chiefs of first rank before Troy , Achilles , Ulysses , Nestor , IDiomed . " The lonians , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menestheus the Athenian receiving only the cold praise of a " good drill . " Yet it would have been easy for the poet , bad he so chosen , to honor the lonians by persons and achievements of his own invention . He might at least have introduced a multitude of // honorary allusions to that people , their cities , chieftains and eponymous heroes . But nothing of the kind is to be found in him . The interest which he expresses in the fate of the Trojan Jneas is accounted for by the fact that a race of kings , deriving their origin from that prince , reigned in a part of IEolia . Mure finds another argument to the same point , in the indifference manifested by the poet in regard to the Dorian migration , and the changes which it wrought in Greece and elsewhere . this great event receives at the utmost only a passing allusion . The iEolian colonies are represented in the tradition as settled in Asia before the occurrence of this revolution . It would therefore be less likely to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose emigration to Asia was one among its many most important consequences . As to the language of Homer , Mure denies that it was founded in any manner on the Jonian , as spoken in Asia Minor in the poet 's own time . He regards it as an earlier form of the Jonian , the current language in the courts of the Acha*an princes , before the Donan invasion . It was employed of course by the bards attached to those courts , and thus became the established idiom of poetry . As such , it was used by bards of other races , . ZEolians and Dorians no less than Jonians . There are certainly some striking advantages about this theory . It accounts well for the general currency of the Homeric dialect in all epic composition . It gives ample time for the disappearance of the archaic forms , so numerous in Homer . The difficulty is that it fails t account for the peculiar affinity , which with all differences subsists between the Homeric Greek and the later Ionic . The tyro must feel , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Xenophon to the idiom of the Iliad and the Odyssey . On the theory of Mure , however , the dialects of Attica and of Jonia , being both alike descended from that primitive Jonian , which we have in the Homeric poems , should both resemble it equally  --  or rather the Attic should present much the closest resemblance . For the Jonians were in constant intercourse with other tribes of Greeks and with the barbarian nations of the interior : they had a much more rapid progress in commerce , art , and every species of culture : they were subjected in far greater degree to all the causes which tend to change a people 's language . The Athenians , on the contrary , lived by themselves , shut up in their own limits , and with little influence from without . They ought therefore to have preserved the original common language in greater purity than their Asiatic colonies : and if this common language were the Homeric , as Mure supposes , then among all the later dialects , the Attic is the one , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conclusion , which no Greek scholar could for a moment entertain . If the legends represent Homer as by birth an iEolian , they connect // him equally in his later life and his death with the Jonians . This connection is understood by our author , as having its substantial truth , not in the history of the personal Homer , but in the fortunes of his works . They were treated with neglect by his own countrymen : but the Jonians adopted them and became the principal agents in their preservation and extension . It is hard to comprehend , how the A*olians , after having produced a Homer , should have fallen thus into the background , and surrendered the great monument of their renown to a rival race . We might perhaps relieve the difficulty by supposing , that Homer , though a native LEolian , was in his poetic culture connected with and dependent upon a more genial and cultivated people . As regards the time , when the poems were composed , the date of the personal Homer , our author expresses no definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus : but he seems inclined , if we may judge from his very guarded expressions , to put him not far below that era . No confidence can be placed in the guesses of the ancient writers . The poems are of course more recent than the Trojan war , which they celebrate . That a long interval of time must have elapsed , may be inferred from the terms in which the poet speaks of his heroes . They are widely different from his contemporaries : gifted with an incomparably greater measure of heroic strength and prowess . They hold immediate and scarcely unequal intercourse with the gods . No people , however prompt in mythical exaggeration , would speak thus of their grandfathers . On the other hand , these poems must have preceded the first Olympiad-for they are earlier than the earlie*t of the Epic cycle , and enough earlier to have gained already a universal recognition of their superiority . For the rest , we must depend upon the state of manners and society represented in the poems : and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they describe . At the outset of the historical period , republicanism is nearly universal in the states of Greece . Monarchy survives only in Sparta , and there subject to great restrictions , the shadow of its former self . In Homer , republicanism is unknown : everywhere we have the king , the supreme military chief and civil ruler of his people , deriving his power from Zeus , and accountable to no man for his use of it . He hears the advice of his council of elders : he is influenced by the public opinion of the people assembled in the agora : but these affect him only by their moral power : he is himself the absolute sovereign . We can not well suppose , that Homer described a past state of society , known to him only by report , designedly excluding the ideas of his own time or country , as inconsistent with historic truth . Such a method belongs rather to a reflective and critical age , an age of historians and antiquaries . It is less improbable , that a particu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bards of the earliest time , when it was actually the established one , should go down by imitation to their successors , and thus retain its place in poetry , after it has disappeared from real life . With every such allowance , however , we are compelled to believe that the Homeric poems were composed before the great early revolution , which transformed the states of Greece from monarchies to republics-if not before it commenced , yet before it had become general and predominant . With such data we can not place Homer lower than the year 850 , and may perhaps carry him a century further back . The questions relating to the authorship of the Homeric poems have been generally connected with this other question , whether they were originally reduced to writing . The inquiries are , no doubt , closely related : yet it has been too often assumed , that a decision in one case must be decisive also for the other . Thus Wolf , having proved , as he thought , that the poems could not have existed in writing before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been composed as integers , or have existed in their collective form at any earlier time . The opponents of Wolf have frequently admitted the correctness of the inference , and regarded it as necessary to rest their cause on disproving the premises . At present , however , it seems to be the prevailing opinion that the premises of this argument do not justify the inference derived from them . It is the belief of Muller , for instance , that the Iliad and the Odyssey are the productions of a single author , but unwritten at the outset , and perpetuated in the same unwritten form for several generations . We can not absolutely deny the possibility of this , though it is hardly made out by satisfactory analogies . It is said to have been not uncommon to find in Athens a man who could repeat the Iliad and Odyssey from beginning to end . But we should consider , how much easier it is to learn a long work from the written copy , than from the oral enunciation of another person . An eminent tragic actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his memory , and ready at a moment 's notice : but the parallel must be taken with the same allowance as before . Much is said of the capacious and well-stored memories of Celtic bards , and modern Greek minstrels , and Persian tale-tellers . Yet we feel , that after all they fall far short of the achievement , which we are required to believe in regard to the Homeric poems . It is not without reason , therefore , that Mure exerts himself to show that the poems were originally written . His chapter on the age of alphabetic writing is particularly interesting and valuable . If it fails to make out in a manner perfectly satisfactory the main point of a written Homer , it proves certainly that writing was in common use at a much earlier date than Wolf assumed . There is overwhelming evidence , that it was frequent and familiar long before the time of Solon . It is admitted // indeed on all hands , that letters were known and used in Greece as early at least as the era of the Olympiads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period the art was applied only to monumental inscriptions , or to brief and scanty records : that there was nothing like the writing of a long continuous composition . This has been inferred from the want ( rather assumed than proved ) of a suitable material for writing : and from the rude and clumsy forms of the letters on the earliest monuments . But there are examples enough to show , that a people may write imperfectly on brass or stone , while yet they write easily and even elegantly on some more tractable material . It is perfectly certain , that the numerous productions of epic , elegiac and lyric poetry , composed in the eighth and seventh centuries before our era , must have been written as they were composed : to imagine them perpetuated by memory alone would be transcending the bounds of the most extended possibility . And if alphabetic writing was common in the year 750 , it may have been practiced a century or two earlier . Most of the arguments against giving it an earlier date than that , would equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this earlier time we have nothing from history but vague presumptions : and we naturally inquire , whether nothing to the point can be extracted from Homer himself . Here , however , we find ourselves drawn two ways . The very existence of these poems , with nearly thirty thousand lines , appears to furnish the strongest evidence of an art , which seems at first view indispensable to their creation and preservation . And yet the absence of any allusion to such an art , among their innumerable and multifarious descriptions , is a strong circumstance upon the other side . Mure claims , indeed , that such allusions are not wanting . But he maintains , that if they were , the silence of Homer would not be decisive . He instances several objects and processes , which must have been familiar in the Homeric age , yet are not distinctly referred to in the Iliad and Odyssey . Without denying all weight to these parallels , we must still hold that the omission of explicit reference to a well known art of writing is a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Homer has omitted such explicit reference . He finds an allusion to the art of writing in the expression , so often used of events which remain yet uncertain in the future , that " they lie on the knees of the gods. ** This he understands as signifying , that such events are inscribed in tablets , which rest , after the fashion of Greek penmanship , on the knees of the divinities who write in them . But this only increases the difficulty . For the expression is clearly proverbial , and if it is to be interpreted in this way , would show that the art of writing , not only in the general idea , but even in its particular methods , was familiar to the popular mind . It is all the more surprising then , that we do not have more frequent and unambiguous allusions . The idea // of destiny occurs on every page . If in this one phrase it is associated with writing , why do we not find the same association in other expressions and connections ? Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of a book at all ? Why is no bard represented as writing his poems ? why no soothsayer as writing his prophecies ? why nobody as writing anything ? Here , however , our author interposes , and tells us , that we hear in the Iliad of a sealed letter sent by Proetus to JQbates , king of Lycia , with instructions to kill Bellerophon the bearer . The passage has been generally understood of late , as referring to some sort of conventional signs , or pictorial representations , by which the Lycian king was informed of his kinsman 's wishes . Mure opposes this explanation in a labored argument , and shows that the passage may without absurdity be understood as a poetic description of a written letter . He has hardly shown , however , that his own interpretation is necessary , or that , when connected with the other indications of the poems , it is even probable . On the whole we find ourselves constrained to admit , that the Homeric poems do not contain any distinct and unequivocal reference to an art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accounted for by supposing , that such an art , if known at all , was not at that time familiar to the great mass of the Hellenic people . It may have been already common with the traders of the sea-coast towns , who borrowed it from their Phoenician visitors . It may have extended itself to the priests , to be used in their temple records . It may have come to be employed by the minstrel-guilds , to perpetuate their finest compositions . But to the great body of the nation , we must believe it to have been as yet unknown . It found no place , therefore , in the Homeric stock of description and illustration . The early epic poetry was addressed to the popular mind , and whether written or not was designed to operate upon that mind by oral recitation . It must of course confine itself to objects of general familiarity . The whole question is one , in regard to which a somewhat doubtful probability is the utmost height that we can expect to attain ; and the view here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be encumbered with fewer difficulties , than any other . If we had not trespassed too long already on the patience of our readers , we should be glad to follow our author through the Epic cycle , the Hesiodic or didactic school of poets , and especially through the interesting account of the early lyrical poetry , which occupies his third volume , and might fitly claim an article by itself . We think it unfortunate , however , that he was precluded by the chronological limits of his work from taking up the great Theban poet , who , if not the greatest master of the lyre , is our best extant specimen of the lyric muse of Greece . The deficiency will be supplied , though // with less of continuity than could be wished , in the next published volumes of the work . An undertaking of such extensive and elaborate research can hardly be expected to advance with much rapidity . It will be the universal wish of scholars , however , as well in this country as in Europe , that its stages may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief as possible .
