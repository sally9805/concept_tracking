Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : THE ENCHANTED CASTLE . FROM " THE SLEEPING BEAUTY . " from Hours of life ( 1853 ) All slept : the armorial bannerals Drooped idly from the castle walls , Nor wooed the morning 's beam : The bell , within the mouldering tower , No longer tolled the passing hour ; The castle was a dream . A pathless forest , wild and wide , Engirt the wall on every side , And stretched for many a mile : Eternal silence brooded there , Eternal shadows filled the air , And veiled the slumbering pile . So high the ancient cedars sprung , So far aloft their branches flung , So thick the covert grew , No foot its mazes could invade , No eye could pierce its depths of shade , Or see the welkin through . Yet oft , as , from some distant mound , The traveler cast his eyes around O'er wold and woodland grey ; He saw , athwart the glimmering light Of moonbeams , on a misty night , A castle , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred summers rained their flowers Upon the castle lawn : Through day and night , through night and day , In charmd rest , the lady lay , Unmindful of the dawn . A hundred Norland winters passed ; A hundred golden summers cast Their glory on the shore ; And still the guardant angels kept The place all holy , where she slept , And blessed her ever more . Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : A VISION OF PARADISE . SUGGESTED BY DUBUFE 'S PICTURES OF THE TEMPTATION AND EXPULSION . from Hours of life ( 1853 ) Methought this dim , old world had passed away , With all its load of agony and crime ; And brightly o'er me dawned that glorious day When nature woke in its refulgent prime ; So broad the splendor , so intensely fair , The unaccustomed sense pined in that purer air . Two peerless forms of loveliness and light , " In native honor robed , " before me shone , Dazzling and blinding my bewildered sight With rays reflected from Jehovah 's throne ; While , like bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed , all sorrow , hope or fear . Beauty , and purity , and heavenly grace Floated around them like an atmosphere ; While love 's young star , that mocks our fallen race With meteor fires malign , soft gleaming there , In their horizon dawned with cloudless ray , Without one shade or stain that dimmed its after day . " A change came o'er the spirit of my dream ; " The light , the loveliness , the bloom had fled . I trembled at the lightning 's lurid gleam , And the loud thunder pealing o'er my head .  --  The dark waves rolled were they , the beautiful , the pure ? Alas ! now pure and beautiful no more ; Scathed with the curse of knowledge ; to endure , The sole , stern lesson of their withering lore ; Driven from their paradisal dream away , Through pathless realms of death , to seek the gates of day . Is there no mercy in the heavens above ? No star to light the exiles to their doom ?  --  There is !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shedding its soft , pale splendor through the gloom ; Shorn of its earlier rays  --  yet oh , how fair That holy flame that burns through darkness and despair . Look on those dewy orbs like violets dim ! No fear of danger , death , or pain 's keen throe Glooms their pure heaven of love ; alone for him Those dark forebodings of unfathomed woe ; On him she turns her soft , appealing eye , Resigned for him to live , with him resolved to die : For him she dared love 's Eden to forego , And the fond yearnings of her heart to quell , That he the secret of the world might know , And grasp the fruit of knowledge ere it fell . For him she sought the lore of gods , to sate The pride of soul that left her own heart desolate . The disenchanted scene is dark with woe ; God 's image seared with sin 's corroding brand ; O'er all remorse and grief their shadows throw , And leaguered angels guard the holy land : The gate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair soul , her wings , from earthly stain assoil . And this the riddle of our destiny ; The lore of lands whence life 's deep waters welled . Still the cold shadow of the poison tree Darkens our earth as in the days of eld : With lingering pain , the soul evolves its power ; And , on a mortal stem , unfolds the immortal flower . Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : THE DRAMA . from Hours of life ( 1853 ) SPOKEN AT THE OPENING OF THE THEATRE IN PROVIDENCE , NOVEMBER 27 , 1838 . What new enchantment hovers in the air ? Soft music breathes and festal torches glare ; A roseate light illumes the storied wall , And youth and beauty throng the lofty hall . Lo , where the Drama , through the shades of night , Bursts in soft splendor on the ravished sight ; Here lurks Thalia with bewildering glance , In the gay masque of Folly or Romance ; There proud Melpomene , in pall and plume , Trails her imperial purples through the gloom . Immortal sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourned , resume your genial reign ! Can we forget when first in childhood 's hour , Our footsteps sought your vision-haunted bower ? When trembling , wondering ' mid the enraptured throng , We quaffed the tide of eloquence and song ; While , stood revealed , the creatures of our dream , Bright , breathing , palpable ! scarce could we deem That earth confessed such beauty ;  --  to abide With these were life  --  vain shadows all beside . O cold the hearts that from such ' witching sway Could turn unmoved and passionless away . Yet , though less genial prove our sordid age To Art 's bright reign than when the Grecian stage Enthroned the Drama 's triumph and her pride , To sacred rights and royal deeds allied ;  --  When priests and scholars sought her scenic halls And conquering heroes gathered to her walls , While the vast area of her temples saw Tumultuous Athens hushed in breathless awe ; Still do her structures rise , her altars blaze Where late the savage tracked the pathless maze ; By many a stormy river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its mountain guest , Far through the wild her festal notes are borne Ere fade the echoes of the huntsman 's horn . Oft when the wint'ry storms shall hurtle round , Or silent snow-flakes print the frozen ground , When the cold rain comes rattling on the blast , And mantling clouds night 's blazing host o'ercast , Here shall we sit , in this enchanted hall , Where breathing thoughts and burning words enthral , Regardless of the cold world 's sordid strife , And all the hollow mimicries of life , Where vainer actors idler pageants play , And wear their masks in the broad eye of day . Here shall we see again , with martial stalk , ' The buried majesty of Denmark ' walk ; Macbeth shall shudder at the ghost of crime , Nor spoil , for us , ' the pleasure of the time . ' Here fair Hermione , long tranced to stone  --  Fixed like a statue on her marble throne  --  Descending from her pedestal , shall move And breathe and tremble at the voice of love . Here royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights of an imperial bride ; And with such haughty eloquence inspire , Our ' drops of tears shall turn to sparks of fire . ' Manhood shall here cast off earth 's coiling care , And weary Age remember life was fair ; Entranced and spell-bound by her potent sway Who ' calls each slumbering passion into play '  --  Exulting , trembling , as her accents flow In varying strains of triumph or of woe  --  Now decked in smiles , and now her brow o'erfraught With the pale cast of melancholy thought . Far through the twilight vistas of the past , Where gathering years their cloudy mantles cast , Oft turns her eagle eye , and , at its glance , The shadows vanish from that drear expanse  --  Lo , at her gaze , night melteth into day , And the dark mist of ages rolls away ! She hath ' called spirits from the vasty deep , ' Roused kings and heroes from their dreamless sleep , Restored the scenes of a chivalrous age Where knightly forms heroic conflicts wage ;  --  The victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pennon , and the bazoned shield ; Bade the dead lover 's clay-cold bosom glow , And the slain warrior meet once more his foe ; And caused them , for a night , on earth to roam , Then pass like spectres to their silent home . And now she comes with all her shadowy train To hold her court within this gorgeous fane ; Here her bright banner fearlessly unfurls , Nor heeds the pointless shaft the bigot hurls . She comes in living beauty to restore The wondrous deeds of legendary lore , Or , in light vaudevilles and comic mimes , To paint ' the form and pressure of the times ; ' With lofty themes to rouse the languid heart , Or stern reproof with subtle grace impart ,  --  To wake the noble love of well-earned fame And teach the glory of a deathless name . She shows how heroes lived and martyrs died , In life dishonored and in death denied , Yet nerved the powers of death and hell to scorn When holy Honor sounds her bugle horn . Such themes new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light up every eye . Whether in gorgeous drapery she is seen , Moving before us like an empire 's queen  --  Or clothed in all the majesty of woe , Bids beauty 's tears like molten diamonds glow  --  Or wreathed in smiles , with soft , seducing glance , Makes the warm life-blood through the pulses dance  --  Still , ever beautiful , she meets the sight , Taking all shapes to furnish new delight , Forever changing , yet forever true To one , fond aim  --  approving smiles from you . Long may those smiles our virgin temple grace , And Shakspeare 's spirit hallow all the place . Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : ROGER WILLIAMS . from Hours of life ( 1853 ) WRITTEN FOR THE FIRST ANNUAL CELEBRATION OF THE RHODE-ISLAND HISTORICAL SOCIETY , JANUARY , 13 , 1847 . Now , while the echoing cannon 's roar Rocks our far frontal towers , And bugle blast and trumpet 's blare Float o'er the " Land of Flowers ; " While our bold eagle spreads his wing No more in lofty pride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field to hide ; Turn we from war 's bewildering blaze , And conquest 's choral song , To the still voice of other days , Long heard ,  --  forgotten long . Listen to his rich words , intoned To songs of lofty cheer , Who in the howling wilderness , Mid forests wild and drear ; Breathed not of exile nor of wrong , Through the long winter nights , But uttered in exulting song , The soul 's unchartered rights . Who sought the oracles of God In the heart 's veild shrine , Nor asked the monarch nor the priest , His sacred laws to sign . The brave , high heart that would not yield Its liberty of thought , Far o'er the melancholy main , Through bitter trials brought ; But , to a double exile doomed , By Faith 's pure guidance led  --  Through the dark labyrinth of life , Held fast her golden thread . Listen ! The music of his dream Perchance may linger still In the old familiar places Beneath the emerald hill . The wave-worn rock still breasts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives hailed the bark That bore their gentle guide . The Spring that gushed amid the wild In music on his ear , Still pours its waters , undefiled , The fainting heart to cheer . And the fair cove , that slept so calm Beneath o'ershadowing hills , And bore the exile 's evening psalm Far up its flowery rills  --  The wave that parted to receive The pilgrim 's light canoe , As if an angel 's balmy wing Had stirred its waters blue  --  What though the fire-winged courser 's breath Has swept its cooling tide , And fast before its withering blast , The rushing wave has dried , Still , narrowed to our crowded mart  --  A fair enchanted mere  --  In the proud city 's throbbing heart It sleeps serene and clear . Or turn we to the green hill 's side ; There , with the spring-time showers , The white-thorn o'er a nameless grave , Rains its pale , silver flowers . Yet memory lingers with the past , Nor vainly seeks to trace His foot-prints on a rock , whence time Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , The roof-tree of a home Wide as the wings of Love may sweep , Free as her thoughts may roam ; Where , through all time , the saints may dwell , And from pure fountains draw That peace which passeth human thought , In Liberty and Law . When heavenward , up the silver stair Of silence drawn , we tread The visioned mount that looks beyond The Valley of the Dead ,  --  Oh , may we gather to our hearts The deeds our fathers wrought , And feed the perfumed lamp of love In the cool air of thought : While Hope shall on her Anchor lean , May Memory fondly turn To wreath the amaranth and the palm Around their funeral urn . Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : THE CROSS . from Hours of life ( 1853 ) " We can not see earth 's cruel eyes When ours are lifted to the skies . " Elizabeth Barrett . Sad memento of a story Sorrowful as death and love  --  Mystic symbol of a glory Brightening all the worlds above ! From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lorn , Solace in that mortal sorrow By the immortal spirit borne ; Fairer through life 's cross and passion Shall its aureola burn  --  To a loftier resurrection From its lingering sorrow turn . Bind the symbol on thy bosom ; From the sharp and cruel thorn , Rays of mystic glory blossom , Of that lingering sorrow borne . When thy lonely heart is dreaming Of a love on earth unfound , Think upon the love redeeming  --  On the soul with sorrow crowned . In lone Gethsemnes kneeling  --  By the loved of earth betrayed  --  Drink the bitter cup of healing , Wait the morning undismayed . Bear , in holy resignation , On thy heart the mystic rood  --  Fill with heavenly contemplation Earth 's dim garden-solitude . Thus the solemn calm , enzoning Life 's wild tumult , shall be thine ; And thy trust in love atoning Lift thee to the life divine .
