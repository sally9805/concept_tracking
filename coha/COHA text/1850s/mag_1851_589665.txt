txt THE THIRTY-FIRST CONGRESS . THE brilliant administration of Mr. Polk , with its commanding talents , sound democratic principles , decided action , and vast practical results , heightening the glory , as well as extending the territory of the nation , was succeeded , as if by contrast , by a weak , vacillating executive , of negative powers , a feeble and mercenary cabinet , which compromised the rights of the country in its foreign policy , the peace and integrity of the Union by abolition intrigues in its home policy , and which tarnished the national name by scandalous pecuniary intrigues in its personal policy . Under President Polk the honor of the nation and the government was unclouded , the Union presented an unbroken front-internal resources of men and money equal to any emergency , and a military prowess which sufficed , without a reverse of fortune , in a few months to conquer a peace from a nation of 8,000,000 souls , occupying a supposed inaccessible country . The prosperity and power of the Great Republic astonished the world , and established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unfortunate hour , however , many democratic southern states were induced to give their suifrages to a successful soldier , without political principles or capacity ; and a few months found the powerful republic on the brink of a civil war despised abroad , for betraying the rights of her citizens and allies in Central America , while honest men blushed at home for the open spoliation of the public treasury , by the persons appointed to guard it . Under such a government no settled principles of national policy could develope themselves . The principle of individual and sectional plunder alone could be discerned , amidst that general rush upon the treasury for which the " Galphin claim " had been the signal . The old land-marks of the two great parties had been disturbed , as in 1820- ' 21 , by the adroit introduction of a sectional question , which was used to divide the democratic ranks and give power to federalism . The Thirty-First Congress , elected under such circumstances , has been governed by two elements . The party in power struggled fiercely to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been distinguished , and the expenditures of the government have swollen to an amount never before reached , either in peace or // war . The new element of discord , which had divided the democratic party , sought to ally itself to the government which it had helped to elect , and by so doing to consolidate a national party , on the ground of opposition to interests guaranteed by the Constitution . It is a remarkable fact , that the executive , himself a southerner , identified personally with the institutions of that region , should have entered into correspondence with that northern faction which had elected him , by deserting the northern friends of the South . Under this alliance the new northern party daily gained strength and importance . Gen. Taylor was the first southern man who bid for re-election , by courting the northern opponents of southern institutions . The course of affairs , which had been called " southern dictation , " and which it was the avowed purpose of Van Barenism to " break up , " was , through the policy of Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by the northern demagogues , consisted in direct attacks upon sectional rights under the Constitution , and in open and shameless disregard of the obligations imposed by that instrument . The dangers incurred by the nation , through the exercise of these means of agitation , in the hands of men who had no pretensions to integrity , were too manifestly great , and the patriots of all parties rallied to the support of the Union . The struggle between the party of the Union and the desperate northern faction , which was fiercely contending for a permanent position , was severe , and the result doubtful . The South were losing ground , and northern fanatics becoming daily more audacious . The power of the Executive was thrown into the scale of the disunionists , who seemed to be on the eve of triumph , at the moment when Providence interfered , and removed the Chief Magistrate by death . The accession of Mr. Fillmore to the Presidential chair , with a new , and , in some cases , better cabinet , turned the scale in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agitation it had created , gradualbr subsided , permitting the old parties in some degree to resume their former relative positions . Gradually the fabric reared by Van Buren-Sewardism was dismantled , and the position abandoned . The old party issues began once more to marshal their respective partisans , and to restore order out of the confusion which had followed unwonted success on one side , and betrayal and defeat on the other . In this state of affairs , we discover the causes which finally defeated most of those federal measures , which the dominant party had hoped to carry , during the disarray of the party of the people . There remains , however , as a general result , a considerable increase of federal power and patronage . The expenditure has become immense , and the construction of the powers of the government in their exercise more loose , while circumstances are developing a power contained in the Constitution , and which has hitherto lain dormant . We allude to the application of the penalties for treason to those who organize forcible resistance to a Con* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply that provision of the Constitution to those found in arms against it , not on an isolated occasion , but as part of permanent organization to resist its authority . The government is becoming stronger through the course of events , and nothing is more likely to consolidate its power than to give occasion for its exercise . Federalism has thus gained largely by the defeat of Gen. Cass at the election of 1848 , and it will cost the democracy many a long and dreary year of // united exertion to regain the ground which was lost by party division in New-York at one election . That division grew out of the adoption , by a faction of the party , for a special purpose , of the loose federal mode of construing the Constitution-of the abandonment for the moment of that strict construction which is peculiarly democratic . In contemplating that defeat , the democracy will long remember one , to whom we might well apply Milton 's description of Lucifer , the Son of the Morning : He , above the rest , In shape and gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not yet lost All her original brightness , nor appeared Less than archangel ruined , and the excess Of glory obscured ; as when the sun new risen Looks through the horizontal misty air , Shorn of his beams , or from behind the moon , In dim eclipse , disastrous twilight sheds On half the nations , and with fear of change Perplexes monarchs . Darkened so , yet shone Above them all the archangel ; but his face Deep scars of thunder had entrench 'd , and care Sat on his faded cheek , but under brows Of dauntless courage , and considerate pride , Waiting revenge , &amp;c . The bravery and devotion of the democratic members of the last Congress who so fearlessly resisted at all hazards a scheme of internal miprovements , which would ultimately abstract hundreds of millions from the treasury , and consolidate the federal government as the moneyed head of the nation , can not be too much admired . The circumstances of that struggle were , however , ominous . At this stage of our national progress , therefore , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high and holy democratic principle which lies at the foundation of our social and political system ; for the vindication of that principle from the charges daily brought against it ; for its purification from those corruptions and hostile influences by which we see its beneficent and glorious tendencies , to no slight extent , perverted and paralyzed ; for the illustration of truth , which we see perpetually darkened and confused by the arts of wily error ; for the protection of those great interests , not alone of our country , but of humanity , looking forward through countless ages of the future , which we believe to be vitally committed with the cause of American Democracy . There is a great deal of mutual misunderstanding between our parties ; but in truth , there does not exist in the people , with reference to its great measures , that irreconcilable hostility of opinions and leading principles , which would be the natural inference from the violence of the party warfare in which we are perpetually engaged . There does exist , it is true , an essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the respective political creeds or systems of our two great parties ; but we feel well assured , that the great body of the latter party-those who supply their leaders and leading interests with the*votes-do not rightly understand the questions at issue in their popular bearings ; and that if these could but be exhibited in their proper lights , to their sound // minds and honest hearts , they would be found ranged by the hundreds of thousands under the broad and bright folds of our democratic banner . Who , that looks back for a quarter of a century , does not perceive , not only in this country but in England and Europe , the progress of the democratic principle 3 In our own country , the position of what is called the whig party of to-day , is more ultra than was that of the democracy of twenty years since . As the great democracy , whose essence is progress , achieves its triumphs and establishes its principles , its former positions are occupied by more tardily advancing federalism . What would now the most ultra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hamilton , proposed to Mr. Madison in the convention , for the creation of an Executive and Senate for life , with hereditary rights ? Surely federalism has gone over much ground since then . Nevertheless , so many false ideas continue to attach themselves to the term " democracy , " as connected with our party politics , that we deem it necessary here at this juncture , to renew a full and free profession of principles , to which we are devoted with unwavering force of conviction and earnestness of enthusiasm , which have strengthened through the contemplation of the incalculable capabilities of social improvement , of which they contain the germ . We believe , then , in the principle of democratic republicanism in its strongest and purest sense . We have an abiding confidence in the virtue , intelligence , and full capacity for self-government , of the great mass of our people-our industrious , honest , manly , intelligent millions of freemen . We are opposed to all self-styled " wholesome restraints " on the free action of the popular opinion and will , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of precipitate legislation . This latter object is to be attained by the expedient of the division of power , and by causing all legislation to pass through the ordeal of successive forms ; to be sifted through the discussions of co-ordinate legislative branches , with mutual suspensive veto powers . Yet all should be dependent with equal directness and promptness on the influence of public opinion ; the populam w ill should e equally the animating and moving spirit of them all , and ought never to find in any of its own creatures a self-imposed power , capable ( when aroused either by corrupt ambition or honest error ) of resisting itself , and defeating its own determined object . We can not , therefore , look with an eye of favor on any such forms of representation as , by length of tenure of delegated power , tend to weaken that universal and unrelaxing responsibility to the vigilance of public opinion , which is the true conservative principle of our institutions . The great question here occurs , which is of vast importance to this country , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunging it into the abyss of civil war 3 ) - Of the relative rights of majorities and minorities . Though we go for the republican principle of the supremacy of the will of the majority , we acknowledge , in general , a strong sympathy with minorities , and consider that their rights have a high moral claim on the respect and justice of majorities ; a claim not always fairly recognized in practice by the latter , in the full sway of power , when flushed with triumph , and impelled by strong interests . This has ever been the point of the democratic cause most open to assault , and most difficult to defend . This difficulty does not arise from . any intrinsic weakness . // The democratic theory is perfect and harmonious in all its parts ; and if this point is not so self-evidently clear as the rest is generally , in all candid discussion , considered to be , it is because of certain false principles of government , which have , on all practical experiments of the theory , been interwoven with the democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anti-democratic systems of government . We should be willing to meet this question frankly and fairly . The great argument against pure democracy drawn from this source , is this : Though the main object with reference to which all social institutions ought to be modelled , is undeniably , as stated by the democrat , " the greatest good of the greatest number , " yet it by no means follows , that the greatest number always rightly understands its own greatest good . Highly pernicious error has often possessed the minds of nearly a whole nation ; while the philosopher in his closet , and an enlightened few about him , powerless against the overwhelming current of popular prejudice and excitement , have alone possessed the truth , which the next generation may perhaps recognise and practice , though its author , now sainted , has probably in his own time been its martyr . The original adoption of the truth would have saved perhaps oceans of blood , and mountains of misery and crime . How much stronger , then , the case against the absolute supremacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its numerical preponderance is , as often happens , comparatively small . And if the larger proportion of the more wealthy and cultivated classes of the society are found on the side of the minority , the disinterested observer may well be excused if he hesitates long before he awards the judgment , in a difficult and complicated question , in favor of the numerical argument . Majorities are often as liable to error of opinion , and not always free from a similar proneness to selfish abuse of power , as minorities ; and a vast amount of injustice may often be perpetrated , and consequent general social injury be done , before the evil reaches that extreme at which it rights itself by revolution , moral or physical . We have here , we believe , correctly stated the anti-democratic side of the argument upon this point . It is not to be denied that it possesses something more than plausibility . It has certainly been the instrument of more injury to the cause of the democratic principle , than all the bayo nets and cannon that have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The inference from it is , that the popular opinion and will must not be trusted with the supreme and absolute direction of the general interests ; that it must be subjected to the " conservative checks " of minority interests , and to the regulation of the " more enlightened wisdom " of the " better classes , " and those to whom the possession of a property " test of merit " gives what they term " a stake in the community . " And here we find ourselves in the face of the great stronghold of the anti-democratic , or aristocratic principle . It is not our purpose , in this place , to carry out the discussion of this question . It will be sufficient to allude to the leading ideas by which they are met by the advocate of the pure democratic cause . In the first place , the greatest number are more likely , at least as a gene . ral rule , to understand and follow their own greatest good , than is the minority . In the second , a minority is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own selfish interests , at the expense of the majority of // numbers  --  the substantial and producing mass of the nation-than the latter is to oppress unjustly the former . The social evil is also , in that case , proportionably greater . This is abundantly proved by the history of all aristocratic interests that have existed , in various degrees and modifications in the world . A majority can not subsist upon a minority ; while the natural , and in fact uniform tendency of a minority entrusted with governmental authority is , to surround itself with wealth , splendor , and power , at the expense of the producing mass , creating and perpetuating those artificial social distinctions which violate the natural equality of rights of the human race , and at the same time offend and degrade the true dignity of human nature . In the third place , there does not naturally exist any such original superiority of a minority class above the great mass of a community , in intelligence and competence for the duties of government-even puttin* out of view its constant tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mass . The general diffusion of education ; the facility of access to every species of knowledge important to the great interests of the community ; the freedom of the press , whose very licentiousness can not materially impair its permanent value , in this country at least , make the pretensions of those self-styled " better classes ' * to the sole possession of the requisite intelligence for the management of public affairs* too absurd to be entitled to any other treatment than an honest , manly contempt . As far as superior knowledge and talent confer on their possessor a natural charter of privilege to control his associates , and exert an influence on the direction of the general affairs of the community , the free and natural action of that privilege is best secured by a perfectly free democratic system , which will abolish all artificial distinctions , and preventing the accumulation of any social obstacles to advancement , will permit* the free development of every germ of talent , wherever it may chance to exist , whether on the proud mountain summit , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the question is not yet satisfactorily answered , how the relation between majorities and minorities , in the frequent case of a collision of sentiments and particular interests , is to be so adjusted as to secure a mutual respect of rights , to preserve harmony and good will , and save society from the malum extremum discordia-from being as a house divided against itself  --  and thus to afford free scope to that competition , discussion , and mutual moral influence , which can not but result , in the end , in the ascendency of the truth , and in " the greatest good of the greatest number . " On the one side , it has only been shown that the absolute government of the majority does not always afford a perfect guarantee against the misuse of its numerical power over the weakness of the minority . On the other , it has been shown that this chance of misuse is , as a general rule , far less than in the opposite relation of the ascendancy of a minority ; and that the evils attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , in th one case than the other . But this is not yet a complete or satisfactory solution of the problem . Have we but a choice of evils l Is there , then , such a radical deficiency in the moral elements implanted by its Creator in human society , that no other alternative can be devised by which both evils shall be avoided , and a result attained more analogous to the beautiful and glorious harmony of the rest of his creation l It were scarcely consistent with a true and living faith in the existence // and attributes of that Creator , so to believe ; and such is not the democratic belief The reason of the plausibility with which appeal may be made to the experience of so many republics , to sustain this argument against democratic institutions , is , that the true theory of national selfgovernment has been hitherto but imperfectly understood ; bad principles have been mixed up with the good ; and the republican government has been administered on ideas and in a spirit borrowed from the strong governments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have never failed , in the course of time , to evolve themselves out of these seeds of destruction , is ascribable the eventful failure of those experiments , and the consequent doubt and discredit which have attached themselves to the democratic principles on which they were , in the outset , mainly based . It is under the word government , that the subtle danger lurks . Understood as a central consolidated power , managing and directing the various general interests of society , all government is evil , and the parent of evil . A strong and active democratic government , in the common sense of the term , is an evil , differing only in degree and mode of operation , and not in nature , from a strong despotism . This difference is certainly vast , yet , inasmuch as these strong governmental powers must be wielded by human agents , even as the powers of the despotism , it is , after all , only a difference in degree ; and the tendency to demoralization and tyranny is the same , though the development to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one case than in the other . Hence the demagoguehence the faction-hence the mob-hence the violence , licentiousness , and instability-hence the ambitious struggles of parties and their leaders for power-hence the abuses of that power by majorities and their leadershence the indirect oppressions of the general by partial interests-hence ( fearful symptom ) the demoralization of the great men of the nation , and of the nation itself proceeding ( unless checked in time by the more healthy and patriotic portion of the mind of the nation rallying itself to reform the principles and sources of the evil ) gradually to that point of maturity at which relief from the tumult of moral and physical confusion is to be found only under the shelter of an energetic armed despotism . The best government is that which governs least . No human depositories can , with safety , be trusted with the power of legislation upon The general interests of society , so as to operate directly or indirectly on the industry and property of the community . Such power must be perpetually liable to the most pernicious abuse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purity of purpose , of all human legislation , exposed constantly to the pressure of partial interests ; interests which , at the same time that they are essentially selfish and tyrannical , are ever vigilant , persevering , and subtle in all the arts of deception and corruption . In fact , the whole history of human society and government may be safely appealed to , in evidence that the abuse of such power a thousand fold more than overbalances its beneficial use . Legislation has been the fruitful parent of nine-tenths of all the evil , moral and physical , by which mankind has been afflicted since the creation of the world , and by which human nature has been self-degraded , fettered , and oppressed . Government should have as little as possible to do with the general business and interests of the people . If it once undertake these functions as its rightful province of action , it . a impossible to say to it , " thus far shalt // thou go , and no farther . " It will be impossible to confine it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be perpetually tampering with private interests , and sending forth seeds of corruption which will result in the demoralization of the society . Its domestic action should be confined to the administration of justice , for the protection of the natural equal rights of the citizen , and the preservation of social order . In all other respects , the VOLUNTARY PRINcIPLE , the principle of FREEDOM , suggested to us by the analogy of the divine government of the Creator , and already recognized by us with perfect success in the great social interest of Religion , affords the true " golden rule " which is alone abundantly competent to work out the best possible general result of order and happiness from that chaos of characters , ideas , motives , and interests-human society . Afford but the single nucleus of a system of administration of justice between man and man , and , under the sure operation of this principle , the floating atoms will distribute and combine themselves , as we see in the beautiful natural process of crystallization , into a far more perfect and harmonious result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " undertake to disturb , under the plea of directing , the process . The natural laws which will establish themselves and find their own level are the best laws . The same hand was the Author of the moral , as of the physical world ; and we feel clear imd strong in the assurance that we can not err in trusting , in the former , to the same fundamental principles of spontaneous action and self-regulation which produce the beautiful order of the latter . This is then , we consider , the true theory of government , the one simple result towards which the political science of the world is gradually tending , after all the long and varied experience by which it will have dearly earned the great secret  --  the elixir of political life . This is the fundamental principle of the philosophy of democracy , to furnish a system of administration of justice , and then leave all the business and interests of society to themselves , to free competition and association-in a word , to the VOLUNTARY PRINCIPLE . It is borrowed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being written in letters of light on every page of the great bible of Nature . It contains the idea of full and fearless faith in the providence of the Creator . It is essentially involved in Christianity , of which it has been well said that its pervading spirit of democratic equality among men is its highest fact , and one of its most radiant internal evidences of the divinity of its origin . It is the essence and the one general result of the science of political economy . And this principle alone , we will add , affords a satisfactory and perfect solution of the great problem , otherwise unsolved , of the relative rights of majorities and minorities . This principle has never yet received any other than a very partial and imperfect application to practice among men , all human society having been hitherto perpetually chained down to the ground by myriads of lilliputian fetters of artificial government and prescription . Nor are we yet prepared for its full adoption in this country . Far , very far indeed , from it ; yet is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations may yet be required before our theory and practice of government shall be sifted and analyzed down to the lowest point of simplicity , consistent with the preservation of some degree of national organization , no one can presume to prophecy . But that we are on the path toward that great result , to which mankind is to be guided down the long vista of future years by the democratic principle-walking hand in hand with the // sister spirit of Christianity-we feel a faith as implicit as that with which we believe in any other great moral truth . We have here endeavored to re-state the theory of the Jeffersonian democracy , to which we profess allegiance , in its abstract essence , however unpopular it appears to be , in these latter days , to " theorize . " These are the original ideas of American democracy ; and we would not give much for that " practical knowledge " which is ignorant of , and affects to disregard the essential and abstract principles which really constitute the animating soul of what were else lifeless and nought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political affairs , is obvious and simple . Penetrated with a perfect faith in their eternal truth , we can never hesitate as to the direction to which , in every practical case arising , they must point with the certainty of the magnetized needle ; and we have no desire to shrink from the responsibility of a frank avowal of them in the broadest general language . If the last Congress has not decidedly swerved from these leading , and , we conceive , immutable principles , it has not decidedly and firmly , as in former years , repudiated those measures which tend to recognize the " fostering hand of government , " as essential to national progress . True it is , as we have before intimated , that those bills , which in their spirit violated , in the most marked manner , the old policy of the democratic party , failed to pass , and the last session witnessed towards its close , a visible deepening of the old party lines , which at one time showed signs of obliteration . A firm adherence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , and commercial enterprise , joined to profound respect for minority interests , must form the foundation of party , as well as national welfare . The respect for minority interests ought by no means to be confined to those guaranteed by the Constitution ; but the enduring principle which led to those guarantees , should be recognized as universally operative . The action of these two leading principles tends to radical simplification of the government ; and in every case where one of its hundred giant arms , with which it now stretches its fatal protecting grasp over almost all the interests of society , can be curtailed , and in every case in which public opinion can be brought to bear more directly upon the action of delegated powers , we recognize a step in advance . We might refer to the fact , that the anti-democratic cause possesses at least two-thirds of the press of the country , and that portion of it which is best supported by talent and the resources of capital , under the commercial of our cities . In the cities where wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where aristocratic habits and social classifications form and strengthen themselves , where the congregation of men stimulates and exaggerates all ideas  --  the influence exerted upon the country is not inconsiderable . From the influence of the mercantile classes , too , ( extensively anti-democratic ) on the young men of the professions , especially that of the law , but recently extensively observable in the pulpit , creating an insensible bias , from the dependence of the latter mainly on the patronage of the former , these young men becoming again each the centre of a small sphere of social influence ; from that of the religious ministry , silently and insensibly exerted , through the false prejudice slightly touched upon above ; from these and some other minor influences , on which we can not here pause , a vast and active power on public opinion is perpetually in operation . These infl*iential combi // nations of wealth are continually seeking profit at the hands of the governnmut at the expense of the people . And it is only astonishing that the democratic party should be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact witness . This is to be ascribed ( under that Providence whose unseen hand we recognise in all human affairs ) only to the sterling honesty and good sense of the great industrious mass of our people , its instinctive perception of ; and yearning after , the democratic truth , and the unwavering generosity of its support of those public servants whom it has once tried well and lono* , and with whom it has once acknowledged the genuine sympathy of common sentiments and a common cause . Yet still the democratic principle can do little more than hold its own . The moral energies of the national mind are , to a great extent , paralyzed by division ; and instead of bearing forward the ark of democratic truth , entrusted to us as * chosen people , towards the glorious destiny of its future , we must be content if we can but stem with it the perpetual tide of attack which would bear it back towards the ideas of the dark ages . The democratic cause is one which not only ought to engage the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its energies ,  --  to carry forward the noble mission entrusted to her , of going before the nations of the world as the representative of the democratic principle , and as the constant living exemplar of its results ; but which ought peculiarly to commend itself to the generosity of youth , its ardent aspirations after the good and beautiful , its liberal and unselfish freedom from narrow prejudices of interest . For democracy is the cause of humanity . It has faith in human nature . It believes in its essential equality and fundamental goodness . It respects with a solemn reverence , to which the proudest artificial institutions and distinctions of society have no claim , the human soul . It is the cause of philanthropy . Its object is to emancipate the mind of the mass of men from the degrading and disheartening fetters of social distinctions and advantages ; to bid it walk abroad through the free creation " in its own majesty ; " to war against all fraud , oppression , and violence by striking at their root , to reform all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and false ideas by which the world has been so long misgoverned ; to dismiss the hireling soldier ; to spike the cannon , and bury the bayonet ; to burn the gibbet , and open the debtor 's dungeon ; to substitute harmony and mutual respect for the jealousies and discord now subsisting between different classes of society , as the consequence of their artificial classification . It is the cause of Christianity , to which a slight allusion has been already made , to be more fully developed hereafter . And that portion of the peculiar friends and ministers of religion who now , we regret to say , cast the weight of their influence against the cause of democracy , under the false prejudice of an affinity between it and opposition to a " hig*mer law , " understand but little either its true spirit , or that of their own faith . It is , moreover , a cheerful creed  --  a creed of high hope and universal love , noble and ennobling ; while all others , which imply a distrust of mankind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creator , for its own selfdevelopment and self-regulation , are as gloomy and selfish , in the tone of moral sentiment which pervades them , as they are degrading in their practical tendency , and absurd in theory , when examined by the light of original principles .
