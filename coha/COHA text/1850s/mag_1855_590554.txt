AMERICAN LEADERS . No. 1. - THOMAS JEFFERSON . THE fiftieth anniversary of Independence came over the American mind , with a sensible impression of something be . yond the ordinary succession of events . The deathof Thomas Jefferson and of John Adams on the 4th of July , 1826 , was an event of no ordinary import . Indeed , the whole range of history may be appealed to in vain to proiuce an event of equal singularity and interest . The death of either of them on the 4th of July would have attracted the public notice as a very affecting coYncidence ; the departure of both on the same day , and that , the fiftieth anniversary of our independence , impresses us with a feeling , that the good Providence , whose interpositions at the great eras of our history have ever been devoutly acknowledged , was pleased , at the close of the jubi. lee of our national existence , in the simultaneous departure of the two great men , who exercised such a leading agency in asserting it , to stamp the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very extraordinary circun*stance , among those which prepared the way for the American Revolution , that the lead . ing colonies of the North and South were equally embarked in it . Settled at different periods from different causes , and by classes of men wholly unlike , and called to very different fortunes , for a century after their foundation , the Northern and Southern colonies could scarcely have been expected to feel and act in concert on any question , much less on one likely to call into exercise every description of local prej udice . The British calculated on a want of concert between the different parts of the country . They thought the South would feel no sympathy with the distresses of the North , and that // the North would look with jealousy on the character and institutions of the South . Among the numerous events which occurred to frustrate whatever hopes may have been built on this foundation , the simultaneous appearance , in Massachusetts and Virginia , of characters corresponding in so many respects as those of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least important . Thomas Jefferson was descended from ancestors , who had been settled in Virginia for some generations . His father , Peter Jefferson , was surveyor of the State , and from him Mr. Jeff&amp;rson inherited what was then deemed an immense fortune . He was born near the spot on which he died , in the county of Albemarle , on the 2d of April , 1743 . At this time , society in Virginia presented very nearly the same division of ranks that exists in England . There was the landed aristocracy , shadowing forth the order of the British nobility ; the middle class of citizens , consisting principally of the yeomanry , and common to both countries ; and a feculum of beings , as they were called by Mr. Jefferson , corresponding to the lowest class of the community in England. * Mr. Jefferson , by birth , belonged to the aristocracy ; but the idle and voluptuous life that prevailed in that class of society had no charms for him . From the first moment his own character disclosed itself he threw himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pursued in the neighborhood of his father 's residence , until he was removed in due time to William and Mary College , through which he passed with high reputation for talent , industry , andscholarship . Selecting the profession of the law , he commenced and pursued its studies under George Wythe , a master well worthy of such a pupil . In this school he acquired , as far as such things are matters of acquisition , that unrivalled neatness , system , and method in business , which , through all his future life , and in every office which he filled , enabled him to accomplish the most arduous and multiplied duties with decision , punctuality , and in the most perfect form of execution . It has been a prevalent error that Mr. Jefferson made no figure at the bar . The case was far otherwise . There still remain in his handwriting a number of arguments delivered by him at the bar upon some of the most intricate questions of the law , which , in the opinion of most competent authorities , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might , indeed , with all persons acquainted with the talents and perseverance of Mr. Jefferson , have been admitted , without any proof of the fact , that he was a profound adept in the profession of his voluntary choice and pursuit . It is true he was not distinguished in public debate . This was merely a physical defect . He wanted volume and compass of voice for a large assembly ; and his voice , from the excess of his sensibility , instead of rising with his feelings and conceptions , sunk under their pressure , and became guttural and inarticulate . The consciousness of this infirmity repressed any attempt , on the part of Mr. Jefferson , to speak in large deliberative assemblies . It is an additional proof . of his intellectual ascendency , that he rose , in the morning of life , to the height of influence , from which he never after descended , without having the command of what is generally considered the necessary instrument of controlling popular bodies . Mr. Jefferson was still a student of law at Williamsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry against the stamp act were moved in the Assembly of Virginia . He was present during the whole of the extraordinary and memorable debate , in the door of communication between the lobby and the house . He has left an account of the scene in his own words . The opposition to the last resolution was most vehement . The debate , to use the strong expression of Mr. Jefferson , became " most bloody ; " but it was carried by a single vote . " I well remember , " continues Mr. Jefferson in his account , " the cry of Treason ' by the speaker echoed from every part of the house against Mr. Henry . I well remember his pause , and the admirable address with which he recovered himself and baffled the charge thus vociferated . " It ha* been pointed out as one of the features of the parallel which has been run between Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams , that this interesting event in the former 's life took place when he was very nearly of the same age at which Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence of James Otis , on the subject of Writs of assistance . From this time onward , Mr. Jefferson stood forward as a champion of his country . He adopted , as the motto of his seals : " Ab eo libertas , a quo spiritus , " and " Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God . " His first official participation in the councils of the day was as a member of the State Convention of Virginia , which , in 1774 , appointed the first delegates to the Continental Congress . On his way to Williamsburg he fell // sick ; and , in consequence of this circumstance , sent forward , to be laid on the table of the Convention , a draft of instructions to the delegates w*iom Virginia might send . This paper was read by the members , and published by them , under the title of " A Summary View of the Rights of Independent AmeriCa . " A copy of this work having found its way to England , it received from the pen of Mr. Burke , such alterations as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition in that country , and appeared in a new edition in London . This circumstance , as Mr. Jefferson afterwards learned , procured the insertion of his name in a bill of attainder , which , however , did not pass in Parliament . The effect of this work on Lord Dunmore , the Governor of Virginia , was excessive . At the time of its appearance at Williamsburg , he put no bounds to the expressions of his anger , or of his purpose of revenge . In the year 1775 , Mr. Jefferson , although , of course , one of the youngest members of the Virginia Legislature , was designated to prepare the answer to what was called Lord North 's " Conciliatory Proposition . " It remains on record , and possesses the characteristic marks of Mr. Jefferson 's mind , and of the spirit of the time . In the same year , Mr. Jefferson was elected a member of the Continental Congress ; but being deputed contingently ( to supPly the place of Peyton iRandolph , ) he did not take his seat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment of General Washington as Commander-in-chief of the American armies , Mr. Jefferson first took his seat as a member of the Continental Congress . The circumstances of his appointment the following year to draft the Declaration of Independence were these : To prevent delay , in the event of the passage of Mr. Adams ' resolution , " to adopt such government as would in the opinion of the represer&amp;tives of the people , best conduce ' to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular , and America in general . " A Committee was chosen by ballot to prepare a Declaration of mdcpendence . This Committee consisted of Thomas Jefferson , John Adams , Benjamin Franklin , Roger Sherman , and Robert R. Livingston . The members are supposed to have been arranged in the foregoing order , according to the number of votes which each received . Mr. Jefferson had , therefore , received the highest number , and Mr. Adams the next highest number of votes . Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams , standing thus at the head of the Committee , were requested b* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-Committee , and to prepare the draft . A friendly altercation took place between Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams , by which of them the Declaration should be drawn , each urging the honorable task on the other . Mr. Jefferson drew up the paper , which , after some small alterations by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams , was reported to Congress . The original draft , as brought by Mr. Jefferson from his study , and submitted to the other members of the Committee , with slight interlineations in the handwritings of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Adams , is still in existence . The merit of this paper is Mr. Jefferson 's . Some changes were made in it by the Committee , and others by Congress , while it was under discussion ; but none of these changes altered the tone , the frame , the arrangement , or the general character of the instrument . Its burning words of defiance and resolute resistance are Jefferson 's . As a composition , the Declaration is Mr. Jefferson 's . It is the production of his mind ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and absolutely . " * Although not participating in public debate , the influence of Mr. Jefferson over the minds of the members , through the channels of private intercourse , was early felt . " Though a silent member , " ( said one of his co.patriots , t ) " he was so prompt , frank , explicit , and decisive upon Committees-not even Samuel Adams was more so-that he soon seized my heart . " On the great occasion which had now arrived , all this influence was successfully put forth ; and while Adams was sustaining the Declaration with the strength of his impassioned oratory , Jefferson was operating to the same end by all the resources of an unrivalled personal influence . In September , 1776 , Mr. Jefferson was appointed Minister to France ; but the situation of his family compelled him to decline the appointment ; and the same cause requiring his presence at home , led him to resign his seat in Congress . He was , however , elected a member of the House of Delegates in Virginia . The following year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge of a duty intimately connected with the higher and final objects of the Revolution , as far as Virginia was concerned  --  a revision of the laws of that State . One of his distinguished associates withdrew from the work , and the other died shortly after its commencement , leaving both the responsibility and the glory to Mr. Jefferson . In June , 1779 , he presented the result of his labors to the Legis // lature , in what is called the Revised Code . In adapting this code to the political condition of Virginia , under a republican government , he found it necessary to materially modify , or rather to re-mould the foundations of the commonwealth . The most important of these alterations were those relating to primogeniture , entails , and the Established Church , and those prohibiting the further importation of slaves . The law of primogeniture , on which , in conjunction with the law of entails , the aristocracy of the State was founded , was now repealed , and with it the laws making provision for the support of an Established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preamble of the bill establishing religious freedom in the State of Virginia , was esteemed by Mr. Jefferson one of his happiest efforts , and the measure itself one of his best services to his country . The legislative enactments now alluded to , form of course but a small part of the entire revision of the laws . The collection of bills reported by Messrs . Jefferson , Pendieton , and Wythe amounted to one hundred and twenty-six , and constitute a well-digested and comprehensive system of jurisprudence . In 1779 , he was elected Governor of Virginia , in the place of Patrick Henry . He filled the chair of State , at a time of great anxiety and ' peril for the State of Virginia , which became , at this period , the theatre of war . Benedict Arnold invaded and ravaged those portions of it within reach , by predatory incursions . An attempt was subsequently made to impeach the conduct of Mr. Jefferson in the discharge of the arduous duties of this crisis . His defense , however , was prompt , and so triumphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before whom the investigation was conducted , an unanimous vote of thanks for his impartial . upright , and attentive administration while in office . In 1781 , Mr. Jefferson wrote his Notes on Virginia , in answer to the written queries of M. Barlie Marbois , then resident in this country . The following year the work was corrected and enlarged ; and re-printed , in a translation , in France : No publication , which had appeared in America before it , can be placed on a level , as a literary composition , with the " Notes on Virginia ; " and the office , which was discharged by Mr. Jefferson , in this vindication of his country , against the misrepresentation of foreign popular writers of great celebrity , was not unworthy of one who had shown himself so able a leader in her political councils . It is a work which , under any circumstances , would secure to its author a permanent literary reputation . // Tn 1782 , Mr. Jefferson returned to the Continental Congress . The following year he prepared a draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called that year , to reform the Constitution of Virginia . Mr. Jefferson was also the author of the preamble of the Constitution , which had been adopted in Virginia , in 1776 . In the plan of a Constitution , drawn up by him in 1783 , Mr. Jefferson introduced the principles of a representation in the Legislature , proportioned to the number of qualified voters , and a general right of suffrage . These principles had been maintained against the unequal representation and limited suffrage of the existing Constitution in Mr. Jefferson 's " Notes on Virginia ; " and in several able subsequently written letters , they had been cogently advocated anew , in support of such a reform of the Constitution of Virginia as was demanded by the principles of republicanism . In 1784 , Mr. Jefferson was busy with the mint and coinage question , and was the author of our present system of decimal coins ; in the same year , he was associated with Franklin , Adams , Jay , and Laurens , in a plenipotentiary commission , addressed to the several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioners , in conjunction with Mr. Jefferson , the treaty of Prussia was negotiated at the Hague in 1785 . In that year , Mr. Jefferson was elected our Minister to France . His reputation was already established among the learned men of that country , by the translation of his " Notes on Virginia , ** and procured him an enviable access to the vast scientific and literary resources of Paris . In the great work which meantime was going on at homethe formation of the Constitution of the United States-Mr . Jefferson had no immediate participation . The same is true of Mr. Adams , who was at the same period in England . They had both , indeed , furnished models of constitutions , coYnciding in the leading principles of representative government ; Mr. Adams , in the Constitution which had been adopted in Massachusetts , and Mr. Jefferson , in that which he had prepared for Virginia . But the direct agency of framing the Feder4 Constitution passed , to a considerable degree , into the hands of the younger patriots of the Revolutionary age , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , the leaders of the classes being Madison and Hamilton . On the adoption of the Constitution , and the organization of the government , Mr. Jefferson was , by the urgent solicitation of General Washington , prevailed upon to the acceptance of // the Department of State ; in which ofilce he gave the tone , under the President , to the foreign policy of the country . It was during his administration of this department that the French revolution burst forth ; and the division of feeling consequent upon it , began to exhibit itself among the American people . Like most of the other patriots of the Revolution , Mr. Jefferson aimed to hold the golden mean between the violent extremes of public opinion . His skill and firmness were as conspicuously displayed in his correspondence with M. Genet , as in that with Mr. Hammond . When it became necessary for the administration to take a decided step , the proclamation of neutrality was resolved upon , by the unanimous consent of the Cabinet . It was not long , however , before the divisions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cabinet of General Washington too decisively , for that harmonious action necessary to the welfare of the State . Mr. Jefferson , unable to act with General Hamilton , who , with talents of the highest order , entertained , on most points , political opinions variant from his own , retired from the administration , with the purpose of devoting himself to the pursuits of an ele*ant and philosophic leisure . An ample library and scientific apparatus , an unconquerable thirst for learning in all its branches , and a highly refined taste , furnished resources abundantly sufficient to occupy him in his seclusion . To the gratification of this purpose , the will of the people opposed an insuperable obstacle . On the retirement of General Washinc , ton from the Presidency , the weight of an influence which prevailed equally in all hearts , and over all interests and parties , ceased to be felt . The country was now , for the first time , canvassed for the election of a chief-magistrate ; and the two parties were arrayed against each other . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these divisions , which were now , for the first time , manifested in a presidential election . Their basis may possibly be sought , in geographical limits , which will be found , in too many instances , to lie *t the foundation of our various political controversies . Mr. Adams had the votes North of the Delaware , and Mr. Jefferson a very large majority of those South . Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams entered upon their respective duties with feelings most cordial towards each other . Whatever feelings had mingled with the controversy , in the minds of a considerable portion of the community , there was no coolness between Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams . In the chair of // 379 the Senate , Mr. Jefferson distinguished himself as a dignified presiding officer . That gravity and decorum , which had subsisted unimpaired during the discussions of the former administration , still characterized its proceedings . No other proof of the respectable character of the parliamentary proceedings of the Senate at this period , and during the preceding administrations , need be sought , than the Manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of the Senate itself . During the Vice-Presidency of Mr. Jefferson , the political division of the American family reached its crisis . The foreign relations of the country furnished the chief aliment , and these had been made to assume the most embarrassing forms , by all the preliminary measures of war . In the result of the presidential contest , Mr. Jefferson was elected to the chief.magistracy of the country . He entered on this exalted station under the most favorable circumstances , and with every disposition to avail himself of them for the benefit of his country . Peace was conclude&amp; with France by a treaty already negotiated . This circumstance authorized a general reduction of the military establishments of the country . A reduction of the naval establishment had been already begun , and the removal of the burden of taxation was an easy consequence . Our foreign commerce released from all its embarrassments , by the treaties with France and England , and continually extending itself to meet the consumption of a most rapidly increasing population , poured a tide of wealth into the treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national debt . In his inaugural address , Mr. Jefferson speaks in confident terms of the prosperous state in which he lound the country on his accession to the chair of State . But while Mr. Jefferson strenuously pursued the policy of retrenchment , under circumstances which so remarkably fa* vored the application of that policy , he adventured on one measure which might have startled an infant government , even as a matter of finance ; and which , in its political relations , was of the boldest and most decided cast . This is not the place to dwell upon the purchase of Louisiana ; nor will this generation be fully able to do justice to the subject , in all its consequences . Although Mr. Jefferson was the first President who enjoyed the satisfaction of finding his administration gain strength from year to year among the people , he declined a nomination as a candidate for a third term in office , and retired from public 26 // life in 1809 . Thenceforward he took no part in public affairs . When the library of Congress was destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jefferson promptly placed his own at the command of that body , and thus consented , fGr the sake of animating the spirits of the country , at a moment of depression , to deprive himself of the cherished resources of his philosophic retreat . On the return of peace , he devoted himself to a new and noble enterprise , the foundation of the University of Virginia . This magnificent institution is justly called " his work ; his the first conception ; his the whole impulse and direction ; his the varied and beautiful architecture , and the entire superintendence of its erection ; the whole scheme of its studies , its organization and government , are his. *** This great enterprise filled up the closing years of Mr. Jefferson 's life . Temperance , industry , and method had enabled him also , as it were , to multiply his existence , and to crowd into one life objects seemingly numerous , and vast enough for many lives . The mere reception and entertainment of visitors , drawn to his abode by his splendid reputation , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following description of his abode may be not inappropriately introduced here : " The mansion-house at Monticello was built and furnished in the days of his prosperity . In its dimensions , its architecture , its arrangements , and ornaments , it was such a one as became the character and the fortune of the man . It stands upon an elliptic plain , formed by cutting down the apex of a mountain ; and , on the west , stretching away to north and south , it commands a view of the Blue Ridge , for a hundred and fifty miles , and brings under the eye one of the boldest and most beautiful hodzons in the world ; while , on the east , it presents an extent of prospect , boundcd only by the spherical form of the earth , in which nature seems to sleep in eternal repose , as if to form one of her finest contrasts with the rude and rolling grandeur on the west . In the wide prospect , and scattered to the north and south , are several detached mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and among them , to the south , Williss ' mountain . From this summit , the philosopher was wont to enjoy that spectacle , among the most sublime of nature 's operations , the looming of distant mountains ; and to watch the motions of the planets , and the greater revolution of the celestial sphere . From this summit , too , the patriot could look down , with uninterrupted vision , upon the wide expanse of the world , for which he considered himself born ; and upward , to the open and vaulted // heavens which seemed to approach , as if to keep him in mind of his high responsibility . It is , indeed , a prospect in which you see and feel , at once , that nothing mean or little could live . It is a scene fit to nourish those great and high-souled principles which formed the elements of his character , and was a most noble and appropriate post , for such a sentinel over the rights and liberties of man . " Approaching the house on the east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this magnificent panorama ; and then passed to the vestibule , where , if he had not been previously informed , he would immediately perceive that he was entering the house of no common man . In the spacious and lofty hall which opens before him , he marks no tawdry and unmeaning ornaments ; but before , on the right , on the left , all around , the eye is struck and gratified with objects of science and taste , so classed and arranged , as to produce their finest effect . On one side specimens of sculpture set out , in such order , as to exhibit , at a coup d'xil , the historical progress of that art ; from the first rude attempts of the aborigines of our country , up to that exquisite and finished bust of the great patriot himself from the master hand of Caracci . On the other side , the visitor sees displayed a vast collection of specimens of Indian art , their paintings , weapons , ornaments , and manufactures ; on another , an array of the fossil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished remains of those colossal monsters that once trod our forests , and are no more ; and a variegated display of the branching honors of those monarchs of the waste ' that still people the wilds of the American continent . " From this hall he was ushered into a noble saloon , from which the glorious landscape of the west again burst upon his view ; and which , within , is hung thick around with the finest productions of the pendll-historical paintings of the most striking subjects from all countries , and all ages ; the portraits of distinguished men and patriots , both of Europe and America , and medallions and engravings in endless profusion . " While the visitor was yet lost in the contemplation of these treasures of the arts and sciences , he was startled by the approach of a strong and sprightly step , and turning with instinctive reverence to the door of entrance , he was met by the tall , and animated , and stately figure of the patriot himself-his countenance beaming with intelligence and benignity , and his outstretched hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courteous welcome of his lips . And then came that charm of manner and conversation that passes all description-so cheerful , so unassuming , so free and easy , and frank , and kind , and gay , that even the young , and overawed and embarrassed visitor , at once forgot his fears , and felt hirpself by the side of an old and familiar friend . There was no effort , no ambition in the conversation of the philosopher . It was as simple and unpretending as nature itself . And while in this easy manner he was pouring out instruction , like light from an inexhaustible solar fountain , he seemed continually to be asking , instead of giving information . The visitor felt himself lifted // by the contact , into a new and nobler region of thought , and became surprised at his own buoyancy and vigor . He could not , indeed , help being astounded , now and then , at those transcendent leaps of the mind , which he saw made without the slightest exertion , and the ease with which this wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of considering among the argumenta crucis of the intellect . And then there seemed to be no end to his knowledge . He was a thorough master of every subject that was touched . From the details of the humblest mechanic art , up to the highest summit of science , he was perfectly at his ease , and everywhere at home . There seemed to be no longer any terra incognita of the human understanding ; for , what the stranger had thought so , he now found reduced to a familiar garden-walk ; and all this carried off so lightly , so playfully , so gracefully , so engagingly , that he won every heart that approached him , as certainly as he astonished every mind . " Mr. Jefferson was in stature tall and erect , and active in his movements . He possessed a taste for some of the polite accomplishments , particularly for music , and in younger life performed occasionally on the violin . He was an elegant scholar , an accomplished linguist , a proficient in several parts of natural science , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years over the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia . While President of the United States , he projected the expedition of Lewis and Clarke across the continent , and much of the success of that well-conducted expedition was due to his counsels . The remarkable parallel which has been traced between the lives of Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams , from their entrance on public life to their departure from this world , makes it proper to record the renewed intercourse of their declining years . Their early friendship and cooperation in the public service , their temporary separation , and subsequent revived intimacy , have been a natural theme of reflection to the numerous eulogists that have celebrated their lives and characters . It has been beautifully observed , " that the streams of their lives were united near their sources , and , joined in one current , had forced their way through mounds of earth , and swept over appalling barriers ; but at length , divided in their course by a rough island of rock , they rushed by its opposing sides with turbulent and emulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , and flowed on , tranquil and majestic , into the ocean of eternity. *** It is gratifying to reflect that , in the most violent periods of // political contention , and while Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams were regarded as the heads of the two great parties in the country , and were rival candidates for the chair of State , the courtesies of private life were not neglected between them . The biographer of Mr. Pitt informs us that , for twenty-four years , that eminent statesman never met Mr. Fox in a private room . On the very eve of the election , in 1800 , Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams were in the exchange of all the offices of social life and good neighborhood . That they may , in moments of excitement , have spoken , in reference to each other , in the character of the leaders of opposite parties , is matter of course . But whatever estrangement at any time existed , it was transitory in its duration ; and a correspondence arose between them in their latter years , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any one thing else those conversations in the Elysium of the Ancients , which the shades of the departed great were supposed to hold . There are the same playful allusions to the points of difference that had divided their parties ; and the same mutual and light and unimpassioned raillery on their own past misconceptions and mistakes ; the same mutual and just admiration and respect for their many virtues and services to mankind . That correspondence was to them both one of the most genial employments of their old age , and it reads a lesson of wisdom on the bitterness of party spirit , by which the wise and good will not fail to profit . " * If any thing were wanting to convince the present generation of the unutterable importance of the American IRevolution , it would be the closing scene of the lives of Jefferson and Adams . Passing over the long succession of great and memorable scenes , with which their after-lives were filled , their minds , in the very moments of dissolution , went back , and dwelt on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th of July , 1826 , Mr. Adams , then evidently near his death , awoke at the ringing of bells , and the firing of cannon . The attendant who watched with him , asked him if he knew what day it was . " Oh ! yes , " he replied ; " it is the glorious Fourth of July . God bless it ; God bless you all . " In the forenoon , the orator of the day , the Rev. Mr. Whitney , the parish minister of Mr. Adams , called to see him , and found him seated in an arm-chair . In the course of the interview , // Mr. Whitney asked him for a sentiment to be given at the public table . He replied : " I will give you , Independence for ever ! " ' After a few moments had elapsed , a lady asked him if he wished to add any thing to the toast . And he said , " Not a syllable . " This occurred an hour or two only before he breathed his last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is a great and a good day . " That his thoughts were dwelling on the scene of 1776 , is evident , from the last words which he uttered , " Jefferson survives , *** which were spoken about the time that Jefferson expired . In like manner , Mr. Jefferson , in. the short intervals of delirium which occurred in his last hours , seemed to dwell exclusively on the events of the Revolution . He talked in broken sentences of the Committee of Safety . One of his exclamations was , " Warn the Committee to be on their guard , " and he instantly rose in his bed , and went through the act of writing a hurried note . But for the greater part of the time , during the last days of his life , he was blessed with the enjoyment of his reason . The only anxious wish he expressed for himself was , that he might live to breathe the air of the Fiftieth Anniversary of Independence . When that day arrived , he was repeatedly heard to murmur his satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing be found that will bear a comparison with the death-bed scene of these two great men ? In a private memorandum found among some obituary papers and relics of Mr. Jefferson , is a suggestion , in case a monument to his memory should ever be proposed , that it should be a granite obelisk , of small dimensions , with the following in-scription : " Here lies buried Thomas Jefferson , author of the Declaration of Independence ; of the Statutes of Virginia for Religious Freedom ; and Father of the University of Virginia . "
