The Usury Laws . October , THE IJSIJRY LAWS . ( Concluded . ) WHY has not an individual , who digs a quantity of gold or silver from the earth , as absolute a right to it as if it were copper or iron l All that is essential to it as money-its value-is his  --  the product of his industry , and he can convey to another all the right to it which he has himself . What right can be more absolute than the right of the miner to the mineral he lawfully obtains from the bowels of the earth l Mr. Whipple will , perhaps , admit his absolute right to the metal in bullion , but claim that , in carrying it to the mint and getting it coined , his right becomes qualified-that he has then no right to prevent the object of its creation* The only kind of creation the government has bestowed upon it , is , the coining of it . The object of this kind of creation is simply to facilitate its minute and accurate apportionment in exchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has no right to pervert . Grant it , and how can he pervert this object l Certainly not by loaning it , at what Mr. Whipple , or any one else , might deem a high rate of interest ; for that has no connection with the facilities for apportioning it . The only conceivable means by which he could pervert this object would be , to reduce the coin again to bullion . This would certainly defeat the object of coining it . It might be shown , if it were necessary , that no motives can exist for defeating the object of coining , but such , and to such extent , as are justifiable upon sound principles of economy . " 4th . That money differs from all merchandise , in the power which is inseparable from it . That this power was conferred upon it by government ,  --  and that it is the right and duty of the government to see that a power , imparted for the general good , shall not be perverted to the injury of the public . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be inseparable from it , and yet be the effect of legislation conferring that power , he does not inform us . The only power which the government can be suspected of having conferred on money , arises from the law of tender-which makes gold and silver the kind in which debts shall be paid , if demanded , by either party ; and this is the very kind in which debts would be paid ,  --  about as uniformly as now ,  --  if there were no law on the subject ; because it is , as a general rule , the kind in which every man wishes to pay , and be paid . Paper money is not a legal tender ; and yet we see no marked difference between the paper and metallic portions of the currency , in respect to the power they possess . The only important power which money possesses , is a purchasing power . This is an inherent power , which " is inseparable from it "  --  but the government has bad no agency in giving it that power  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , in the hands of any one man , is just equal to its exchange value  --  and that value is not the creation of the government at all . Its general purchasing power is equal to its exchange value , multiplied by the rapidity of its circulation . The power , then , of a particular sum of money , is simply to purchase its equivalent in something else , and // that something else has the same power to purchase that sum of money . The same money may go on from hand to hand , exerting its power in repeated acts of exchange . But in respect to any one of these acts , the money has no more power over the thing for which it is exchanged than that thing has over the money-and , consequently , money has no more power in the hands of any one man than an equal value in anything else . Mr. Whipple has a confused apprehension of a real power existing somewhere . That power is nothing more nor less than the power of wealth ,  --  and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the wealth may chance to exist . Human nature is subject to numerous temporal wants which wealth has the power to supply . Money is never an ultimate object of want , but the thing for which the money is exchanged ; and hence the power of wealth to supply human wants resides , primarily , in. the ultimate objects of those wants , rather than in the medium through which those objects are ordinarily exchanged . Whatever influence the possession of those objects may give one man over another , who possesses them not ,  --  it is difficult to conceive how the possessions of the one can operate to the injury of the other . Would any man be better off if his rich neighbor were as poor as himself ? " 5th . That this power is the necessary consequence of the character imposed upon it by government ,  --  money being the only instrument of exchange , and therefore indispensable to the business of all . " Had Mr. Whipple stated , definitely , in what this " character " - which he says the government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to judge for himself of the probable consequences of that character . If he means , as intimated , that its character consists in being a medium of exchange , he is mistaken , as I have shown , in supposing that it has derived it character from the government . On page thirteenth , the author says of money : " It is sent out as an instrument to represent the value of all other articles . * * * It was never intended as an article of trade ,  --  as an article possessing an inherent value of itseig any farther than as a representative , or test of the value of all other articles . " Perhaps by these , and similar assertions , by which he " darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge , " the writer would have us infer this mysterious cbara*tcr which the government has imposed on money . If so , I must insist on an explanation of terms . What does the author mean when he cals money a representative and a test of the value of all other articles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts that money has no value of its own ? I am aware that in speaking of money , the phrases " representative of value , " - " measure of value " - " standard of value "  --  and " no value of itself " are- upon almost every man 's tongue ; but I have never yet found a man who could tell what he meant by them . 1-low can a piece of money represent any value but its own ? How can a piece of money be the test of the value of any other thing ? If we say that the value of a yard of cloth is tested by a dollar when a dollar is given in exchange for it , we may say with equal certainty that the value of a dollar is tested when the yard of cloth is given for it , and the one is as much a test of value as the other  --  but neither is any test at all . The value of each is determined by its utility , cost of production , and the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that the dollar , and the yard of cloth , are supposed to be of equal value . The // idea of representing value by no value , is precisely equivalent to representing something by nothing . If money has value , it represents its own value , and nothing more . If it has no value , it represents none . Probably the unmeaning phrases I have quoted , have originated from the simple fact , that money being constantly exchanged for other things , its relative value is better understood than that of any other article ; and so has become the commodity in which the value of other things is estimated and expressed . Mr. Whipple is further in error , when he says , " that money is the only medium of exchange . " Mr. Leatham , of England , has shown that , from 1832 to 1839 , inclusive , the average amount of bills of exchange in circulation in the kingdom , was ? 107,000,000-while the average circulation of the Bank of England was only ? 3*,000,000 . And the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every civilized country . In addition to this medium of exchange , a large amount of exchanges are effected by barter . I allude to these facts , to show the looseness of the writer 's statements , and not because the question whether money is , or is not , the only medium of exchange , has any bearing upon the rate of interest ,  --  for men do not borrow money to effect an exchange of a commodity on hand , but usually because they have nothing to exchange for the money they need . " 6th . That money being generally in the hands of the few , the facilities for creating an artificial scarcity are greater than for creating an artificial scarcity of merchandise . " It is not true that the money is in the hands of the few-not half as true , as it is of merchandise , or any other item of wealth ; neither is it true , as the author asserts , that money is " concentrative in its nature . " Money , more strictly than any other thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-eminently diffusive in its nature , or it would not be a currency . The average proportion of the possessions of those in moderate circumstances ,  --  which exists in the form of money ,  --  is always greater than that of the wealthy . The reason is this : Money , as such , is unproductive property . He who keeps any portion of it on hand , loses the productive use of so much , value so long as he keeps it in that form ; and hence the law of self4nterest does not allow him to keep more of it by him than his immediate wants require , and the wants of the poorer classes absorb a greater proportion of their income than those of the wealthier classes . The average proportion of each man 's wealth which exists in the form of money , varies with his circumstances and business ,  --  but the same regulating principle everywhere prevails . In the case of each individual , ( except the miser , ) by some law of necessity which operates in his case-this proportion is brought up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the law of self-interest , and there held between these two opposing forces , with a firmness equal to their own inflexibility . In the light of these truths , we may be able to judge of the possibility of an artificial scarcity being produced by capitalists . Suppose they address themselves to the work . In order to produce a scarcity , they must go to buying the currency , and hoarding it up . In order to buy it , they must sell their property . Property bears a price in proportion to the currency in circulation . So soon as they have bought enough to affect the currency at all , the effect tells upon the price of the property which they must still sell , and they must sell at a reduced price . If they attempt to buy more , they must buy at // a sacrifice . If they keep what they have , they lose its productive use ; and if they put it in the market , the scarcity ceases . Pursue the scheme as far as they may , or stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom-never to repeat the experiment . The only possible way in which an artificial scarcity of money can be produced , is , by the expansion and contraction of bank issues ,  --  and seasons of scarcity thus produced , the Usury Laws have not prevented . We are now prepared for the consideration of Mr. Whipple 's second question , to wit " Do the parties in general meet on equal terms , and are the bargains , in the absence of the Usury Laws , as fair as bargains usually are in relation to merchandise ? " The author takes the negative upon both branches of the question . One of the supposable grounds of argument considered by Mr. Bentham , was : " Protection of indigence against extortion . " Mr. Whipple regarded this as one of the " cob-houses " of Mr. Bentham 's imagination , and admitted that he had demolished it . Mr. Whipple 's second question is but a reconstruction of this same " cob-house , "  --  and should it be disposed of as summarily as he has disposed of Mr. Bentham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further reflection , the author seems to have concluded that the protection of the needy against extortion , is , after all , one of the main objects and uses of the Usury Laws ; and he proceeds to defend them upon that ground . The author lays down his premises in the form of interrogatories , which he seems to suppose do not admit of negative answers ; and some of them will be quoted , and such answers given , as may appear consistent with truth . " They ( the Usury Laws , ) proceed upon the principle , that money possesses a power which no other article ever did , or ever can possess . Is not that true , in point of fact ? " If this assertion be true , then they proceed upon a false principle ,  --  fo r money , as has been shown , possesses no such power . " That the avarice of the lender will urge him on to exact all he can get . Is not that true , in point of fact ? " It is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . People commonly get all they can for whatever they have to dispose of ; and , as a general rule , it is right that they should . " That the wants of the lender are in general so great , that in nine times out of ten he must have the money , at all events . Is not that true , in point of fact ? " It is true , all but the nine . About nine times out of ten there is no such necessity in the case . " That the parties do not stand on equal ground , any more than a prisoner contracting with his creditor l Is not that true ? " Not at all . They stand upon much the same ground as they would in any other credit transaction . " That in dealing for all other articles , men do stand on equal grounds . That no man can deny . " I deny it . A man whose credit is good , can purchase articles upon credit on better terms than one whose credit is poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper than either of the others ; and a man will loan money just as readily as he will sell goods on credit ,  --  with the same // security ,  --  provided he can make as much net profit by it ; for his goods cost him money , and his only object in buying and selling is , to get gain . " The advocates of the free-trade system ( says Mr. Whipple , ) must be driven to take their ground . They must admit that the borrower is , in general , a slave to the lender , and under a necessity of complying with the terms dictated , and still contend that the law ought to permit such a bargain to stand , or they must deny the fact . I give them their choice . They must take one or the other . " With Mr. Whipple 's leave , I will take both . Sometimes the necessities of the borrower are such as to urge him to give an exorbitant rate of interest , and sometimes they are not . Sometimes the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take advantage of this necessity , and sometimes it is not . Borrowers , then , may be divided into two classes ; - first , those who borrow to secure gain , and second , those who borrow to avoid loss . And in discussing the bearings of the Usury Laws upon individual borrowers , I propose I. To consider them with reference to the first class . II . To examine the causes which enable the lender to take advantage of the necessities of the second class . III . To inquire whether , even if the causes which enable the lender to take advantage of those necessities can not be wholly avoided , the restriction contended for , can afford either protection or relief , under those circumstances . I. In respect to the first class , whatever may be its comparative numbers , it must be admitted that there is no necessity pressing upon them to induce them to pay a greater rate of interest than they can afford , or think they can afford to pay . Their object being simply gain , their necessities must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for increasing their gains ; and when the rate of interest is so high as to defeat this object , the motive for borrowing is removed ; and so long as the rate is below the neutralizing point , however high that may be , no harm can result to the borrower . I assume , that this class is much more numerous than the other , and absorbs by far the greater proportion of loans ; and to sustain this assumption , the nature of the case affords no other means than to appeal to every man 's experience and observation in business affairs . Almost every man in the community is , to some extent , a borrower , not excepting the lenders themselves ,  --  and to say that every man who borrows money is in circumstances of distress , would be to assert that which but few would be willing to believe concerning their neighbors generally . Capital and labor are co-agents in- the production of wealth , and neither can accomplish much without the other . Wealthy persons , in many instances , wish to pui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their property . They have the capital , but do not wish to put forth the industry necessary to make it productive , but prefer to connect it ,  --  in some way ,  --  - with the industry of others ; and here originates the chief supply of loans . Others again , have the industry and business talent , but have not the capital to make that industry and talent productive to the full extent of their joint capacity ; and here originates the chief demand for loans . In all such cases the rate of interest will be limited by the motive which prompts the demand . // If Mr. Whipple claims that this class of borrowers are liable to be deceived in regard to the rate of interest they can afford to pay , and that they need the Usury Laws to repress their temerity , or to guard their simplicity ,  --  he will be found re-building another of Mr. Bentham 's cob-houses . " That persons may err as to the rate of interest they can afford to pay in particular cases , is undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , than in respect to any other business transaction . In some cases the borrower can better afford to pay ten or fifteen , or even twenty-five per cent. , than in others to pay six or seven per cent . ; - and the borrower is just as likely to err in one case as another . It often happens that one man is ruined by paying seven per cent . for money , while another pays ten or twelve per cent . and gets rich . The rate of interest which the borrower can afford to pay , depends upon the net profit which can be realized from the capital at the particular time and place , and under the peculiar circumstances which may exist , as well as the talent with which the capital may be managed . The only question seems to be , whether the government , or the individual , is best qualified to determine what is for his interest in each particular case . Mr. Bentham 's remark upon this point is as just as it is caustic . He says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that no simplicity short of absolute idiotism can cause the individual to make a more ground less judgment than the legislature . " To say nothing of the bungling attempts of legislation at a general supervision of business affairs , it will suffice to remark that , for the legislature to graduate the rates of interest to the endless variations of net profits , is clearly impossible . Among the effects of fixing a uniform rate of interest , so far as it falls below what the borrower can afford to pay , are the following 1st . It cuts off supplies from the loan market . Before any one can retire from business and live upon the net income of his capital , he must accumulate such an amount that the net income will supply all his wants . If the borrower can afford to pay a higher rate of interest , it will enable capitalists to retire with smaller fortunes , and put their capital in the loan market earlier than they otherwise could . By the restriction , the industry of the borrower is crippled for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for the interference of the law ; and he is compelled to remain poor until his rich neighbor shall have become richer . 2d . The restriction tends to prevent the diffusion , and to promote the concentration of wealth . This proposition has been partially established , from what has been remarked upon the - preceding one . So essential is the use of capital to the production of wealth , that without it no man ever did , or ever can , become very wealthy . Ask the wealthy men of our country how they acquired their wealth , and four-fifths of them will tell us that they started with borrowed capital ,  - -  and , that , without it , they must have remained comparatively poor . And where Usury Laws have existed and been enforced , they have not usually obtained the use of capital in the form of money at the legal rates , but in the form of credits of various kinds , and upon which they have paid much more in the form of extra profits to their creditors than the legal rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest // on the debt besides . Every man engaged in mercantile pursuits knows , that when he goes to an Eastern city to buy goods , he can buy from five to fifteen per cent . lower for cash than he can upon a credit of six months . One of the oldest and most successful business men in Wisconsin-who never had a note protested in his life-informed me that he could purchase a stock . of goods in New-York ten per cent . cheaper for cash than he could on six month 's time with his credit , and that the very lowest average difference between cash payments and six months credit was eight per cent. ; and the statement has been corroborated by every business man with whom I have conversed on the subject . This is equivalent to paying sixteen per cent . per annum for money , to the extent of all the mercantile credits in the land . Yet men pay this per cent . for the use of others ' capital in the form of credits , and become wealthy by it , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other pursuits , this method of obtaining the use of capital is not available . From the nature of the case , the loan must be made in money , or not at all ; and , while but for the restriction , a credit could be obtained upon money as readily as upon merchandise , and with the same beneficial results-impertinent legislation steps in , and prevents the loan , by limiting the interest to a per cent . which destroys the motive for furnishing the supply . The enterprise may be quite feasible , and the borrower may be well qualified to conduct it , and it may promise a rich reward ; but the loving-kindness of the legislature will not allow him to obtain the necessary capital , for fear he may ruin himself , or the capitalist get more than his share of the profits ; and he must plod along in his poverty , while the capital which might have led him on to a fortune , is doomed , by force of law , to remain half employed , and slowly to accumulate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much veneration for facts , I have a mind to refer him to a few . I know of many men in Wisconsin , now worth their thousands , who would this day have been penniless , had they not been able , twelve or fifteen years ago , to borrow money at twenty-five per cent . When the eastern portion of Wisconsin came into market , it was extensively settled by " squatters , " who had not the means to pay for their lands . Fortunately for them , the sales were attended by heavy capitalists , who offered to buy the claims of these poor people , and give them bonds for deeds , upon the payment of double the amount , in from two to four years . This method was adopted to avoid the Usury Laws , then in force in the Territory . A large portion of the sales were made with this arrangement , between the purchaser and the occupant . Many predicted , that at the end of the terms specified , these poor settlers would be robbed of their improvements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet their engagements , but even these were able to " sell their shares " for enough to make a fair beginning elsewhere . The majority of them paid up , and received their deeds ; and many of those same tracts of land are now worth , even in their wild state , from fifty to eighty dollars per acre . Similar rates of interest were paid , either directly or indirectly , to secure investments in city and village property , ( subsequent to the period of speculation , ) and with similar results . As settlements progressed over the Territory , the same operations were repeated over and over again , and with the same results . From twenty to fifty per cent . has usually been paid to secure government // lands and town lots ; and hundreds , nay , thousands , have improved their condition by it , and very many have risen from poverty to affluence ; and , in some instances , have got their heads quite above those whose capital they employed . Abiding all these transactions , until quite recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their majesty , but exerting no more influence upon the rate of loans than the croakings of a prairie-cock . Sometimes a little pains has been taken to evade them , and sometimes not ; and even the seeming evasions have bcen resorted to more for the purpose of securing a shorter method of collection than for any other purpose . There have been instances , without number , in which notes have been given at thirty per cent . or more , and faithfully paid up . Whcther the " Badgers " are more shrewd than common pcople , it is not for me to say ; but they usually find no difficulty in discriminating between cases which will justify their paying a higher rate of interest and those which will not ; and I can not but believe , that other people would very soon become equally wise , if they were left to exercise their own wits in the premises . Although they often pay twelve or fifteen per cent. , yet they seldom go as high as twenty-five or thirty , in carrying on their ordinary business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agree with the theory , that freedom in respect to rates of interest tend to the diffusion of wealth , while restrictions have the opposite tendency . It might be demonstrated that the restriction in question retards the general increase of wealth , by preventing the free circulation of capital through those channels in which it would be most productive ; but I must be content with a bare statement of this important truth . II . To take more interest in extreme cases of necessity than would be required under other circumstances , is not to take advantage of such necessity ; for extreme necessity is usually the effect of the embarrassed state of the individual 's pecuniary affairs , and an additional risk is to be incurred . Even if the security is the same , and the applicant 's honesty above suspicion , still there is an additional risk of the trouble and expense of a suit , or a foreclosure ; and to charge an additional sum sufficient to cov*r the additional risk , is no extortion , but just what is demanded in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in any kind of business which is attended with extraordinary risk . The risk may be the borrower 's misfortune , but it is not the lender 's fault . Generosity may prompt a disregard of it , but justice can not demand it . To go beyond the demands of this additional risk , is extortion . But the borrower 's necessity , however pressing it may be , is not the only circumstance , nor the chief one , which enables the lender to practice extortion upon him . A nia*n may be greatly in need of a barrel of flour , and if the quantity in market is small , or in the hands of two or three individvl4ls , they may easily practice extortion upon the consumer , however rich he may be . But if the market is flush , and the article in the hands of many dealers , such extortion would be impossible , however poor the customer might be ; for , although he might be obliged to purchase on credit , and consequently to pay more than the cash price , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional price as the credit and risk might be worth . We see then , that in order to the practice of extortion in the provision market , there must be an urgent demand on the one hand , and on the other a scarcity and monopoly of the thing demanded ; and that , whatever tends to produce a scarcity in the market , facilitates monopoly , and enables the monopolist to practice // extortion . Just so it is in the loan market . Whatever tends to produce a scarcity there , facilitates a monopoly of the market , and enables the money lender to practice extortion upon those whose necessities compel them to submit to it . We have seen , that so far as the Usury Laws attempt to confine the rate of interest to a point below the net profit on capital , under circumstances similar to those under which the loans are demanded , just so far the law is either disregarded , or capital leaves the loan market for a more profitable field of investment . The consequence is , that the extremely necessitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan market , would be obliged to pay more than the ordinary rate of interest , are left to shirk in a lean market , and drive such bargains as they can with the few who are willing to violate an absurd law , if they can be paid for this risk also . On the other hand , if perfect freedom were enjoyed , there is no reason within the compass of thought , why money could not be obtained upon credit , as readily as anything else , upon the same terms . It is idle for Mr. Whipple to repeat his assertion , that " it was never before pretended that Usury Laws lessened the quantity of money , or prevented any one from borrowing . " True , they do not lessen the quantity of money in circulation , but as certainly as that there is any power in the motives which govern mankind , so certain it is that they lessen the quantity of money in the loan market , and diminish the chances for borrowing . As has already been remarked , it is capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands of the loan market , at the natural rate of interest . Capital can assume the form of money as readily as it can assume the form of merchandise . In all cases in which the net profit is the object of the capitalist , the motive which induces him to prefer an investment in productive property , by placing it in the loan market , ( the security , &amp;c. , being the same ) is , the difference in the profits to be derived from the two sources . Destroy this difference , and we take away the motive which determines the choice . Let the rates of interest rise a little above other profits , and the motive will instantly preponderate in favor of the loan market until the equilibrium is restored . Remove all restrictions in regard to rates of interest , and in the language of Mr. Mill , they will be such , " that exactly as much as some people are inclined to borrow at those rates , others shall be willing to lend . " Usury Laws , so far as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destroy the equation of supply and demand ,  --  produce a scarcity in the loan market by cutting off supplies , and thus facilitate monopoly and extortion . Mr. Whipple may discard these principles as mere theories , but they are as certain in operation as any law , either of mind or matter . I do not wish to conceal in resuect the fact , that with the utmost freedom to money bargains , the lender may have occasions presented to him for practicing extortion , by the operation of temporary causes which can not be avoided , just as is the ease in all the departments of trade ; and this leads me to inquire , III . Whether the Usury Laws can afford either protection or relief to the borrower , under those circumstances ? The advocates of the restrictive system lay great stress upon the necessities of the borrower . Mr. Whipple says , " that the wants of the borrower are , in general , so great , that in nine times out of ten he must have the money ,  --  at all events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ruined . " This is not true in more than one case in ten , even in respect to the second class of borrowers . They wish to borrow , sometimes to avoid a sacrifice of credit . and sometimes to avoid // 337 a sacrifice of property ; and in all cases , the urgency of their wants is limited by the extent of the sacrifice of credit or property , which must ensue , if they fail of obtaining the desirtA loan . The lender can take advantage of no greater necessity than exists . To say that any and every degree of sacrifice must involve the individual in ruin , is an extravagance which should not be indulged in bya man who depends so much upon mere assertion to establish his points , as does Mr. Whipple . The extent of the loss to be avoided , varies , as every man knows , from a small per cent . of the individual 's estate , to the whole of it . But , whatever may be the extent of the impending loss , the principle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficacy of Usury Laws in alleviating the distress , we will take Mr. Whipple 's extreme ease-one in which the man must have the money at all events , or he is ruined . It is admitted that the elements of ruin are already about him in consequence of his own follies or misfortunes . There is but one possible means of extricating himself from his embarrassments , and that is to borrow money . Will the Usury Laws enable him to obtain the money " at all events ? " Not at all ; hut exactly the contrary . The avowed object of those laws is , to keep down the rate of interest below the common level of profits . This , as we have seen , has a contracting influence upon the loan market , and increases the difficulties of obtaining loans under any circumstances . his circumstances are such , that the lender must incur an extraordinary risk , and for this the Usury Laws make no allowance . There are but three courses for the lender to pursue . First , to lend at the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take more ; or third , to send the applicant away empty . The first he will not do , for he can find plenty of safer customers . If he adopts the second course , the Usury Laws fail of their object ; and if the third , the man is ruined " at all events ; " but as the money lender has had no agency in the matter , nobody cares . In the absence of any restriction , this man might have found some one willing to risk his capital upon his precarious circumstances , for an adequate , or something more than an adequate compensation for the risk ; and though the rate of interest might have been beyond what was morally justifiable under the circumstances , yet he might have paid it , and saved his estate from the total ruin which must have come upon it under the restrictive system . Twenty-five or thirty per cent . seems like a high rate of interest , and so it is , in ordinary cases ; but what is it compared with the forced sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The collection laws not only allow a man , hut will compel him to sell his property at a sacrifice of fifty or seventy-five per cent. , while the Usury Laws will not allow him to make the tenth part of that sacrifice in the form of interest , to save the other nine-tenths ! - But suppose this last resort of the sinking man fails of recovering him from embarrassment-he is no more than ruined , and ruined he would have been if he had not borrowed at all . Although he meets his ruin in the hands of the lender instead of the hands of his original creditors , yet it is not the loan which has caused his failure , but the embarrassments which made the loan necessary . The cases alluded to in the letter of Judge Wick , published in the introductory pages of the pamphlet under review , were undoubtedly of this latter class . By a little attention to dates , it will be seen that the period alluded to by Judge Wick , was that which immediately succeeded voi*. xxvii. - No. iv . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the same wreck of fortunes was witnessed in every state and territory of the Union . Multitudes , not only in Indiana , but throughout the republic , had , under the influence of the speculating mania of that memorable period , become hopelessly involved in debt . The absence of Usury Laws in Indiana enabled this class of persons , in that state , to avail themselves of this last resort to retrieve their circumstances . Some borrowed at high rates to buy real estate , and some to pay for what they had already bought at the insane prices then paid ; and in either case , it was the principal and not the interest which ruined them ,  --  and they would have been about as effectually ruined if they could have borrowed without interest . In Indiana , the destruction previously contracted came upon them in the form of notes , bonds and mortgages , for borrowed money ; while in other states , it came upon them with equally desolating force , in the form of similar securities given for real estate . At that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and facts every way similar to those related by Judge Wick , were common in each of them ; and , if worth anything to the argument , they are about ten times as conclusive against Usury Laws , as they are in favor of them ; but as those facts had their origin in causes entirely remote from those laws , they authorize no conclusion whatever respecting them . A man 's circumstances become embarrassed-so much so , that he must borrow money at such rates as his circumstances will compel him to pay , or he must fail . This is the only avenue by which he can possibly escape ruin . But because some have fallen and perished in this avenue , legislative wisdom must needs step in and close it up , determining that , perish where else he may , he shall not perish there . Such appears to be the precise philosophy of the Usury Laws , in their bearing upon cases of extreme necessity . To the mass of men who are not engaged hr extensive business operations , a failure to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attended with no very serious consequences to the little credit they possess . But , to men extensively engaged in mercantile pursuits , the case is far otherwise . The preservation of their credit is of the utmost importance to them ; and in order to preserve it untarnished , they sometimes must make extraordinary drafts upon the loan market , and at times when money lenders can not supply all their wants without endangering their own credit , to say nothing of the additional risk indicated by the extraordinary demand , more than the ordinary rate of interest must be paid , or the risk will not be incurred . The merchant may smart , for a time , under an exaction of two or three per cent , a month , but he regards this as nothing compared with the loss of his credit . The free principle has proved so essential , and restrictions so futile , in commercial intercourse , that in England , and to a great extent in this country , mercantile paper has been exempted from the operation of Usury Laws . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it be really a dangerous one * I can think of no reason for the distinction , except that this class of persons are supposed to know better what is for their interest , in particular emergencies , than the legislature , while others do not . In all cases of borrowing to avoid loss , an impending loss is supposed , which can only be averted by a loan . Now , suppose the loan itself can not be effected without a severe sacrifice , but with the freedom to make that sacrifice , it can be obtained . Then the worst feature of the free principle is , that it leaves the borrower the choice // between two losses ,  --  both of which can not be avoided ; and the best that the Usury Laws can do for him is , to deprive him of that choice , and leave him to suffer the threatened loss , whatever it may be . In the most extreme case of necessity , therefore , the borrower being most exposed to extortion , the question is simply this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two evils of paying an exorbitant rate of interest , for a time , or submitting to the more permanent sacrifices of a forced sale , or a ruined credit ? What we are accustomed to call common sense , I understand to be that degree of judgment and discretion which mankind in general possess . Those who are most familiar with the developments of legislative wisdom , will agree that a fair average of common sense is the utmost that can be predicated of legislative bodies generally ; and hence , with the same means of information respecting the peculiar circumstances of each particular case , the chances between the legislature and the individual , for forming a correct judgment , would be about equal . But when we consider that the data upon which alone a correct judgment can be founded , are all with the individual-that he knows the nature and extent of his necessity-can estimate the impending loss , and compare it with the terms upon which it can be averted , and strike the balance-that he knows what resources he has in prospect with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to become matured , and how much he can save if he can anticipate them by a few weeks or months ; and that these are matters of which the legislature knows absolutely nothing . I say , when we consider all these facts , we can not but agree with Mr. Bentham , that " no simplicity short of absolute idiotism , can cause the individual to make a more groundless judgment than the legislature ; " and that whenever the capacity of the individual , to judge in the matter , falls below that of the legislature , he should be provided with a private guardian , or a place in a lunatic asylum . The objections to the Usury Laws may be summed up as follows 1st . The only criterion by which the equitable rate of interest can be determined , is , the net profit on the capital otherwise employed . 2d . This net profit is different at different times , at different places , and under different circumstances ; and that the equitable rate of interest must be as variable as the criterion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of Usury Laws , there is no danger that the rates of interest will permanently rise above nett profits , because the avidity with which capital seeks the most profitable employment , will keep down the . rates to those points . 4th . The only effect Usury Laws can have upon the rates of interest. * is , to reduce them below equitable rates . 5th . The effect of confining the rates of interestbelow the rates of net pro* fits on capital otherwise invested , is to exclude capital from the loan market . 6th . The consequence of thus excluding capital from the loan market , in its bearing upon those who borrow to secure gain , is , to deprive them of the means to make their industry as productive as it might otherwise be . 7th . It retards the general increase of wealth , by forcing capital away from those channels in which it would be most productive . 8th . Usury Laws deprive those who wish to borrow to avoid loss , of the privilege of choosing between the two evils , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better qualified to choose for himself than the legislature is to choose for him .
