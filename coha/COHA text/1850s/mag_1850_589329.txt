txt MILITARY PRESIDENTS . MILITARY glory has ever been the idol of mankind ; the subject on which poetry , tradition , and history have most delighted to dwell . Like beauty in women , it hides a multitude of faults , and attracts by an irresistible fascination . Nor is it without reason that successful warriors are objects of such general admiration ; for the man who has shown himself capable of defending or vindicating the rights and honor of his country in time of danger , possesses the highest claim to its confidence and gratitude . Success in war , though it may sometimes be the result of accident or good fortune in a single instance , yet if uniform , and long continued , furnishes decided evidence of courage and capacity , at least in military affairs ; and when earned in a righteous cause , merits the highest distinction among men . But it does not follow that a man who has gained a victory , or a succession of victories , is for that reason qualified to govern the country he has defended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from those of a military commander , and require different qualifications . Military laws and regulations are in direct contrast to the civil rights of free citizens ; and that principle of complete *ubordination which lies at the root of the one , is totally incompatible with that freedom of action and political equality which constitute the basis of the other . The President of the United States , although the nominal Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy , is not expected to take the field , or go on a cruise to the distant regions of the earth ; for he can not do so without deserting his most important duties as a civil magistrate , and virtually abdicating his authority at home for the purpose of exercising it abroad , it is not , therefore , his military skill , or capacity for leading armies , but his civil courage , his qualifications as a statesman , and his experience in political affairs , that are brought into requisition when placed in a position to give tone and character to the government .

Washington was a military man , but not exclusively so . Those who have read his letters to the old Revolutionary Congress , Governors of States , * and distinguished contemporaries , during the *trogress of the great struggle for liberty , will at once perceive that he was a statesman as well as a soldier ; that his counsel and suggestions influenced almost every act and measure of Congress , and that his wisdom in the cabinet was equal to his valor and conduct in the field . Through a period of eight years of intestine war , he was at school , learning the art of government ; and almost his first action after laying down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution of the United States . Here , surrounded by statesmen , sages , and philosophers , he listened to discussions involving the great fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty , the rights of states , and of citizens , and the entire circle of political science.t He came therefore into the Presidency deeply inbued with a thorough comprehension of its duties , and a clear perception of the great landmarks which were to direct him in the exercise of his high functions as chief executive officer of the United States . He had the chart before him , and steered the ship accordingly ; with what success , it is unnecessary to state . The history of the country is his best eulogium , and the admiration of the world his everlasting monument . General Jackson is also principally known to the world as a military man . But he , too , like Washington , had been schooled in civil life , before he undertook to direct the affairs of his country . He had sat on the bench ; in Congress ; and at two different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature age , in the Senate of the United States . He was a judge and a legislator , as well as a soldier , and did not spring at one hound from the camp to the cabinet . But even had not this been the case , Andrew Jackson was an extraordinary man ; such a man as we see but once in an age , and sometimes in many ages . We never saw Washington7 and it has always been a subject of deep regret that we could not embody from memory , the form and features of one of the noblest beings tha2 ever trod the earth . But we knew Andrew Jackson , from having been domesticated with him at Washington , during the winter immediately succeeding the war of 1814 ; and especially from sharing his hospitality for some weeks , at the Hermitage , about two years before he became immortal in both worlds . He was indeed an extraordinary man ; the only man we ever saw that excited our admiration to the pitch of wonder . At the period in which we visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great physical debility ; but his intellect was as clear and bright as ever . He was but the shadow of a man , and it seemed that the only principle of vitality by which he was supported , was the vigor of his mind .

It was not the studied politeness of conventional habits , but the courtesy of the heart ; and his deportment towards his family , his guests , and his slaves , was that of a patriarch of old , presiding over his flocks , his herds , and his dependents . At this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he ate less than an infant . His long table was almost every day crowded by visitors from different quarters , who came from far and near to see him ; and though he sat down with them , and shared in the gay freedom of the hospitable board , he never tasted anything but a little rice and milk . We can not better indicate the character of his intellect , than by saying he was a man to whom knowledge seemed entirely unnecessary . He saw intuitively into everything , arid though he seemed never to take aim deliberately , was always sure to hit the mark . lIe had a short cut , by which he reached a conclusion while others were beating the bush for their game . His reasoning was impulse , and his impulses inspiration . His genius and his courage were his guides . One pointed out the path ; the other prompted him in the pursuit .

His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune , though she often does us a single good turn , soon becomes tired of tagging at the heels of imbecility and folly .

He began his public career in Tennessee , where the men are all brave , and the women handsome ; and was one of the early settlers at a period when ,  --  as an old lady , who came up with the first party to Nashville , once told us- " there was neither law or gospel . " In such a state of things , personal qualities give the law , and courage assumes its proper rank as the first , because it is the great conservative of all the other virtues , which never are to be depended upon in any man who may be frightened out of them . Here he soon *ained that ascendency over the wild spirits he had to cope with , which he ever after maintained in his intercourse with his fellow men . Many anecdotes are told in Nashville of his quick decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbear to give them in this brief sketch . It is sufficient to say that he became the master spirit among men who had no other master . There was nothing on earth he despised so much as cowardice , and his highest eulogium on his favorite , General Coffee , whose fine portrait hung up in the sitting-room , was , " Sir , he was as brave a man as ever lived . " *Then he returned home from the battle of New Orleans , it was to inhabit a 1%-house , which was still standing at the time of oUr visit , md occupied by two or three superannuated slaves , one of whom had been Mrs. Jackson 's nurse .

" // Of General Harrison it is unnecessary to speak , as he died before his acts could give character to his administration . The fourth military President is the gentleman who now occupies that high and unique station . We have , heretofore , spoken of the illustrious dead , and shall now speak of the illustrious living , we trust , with equal justice , though not with equal praise . As to General Taylor 's military talents , we accord with the sentiment of the people who elected him ; although we can not help expressing an opinion , that there is a certain cotemporary of his , who has equalled the first conqueror of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in clemency and generosity , who , if military exploits in two wars are to be the tests , might well dispute the palm with the hero of Buena Vista . In saying this , we neither wish to elevate one , or undermine the other . Both well deserve the gratitude of their country ; both were followed by armies of heroes , and both were worthy to lead them . But General Taylor , though crowned with well-earned laurels , we fear , is neither a Washington , nor a Jackson . His whole life has been a se* ries of military services , ending in a blaze of glory . He is , according to his own frank and honest declarations , utterly unskilled in matters of state , and divested of all experience in civil affairs . Far be it from us to object to any man being President of the United States , because he is not a hackneyed politician , initiated into all the mysteries of party squabbles and personal rivalries , from which men but too often learn nothing but paltry tricks and stratagems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still we can not help thinking a man should know something besides marshalling a squadron in the field , before he aspires to the Presidency of the most powerful republic in the world . It is not every general who has gained a victory , or a series of victories , that is worthy of such exalted honors , or capable of sustaining such stupendous duties . If he is not one of nature 's most chosen productions , either selfmade or self-taught , he should be matured by study and reflection , and above all , experience in preparatory stations , to supply the absence of genius or innate capacity , else there may be great danger that the laurels reaped in the field will be withered in the cabinet . Is General Taylor thus qualified by nature , or by study and experience ? We are compelled to shake our heads and doubt , if not decide . It may be urged in reply to this , that the President has as yet done nothing by which his capacity for the duties of his high station could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is from the very fact of his having done nothing but look on , that we are ol ) liged to doubt his capacity to do anything else . He has been in office more than a year , during a great portion of which the country has been almost convulsed by internal sectional struggles , and when if ever , the direct and vigorous exercise of all the Executive wisdom and influence in allaying it was not.only justifiable but obligatory on him ,  --  and what has he done ? If he has not fed the fire , or blown the coals of dissension , he has stood looking on as an idle spectator . So far from doing any thing good , bad or indifferent , it is universally understood that he has voluntarily divested himself of all power of action , by abdicating his authority to those who it would appear are afraid or ashamed of the responsibility of its exercise in any thing but removing officers , and settling old accounts . Nothing but an innate consciousness of incurable incompetency can // 485 justify a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administer the laws of the land , arid direct the foreign policy of their government , in thus throwing down his arms and surrendering at discretion to his ministers . A man so brave in the field as General Taylor , should not exhibit such a cowardly will in the cabinet . The people require , and have a right to require something from their Chief Magistrate , a little beyond the incarnation of King Log of the Fable . They bestowed certain powers on him and him alone ; and for the exercise of these they expect him to be responsible . They do n't want to be governed at second hand , and look to subordinates for what should be done by the principal or at least by his direction . There is a little too much of Royalty in this to be relished by Republicans . It may do very well for a King by divine or liereditary right to shield himself from all responsibility for his acts of folly , caprice , or oppression , by throwing it on his ministers , and thus securing himself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do here . The President of the United States must stand before the people at full length , in his own proper person , and be judged like other men by his own acts , and not lag behind his corporals in the day of battle . There can not be a more anti-republican policy than this , or one more directly calculated to undermine and destroy the force of public sentiment , when brought to bear on the acts and policy of the administration . The public disapprobation , if thus excited , must concentrate itself not on the principal offender , but his mere instruments , who thus become the scapegoats of him , by whom they are chosen and changed at pleasure . In this way a President virtually evades all personal responsibility for his measures , by laying the blame on his ministers for an unpopular act , and exemnplifies the doctrine of legitimacy , that " the King can do no wrong , " because of himself he does nothing . Justice to a brave , and we fully believe an upright man , compels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of policy the President has deceived nobody , and violated no pledges . When invited to become a candidate for the Presidency , he frankly acknowledged his incapacity and entire want of experience in civil affairs ; and if the people who elected him , did not take him at his word , it is their fault , riot his . He gave them faii warnincr that they must take him for better for worse , He intimated to them pretty distinctly that they must make choice of two alternatives , namely either of being governed by a man without a particle of the knowledge and experience necessary to the task , or by deputies , for the wise and discreet selection of whom , this same want of knowledge arid experience in a great measure disqualified him . We are far from blaming the President for adopting this latter course . Necessity has no law ; and what a man can not do for himself , he must either leave undone , or get others to do for him . We , however , take leave respectfully to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fully justified in aspiring to a station , for which , according to his own acknowledgment , he was so eminently disqualified , He should have rested under the shade of his laurels , and been content to pass onward to future generations , as a gallant , successful warrior , rather than an incompetent statesman . There is great wisdom in knowing where to stop , . and when to retire ; and history is filled with examples of men who broke their necks by walking over a precipice for want of this savin* discretion . Nor have the people of the United States a right to accuse the Presi. // 4*36 Military Presidents . dent of violating his pledges-except perhaps in one instance , which will be hereafter discussed  --  or acting inconsistently with his declaration of principles , for he made none . He simply announced himself a " moderate federalist , " which may mean one of three things-either that a man is moderate in his principles ; or that he acts upon them with moderation ; or that in the indulgence of the utmost extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The President has certainly not violated his pledge in either of these ways . His ministers may indeed have done so , but they , it seems , are entirely independent of his authority , and not responsible to him for its exercise . For himself , he does nothing ; he has done nothing ; and it seems he means to do nothing . He has borrowed a leaf from the Book of Kings , arid is content with being a mere drawing-room pageant , enjoying all the honors and emoluments of power , without any of its labors , vexations , disappointments and responsibilities . This is doubtless a pleasant position . Nero fiddled while Rome was burning ; and the President may laugh and grow fat in his easy chair , . while the republic i.s rocking with earthquakes . If it should chance to be swallowed up , or riven to atoms , it is nothing to him ; he has washed his hands of the dirty business of governing , and you must look to the agents , not to the principal . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pity to disturb him . And who has a better right to a comfortable nap . than the President ? He told the people honestly , that he was incapable of steering the ship ; he has chosen his pilots , and if they run her on the rocks , the underwriters are responsible . This dignified repose amid the fury of the storm , this total abstraction from all agency in counteracting , . and all participation in its consequences , is the perfection of Presidential philosophy . It comprises the great secret of separatiiig the bitter from the sweet ; the grain from the chaff ; the rose from the thorn ; and is doubtless the su'nmum bonum which so completely confounded all ancient sages . But much as we may admire , we can not quite fully approve of this dignIfied abstraction from the exercise of all constitutional functions , and this abstinence fromn all declarations of principles accompanied by pled5es to act in accord ance with them . It is contrary to the spirit of republicanism , and in direct contravention of the jeat principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its destroys all accountability of the representative to his constituents . Of what value is the In privilege of choosing a ruler , if it is to be done unsight , unseen ? other words , if we are to choose him without knowiub what are his opinions on certain great fundamental doctrines , and certain leading measures , which constitute the line of division between conflicting parties , and without receiving his pledge to act up to them ? The people might just as well trust to the accident of birth , and resort at*once to the principle of hereditary succession , instead of suffering themselves to be eternally tossed on the sea of political strife-amid for what * Merely to choose a ruler , of whose principles they are entirely ibnorant , and who may for aught they know , act on all occasions in direct opposition to their wishes . A free people before they exercise their sovereign prerogative of choosing a Presid eat , ought to know , and have a right to know who and what he is . They do n't choose a pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the color of his bristles . // This was most especially necessary with respect to the present Chief Magistrate , who had been all his life a soldier , and a gallant soldier *o , and had never been before the people as a candidate for their suffia4es . As a statesman they knew no more of him than they did of the mostobscure man in the nation . He came before them in this instance a per fect stranger ; for though as a soldier every man knew him by heart , as a statesmttn he was utterly unknown . It was their business to become ac*uainted with him ; to hear from himself , from his own mouth , or under his own hand , on what principles he would administer the government , if they placed him at its head . But they contented themselves with vague declarations signifying nothing , and did not even ask any pledge that they should be fulfilled . They admitted him into communion without any confession of faith ; they placed the reins iii his hands without any directions as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his capacity as a driver ; and if he plunges them into a ditch , or whirls them over a precipice , they have no right to complain . If they find they have been worshiping an idol , they can not deny that it is one of their own raising . There is , however , one pledge the President certainly did make , and which he is accused of having violated . He most assuredly did state in so many words in a letter under his own hand , that he would make no rernovals from office except for unfaithfulness , incapacity , or active political opposition . We have not the letter before us , but this it is believed is the substance of the pledge . The intention in making it was doubtless to disarm and neutralize the opposition of all those who had been appointed to office by his predecessor , and it undoubtedly had that effect , if not in all , in a great many cases . But such a pledge , however efficacious in the first instance , is sure eventually to involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if carried out in its spirit , it becomes necessary to bring every official to trial , and just to allow him the means of defence before condemnation . Who is to do this ? The accuser is the judge in this case , arid the witnesses parties in the event . This is not the only objection . If the charge of partisanship can not be sustained , and still the incumbent is displaced , his character for either fidelity or capacity is directly assailed , and he loses his reputation with his office . Such a system can not be carried out in good faith ; it is in its nature impracticable . It is bringing men to trial before an irresponsible tribunal ; it is a political inquisition . If , however , the judges of the secret tribunal have acted strictly on the principle announced by the President , there must have been a most undue proportion of rogues and blockheads in office , and it was high time to make a sweep among them . Some eight or ten thousand must have been terribly out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see the good old President , like ? sop , with his lantern , groping about among the Public Offices , in search of an honest man , and every day returning home in despair . Such a collection of sad fellows assuredly never were selected from their fellow-citizens in compliment to their character and qualifications . If the President was sincere in his pledge , every Public Office , every Ministerial Bureau , and every Custom House must have been a penitentiary , or hospital of incurables . It is no wonder that crimes are increasing so rapidly of late , when we find so many wicked offenders set at large by this general jail delivery of the President-or r ather his cabinet . For ourselves. , we have purchased a revolver , and // shall keep a sharp look-out uiitil these notorious delinquents are agaia sl*ut up in the Tombs or the public offices . o be serious , however , we have always considered this clamor about removals from office , as equally unfounded and ridiculous ; viewing them as only reprehensible when practiced in contravention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the balanee-wheels of the Government . It is one of the elements of that balance of power , that division of functions , without which every government , whatever may be its name , is virtually despotic . Next to the character , talents , and popularity of the President , the chief support of his authority and influence is the executive patronage , which was bestowed by the Constitution for the express purpose of preserving the equipoise between the different branches of government . The prerogative of removals and appointments is as much the constitutional right of the President , as the right of rejection is that of the Senate . It is an absolute right without any restriction , except the negative of the Senate , which extends only to appointments and not to removals . The Senate in this latter case has no other control but that of rejecting all nominations , to fill the place of the officer removed . The right of removal and appointment is clear , and it only remains to enquire into the justice and expediency of its exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of the government , and enters into all social and political relations , the holding of an office for any number of years , is considered as giving a sort of claim to perpetual possession . If a father has been fed at the l ) ublic crib all his life , it is held a good reason that the son shall succeed him-on the score of his long services . But in this republican land , public offices are not held in fee simple , or by inheritance . The Democratic doctrine is rotation in office ; and that a man who has been long in a snug , comfortable public position , or that the son should succeed his father-because the latter enjoyed it all his life , so far from being considered a good claim , is rather held to be a disqualification . The people of the United States d* not , therefore , consider it unjust , or unfeeling-except , perhaps , in their own individual cases-for a President to displace an old incumbent , and put in a new one . It is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , and that if the bread is taken out of one man 's mouth it is only to put it in that of another , who is quite as hungry , and perhaps quite as deserving . On the great general principle of equality , there is , therefore , no injustice in this rotation in office , and all we have a right to require , is that the public does not suffer by the change . It is equally applied to the President , and can not therefore be considered any peculiar hardship to his subordinates . With respect to the expediency of removals from office , on the accession of a new President , elected by a party in opposition to his predecessor , the case , we think , is equally clear . The appointing power is the main prop of Executive authority , as before observed , and if the President made no removals , would in a great measure lie dormant . But there is another very strong reason for removing opponents , especially bitter ones , from office . The President is charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on his subordinate officers for the faithful discharge of this great paramount duty . Can he rely on those // who did all in their power to oppose his election ? who hate his person ? abhor his political principles , and would triumph in his downfall and disgrace ? and is he bound to leave men in office who he knows will use all the influence their pesition gives them , to displace him as soon as possible ? There is no code , at least no code of political morality that demands such sacrifices . No complaint can therefore , in our opinion , be urged against the President , for having displaced an army of officials greater than that with which he gained all his laurels , had he not pledged himself to the contrary . With this he stands charo'ed and of this we can not acquit him . We have dwelt the longer on this point , because the subject of removals generally , takes the lead in the list of Executive enormities . Instead of looking to great principles , and basing our opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamors of removals , as if nothing was at issue , and nothing to be gained by victory but the spoils of the vanquished . These unmanly complaints , these groans of the wounded and dying , are disgraceful to the great cause for which the mass of the people fight . They do n't scramble for offices , but principles ; they labor to build up and sustain the Republic on the basis of Liberty and Equality : but this eternal howling about removals , gives a base and sordid aspect to conflicts , which we trust are with our fellow-citizens at large , for greater and nobler objects than office and emoluments . Whatever their leaders may be , the people are always honest and patriotic . Vox Popu ii , is only Vox Dei , because in a free country it is not only omnipotent , but well intentioned and sincere . The people are no hypocrites , and never act wrong but when misled by those in whom they confide . They may not be always wise-for who can boast of infallibility except Quack Doctors and fanatics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ les , and it is a good thing for men to mean right . It goes a great way towards doing right . A good intention is at least half-way to a good act . It is the needle that always points to a safe harbor . For this , at least , we unhesitatingly give the President of the United States full credit . We believe he meant well , when sensible of his incapacity and inexperience , he shifted the labors and responsibilities of his high station from his own shoulders to those of others . We think , however , that before taking this decisive and important step , he should have been careful in the selection of those to whom he was about to delegate such high and critical functions . In our poor opinion they should have been men looked up to as leaders by their own party , or known to the nation at least by name . They should have been prophets abroad as well as at home ; and occupied a station before the world which would have been in some measure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position they had already acquired in the public estimation . In short , designing to clothe them wiih such boundless authority within the sphere they occupied , the President should , we think , have bestowed it on men whose name and character would , if not justify such unlimited confidence , at least carry with them an influence which might give dignity even to their blunders . We do not wish to indulge in personalities ; but the occasion seems to justify the inquiry , whether the President has exercised a sound , discriminating discretion in the selection of the men who , though called his ministers , are , it would seem , virtually his masters ? Let us briefly pas* // them in review , like the shadows of posterity of the Banquo , and like them , probably to appear but once before the audience , to pass away forever and be seen no more . They are the great pilhrs of the temple , and we judge of its strength by its supporters . The Secretary of State , who is of course the leading member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , if we may judge from his speeches in the Senate , possesses a very lawyer-like understanding , and is better qualified for discussing a single point , than analyzing a great system of national policy . He can see better through the eye of a needle than a telescope ; and comprehend an atom at the end of his nose much more clearly than a world at a distance . The practice of law is not the best school for a statesman . Lawyers are too apt to argue a question of great national interest as if it were a point of law instead of policy , and treat it like pettifoggers rather than statesmen . They deal more in municipal than international codes , and their oracles are Coke upon Littleton or the statutes at large , instead of Grotius and Vattel . They seldom look at a subject in all its bearings , but peck at it here and there ; see but one point , and one side ; consult authorities without regard to change of time , place or circumstances ; and instead of reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seldom penetrate beyond the rhind . They study the statutes of England , rather than those of the United States ; and in discussing a question of national rights and honor , are prone to mistake the common law for the law of nations . We are indifferently versed in modern history , but do not recollect a single great practising lawyer who could ever get beyond precedents in discussing important political questions . Take these from him , and he is without rudder or compass ; for he has never been accustomed to depend on his own judgment , but on that of my Lord Mansfield , or Sir William Scott . During the late war with England , which was in no inconsiderable degree provoked by the decisions of the British Admiralty Court , over which Sir William Scott presided , his authority was decisive in our courts ; and we recollect to have heard it triumphantly quoted by a Sen ator of the United States , acting as counsel before the Supreme Bench , who had voted for that very war . The distinction between a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind  --  a statesman should always look forward . One relies altogether on the past , the other studies the present and the future . One acts on the judgment of others , the other on his own . It is not what dead men have done , but what living ones are to do . The law , at least by courtesy , is always the same ; the relative position of nations is perpetually varying , and no precedent can be exactly applicable to the condition of the present . There is no supreme court of nations but that of heaven , and notwithstanding they profess obedience to a certain code of laws , all history demonstrates that it is only weaker states that are willing to adhere to it implicitly . The right of the strongest is the only law , and conquests the only precedents that carry any authority . We apprehend the Secretary is a much better lawyer than statesman , though we must in candor confess that this is only a surmise ; for as yet we do n't know positively that he has actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has made many removals and appointments ; but this , after all , is no great feat of statesmanship ; and he has quarrelled with the only Republican Ambassador we are ever likely // to receive from Europe , and especially Republican France , on a pretext that appears to us worse than frivolous . What he has done , or what he is doing , in the affair of the Isthmus  --  a question of the deepest interest , and which ought promptly to be settled , in order that the canal may be commenced-nobody knows , or seems likely to know for the present , or at any definite period . It is said that he has made treaties , but where are they ? The nation knows no more about them than the King of the Musquitos  --  the protogee of my Lord Palmerston . Nobody knows any thing concerning these mysterious documents , where they are , or what is to be done with them . In the meantime , the canal is delayed ; our commerce is passing away round Cape Horn and the Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Isthmus ; the British Government is quietly proceeding in its encroachments , and establishing its influence in that quarter , by " protecting " the savages and overawing the white man ; and what might have been prevented by timely measures wisely adopted , and firmly adhered to , without a war , may , and probably will at some future period , be remedied only by a resort to arms. * But to do him justice , the Secretary is not alone ; in addition to the seven sleepers in the Cabinet , he is kept in countenance by the other branches of Government , who all seem so completely monopolized by the affairs of Africa , that they have forgotten every thing else ; and instead of making an issue on the Nicaragua question-one of the most important that ever did or ever can present itself to their consideration-are one and all higgling about an abstraction which menaces the very existence of the Union . We do not venture to condemn the Secretary on mere circumstantial evidence , or to deny that at all events he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is enough for a lawyer . The Secretary of the Treasury is also a lawyer , and stood , we believe , in the highest rank at the Philadelphia Bar , which has long been proverbial . To " puzzle a Philadelphia Lawyer , " has hitherto been considered the highest feat of logic ; and yet the Secretary appears to have been a little puzzled with the celebrated Galphin claim which takes place even of Amy Dardin 's horse , t both in antiquity and longevity . But though the legal reputation of the Secretary is well established at home , his statesmanship is yet in embryo , and his political principles remain to be demonstrated to the eyes of the nation . To us he happens to be known as a staunch , unbending federalist ; a federalist by inheritance ; a federalist by habit , and a federalist by conviction  --  a plain , honest , downright federalist of the Hamiltonian school ; just such a federalist as his great uncle , the late Governeur Morris . was before him , with the exception of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a moderate federalist , " the Secretary certainly belongs to that school . If we do not greatly err , his moderation , and that of all his 7noderado colleagues , will exhibit itself in a distrust of the people ; a confirmed conviction of their incapacity for self-government , and a systematic policy based on that assumption , to restrict them in the exercise of their * Since writing this , it is stated that a treaty has been concluded . It is hoped the Senate will scrutinize it closely , for it involves momentous consequences . The reader conversant with the proceedings of Congress for the last century , can not fail to recollect this celebrated claim . The descendants of poor Amy , however , received no interest money . // judgment and their will , just so far as it can be done without an open avowal and display of their covert policy . Neither moderate federalism , nor any other alias of federalism , consists in a single measure ; neither in a National Bank , a High Tariff* , Internal Improvements by the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or all put together. * Its maxims are fundamental , and their influence pervades every vein and artery , and nerve and sinew of the body politic. *Thus , the Bank of the United States may have become , as Mr. Webster declared , " an obsolete idea , " but the principle on which it was based is still in full vigor ; and whoever lives to see the time when such an institution , either openly or in disguise , can be established , without overthrowing a Federal admi*Pstration , will soon learn whether it has become an obsolete idea . At present Federalism can not show itself to the people under its old flag . It must come in disguise , and under some new alias . It was once National Republicanism ; it is now Whig or Moderate Federalism ; and if necessary it will become Anti-Rentism in New York ; Abolitionism in New England ; and anything anywhere else , that may aid it in sweeping together all the rubbish of Faction and Fanaticism . But though it may cast its skin , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the same radical principles which lay at the root of all that is hostile to the progress of freedom in the New and the Old World . Never will it be found to sympathise with the struggles of liberty at home or abroad ; never will it emancipate itself from its habitual subserviency to British influence ; nor will it ever be found conceding any thing to the people , except with a view to cheat them of their suifrages , for the purpose of swindling them of their rights afterwards . Of all administrations with which a country can be afflicted , defend us from one which dares neither come abroad under its own flag , or answer to its own proper name . Its entire policy must necessarily consist in hypocrisy , and mystery , and subterfuge . It must perpetually work under ground , and in the dark . It must creep on all-fours instead of walking upright ; and if it can not succeed in the practice of concealment and deception , be content with the profits of office , and quietly sit down under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more degrading position than that of a Cabinet which is only tolerated because its true character is unknown , or which is so perfectly insignificant as to make it a matter of indifference . Such seems the case with General Taylor 's Cabinet of " *Moderate Federalists : " moderate in talents-moderate in experience-moderate in every thing except turning men out of office , and payin g interest on old claims . We believe the Secretary of War is a lawyer too . Btit of this we are not certain . He is , we think , a son of the late William H. Crawford , a giant in frame , and a giant in intellect , to whose memory we are always ready to do justice . Had he preserved his health and mind , * he would unquestionably have succeeded Mr. Monroe in the Presidency , and in all probability prevented that confusion which has since so fatally operated on the fortunes of the Democracy . He was a man of great talents and great weight of character . Firm , upright , and decisive , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold the reins . Of the son , we know little . // His reputation had never become national , and his first appearance on the great stage of political life has been as a " star . " Obscurity is said to be akin to the sublime in poetry , but we doubt whether it is so in politics . Be this as it may , the capacity of the Secretary to distinguish himself in the great drama of political life is yet to be exhibited . As agent for the Galphin claim , he has been eminently successful ; and if he understands managing public affairs as well as he does private ones , the people will no doubt be satisfied . As this subject is now before Congress , we will content ourselves with merely expressing the opinion , that law or no law , no man occupying so high a station in the government as this gentleman , ought to have condescended to act as an agent in any claim , most especially one against a government of which he was so distinguished a member . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing any thing illegal ; but the people will condemn him , and they will be right . The example is pernicious , and can not be justified by all the legal dogmas in the world . The judgment of every man , who feels as he ought , and sees the consequences of such a perversion of official influence , will condemn it without hesitation , as bringing private and public duties in direct conflict with each other , and leading men into great temptations in stations where there are already too many . The subject of claims on Government is one of great delicacy . The centre of power is the focus of corruption . We do not mean to say that those who exercise power are more corrupt than other men ; but that they are placed in situations of greater temptation . Those who have much to give away will be surrounded by beggars ; and where by practicing imposition , or acquiring favor , men at once make their fortunes , the cunning , the selfish and the unprincipled , will always be attracted by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for men in power , and most especially those who stand guard over the Treasury , to be ever on the watch , for they will assuredly be perpetually assailed by a thousand false or frivQlous claims that have no foundation but a shortsighted selfishness , or a deliberate plan of deception against which the Government has no defence , but the most wary caution and the most stern incorruptibility . There are honorable exceptions , but a large portion come under this description . To those who have had no experience in these matters , it is inconceivable with what zeal , art and perseverance these claims are urged , either by principals or their agents-some of the latter of whom it is said are members of Congress , and Senators , who in the event of their being brought into either House , are to decide on their validity . They never remit their exertions , and never despair ; for experience has taught them , that some time or other , chance , management or good fortune will befriend them ; and that a new Secretary , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin House , or a last night 's Session , will at length reward their labor and perseverance . Like the King of England , a claim never dies . It may have been examined and rejected by a succession of Secretaries and accounting officers , but the moment a new one comes in , it is sure to be revived again , under pretence of new facts , new evidence , and additional vouchers . Thus the time of the new incumbent is wasted in re-examining cases , already examined and decided perhaps a dozen times , instead of being employed in attending to the atfairs of the nation . When all else fails , a last appeal is made to Congress , vvhicb refers it to a committee of // claims , which if it had the will , has not the power of investigating the myriads of cases presented for its consideration . It should be specially noted-for this circumstance makes such claims sui generis-that all the evidence brought forward in their support , is ex parte-all on one side . A public department is not a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their claims to confidence closely investigated ; nor is any counter testimony accessible , unless an officer is specially deputed to enquire into the affair on the spot , and explore the secrets of past ages ; for most of these great claims originate in the obscurity of remote antiquity . Whoever has had the good fortune to be beleaguered by these claimants , must have noticed , that when a claim was rejected for want of proof as to some essential point , that proof never failed to be forthcoming ; and though in point of conscience , the Secretary or the accounting officer , might be satisfied that imposition had been practiced , in point of law the proof would be sufficient , because there is no testimony to the contrary . Claims on Government , though they involve general legal principles , are not to be settled by the ipse dixit of lawyers , or the precepts of the decalogue . Most of them are governed by special acts of Congress , intended for the single purpose of protecting Government from fraud or imposition . They prescribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of claims , which experience has shown to be absolutely necessary , and which can not be dispensed with without incurring a just responsibility for misapplying the public money . rro guard the public treasury , men should have argus eyes , iron hands , and flinty hearts . The whole united force of fraud , selfishness , cunning , and influence , is perpetually arrayed against them , and suspicion is the greatest of their virtues , because in a vast many cases it is their only defence . They have no right to be charitable , or benevolent , at the expense of the people ; nor to permit their feelings to operate in favor of a particular claimant ; to oblige a friend , or conciliate a colleague in office . What would be amiable and praiseworthy in private life , is often a base desertion of our duty to our country , and the philanthropy of the citizen an offence to the State . The public officer when he bestows the money of the people where it is not justly due , can not boast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put his hands into his own purse , but into the pockets of the people , and has no right to be benevolent at the cost of others . Much less should any man , let him be who or what he will , standing high in office , and clothed with Executive powers , which authorize him to act in many cases according to his own judgment and will ; or any representative of the people , whose function it is to make the laws , become the paid agent of a party having a claim against Government . In one case he must employ his official influence in a manner totally inconsistent with his offici 1 duty ; in the other he becomes interested in a claim on which he may be called upon to decide as a legislator . There may be no law against it , but there is reason amply sufficient to mark it with reprobation. it is radically wrong in principle , and disreputable , to say the least of it , in practice , nor can the example of any man , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which makes it the interest of those whose great duty it is to guard the Public Treasury from being plundered , to become accomplices in its plunder . While writing this , we perceive that Senator Hunter , of Virginia-a // man every way worthy to represent that fruitful mother of Presidents and Patriots-has brought forward a Bill establishing a tribunal for the examination and final settlement of contested claims on Government . The theory is good , but the practical result will , we fear , scarcely justify the experiment . The same influences will be brought to bear upon the members ; the same acts and impositions practised ; and the same cx parte evidence offered . The tribunal must necessarily be left to decide irrevocably in the last resort ; for if an appeal is had to Congress , precisely the same state of things will occur , as that which this court is designed to remedy . Such a tribunal , clothed as it must necessarily be with discretionary powers , will be assailed by great temptations , irresistible , except when met by the most inflexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most wary sagacity . Shortly after the conclusion of the late war with England , a Board of Commissioners was authorized by Congress to adjust the claims for damages commit ted by the British in their inroad at Washington . They proceeded to business , and were so exceedingly liberal , that Mr. Madison was compelled to suspend their functions , lest the treasury might be exhausted , and it was abolished at the next session of Congress . Good laws are worse than a dead letter unless there are good men to administer them . But to resume our Gallery of Portraits . The Head of the Home  --  or the Onzniurn Gatherum Department as it might be called-is , we believe , also a lawyer . It is rumoured  --  and we know nothing of him but by hearsay-that he is peculiarly dextrous in decapitations , insomuch that it has been affirmed he has cut off more heads than any Pig Butcher in the great State of Ohio , which has grown so fast that it seems to have outgrown its discretion grievously . But he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the feat with exemplary moderation . Like his namesake , Sir Thomas , in the Ballad , " It grieves his heart to cut the rascals ' throats  --  and then he cuts them . " Though we can not learn that he has any great claim on the gratitude of his country ; report says he , or his kinsman , has , or had , heavy ones on the Government , which have been conceded with singular liberality . If his career should not be exactly honorable , there is every appearance it will be highly profitable ; and the art of feathering one 's nest in office , his held by a certain class of statesmen , the highest branch of political ethics . Enter the Post Master General , carrying a mail-bag filled with the heads of six thousand defunct Deputy Post Masters . He drinks six glasses of cold water to quiet his conscience , and proceeds to attend an abolition nieeting to denounce the constitution . Nil dicit . He says nothing , and we have nothing more to say of him , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par excellence , every one of whose opinions is worth its weight in California gold .. The Attorney General , we are happy to say , is more illustrious than some of his colleagues in office . lie has been heretofore pelted with something more substantial than bills of a broken bank , by a parcel of turbulant Democrats , who got into an unreasonable passion at having their pockets picked . This is equivalent to a Federal Patent of nobility . He has been President , or Director , or Receiver of a Bank which disappeared , leaving not a wreck behind , except some two or three hundred thousand dollars of bills , for the payment of which it appeared neither // President , Directors , or Receivers were responsible . Of course nobody doubts the talents of the Attorney General , both as a lawyer and financier . In our opinion he ought to have been placed at the head of the Treasury , for probably no man better understands the science of " raising the wind . " But on the other hand , he is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer among them , and his opinion with respect to claims on Government is decisive . Whether he continues to take fees , from the mere force of habit , is a curious subject for future investigation . In referring back , we perceive that the Secretary of the Navy has been omitted in his proper place , certainly from no disposition to treat him with the slightest disrespect . As an executive officer , little is known of him ; but as the Cabinet is said to be a unit , a sixth part of it must be pretty near a cipher . We hope , however , he is not the devotee of steam power , and looks askance at " Old Ironsides " and that class of vessels which bore our flag so triumphantly during the late war with England . We recommend him to pause and reflect a little , before he relinquishes a mode of warfare , in which the Americans are confessedly superior , for one in which the British are much more experienced than ourselves , and trusts the honor and interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and nautical skill . It would perhaps be well also for him to bear in mind , that steam vessels have never yet been tested through all the vicissitudes of war , nor their superiority over Old Ironsides decisively established . A ship of war is not exactly a locomotive , but requires to combine other qualities with speed . We hope and trust the influence of our more able and experienced naval officers will be exerted against every plan to substitute steam for canvass in our navy , except as an auxiliary , merely because England has set the example . We hope , too , the Secretary will not estop honest Jack 's grog , for it would be cruel to deprive him of almost his only solace during his long exile at sea . Except when our commerce is in a state of suspended animation , it is at all times difficult to man a squadron , and even single ships have sometimes been delayed for months for want of men . It needs no ghost to come from the grave to tell us that this difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water system in our Navy ; and that discontent and mutiny will become more common . The public have been led to suppose that our sailors are allowed sufficient whiskey to intoxicate them ; but this is not the case . They receive only enough to create an innocent and agreeable excitement , to which they have as good a claim as the gentleman has to his bottle of claret , or glass of whiskey punch . It were we think much to be wished , that a certain class of pious reformers , who in hunting the wolf , leave all other beasts of prey to scour the forest free from restraint , would be content to abstain themselves , and set a good example , without inflicting abstinence on others , whose condition and habits are altogether different . There are many far more ( Iangerous excitements to contend with in this world than that of alcohol ; many more deadly and destructive indulgences of the passions and appetites than drinking ; and the cool depravity of the seducer , the artful duplicity of the swindler , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the vitals of society than the occasional excesses of the tippler , though they do n't make quite so much noise . // 497 We are far from advocating or defending excesses of any kind ; for all excesses , even those of well meaning men , are more or less mischievous or dangerous . But it seems to us that it is not the best possible mode of reforming mankind , to pledge therri to abstinence from a single vicious indulgence , arid leave them their full sweep in every other . To ii*culcate moral and religious principles , and assail the entire fortress of human depravity , by undermining its foundation , and going to the root , is much more effectual in reforming mankind , than attacking the mere outworks , and while battering down one , leaving the great enemy to erect others still stronger in its place , without opposition . Men are very apt to convert abstinence from *one vice into a warrant for the indulgence of others , and quiet their consciences by making it the scape-goat . A very worthy and zealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , informed us that among his parishioners was a man who he had frequent occasion to lecture , for being a bad neighbor , an unkind husband , a tyrannical father , and various other transgressions , all which he confessed with great complacency , never failing to wind up with ,  --  " But then you know sir , that I have taken the pledge . " In all commercial and maritime nations , sailors are a class indispensable to the social state ; and every profession has its own peculiar habits , manners and characteristics , which however offensive they may be to others , are in a great measure indispensable to their usefulness in that position where accident or inclination has placed them . To make any radical change in them , is in a great measure to destroy their usefulness in their particular vocation . This is most especially the case with sailors , whose home is on the seas , and whose habits and experience are , and must necessarily be entirely different in many respects from those who live on the land . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to govern themselves by the same maxims of prudence , economy *nd discretion , which operate on farmers and mechanics , for if they did we should have few experienced sailors . They would save their money , buy a farm , and stay at home . If you want sailors , you must not go to church , or locate your recruiting offices among the saints . You do n't ship them for their morality , but their skill and experience on the wild waves . nor for their piety in kneeling , like the modern Greek sailors before a picture or a wooden image , when they should be breasting the elements , or contending with the enemy . While at sea , they are for months debarred in a great measure from all tho ' indulgences of life ; confined to the ship , and under severe discipline . Is it to be wondered at , that when suddenly released from " the prison-ship , " they act like children just out of school , rein wild with joy , and spend the earnings of a twelvemonth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not do this we should never m n our navy , for Jack never goes to sea till his purse is empty and his credit exhausted . We have thus briefly sketched the Imperial Cabinet , which is understood to wield the entire executive authority , aided by the feeble glowworm light diffused around them . As yet it must be confessed , they have not , at least openly , displayed any extraordinary talent or energy , except in removing officers and settling claims ; but they may , perh ps , improve in time . There are men-not however quite as plenty as blackberrieswhose genius rises with the exigencies of the occasion ; who climb the higher the steeper the ascent , and see the clearer the wider the sphere VOL . XxvL-No. cxLiv. 2 // they contemplate : men who approximate to the magnitude of the objects they wrestle with , and become great by an association with greatness . There are others  --  and these constitute a much more numerous class , who may he said to sink as they rise , and whose littleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their functions-men , whose genius instead of growing brighter , like the sun as it reaches its meridian , becomes only more dazzled , dizzy , and confounded by the height to which they have ascended , and who have no resource for getting out of one blunder except by making a greater . To which of these classes the members of the cabinet belong , time will show , and to time we leave them . In the high stations they occupy , incapacity or corruption can not be long concealed . The light is too strong , and the scrutinizers too many and too keen . The people have eyes to see , ears to hear , and common sense to judge . They will in good time discover whether the inaction of the gentlemen in question , in this alarming crisis of our affairs , is real or pretended ; and whether while affecting to do nothing they are not in reality blowing the coals of dissension and disunion . We shall ere long discover if they are or are not accomplices in the grand conspiracy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in taking an oath to maintain and support the latter , it was not , like Senator Seward , with a secret proviso , that it did not go against their consciences. if they are leagued with the Abolitionists , as there is too much reason to believe , they are playing the despicable game of hypocrisy ; if they are really neutral as they pretend , their neutrality is little short of treason . We think it high time for the President to resume the helm before the ship is stranded . Let him do something , if it be only to play Diogenes , and roll his tub about Washington .
