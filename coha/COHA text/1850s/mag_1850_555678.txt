txt ART . VII . - Orations and Speeches on various Occasions . By J*D WARD EVERETT . Boston : Little &amp; Brown . 1850. 52 vols . Svo . THE experience of the world has shown pretty conclusively , that eloquence and political liberty go hand in hand , flourish under similar favoring influences , and , dying together , are buried in the same grave . To discourse upon the marvellous effects produced by the great orators of Greece and Rome were to talk upon a hackneyed theme , with scarce a possibility of saying any thing at once new and true . But the eloquence of the ancients , it can not be denied , acquires in republic*tn America a fresh interest , from the numerous coincidences of circumstance , occasion , topics of popular appeal , and links of electric sympathy between the patriot speaker and the tumultuous assemblages of free and sovereign citizens , gathered to consider questions of moment to the public weal , or to celebrate , with the pomp of solemn processions , religious rites , and commemorative orations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the famous days which have been turning points in the history of national greatness . In truth , we are living over again the 38* // classic times of Athenian and Roman eloquence , on a broader stage , in larger proportions , with elements of excitement , hopes of progress , and principles of duration , which never cheered and strengthened the souls of Demosthenes and Cicero . Our " mass meetings " are the counterpart of the multitudinous gathering in the Pnyx and the Forum ; and the great political questions we discuss in them are of the same vital importance to our national prosperity , though not , perhaps , to our national existence , as were the topics debated hy Phocion and Demosthenes . From the battle fields of the American Revolution , we repeat the same lessons of heroic resistance to the enemies of our country , and of the duty and glory of dying in defence of our hearths and homes and native city , that the Greeks drew from the soil which the Persian invader had drenched with his barbarian blood . Bunker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Plat*ea , and Thermopyke ; but God forbid that the parallel should he carried farther ! God forbid that our great statesmen and famous orators should be called upon to commemorate the virtues of those who have fallen in civil strife , the victims of a quarrel springing from jealousies among rival but kindred States , living under different institutions , but hound together by every tie of interest , every memory of the illustrious past , every hope of a more illustrious future . God forbid that we , too , should plunge into a Peloponnesian War , of uncertain duration , but leading to certain ruin , even should the eloquence of a Pericles urge us into the fatal struggle . Rather let the counsels of a wise moderation lead these sister States back to the common ground of magnanimous forhearance , which , while it saves the honor of each , shall rescue the endangered fortunes and happiness of both . These two superb volumes , containing Mr. Everett 's Orations and Speeches , could not have come out in a better time , or more seasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover a period of six-and-twenty years , beginning with 1824 , and extending to the present time . Though this long series of years have been passed in profound peace , with the single and brief exception of the Mexican War , yet it has been crowded with events deeply affecting the present condition and future prospects of our country . // As we look back upon the long train of these thickcrowding events , we seem to have lived a life of ages ; and even now , the form and pressure of the times show us , that we have as yet been spectators of the overture only of the great action on the stage of national affairs , which is about to open before us with more than dramatic intensity of interest . Through the whole period to which we refer , the influence of Mr. Everett 's genius and eloquence has been steadily and powerfully felt . His life and labors belong to the history of the times ; and though his name and his praise have been in all men 's mouths throughout the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his achievements have been fully appreciated until the publication of the present volumes . The early training of Mr. Everett , by which he placed himself foremost among the scholars of America ; his rich opportunities , employed with admirable industry and success , at home and abroad , after the period of college and professional studies had passed ; the amplitude of classical learning , and the memorable eloquence by which he adorned for five or six years the Professor 's chair in the University the vigorous national spirit which he breathed into the leading American Review , while he was its editor , - had gradually fixed the regards of the public upon his career , and singled him out as one destined to take a leading part in the councils of the nation . From the Professor 's chair he passed , by a strong popular vote , to the House of Representatives in Congress ; and he represented an enlightened constituency in such a manner as almost to put an end to party divisions for a time , by the satisfaction and pride all felt in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact performance of every duty belonging to the station , his profound knowledge of every subject , in details and principles , that came up for the consideration of Congress , and the never-failing readiness and skill with which he poured out the light of his knowledge upon whatever subject he was called upon to discuss in the debates of the House . We well remember hearing a distinguished leader of the opposite party to that to which Mr. Everett belonged , during the administration of Mr. Adams , - a gentleman afterwards raised to a seat on the supreme bench of the United States , - say , that when he wanted information upon any matter of public business , no // matter what , he always had recourse to his political opponent , Mr. Everett , and that he always obtained , to the fullest extent , what he asked for ; - so deep was the impression made , at that early day , by Mr. Everett 's acquirements , and unwearied industry and prompt liberality in imparting to others the treasures with which his capacious mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State of Massachusetts , and , later still , in the more conspicuous posi-* tion of Minister of the United States to the Court of St. James , are so freshly in the memories of all , that any thing more than the briefest passing allusion is quite superfluous . These labors for the public good , in political stations of high rank and trust , were not inappropriately followed by his election , with singular unanimity among the appointing and confirming boards , to the office of President of Harvard College . During the three years , at the close of which the state of his health compelled him to lay aside the onerous responsibilities of that office , Mr. Everett performed its duties , always difficult and frequently trying , with an unsparing and unsurpassed devotion to the highest interests of the institution , and to the moral and intellectual welfare of the students who resorted to its learned halls to prepare themselves for the struggles and conflicts of life . The labors , to which allusion has been made , are enough to fill up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among which may be mentioned an important and learned volume , the Defence of Christianity ; academical lectures on Greek Literature ; elaborate contributions to the North American Review , for a long series of years ; lighter contributions to other journals and periodicals ; Congressional duties , often involving the work of the most important committees in the House ; the duties and responsibilities of the Executive Chair of the State ; the diplomatic labors belonging to the embassy to the first European court , for a period of four years ; and the incessant and exhausting variety of work connected with the office of President of the College , - these constitute the basis of Mr. Everett 's great and national reputation and influence , and are enough for any man to rest his fame upon . The studies , embodied in the volumes before us , constitute a sort of running accom // paniment to the weighty cares and toils with which Mr. Everett 's official years have been crowded ; they give a graceful and completing touch to the grave discharge of the responsibilities of public life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the finishing ornaments of solid labors performed in the service of the State ; they constitute , if taken independently and alone , a series of literary works , of such number and magnitude , that the country might well accept them as the lastin0 memorials of rich scholarship and patriotic genius , conscientiously applied to the noblest objects which a man of letters can ever hope to compass . Mr. Everett 's fame , as a scholar , runs back " even to his boyish days . " It was , however , the first Phi Beta Kappa Oration , delivered at Cambridge in 18*24 , that placed him before the public , as one of the greatest and most accomplished orators who had ever appeared in America . The occasion was a singularly happy one . The visit of General Lafayette , in his old age , to the country whose liberties he had bravely fought for in the chivalrous days of his youth ; the ardent , enthusiastic , and unanimous welcome which rang from city to city , and from state to state , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snccessive stages of his great ovation ; the excitement of the thronging multitudes of the descendants from his companions in arms , who poured out from hamlet and village and town and city to meet him , to follow him , to listen to his words , to gaze upon his friendly and venerable countenance , and to bless him with the warm benedictions of full and grateful hearts ; - all these auspicious circumstances had spread a festal joy , unexampled in the history of the country , preparing the minds of men to respond to the inspired voices of eloquent speakers , to beat in full accordance with the thrilling memories of the past , to swell with the exulting anticipations of the future . The immense multitude who were present in Cambridge on that anniversary , will never forget the deep interest of the occasion , - the plaudits and congratulations , as they received among them the beloved guest of the nation , and the breathless and absorbed attention with which they listened to the discourse of Mr. Everett , as it reached , with its rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded to its utmost capacity with eager and expectant throngs . The oldfashioned square pews were filled , and every inch of space // on the top of the narrow railing which enclosed them was occupied by persons , who , unable to find seats or standingplaces , remained perched upon these sharp edges , hour after hour , wholly unconscious of the discomfort of their uncertain elevation . Mr. Everett 's subject was fortunately chosen for such an assembly of lettered men , and fell in admirably with the joyous and triumphant spirit of the occasion . It was redolent of the most refined scholarship , - the most exquisite learning drawn from the highest fountains of knowledge . It was the earnest plea of a republican scholar , in defence of republican institutions , in their bearings upon the cultivation of letters and science . The argument was conducted with consummate ability and taste ; none left that assembly without having their confidence in the intellectual destinies of the country increased by its close reasoning and glowing appeals . The orator was then in his early manhood , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the audience had never listened to his voice or looked upon his countenance before , though his literary renown had already filled the land ; and the music of his speech came upon them with the effect of a delicious novelty . To many of them was given , on that day , the first conception they had ever formed of the great triumphs of classical oratory ; those triumphs achieved by the combination of the gifts of genius with matured and profound studies , and with a thorough knowledge of the principles and a careful training in the practice of the art ; employed upon subjects of deep and immediate concern to the hearers , and holding undivided possession of the soul , while tasking all the mental energies of the speaker . So Demosthenes moved the passions and swayed the minds of the Athenian assemblies , as he addressed to them , from the Bema , those carefully meditated orations , by which , year after year , he guided and controlled the policy of the Athenian commonwealth ; so Cicero compelled the feelings of the surging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eloquence , as the mighty ocean tides follow the path of the serene orb of heaven , whose attraction nature forbids them to resist . In reading these volumes , we can not but be astonished at the number and variety of subjects which Mr. Everett has discussed in his public discourses . We have alluded to some points of comparison between the public speaking in our country and in the ancient republics . While the comparison // holds good in several very striking particulars , it is , in others , a very inadequate one . If we look over the extant orations of the Attic orators , and add to them the semi-historical speeches put into the mouths of statesmen and generals by historical writers , we shall see that the number of topics , compared with those which present themselves in our day and country , was somewhat limited . In the popular assemblies , the general political subjecfs were pretty much the same ; and some of the themes of popular address , most effective then , are even now equally powerful over the eternal passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated by Lord Brougham , in his Essay on the Eloquence of the Ancients , where he shows that many passages of Demosthenes would have commanded the same attention in the House of Commons that they did in the Athenian Ecclesia . But , with the exception of judicial arguments , the popular eloquence of the ancients was not very extensive nor comprehensive in its topics . Private suits , indeed , were mimerous ; and the rhetoric of the courts was distinguished , in Athens at least , from a very early period , by its logical acuteness in the application of the rules and principles of law , as well as by able arguments drawn from natural right , common sense reasoning , and the unalterable rules of equity . The demonstrative , or epideictic style , as their technical writers designated it , corresponded , with tolerable exactness , to the occasional orations in which our countrymen delight . In these , for the most part panegyrical , discourses , the formal and standing subjects were eulogies upon an illustrious ancestry , in which the speakers , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged at will among the shadowy forms of a mythical and mysterious and unmeasured past ; they recounted the visits and benefactions of gods and goddesses to the favored city , and the exploits of demigods , with whom the poets had peopled the primeval land ; then the Scythians , Thracians , and Amazons figured in their sounding periods , and the wars of god-descended kings , by which these fabulous hordes of fighting men and fighting women were defeated or annihilated . The legendary strifes of Thebes and Troy furnished abundant materials for declamation ; and the autocthonous glory of immemorial possession of the soil rounded many a patriotic descant . After // these ambiguous claims had received their due attention , the orator generally came down to matters within the scope of acknowledged history , and the illustrious deeds of his countrymen in the Persian invasion furnished the theme of eulogy . Now these obligato topics strike the modern reader as being somewhat monotonous , to say the least ; and however interesting the gods , demigods , heroes , Amazons , Thracians , and Scythians were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestral names with these dim but gigantic figures , they appear to us like the cold inventions of frigid and somewhat childish rhetoricians , playing at eloquence , rather than rousing the passions of an excited audience . The truth of these remarks will be felt , we think , if we read in succession the elegant epideictic discourses of Lysias and Isocrates . It should be added , however , that the deliberative orations of the ancients are generally free from these inartificial devices . When Pericles exhorts his countrymen not to yield to the overbearing insolence of a rival state , he passes with consummate judgment , after two or three sentences of introduction , to the practical consideration of the real questions at issue in the coming contest ; points out the insulting nature of the Laceda*monian requirements ; descrihes vividly the advantages , physical and moral , they possess over the enemy ; and traces a line of action by which these natural and acquired superiorities may he maintained ; and so , in a speech of masterly vigor , occupying at most half an hour in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of conviction , at which they are willing to risk their fortunes and lives on the doubtful hazards of war . The same great orator and statesman , in his famous funeral oration , avoids with fine tact the prosy details of mythical times , though the nature of the occasion made it fitting , if not necessary , to touch upon the virtues of the autocthonous ancestors . " The same race , always inhabiting the same country , " said he , " transmitted it , through a succession of generations , free ; they are worthy of praise , but still more so are your fathers ; for they added to what they received , and handed down to us , of the present day , the extended empire which we now possess . " After this skilful opening , he delineates with a power never sufficiently to be admired the character of the Athenian institutions , // analyzes with deep practical insight the principles lying at their foundation , contrasting them , for the most part silently , with the austere and repulsive features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearers with an art and depth of genius which Demosthenes himself never surpassed , every consideration that could rouse in the hearts of the mourning assembly , as they stood around the hones of their friends and countrymen gathered from the field of battle , an unquenchable pride in the position achieved by the country ; and having fixed in the minds an august image of her as the " mother of arts and arms , native to famous wits , " not needing even the poetry of Homer to celebrate her praises , - he makes them feel that for such a country it is a duty and a joy to die ; that the field of their death was the scene of their happiness and of their brightest glory ; that their example should be cheerfully imitated , by men inspired with a just sense of their country 's greatness ; that the thoughts of the past should console the short remaining future of the aged parents bereaved of noble and patriotic sons ; and having announced that the children of the departed are to be the objects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , mourning , but excited , consoled , and resolute to maintain the glory of Athens at every hazard of life and fortune . Such was the magnificent style in which the great statesman broke away from the rhetoric of the schools , and , guided by an exquisite art or a divine instinct , appealed at once to the profoundest feelings of the human heart . At a later period , the kindred genius of Demosthenes handled with a like force the living interests and realities around him . In the long-drawn , but unequal , struggle against the Macedonian kings , when he needed every topic which could exercise a power over his countrymen as he strove to rally them to assert their ancient prero0atives against the encroachments of despotism , and when the mighty memories of the past came thronging around him , he , too , never dwelt upon the unreal boasts of a cloud-encompassed age of intercourse with the gods , but with passing allusions to these things , he swept on , in the storm of his eloquence , to the questions that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the historical glories of the peerless city whose destiny his almost single arm was upholding , like Pericles , he appealed to the // pride of Athenian supremacy ; and with a vivid appreciation of the present that even Pericles did riot attain , he pointed to the evidences of Athenian greatness , - the docks , the navies , the courts of law , the Propyl*a , the temples and images of the gods , and especially the majestic statue of protecting Athena , who seemed to overshadow with her regis the Acropolis itself , while she defended her beloved city with her menacing spear . We have barely alluded to these traits of antiquity for the purpose of showing that , although such men as Pericles and Demosthenes addressed their contemporaries with almost superhuman power , yet , in modern times and in our republican communities , the sources of eloquence are quite as deep , and the topics more various ; and this brings us hack again to Mr. Everett 's noble volumes . The first discourse , delivered on the occasion to which we have briefly referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular circumstances that gave opportunity to more than one burst of eloquence , like the apostrophe to Gen. La Fayette , whose effect was equal perhaps to any thing of the kind in ancient or modern oratory . The oration is , indeed , as we have said , a most beautiful and scholarly plea in behalf of letters in republican states . Between this and the speech on the Bible , which forms a fitting close of religious solemnity , to the manifold strains that fill the interval with their rich enchantments , we have a series of orations , discourses , speeches , and addresses , on a wonderful variety of occasions and topics , for a wonderflil variety of objects , in different countries and almost numberless places . We have elaborate literary orations , delivered before college and other societies ; discourses in commemoration of the founding of our New England communities ; orations prepared for anniversary celebrations of the great battles in the revolutionary war ; fourth of July orations ; eulogies on illustrious patriots , as Adams and Jefferson , La Fayette , and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other festivals ; temperance addresses ; addresses before charitable societies ; before learned associations , agricultural and scientific societies ; at cattle shows , and before legislative committees ; - amountkig in all to the astonishing number of eighty-one ; a third more than Demosthenes wrote in his whole life , and nearly as many as are extant of Demosthenes and Cicero together . // Next to the great variety of occasions for which these discourses were prepared , we are struck by the number of important subjects which are treated in them . The extent of knowledge and the depth of study required for the management of these can only be appreciated by one who has carefully read and analyzed them . And when we consider that , with the exception of the earlier and scholastic period of his life , Mr. Everett has been charged almost constantly with weighty public duties , we must needs wonder at and envy the extraordinary powers of acquisition which have enabled him to conquer so many provinces of learning . For the subjects which Mr. Everett handles are not discussed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ou , is public speakers are characterized . On the contrary , hPi searches , with curious art and marvellous succ* 's , for the fundamental principle , develops it with unerring logic to its great practical conclusions , and concentrates upon the argument , with a taste as faultless as his conception of the subject is profound , all the connected and auxiliary learning which the topic and the occasion admit or require . Another and equhlly striking characteristic of these volumes is the national tone which sounds through them . We feel the patriotic American spirit animating them and communicating its glow to our hearts , as we dwell upon the page . And while we recognize this nationality of sentiment , we feel also that it is the result of no narrowness of mind or exclusive temper towards the distant and the foreign . No man has a more intimate acquaintance with the ancient and the modern world , or a more catholic appreciation of all there is of good in governments and institutions differing from our own ; no man has made more extensive comparisons , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his conclusions ; and yet , with these rich funds of study and experience , Mr. Everett , combining the ardors of youth , with the wisdom of long experience , still discourses to his countrymen in those strains of temnperate enthusiasm for the principles of American liberty , of devotion to the constitution our fathers bequeathed , of sagacious forecast and earnest warning for the future , which led his hearers captive a quarter of a century ago . The importance of knowledge , the necessity of popular education , the value of public improvements , and of inventions in the arts , the practical applications of science , the obligations of charity , the // duties of an enlarged love of country , and more than all , and above all , the indispensable necessity of enlightened Christian faith ; - in short , all the vital themes connected with the peculiarities of American existence , and naturally forcing themselves upon the consideration of the thoughtful American citizen , whether old or new , whether worn thread-bare by the speculations of other times , or brought first prominently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have received new , intenser , and brighter illumination from his pen . Our national life , comparatively speaking , is of yesterday . We have , fortunately in most respects , it seems to us , no legendary past . Our heroic age is not mythical , but historical ; and our great orators linger , of necessity , upon themes like those which Pericles and Demosthenes took by choice . But it requires the living power of genius to shed an original interest , as Mr. Everett has done , over the familiar and the known* to strike out new thoughts from old facts ; to draw unsuspected conclusions from ancient premises ; to point out , from the trodden highways of life , vast and illimitable vistas of progress which had not before opened upon the common eye . It is this Americanism of feeling , this pervading patriotic purpose , which brings a delightful unity out of this endless variety . We seem almost to be reading an epic poem , as we advance from the prelude , adorned by every charm of finished speech and admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the lesser episodes of the successive periods of Mr. Everett 's literary life , set forth with accurate logic , clothed in the forms of an exquisitely cultured imagination , and finally ending with a strain of religious eloquence worthy of the Christian orator and scholar . At every step we take , we behold on all sides the spectacle of order , and arrangement , and beauty ; and when we reach the conclusion , our souls are filled with a pervading sense of harmony . We should have no hesitation , therefore , in placing in the hands of young American citizens these volumes , as containing the best developments of the genius of free institutions the noblest expositions of the lofty duties by which the citizen of a free state is bound ; the most spirit-stirring representations of the greatness of the illustrious founders of our cornmonwealths , now living immortal in the monuments of genius and patriotic wisdom they have left behind them . // After speaking of these graver qualities , it may seem like descending to touch upon merely literary excellence . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's writings that the o*lir*t 1*ere attempted would be more incomp*1ete than we should be willing to leave it , if something is not said with special reference to this point . In all that Mr. Everett does , there is a singular completeness in the execution , as well as the conception . It seems to be the natural tendency of his mind to do whatever he undertakes in the best possible manner , as a matter , not only of taste , but of conscience . As a moral duty admits of no half compliance with its requirements , or a religious obligation feebly discharged is not discharged at all , so an intellectual task , if executed in a superficial manner , is not to be considered as a task performed ; and conscience , lending aid to taste , lays a moral law upon the operations of the intellect , and imparts a species of sanctity to the highest possible finish of its work . We suppose Mr. Everett labors in a spirit like this . He leaves no thought ill comprehended , no sentence badly expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth uttering at all , is worth uttering well ; whatever is worth writing at all , is worth writing in the best manner . The studies of his youth , made the productions of antique genius familiar to him as household words , and the fragrance of their amaranthine flowers breathes from every sentence that drops from his pen . His style combines purity and great richness of phrase , with that numerous rhythm which belongs to the higher forms of prose eloquence . The delicate perception by which the artist shades and tints his pictures , until the eye rests upon them with a conscious , but unspeakable and inexplicable , delight , is analogous to that well-trained sense of the beauties and proprieties and harmonies of speech , which guides a writer like Mr. Everett in the choice of his words , the combination of his clauses , and the moulding of his periods into forms that dwell in the mind of the hearer forever . The fine contrasts between simplicity of expression in narrative or unimpassioned passages , and the more elevated and embellished manner into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration , form one of the highest charms of a finished literary style . This charm everywhere casts its spell 39 * // over the writings of Mr. Everett . Moving and noble passages of his orations are found in all our school books , committed to memory by young men for declamation , read aloud in the evening circle , repeated in quotations , and dwelt upon as we muse in our solitary walks . There is no such power as that of the poet and the fine prose writer . The sentences they utter in their higher and happier moods , blend , as we revolve them , with the sights and sounds of nature flowing into and taking possession of our souls . So subtile and delicate , so gentle yet so powerful , so penetrating and all-pervading is the influence of an author whose knowledge is varied , elegant , and profound ; whose imagination is vivid , strong , and creative ; whose taste is pure , according to the last requirements of classic art ; whose language is fastidiously chosen , yet copious ; whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise from the country to mankind , from mankind to God . We had intended to quote a portion of the graceful and very interesting preface to the second edition . But we have scarcely left ourselves space for more than one or two passages , and those from the less known portions of the second volume . Most of the discourses that occupy the first have been long before the public , and have entered into the standard literature of our age . All will in a short time become so ; they will be studied hereafter as we now study the classics , to train the mind in habits of accurate reasoning , to form the taste by models of classic beauty , and to fill the memory with noble and exalting ideas . Three discourses in the second volume are now published for the first time . From the second of them , - an oration delivered at a few days ' notice in Lowell , July 5th , 1830 , - we quote a characteristic passage . " There is another point of importance , in reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection , and it is this , - that in addition to what may be called their direct operation and influence , manufactures are a great school for all the practical arts . As they are aided themselves , in the progress of inventive sagacity , by hints and materials from every art and every science , and every kingdom of nature , so , in their turn , they create the skill and furnish the instruments for carrying on almost all the other pursuits . Whatever pertains to machinery , // 459 in all the great branches of industry , will probably be found to have its origin , directly or indirectly , in that skill which can be acquired only in connection with manufactures . Let me mention two striking instances , the one connected with navigation , and the other with agriculture . the greatest improvement in navigation , since the invention of the mariner 's compass , is the application of steam for propelling vessels . Now , by whom was this improvement made ? Not by the merchant , or the mariner , fatigued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production of the machine shops of Birmingham where a breath of the sea breeze never penetrated ; and its application as a motive power on the water , was a result wrought out by the sagacity of Fulton , from the science and skill of the mill-wright and the machinist . The first elements of such a mechanical system as the steam engine , in any of its applications , must be wanting in a purely commercial or agricultural community . Again , the great improvement in the agriculture of our Southern States , and , in its results , one of the greatest additions to the agricultural produce of the world , dates from the inventiOn of the machine for separating the seed from the staple . This invention was not the growth of the region which enjoys its first benefits . The peculiar faculty of the mind , to which these wonderful mechanical contrivances of modern art owe their origin , is not likely to be developed in the routine of agricultural operations . These operations have their effects on the intellectual character , - salutary effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrivance , which peoples your factories with their lifeless but almost reasoning tenants . " I can not but think that the loss and injury unavoidably accruing to a people , among whom a long-continued exclusive pursuit of other occupations has prevented the cultivation of the inventive faculty and the acquisition of mechanical skill , is greater , in reference to the general affairs and business of life , than in reference to the direct products of manufactures . The latter is a great economical loss , the nature and extent of which are described in the remarks which I have quoted from the great teacher of political economy ; but a community in which the inventive and constructive principle is faintly developed , is deprived of one of the highest capacities of reasoning mind . Experience has shown that the natural germ of this principle - the inborn aptitude - is possessed by our countrymen in an eminent degree ; but , like other natural endowments , it can not attain a high degree of improvement without cultivation . In proportion as a person , endowed with an inventive mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his command is extended over the resources of art , and he is // 460 Everett 's Orations and Speeches . Oct. more likely to enlarge its domain by new discoveries . Place a man , however intelligent , but destitute of all knowledge in this department , before one of the complicated machines in your factories , and he would gaze upon it with despairing admiration . It is much if he can be brought , by careful inspection and patient explanation , to comprehend its construction . A skilful artist , at the first sight of a new machine , comprehends , in a general way , the principles of its construction . It is only , therefore , in a community where this skill is widely diffused , and where a strong interest is constantly pressing for every practicable improvement , that new inventions are likely to be made , and more of those wonderful contrivances may be expected to be brought to light , which have changed the face of modern industry . " These important practical truths have been fully confirmed by the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost every part of the machinery by which its multifarious industry is carried on . But however interesting this result may be in an economical point of view , another lesson has been taught at Lowell , and our other wellconducted manufacturing establishments , which I deem vastly more important . It is well known that the degraded condition of the operatives in the old world had created a strong prejudice against the introduction of manufactures into this country . We were made acquainted , by sanitary and parliamentary reports , detailing the condition of the great manufacturing cities abroad , with a state of things revolting to humanity . It would seem that the industrial system of Europe required for its administration an amount of suffering , depravity , and brutalism , which formed one of the great scandals of the age . No form of serfdom or slavery could be worse . Reflecting persons , on this side of the ocean , contemplated with uneasiness the introduction , into this country , of a system which ha*l disclosed such hideous features in Europe ; but it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were I addressing an audience in any other place , I could with truth say more to this effect than I will say on this occasion . But you will all bear me witness that I do not speak the words of adulation , when I say , that for physical comfort , moral conduct , general intelligence , and all the qualities of social character which make up an enlightened New England community , Lowell might safely enter into a comparison with any town or city in the land . Nowhere , I believe , for the same population , is there a greater number of schools and churches , and nowhere a greater number of persons whose habits and mode of life bear witness that they are influenced by a sense of character . " In demonstrating to the world that such a state of things is // consistent with the profitable pursuit of manufacturing industry , you have made a discovery more important to humanity than all the wonderful machinery for weaving and spinning , - than all the miracles of water or steam . You have rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ignorance , vice , and suffering , under which it lay crushed . You have gained , for the skilled industry required to carry on these mighty establishments , a place of honor in the great dispensation by which Providence governs the world . You have shown that the home-bred virtues of the parental roof are not required to be left behind by those who resort for a few years to these crowded marts of social industry ; and , in the fruits of your honest and successful labor , you are daily carrying gladness to the firesides where you were reared . " The alliance which you have thus established between labor and capital ( which is nothing but labor saved ) may truly be called a holy alliance . It realizes , in a practical way , that vision of social life and action which has been started abroad , in forms , as it appears to me , inconsistent with the primary instincts of our nature , and wholly incapable of being ingrafted upon our modern civilization . That no farther progress can be made in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be contrary to the great laws of human progress to suppose that , at one effort , this hard problem in social affairs had reached its perfect solution . But I think it may be truly said , that in no other way has so much been done , as in these establishments , to mingle up the interests of society ; to confer upon labor , in all its degrees of cultivation , ( from mere handiwork and strength up to inventive skill and adorning taste , ) the advantages which result from previous accumulations . Without shaking that ttrcat principle , by which a man calls what he has his own , whether it is little or much , ( the corner stone of civilized life , ) these establishments form a mutually beneficial connection between those who have nothing but their muscular power and those who are able to bring into the partnership the masses of property requisite to carry on an extensive concern , - property which was itself , originally , the work of men 's hands , but has been converted , by accumulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the greatest triumphs of humanity , morals , and I will add , religion . The labor of a community is its great wealth , - its most vital concern . To elevate it in the social scale , to increase its rewards , to give it cultivation and self-respect , should be the constant aim of an enlightened patriotism . There can be no other basis of a progressive Christian civilization . Woe to the land where labor and intelligence are at war ! Happy the land // whose various interests are united together by the bonds of mutual benefit and kind feeling ! " From the Discourse on Superior and Popular Education , we extract the following : - " With respect to the first-named view of education , it is an inquiry well calculated to stir the curiosity of the thoughtful student of the nature of the human mind , whether it be possible , by the wisest system of education , most faithfully applied , to produce higher degrees of intellectual power and excellence than have ever been witnessed among men . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried our common intellectual nature to the highest point of human perfection ; and it may seem presumptuous to express the opinion , that it can be possible , by any agency of means which can be planned out and put in operation , to form minds superior to some of those which , from time to time , have commanded the admiration of the world . It may even seem idle , in connection with education , to speak at all of such minds , since , in tracing their personal history , it is often found that , so far from owing their eminence over the rest of mankind to superior advantages of instruction , they were born and reared in want , and became great by the power of genius , unaided by favorable circumstances . I do not now recollect one , among the master minds of our race , for whom a kind and judicious father would have prescribed , from first to last , that course of education and life which , as the event proved , was prescribed by Providence . " Homer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all aftertimes have accorded the first place , was a wandering minstrel , in a semi-barbarous age , perhaps a blind mendicant . Who would have thought that the wisest of men ' should have been a poor , bare-footed soldier ; the standing butt , on the Athenian stage , of the most tremendous of satirists ; the victim of an untamable shrew , sacrificed , at last , to a tyranny as base as it was cruel ! Or who would have predicted that the prince of Grecian eloquence should have been found in a stammering orphan , of feeble lungs and ungainly carriage , deprived of education by avaricious guardians , and condemned to struggle for his life amidst the infuriated contests of rival political factions . The greatest minds of Rome , so far from being placed in circumstances seemingly favorable to their formation , lived , almost all of them , in exceedingly critical , perilous , and degenerate days ; many of them under a despotism so frightful that one would think it must have produced a general intellectual catalepsy . " If we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // minds seem to have been trained under circumstances which would have been deemed , beforehand , friendly to the improvement of genius ! Dante was tossed , by the stormy feuds of the Italian republics , from city to city , banished , and sentenced to be burned alive , if found in the land which he has immortalized by his fame . The madhouse of St. Anne was the conservatory in which Tasso 's genius ripened . Columbus was , for years , an all but heart-broken suitor to royal stocks and stones . Luther , at the age when the permanent bias is usually given to the mind , was the shorn and sleek inmate of a monk 's cell . Of the great men who form the glory of English literature , not one , I think , was so situated as to enjoy the best advantages for education which his country , at the time , afforded ; least of all was this the case with the greatest of them ,  --  Shakspeare . Not one of the most illustrious intellects , from Homer down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Machiavelli , rise above the level of their fellow . men , and stretch out their hands to each other , across the interval of ages , transmitting to each succeeding generation the torch of science , poetry , and art , - not one of them , taking all things together , was placed even in as favorable circumstances as the times admitted , for the training of his faculties . " 1 readily admit , that minds of the first order furnish no rule for the average of intellect ; and I can well conceive , that they may , in the inscrutable connection of cause and effect , in some cases , have owed a part of their power and eminence to the operation of those seemingly untoward circums:ances against which human prudence would , if possible , have guarded them . But I hope it will not be deemed rash to say , that I can imagine that each and all of these great men , to whom I have alluded , might , under more favorable influences , have been greater , wiser , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manliness per . mits for the master geniuses of our race , - a reverence nourished by the fond and never intermitted study of their works , - I may say that I catch , from this very study of their writings and characters , a conception , that , high as they rose , they might have risen higher . I can sometimes behold the soil of the world upon their snow-white robes , and the rust of human passion upon the glittering edge of their wit . It was long ago said by Horace , that the good Homer sometimes nods ; and Shakspeare , the most brilliant example , unquestionably , of a triumph over the defects of education , mental and moral , too often exhibits traces of both . As he floats , on eagle 's wings , along what he nobly calls the brightest heaven of invention , ' he is sometimes borne , by an unchastened taste , into a misty region , where the understanding endeavors in vain to follow him ; and sometimes , as he skims // with the swallow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his power to soar , when he will , up to the rosy gates of the morning , he stoops , and stoops , and stoops , till the tips of his graceful pinions are sadly daggled in the mire . " With these passacres not selected as more than average specimens of Mr. Everett 's manner , we close this notice , regretting the less the scantiness of our extracts , because the entire discourses ought to be studied to feel their power , and will be studied cre long by every well educated man in America .
