is deemed of such vast importance that there is a resort to authority in its support . Theologians are quoted who have thought it would appear liberal to give it their clerical sanction , or some man of letters is referred to , whose opinion has all the more weight from the fact that he has somewhere in his writings paid the Bible a few compliments . And then , again , we have ever and anon the counterpart of the dogma . " The field of the Scriptures is moral truth ; " and this they would wholly separate from the physical ; they would draw a clear line between them not only in their essence , but in all their intimate bearings , and in all the relations they may be supposed to have with each other . All on that side is moral and we give it up to the theologian-all on this side is physical and belongs to us , and we are to determine where , and in what direction , the boundary is to be drawn ; so that if any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarging the one field and diminishing the other . Thus would they run their scientific dissectingknife between these two departments of ontology with as much ease as they would separate the calyx and corolla of a plant , or the fins and scales of a fish . We are not railing at science ; we are not disparaging the devout study of nature . But men should learn to be modest . Especially should they be very modest when they compare the finity  --  the exceedingly minute finity of their knowledge-with the infinity of their ignorance . The caution has been abundantly given to the moralist and the theologian ; but certainly there is some little ground for it in the case of the naturalist . Above all is it necessary in respect to the distinction on which we are here dwelling . What great physical truth is there without a moral bearing ? What is there in nature that does not either shock us by the apparent unmeaningness of its mere physical ends , or run up at last into the domain of ethics and theology ? Are we one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of us more human , others less human , or not human at all ? In short , is there a true human brotherhood in distinction from class resemblances which are only matters of degree , and may as well connect us , nearly or remotely , with any other departments of nature ? Are fraternity , philanthropy , mere figures of speech , grounded on a false etymology , and only other names for relation to " being in general ? " No folly can be greater than that scientific trifling , which would deny to a divine revelation any true authority in deciding such questions as these , and that , too , on the ground that they have no moral bearings . But our limits admonish us that we can not , in our present number , do any thing like justice to the many topics which this question suggests . There is the wide difference between it and the geological issue to which we have already adverted . There is the Bible argument  --  the argument from the letter  --  the argument from the spirit  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christianity . There is the answer to the argument from antiquity which is so confidently put forth , and which needs to be presented in its real force and real dimensions , to show how very little , aside from the Bible , is known of the earliest history of our race . There is , on the other side , the great and unanswerable argument from language . And not least , there is the moral argument derived from a consideration of the tremendous evils , moral , social , and political , that would come from the universal belief of the doctrine of diversity now so zealously advocated . We look upon it , not only as more directly antibiblical and antichristian , but as more inhuman and dehumanizing than any that modern science has yet propounded . The insidious manner in which the issue is urged , and its vast importance in itself , make our apology for presenting such a subject to our numerous Christian readers . WE have never seen sadder nor more anxious faces than those which have surrounded our Chair during the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synonym of life , and health , and beauty , seems to be gradually acquiring a terrible reputation . Whether our hemisphere is slowly drifting southward , and the temperate zone is beginning to wax torrid , it may not be easy to say , but it is certainly very easy to believe . The heat of midsummer is so prodigious that travel must be abandoned , and the happy few who can escape to the sea-shore are alone able to defy Sirius and his rage . Yet from the sea-shore and from all the waterin*-places has arisen a cry of disappointment this year . It is not that Saratoga has not been clean , and Newport cool , nor Cape May refreshing , nor the Virginia springs and the mountains airy-it is not that the charms of landscape and of climate are less than they were-it is not a cry from the parents , but from the children , and not from the children altogether , but from the daughters ; and the cry is " Beaux ! beaux ! " " Where are the men ? " sighed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they knew the fascination so well that they grieved at the lost opportunities of conquest . " Why should we go down ? " pouted Zoe and Una , as they paced indignantly their chambers in the hotel , indignation showing itself to be the best of cosmetics . The alluring waltzes wasted their sweetness upon parlors of dowagers and halls of unpolking promenaders . Passionate Strauss , melancholy Lanner , gay Labitzky , and the Germania composers , pealed and appealed in vain . The listeners saw little actual dancing , but as the strains rose and fell they dreamed of the Wilis , of invisible fairy dancers . In place of their daughters ' dancing , musing mammas surveyed the listless parlors , and remembered their own young balls . Vainly each morning younger and unsuspecting brothers were sent to scan the hotel-books and report of the recent arrivals . Uncertain foreigners , or too-certain natives , were the only record . " It 's a failure  --  a dull season-it 's too bad-it 's mean , " was the unanimous verdict of those congresses of fresh fashions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were where the scene-shifters and the property-men and the machinists are in the theatre . While that delicious dancer , to whom the young men write sonnets and send bouquets , is loving and languishing upon the stage , and bends to the ground in graceful recognition of the universal homage , and falls exhausted upon flowers , then the propertymen , the helpers , the officials who suddenly erect Aladdin 's palaces , and fairy bowers , and lay out endless pleasure-parks and gardens , who create caves glittering with gems , and mysterious passages to incredible delights , in the midst of which the beautiful and popular danseuse achieves her most rapturous successes , are all quietly hidden away behind scenes and under the stage , in dark , // damp , mouldy , smelly places , pulling strings , and watching wires , and shoving slides , and generally maintaining the dear delusion ; themselves , meanwhile , not applauded , quite unsuspected , and not very happy . Now if you say that the places which may he classed under the general head of Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is not this Easy Chair which says so . That simply states that " the men " have been kept away very busily making and arranging the means whereby those airy and alluring morning toilets were made practicable .. Husbands , brothers , and sons have been patiently or impatiently sitting at desks , and poring over books , and running about docks . While Zoe and Una were luxuriously reclining upon the neat yellow linen lining of the calmly-rolling chariot , upon the margin of the sea , or in country love-lanes and sweet-briar-lanes , John and Tom were waiting upon opportunity , and finding it very warm work . They longed to go , as much as Zoe and Una longed for them to come . Their bodies were in offices and counting-ron ins , but their unconfined souls were prancing upon proud horses and bowing gallantly to throngs of beautiful women , or driving the loveliest of ladies in the lightest of wagons with yellow wheels , or lounging in dazzling costume of unsullied white , or with grace and the frantic whirl of musical motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir Richard Lovelace found his mind a kingdom , and the John and Thomas Lovelaces of this summer found their minds a whole round of watering-places , with all the attendant felicities and good fortunes . But there were also sadder men than they this summer , if not wisar . We Americans , who polk through the ball of life with such a rush and so unconcernedly , occasionally discover , to our dismay , that there are other things than speed , and that speed sometimes costs safety . If Aladdin is a wise man , it will sometimes occur to him that a palace which is reared in a night may have some weak sjjot somewhere , and may well repay a little investigation . He will survey it betimes in the morning-he will take lamps about at night-he will feel a little nervous about the children who are lodged in their pleasant nursery in the fifth story . If the beautiful palace s/mould come down ! Just Heavens ! as the sober Frenchmen say , what a crash were there ! Unfortunately , the beautiful palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great is the fall thereof . The man who has been a prince and a king among his fellows , by reason of supposed superiority in their own way  --  the man who runs fastest , and dives deepest , and jumps highest , is suddenly discovered to have done so by machinery , and not by his own unassisted muscles . The respected Aladdin , whose palace was a model of grace and beauty , and reflected equal credit upon his exquisite taste and princely munificence ( see all the papers , and hear all the private conversation ) , is suddenly respected no longer ; no more cards are left at the palace , no more carriages come from the great portal , the palace itself disappears . It is no wonder that society goes silently homeward , and looks with some humility and apprehension upon its own piles , and searches with greater care than ever into the suspected corners , or the spots where weakness is possible . A.When Aladdin 's palace falls , whose house is safe ? You may go to Switzerland , or Newport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . But I must stay and watch . Perhaps my palace is , after all , no palace at all , but a shapely fog-bank , which will curl away and leave me nowhere , and damp , and chilly . Here was Aladdin , whom I honored and loved . Now I do not see him , and his name is a by-word . Go , my dear , to the sea-side , you and the children ; but I will stay at home , and weep and wonder . For if Aladdin 's house goes , then mine may go ; and if his name becomes a reproach - him whom 1 loved and honored-I wish to be more thoughtful , and to walk more humbly . It is a consolation to find that , even with us , loss of character is actually ( of course it is theoretically ) felt as a more fatal misfortune than any merely financial mischance . Yet the tendency of our life is to regard external success as the criterion of real success and genuine power , and there is a mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to have been misplaced . And it can not be concealed that it is the tendency of society-perhaps with just and necessary instinct  --  to condemn and punish the offender to the end and to the utmost . Perhaps it is because we feel what a precarious thing our virtue is , and we shudder at the slightest exposure , as a man in feeble health swears at the thoughtless intruder who opens a window and a draught . Like men balancing swords upon their chins , if one lets his weapon fall , and it strikes him to the heart , the others are nervously angry lest the excitement should unsteady their chins , and suffer death to drop upon them also . Society is an old dowager , whose youth was suspicious , arid whose fame is as dingy as her complexion-who rumples her plumage in fearful flutter , and scowls scornful condemnation when some victim slips away . But there is a better part and a higher aim . There is no nobler effort of literature , and art , and morals than the attempt to forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not deadly . It is surely the greatest and most glorious distinction of contemporary literature , especially fiction , that it is steeped in the very spirit of Christianity-that it teaches sympathy , and forgiveness , and long-suffering . It never occurs to a Criminal Judge , probably , that Christ wept over Jerusalem ; nor to that amiable and charitable thing called " Society , " which is just now discussing the melancholy case of Hero who lived so shamefully with Leander , that He told him who was without sin to cast ' the first stone . " Oh ! yes , " says Society , " of course ; but you would n't have us abolish the Penal Code because we are commanded to love one another ? " Certainly , in your heart . Crime must be punished , and the good of all demands that the guilty suffer . But while he is outlawed and executed by the commonweal , let him not be exiled from your sympathy and your prayers . Even as the Christian minister goes to the condemned cell , and weeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet gives no 1101 ) 0 of earthly pardon , so let your heart go in and minister to every outcast , and prove to him that there is a God , and religion , and generous human love , although he may never before have suspected it , and although he knows that the majesty of law and the safety of society demand that he suffer . It is so easy to be selfish , and hard , and crushing , and to call it virtue and a proper self-respect . But it is the hardest and most solemn of human duties to be loving , humble , and Christian . Perhaps it is on some Sunday morning that you , gentle reader , chance to scan this page . It shall be a soft September day , with sweetness and stillness // in the air , and a tender bloom upon the honzoo . The trees , not yet reddened , wave gently and sigh in the light warm breeze , that , deepened into a cold gale , shall tear them relentlessly from the boughs . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer days . There is that universal repose which lies upon the heart like balm . You hear the church-bells ; you see the slow-moving congregation ; the silence follows , and the sound of hymns . Then comes the sermon and the benediction . What myriad groups of youth and age , of every experience , are every where gathered this solemn morning ! And for how many , many years , in countless congregations , have they all been gathered ! They who come no longer are yet near , and the sound of the singing and the preaching which they shall hear no more floats gently out of the open windows and dies among the graves . What soft , plastic hearts of youths and maidens are beating with hope in the pews ! What graver pulses of age throb with remembrance as the word is spoken ! Consider that every week , in every year , each one of these congregations gathers together , and hears read the life of Christ , and listens to his commands ; and think how hardly sinners are yet judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he fallen . Ah ! Zoe and Una , have mercy and come down into the parlor ! Bethink yourselves in your pouting prettiness and fresh morning dresses , that nothing is so graceful as goodness , nor so beautiful as charity . Nothing will so surely make you a belle , and the queen of love and beauty , as to show that you have both . Men admire gifts , and talents , and accomplishments ; but they love that sweet . ness of nature and character which Adam loved in Eve . Search the records of the most famous successes of belles , and you will find that every man honored the woman who showed that she did not think sarcasm wit , nor heartlessness gayety . Hear what the grandfather of this Easy Chair said to it , when it was no more than a three.legged stool : " Grandson , when I was young , long and long ago , 1 was a beau and loved the sex ; which , as you hope to be an Easy Chair , never fail to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a lively debate about the charms of two rival women at the Springs among the mountains . It was in the days of horseback and saddle-bags , and I put my clean shirt into one bag and my boots into the other , and departed to behold the belles . My son , one was tall , and fair , and like a camelia , when the noonday sun shines upon it . The other was dark , yet like a violet in whose heart the sun nestles . The blonde was brilliant , accomplished , and clever ; the brunette was not . To talk with the blonde was to be lost in admiration among lofty mountains , with graceful and imposing lines and sweeps ; but you longed , after a time , to press them away , and breathe the pure , open , unconfined air and sunshine . To be with the brunette-for you did not talk much-was to be lifted into the serenity of the summer sky , and to exist contented . The men toasted the blonde , and her name was heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comer sought to be presented , and boasted aloud when he had won a smile . But the men thought of the brunette in secret , and pledged her silently , not with wine but with their heart 's worship , and the new comers asked themselves , Am I worthy to be presented ? ' The secret I soon discovered , my grandson , and may you be as astute as your ancestor ! The blonde was devoted to herself , and the bru nette forgot herself . Alas ! that summers will pass . The blonde is now a shriveled old mummy with gold beads around her tawny neck , railing at the world in which she never mated ; the brunette is the comely grandmother of loving and lovely children . " So said my grandfather , who was sadly given to prosing , but whose memory was perfect . You , Zoe and Una , in the absence of new men , have been reading the old books by the sea and among the hills . Is it not the same story in all ? If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grandfather , may dare to suggest what no younger man may , that you have been in love , have you not found that the blondes and the brunettes are much the same ? that men are not very different , and still loudly toast those whom they do not very deeply love , and silently worship the real Divinity of their lives ? Be sure of it ; and be equally sure that the qualities which made the brunette the girl she was , have an immortal excellence , and will make you equally a belle . Think gently , and speak tenderly of those who trip and stumble , and your influence shall make men think and speak so ; and you , even you , Zoe and Una , shall thus do something , and a good thing , toward the happy day of which we all dream ; and so shall you ever be gently and tenderly remembered in the places which your youth and beauty adorned . THE young man of Messrs . Dry , Sly , and Lye , came into our office the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eye . " How about stocks ? " we inquired . " Down , rather , " replied the young man . " Crystal Palace ? " asked we . " Plenty to be had at easy rates , " answered the same young financier , without moving a muscle of betrayal . it was in May that we saw him last . In May , just after the attenuated procession and the inaugural ode and speeches . In May , just as Mr. Barnum had put his shoulder to that sadly-mired wheel , to learn , as it seems , that some things can net be done as well as others . Since the resignation of the President and the fall of stock , we believe , to five per cent. , there has been a liberal display of cheap wit at the expense of the late chief and of the whole undertaking . With peculiar point Mr. Barnum has been advised to confine his attention exclusively to mermaids . With sly and graceful innuendo he has been charged to return to his muttons , meaning woolly horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , twitted with being unable to turn the Crystal Palace into a museum . He has endured the usual reward of unsuccessful effort , the bitter sarcasm and censure of those whom he sought to benefit . Having declined to take stock in the reorganized enterprise , we feel quite at liberty to express our sentiments about the undertaking and its failure . At the most critical moment in the affairs of the institution Mr. Barnum consented to give his name , and prestige , and efforts , to restore the value of the stock and secure the success of the exhibition . He brought to the task familiarity with affairs , financial shrewdness , and good-humored resolution , as well as capital . He undertook it for his own advantage , doubtless , and for that of the stockholders . Mr. Barnum is a business man , and this was a matter of business . The enterprise failed . The President found that he had made a mistake , and resigned . But Homer // has been known to nod , and great generals have retreated . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not succeed in a task that was universally conceded to be impracticable . It is sad to recall the intrepid , but limited band of directors and reverend clergy that marched so gallantly up Broadway in the semi-drizzly May-day , like a forlorn hope heroically charging a breach . The echoes of the inaugural eloquence linger still among the airy arches of the Palace . The boom of the colossal musical congress has not yet died away . It is a still an exhibition , and with a moral . It is a sermon in iron and glass and the collected wares of the world . We inquired of Messrs . Dry , Sly , and Lye 's young man what would be the probable destination of the palace . " The new direction will perhaps hardly imitate the fate of the London prototype of the Palace , and remove it to some suburban Syden-ham ? " The young man looked sagaciously , and said that he had heard no such intention expressed as yet . He did not know what might be done . The resources of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do any thing it might resolve . " Except to make a Crystal Palace succeed ? " interposed we , interrogatively . That very singular leer appeared again in the corner of the eye of the young man of Messrs . Dry , Sly , and Lye . " The senior partner says , " he replied , after a pause , " that it was one of the bubbles of an inflated time . It arose from the extremes of self-confidence and of miserable imitation . The Yankee nation is the most boastful and the most foolishly dependent of any . A Crystal Palace exhibition was equally unnecessary and impracticable at that time and in that place . The glory of the idea had been reaped by England , and the prestige of a successful adaptation of the idea will accrue to France next year . There can not be a World 's Fair every year , exsept under very different conditions from those that were deemed sufficient in our Crystal Palace enterprise . it is to be seen whether the Sydenham building will succeed as a speculation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in the best and most admirable manner . Site , convenience of access , facility of observation , intelligence of classification , all these things have been duly considered and arranged . It enjoys the aristocratic prestige which is so much the secret of success of all things English . It is truly a representative exhibition of the world , and it is visited by twenty thousand persons a day . This may not be a pecuniary , but it is a popular , success . It is impossible not to feel that an exhibition so visited is exerting some kind of influence , and an influence toward good things . We have never had the consolation of that conviction-no man has felt that our Crystal Palace was , except to a very few persons , more than a curious show-box . The reason of the utter failure is to be sought in the fact that the whole thing was unreal , it was an imitation , it was an ill-considered speculation . But the event ought not to be regarded as a final failure of all such enterprises among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can achieve our ends only by obeying the peculiar bent of our own genius and the structure of our society , " etc. , etc. , etc. , said Messrs . Dry , Sly , and Lye 's young man sententiously . " You have a very wise man for senior partner , " said we , with great reverence . " Mr. Dry is usually so considered , " replied the young man , sedately . " Mr. Dry is well named , " we said , with anisnation . " I am said to resemble him , " answered the youth . " In conversation , certainly , " rejoined we , with imperturbable gravity . " You do n't care to take a few shares ? " asked he . To such an inquiry a bland smile was the best and most ready reply . The young man took his hat . " Have you ever heard of the South Sea ? " asked we . " I have heard the name , " he answered . " Do you know its peculiarity ? " " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen out . " " Yes " Good-morning ! Easy Chair . " " Good-morning , sir , and pray remember us par . ticularly to Messrs . Dry , Sly , and Lye . " Their young man walked slowly away down town ; but as they are sure to try all kinds of fancy stocks , we shall apprise our readers if any thing of the Crystal Palace kind is afloat . If we could have sat in our Easy Chair at all the College Commencements to which we have been bidden during the Dog-days , how much we should have to report to our readers . But we have been struggling to ascertain the occult relation between midsummer heats and literature . It is notorious that the tropics are not favorable to the development of literary genius ; that , in fact , the colder climates are favored by the Muses . Yet the annual festivals of the Muses , with us , are celebrated upon the arid heights of the year . What was said of one orator is true of all : " His audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because youth is " the time of roses , " that the triumphs of its literary power culminate in summer ? It is surely worth a thought . It might not be an unpromising theme for a graduate 's oration . But we can not enlarge upon it . We simply did not go to the Commencements . We staid in our chair . It was warm . By much sitting in the Dog-days the cushiong of Easy Chairs , even , do become warm . We sat there , brooding , as it were-hatching , if you please  --  a whole brood of pleasant and melancholy remembrances . Charles Lamb lamented , in his quaint and pensive way , that he had been defrauded of the sweet fruit of academic instruction . Elia has made " Oxford in the Vacation " almost as memorable , certainly as romantic , as ever it was in triumphant term-time , to the most reckless and generous of Gentlemen-Commoners . These early associations , these young friendships , based upon humane and sympathetic grounds , founded in a common interest in things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tumults of business , politics , and affairs in general , have an indefinable charm , and you will find a man 's heart soften , even after it had grown very hard indeed , when an appeal comes from a college friend , a chum , a contemporary . We , whose collegiate days are dim already in the past , yet whose heart bounds  --  to use the old figure - like that of the old war-horse at the sound of the trumpet , whenever an anniversary , or a letter , or a chance friend recalls them , stoutly but sadly declined all invitations this summer , until one came // in the sweetest month of the year . To hear that summons was to obey . It was not to a solemn Commencement , nor to a College Society , nor to that melancholy association of the Alumni which rises upon the horizon of every college festivity as a memento mon , but to the parting celebration of the Class , to the festival of Hope rather than of Memory . We hurried to worship the rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sadness . In youth all emotions are intense . We have not yet learned to doubt the duration of our feeling in the very moment of its mastery over us . It lies now a gentle picture in the past . So soon , so rapidly , does Time snatch up completed events , and hang them along the twilight gallery of memory . There were peals of morning music , a winding procession under memorial trees and along sunny paths-there was the eager , happy crowd in the hall ; wise collegians sad with profound experience ; lovely girls unconscious that they were filling old parts in a play that their grandmothers play . ed ; anxious fathers , pleased mothers , fluttering sisters-there was soft summer air stealing in at open windows , the waving of fans , the long and warm expectation : then the bursts of approaching music , and the rush and tumble of the crowd outside . 0 happy orator in flowing robes ! Grave , gay , and graceful , his discourse proceeds . Resounding applause , flashing eyes , flushing cheeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an army . He reviews the eventful college course . It is an epic of punches surreptitiously consumed-of tyrannical laws dexterously evaded . Four years of fun , of cloudless sun , to which occasional recitations and necessary chapels supply the shadow . What duties lie before us ! We are quitting the tranquil and flowery shores of youth , and now our barques head for the uncertain ocean . We are exchanging romance for reality ; our visions are ending . We have beennaughty boys-yes , Amanda , with blue violets in your muslin bonnet ! - we have been dissipated , and have done indescribable things . To us , dear companions , whose movements are awkward in the novelty of body-coats , worn this day for the first time in life  --  to us the destiny of our glorious country is intrusted . Farewell , venerable shades ! Farewell , venerable maids ! whose patience as landladies we have tried so sorely . Farewell , venerated and beloved instructors , our affection is ardent as we part forever ! Farewell , groves of Academe , classic Jenkinaville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and heart to heart , tearfully we turn from scenes so dear , and plunge headlong into " Fifty gallons of punch are ordered for the graduating supper to-night , ' exclaimed an alumnus of twenty years standing , just as we were breath . lessly imbibing the peroration of the oration . But we saw the final gesture , the sweeping sleeve , the animated eye , the pleased consciousness of success as the orator sank into his seat , and enthusiastic plaudits drowned the waltz of Lanner that began to breathe from the band . Then the poem-perhaps you have heard college poems . Possibly you know that the poet has large collars and discursive extremities to his cravat . How the puns explode along the line ! It is like the broadside of Nelson at Trafalgar , one blaze of glory . This Easy Chair must be allowed to envy the poets , the occasional poets . They shall not live , possibly , in Little and Brown 's edition , nor be annotated by Professor Child , most accomplished and sympathetic of Editors . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fate fairer than that of flies embalmed in amber ? Sing on undauntedly , occasional Commencement poets ! and believe that you do not sing in vain . Years hence some comely matron will recall this day , and crown you anew with laurel yet ungrown . Believe in yourselves , in your poetry , and in the Future . But not gay only , nor grotesque , are the chords struck by the associations of the day . There is dancing afterward upon the green , in the ball , around the tree , perhaps . There is music-there may be moonlight promenades , flirtations , weeping , passionate adieus before the " fifty gallons , " etc. etc . The pale stars at early dawn may see paler facesyouth eclipsed ; the wild serenade may fall mournfully upon the ears of love and longing ; but the day is enshrined and immortal . They go sadly homeward , the youth that were so gay ; and they who have never truly suffered feel the prescience of sorrow . They sit upon the bedside with a vague longing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexplicable grief . It is not an immortal sorrow . They are all better next morning . There even comes a time when they smile at the sentimentality of which they were the victims . But the day never dawns when they do not confess that the sorrow was as real as any sorrow they have known . " You were deluded , jeane homme , " says Madame Sangfroid in Paris , years afterward , when the youth confesses his regret . " Madame Sangfroid , is be most deluded who believes every thing , or he who doubts every thing ? " " C'est an dr6le de philosophe ! " replies Madame , adjusting her ear-rings . In a country like ours we can not ever-estimate the value and influence of these college reunions . They are almost the only festivals consecrated to intellectual sympathy . Our dinners and suppers and celebrations have all reference to some political , or financial , or sectarian bond . But a Commencement is the feast of the intellect . However fast and furious our lives may be , we are annually reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , and more satisfactory than the kind of success we are pursuing . It is the reunion of friendship and genial sociality . Men are but children . Under your whiskers and wrinkles your college chum sees the old boy . We are barricaded with business , with families , and grave affairs ; but we are boys at heart , or we ought to be ; and nothing more tends to keep feeling perennially fresh , than the annual meeting of those who were boys together . SoME months since we noted the incredulity with which the French press received the reported discovery of the " viviparous fish " of California . Even the great authority of Agassiz was not sufficient to convince the skeptical Gauls that so notable an exception to the general law of nature had been brought to light . But Mr. Jackson and Professor Agassix were right , and the doubters were all wrong . And what is still more strange , the fish is a very common one in the Golden Land . " They are , " writes a San Francisco correspondent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weighing from a few ounces up to two pounds . The average weight of those to be seen daily in our markets is some three-fourths of a pound . " Hundreds and thousands of persons have caught and dressed and eaten of these fish . Many of them must have seen the " bag subdivided // internally into a number of distinct pouches , " in which a score or so of young were wrapped up , and cunningly packed away , heads and tails , so as to save space . Yet until Mr. Jackson made his chance-cast , no man ever thought it worth his while to notice the singular fact . The name Embiotica.Jacksenii , bestowed by Agassiz upon this fish , will perpetuate in the scientific world the memory of ALONZO C. JACKsON , the young naval officer who brought to light this new fact in natural history . But there are many who will need no memorial of him , besides the remembrance of his rare worth and brilliant promise . At the very time when his discovery was made , he was laying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly life . Dispatched by Government to California upon important business , in his eagerness to bring it to a speedy and successful conclusion , he overpassed the limits set to human endurance . The overtasked system sank under the effort ; a disease of the brain ensued , and he returned to his home to die . One who knew him well thus writes : " Young as he was " ( he died at the age of eight-and-twenty years ) , " he had already won for himself a distinguished name in his profession . There was no brighter intellect , no purer spirit , no nobler nature than his ; no resolution more undaunted , no ambition more chastened , no love more true . Nature had gifted him with such versatility of talent and with so earnest a love of investigation , that few things escaped his keen and accurate observation , or failed to contribute to his improvement and delight . Hence arose that rich cultivation in every department of science and art , and that even and beautiful balance of mind which made him so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshness to his conversation . " OUR FOREIGN GOSSIP . WE are fatigued this month ; we admit it ; we ask favor ; we plead the heat , we plead the dust ; in short , we will plead any thing that our courteous readers will admit . We shall serve them , as we served them last month , with a letter from a friend . He has a keen eye ; he is truthful ( as the French reckon truthfulness ) . We shall let him talk for himself-only premising that in the translation ( for our friend is Parisian ) we have worried his deft French phrases into our own home-sounding English . " Bah , " he begins , " what weather ! Do not fancy that any ordinary days , or even weeks , of rain can have led me into such outcry at the very beginning of my sheet . But what do you say to two months of cloud-of drizzle-of cold-of wind-of sour temper-of quarrelings between man and wife ? We are now in the front half of July , and , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway flagging under the sultriness of August , 1 do assure you I have seen the sun but ten times in as many weeks . " If you doubt my story , look in the papers ; for though they are closely muzzled on all weightier topics , they still venture an opinion about the weather . There are hints even that one or two divorce affairs are on the tapis , by reason of the illblood which has grown out of the clouded weeks . I put it to you , as a man of some philosophical discernment , if a lady who has expended a matter of ten thousand francs on spring dresses , and finds no day on which she can wear them , until midsummer and the grisettes have made them old , is in the cultivation of a meek temperament ? Nor is this the worst . What would you say of trunks packed in May , for Aix-la-Chapelle or Baden , and the tedium of the leaden sky keeping the fair proprietress in the winter rooms until August has fairly burst ? Is there not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Silkmercer kept back a fortnight from her corner parlor at Saratoga ( engaged in March ) until the good set ' she counted on meeting is on the wing , would not your male friend Mr. Silkmercer suffer drearily for the mishap " Women ( trust my word for it ) are very much the same thing all over the world ; and nothing so sharpens their tongues as a leaden sky hiding the blossom of the spring . " But again , the matter has affected the stockmarket . The barometer has been quoted on the Bourse ! A gleam of sunshine has carried up the funds like a Turkish victory , and a wet-jacket has brought them down like a new manifesto from Nicholas . The speculators have made good play upon the weather fears of the stockholders ; and the French Bear ' has latterly made his appearance wrapped in a Mackintosh , and has taken the precaution to hold his umbrella under the pump ( if no ramn was falling ) , and has talked in a despondent way of the crops , and of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otlmer hand , eager for a rise , has sported white duck trowsers-concealing his shiver with a small glass of Cognac-and , with a blue-and-white cravat , has talked sportively of the heat , and of the pleasant reports from the provinces . " Still another play of the stock-dealers I must tell you of , and with the story drift away from the weather . A broker ( who would have done credit to Wall Street ) was speculating for a fall ; it did not come so soon as he had hoped ; in two days his stock limit expired ; news was favorable ; every thing looked badly for his bargain . He bethought himself of a last resource . He laid his scheme open to a friend from the provinces , who was unknown on the Bourse . He purchased for him a crimson cap with a blue tassel , he ordered a straight-breasted frock , in the manner of the Turkish legation , he hired a magnificent equipage , and agreed with him that just before the hour for the closing of the Bour'me he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent , and order the immediate sale of a large amount of the three per cents . " At the given hour the provincial friend , en grande tenue as a Turkish official of high rank , drove to the Bourse , and ordered the immediate sale of the large amount of stocks which the broker had put in his hands . " People whispered unquietly ; the stranger passed with many for the Turkish embassador himself ; at least he was attached to the legation ; he must be in the possession of disastrous news ; there could be no doubt of it . The sales multiplied ; a panic seized the dealers ; there was a fall of ten per cent. : and our shrewd broker , standing ready , bought up enough to make good his bargain , and to furnish his provincial friend of the crimson cap with salmon , spring-chickens , and Clmnteau Margaux at the Trois Fr*res Provent*aux . " Apropos of the weather , you can not imagine what a cut.throat air belongs to the little countryplaces ( Maisons de Campagne they call them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet sky as this of 1854 . French country is made for sunshine ; its parterres , its gravel walks , its clipped trees , its dwarfed hollies , its extinguisher.eopped houses , want sunlight . Without it , the weeds shoot up in the grass , dampness rests in the hollows of the walk , // the peacock trees shiver like ghosts , and the tiled tower-tops look exceeding dismal . And the people are dismal in them . " You , and your friend , and your friend 's friend , have got a country-place-perhaps at Hoboken , perhaps at Flushing-where you go and enjoy ( barring the mosquitoes ) a month or two , between July and September . But it is not the French way : if you speak of Baden , or Homburg  --  a la bonne heure ! This will do . Dress and intrigue and chitchat go thither , and these three make any spot enjoyable to a Parisian born . As for the little outlying extinguisher-topped houses of which I spoke , they are rented , sometimes by an economic family of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who teaches Frenchisms , and suffers Englishisms . Or perhaps the suburban place is in the hands of one of your countrymen , who keeps a coach , and a coachman and footman in very broad gilt bands . ( By the way , I have remarked that your people specially love a bread gilt band : how is this ? ) " Again , the out-of-town house belongs to an honest bourgeois , who has boats of friends , and who goes into the country three months in the year to economize ; and one of the Paris paragraphists tells latterly a funny story of this sort of economy , which , for want of better things , I will set down in my letter . " The good bourgeois Didier , for the sake of a nice retrenchment in the year 's outgoings , took a cottage ernie at St. Germain . A week went well ; and though the whey and the curds , and the plain boiled-meat and greens , were not altogether so satisfactory as the cuisine of the town , yet there was a saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Sunday came . It is a capital visiting day , is Sunday ; especially for those who take a short run in the country for a breath of fresh air , and who have a friend with a quiet terrace of his own , where one may smoke an evening cigar . Well , at noon the bell of the Didier cottage rang . It was a bourgeois friend . Madame Didier took courage at finding him alone , and welcomed him kindly , and hoped Madame his wife was well . " Parfaitement-perfectly well , ' he said , and had loitered away with his sister-in-law , but they would both follow him presently , and his two little boys , whom he had brought out for a country freshening . " Madame Didier looked hard at Monsieur Didier , and bit her lip . " When one receives a visitor in the country , one asks ( or should ask ) them to dine . It is the way hereabout . ( 1 hope it is the way with you . ) The bourgeois friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wife , and the wife 's sister , and the little ones , threw off their hats , and made the Didier cottage and the Didier walks their own . " But the Didiers had other friends ; and in an hour there was a new touch at the bell . Madame Didier recognized in a fright the voice of a town neighbor , and overheard him assuring her husband that he had no idea of forgetting him-not he . It was a sorry thing to be shut up in a lonely country house ; he should look in upon him from time to time ; he might perhaps bring , from time to time , a friend or two ; he begged to present Monsieur Soaker , a cousin of his wife 's : he thought Monsieur Didier had a charming little place . Nor was this all : acquaintances multiplied , until Madame Didier had a round company of thirteen - all to dine , as a matter of course . The lady of Vor , . IX-No. 52. -N N the cottage , in concert with her economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pot of greens for the dozen guests . The French have a happy art in this thing ; and although the dinner might be somewhat maigre ( there is no translating that word ) , it would yet fill the dishes , and discourage future Sunday visits . " Monsieur Didier undertook , with French politesse , to explain the matter to his friends ; he regretted exceedingly that he had been taken by surprise ; he feared he should have but a short dinner for them ; but , at that distance from Paris , it was exceedingly difficult to provide as he should be gratified in doing . " The guests , of course , would listen to no apologies . His old neighbor  --  a plethoric , red-faced man-knew it would all be quite well ; he knew his old friend Didier ; he was not the man to send a guest hungry from his table ; he was preparing a surprise for them ; he had no doubt , for his own part , that he ( Didier ) had sent down to Paris by telegraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Didier on the back in a very familiar manner . " Monsieur Didier , in a disturbed state , retired to consult anew with his wife . In the midst , however , of their consultation , the Didier bell sounded for the fifth time . The new visitor was a gentleman of importance  --  a valued friend , Baron  --  M. Didier was largely indebted to him , and was just now looking for his interest in behalf of his business schemes . It would never do to serve the Baron with a pot of greens . There was nothing to be done but to make a virtue of the joke of the bourgeois neighbor , and to telegraph to a Paris restaurateur for a dinner for fourteen . " Of course the dinner was capital ; the visitors were charmed ; the bourgeois neighbor , more plethone than before , grew hilarious in recalling his prediction . He knew his friend Didier . He should visit him again . " The hint was not lost upon Madame Didier ; and the curtain talk of the economic bourgeois couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hundred francs , ended in a resolution to go to the Springs . " The next Sunday the plethoric neighbor of M. Didier appeared at the Didier gate , and rang , and wiped the perspiration from his forehead ; and rang , and wiped his forehead again . He looked through the bars , and then stepped to the corner , and walking back to the entrance , rang again more stoutly . He next tried the gate , casting his eye up in search of the fastenings . There was a placard over his head , and stepping back a pace or two , he read a notice that the cottage was to rent . " Dame , ' said the plethoric man , naus *tion.s trap ! ' " " Tins matter of dinners is reminder ofa pleasant joke which used to be told about the Abb6 Prevost , who was a great gourmand , and specially fond of artichokes ( not your heavy Jerusalem artichokes ) , a i/mile-that is to say , with a dressing of oil . His friend Fontenelle was as great a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artichokes-with a dressing of butter . It happened once on a day that they were to dine together . The Abbi entreated that the artichokes should be served a ihuile ; his friend was as urgent that they should be served with butter . They arranged the difficulty by ordering half in one style and half in the other . But before the dinner was served the friend of the Abbi fell suddenly ill ; // he grew pale ; slipped from his chair ; groaned ; was dead ! The Abb6 was shocked ; lifted the head of his poor friend ; felt his pulse ; saw that it was over ; rushed into the outer room , exclaiming , Les artichauts-tous d i/wile ! ' Let all the artichokes be served with oil ! ' " It is of course not the sort of story to he thoroughly vouched for , hut yet it is a good story , and a characteristic story . Another one , in the same fashion , I think can be fully authenticated . I may say indeed that I have myself had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty woman she is . " Her name is Laura , and she had a pretty friend who shared her phaeton nearly every day , in the pleasant drives through the Bois dc Boulogne . On a certain occasion , not very far back , there was to be an extraordinary performance at the Grand Opera ; tickets were in great demand , and stalls were hardly to be found for favor or money . The friend of Laura had , however , by some special manouvre , secured a billet for a first circle stall . She rode with Laura upon the evening of the grand performance , wearing the pink billet stuck boastingly in her corsage . " They had accomplished half the circuit of the Bois de Boulogne , when Laura was shocked at the sight of a deadly pallor which overspread the countenance of her friend . She spoke to her , but the friend did not reply . There was no doubting the urgency of the case ; the friend had been threatened with a disease of the heart ; the blow had come she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her expiring friend , drove back to her lodgings , and was at the play in the evening ! " And this is the philosophic way in which Parisians deal with life and with death . " The other day  --  a week is not gone since the event  --  a pretty girl threw herself into the Seine . There was nothing unusual in seeing a cast-away creature floating on the turbid , spring flow of the Paris river . But the girl in question was very beautiful and young . Her hair flowed in ringlets on the yellow water , and her dress showed that she had lived in the enjoyment of wealth . About her neck was a blue ribbon , and to the ribbon was attached a paper carefully guarded against all harm from the wet , and reading somewhat in this way : You can not find me out . I live far away from the city ; am miserable , and therefore I wish to die . My mother died when I was young-would to God she had lived ! My father married again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ; and when she came to have children of her own , I was no more than a servant in the house , where I was before so happy . And now my father is turned against me ; what is there left now to live for ? " My father , and this other mother he has given me , will find my story in the papers , and they will read this last farewell of mine . He will relent , I know he will , and be sorry he could not say adieu to the child he once loved , or save her from so dreadful fate . But it is too late now . I hope he may be happy . It is all I have to say ; and may God have mercy on me ! ' " Does not this sort of philosophy grow very naturally out of the reading of Balzac , and Eugene Sue , and Dumas ? Let your Editor of the serious part tell us ; and tell us further , if the cheap reissue of such literature will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will think-like this poor girl-they commit great acts of heroism in jumping into deep and dirty wa ter ? If this were the place for it , I might drop a hint here , moreover , about the copy-right affair , which seems now to be swallowed up in Cuba and in Russia . Query : Why not pass it , and so publish nothing but what is worth paying for ? Cheap things are always dear in the end . " AND while I am in this half-sermon way of talk about French morals and philosophy , pray let me ask you , have you seen M. Veron 's last volume of his Bourgeois Life ? You know who M. Veron is-late proprietor of the Constitutiennel , and former manager of the French opera  --  a man who has dined with princes and coquetted with Duchesses ; who has handled his hundreds of thousands , and been closeted with political strategists ; a man of an easy , gossiping pen , and a very dining-out way of chit-chat ; a man who had reputation for shrewdness , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad odor with Louis Napoleon , and was determined to devote himself thereafter to gossip and filets . Well , this last volume of his descends to discussion about the habits and natural history of opera-girls , both dancing and singing . I think he inclines , on the score of morals , to the former ; for the reason that they do not desert their children when they have them . Indeed , it is quite curious to see how the 01 ( 1 gentleman discusses the domestic habits of these forlorn creatures ; clothing them in very bright-colored hues ( as if he thought of assuming again operatic direction ) ; praising their good parts ; speaking kindly of their little weaknesses regretting cavalierly the informality of their marriages ; but never telling us a word of the old age of the wretched creatures whom he treats so coquettishly with his pen . lndeed , it is a subject not apt to be treated on byfeuilletonists , or Parisian writers of any stamp . Indeed it would be a queer subject ; 1 fling it out as a bait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opera-girls and grisettes " Do they ever reach age ? Or what becomes of them all ? Did a man ever see a gray-haired grisette ? Will the suicides tell us any thing of it , or the stone tables of the Dead House ? " AMoNo other matters ofgossip , let me set down this . A pretty woman , young , and only three years a wife , has latterly set a certain quarter of the town agog by deserting her husband ; and , after being ferreted out of a suburban convent , she has stoutly declared she will never go back to him , and an action for divorce is brought , at trial of which the quidnunca may find a world of fat gossip . " The truth is , the wife is young , and has just now inherited a great fortune from her father . The husband is old and titled . He has fulfilled his part of the marriage-bargain , in giving his title ; she wishes to enjoy the title without giving him the money . It is to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unlike , which is nearer to a ripening . " The fat wife of a pursy broker found herself not long ago a widow , with one daughter , and a vast fortune . The broker had been a sensible man in his way , and never sought for other connections than were fitting and agreeable to his tastes ; he had hoped to marry his daughter some day to an honest bourgeois , who would be kind , and take good care of her fortune . The widow , however ( who had the misfortune to inherit a more sonorous family name than belonged to her bourgeois husband ) , was ambitious . She // formed grand designs for her daughter , and took means to carry them into effect . The girl was pretty ; her wealth was known ; and there are always a plenty of broken-down old Counts hanging round the dark streets of the Faubourg St. Germain , who are quite willing to bargain their noblesse for the possession of youth , beauty , and money . They can hardly be thought to lose much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such old gentlemen have a very keen scent for American heiresses . I can not say justly whether this be so or not . however , the daughter of our broker 's widow found an eligible admirer in a certain Count L- , who , though not absolutely reduced , was still in a position that eminently needed the bolstering capacity of the dowry of the pretty daughter of the dead broker . " The mamma was satisfied with the aristocratic resonance of the Count 's name , and with a little coyly managed difficulty gave her consent to his proposals of marriage . " In short , the affair was accomplished , and Madame the widow of the broker could speak proudly of her daughter , the Countess L - a very pretty thina to he sure . " But the Count L was a man of the world and of mode . He took occasion to say to the mother-in-law , in a quiet way , shortly after the ceremony - My dear Madame , we shall be very happy to see you here on occasion in a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up occasionally on a drive ; but you will perceive , Madame , that when we have society it would be excessively awkward to announce you . ' And the Count appealed to the good sense of his mother-in-law , insisting strongly upon the p rvenu character of the name she bore . The old lady , indeed , was not insensible to the difficulties which her husbands name threw in her way she relieved herself by dropping it altogether , and , assuming her own family-name , ventured the prefix of Countess . With this change , she appealed boldly to the generosity of her son-in-law . The son-in-law , never forgetting that a million or two of inheritance was in prospect from the worthy dame , overlooked the informality of the old lady 's action , and consented that , as a Countess , she should enjoy free eurr*r of his salon . " A night of entertainment arrived , and the old lady made her appearance in the antechamber in the richest brocades of the day . It happened that a certain Duchess arrived at precisely the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were opened , and the Duchess being announced , entered with a magnificent rustle of silk and of feathers . The doors were closed after her ; a single one was then opened , and the Countess ( the broker 's wife ) was announced . The poor lady was excessively annoyed by the distinction made between herself and the Duchess in the matter of the doors . She made an angry appeal to her son-in-law , and received this very satisfactory explanation : My dear H idaine. among your people of the Boone , money is every thing ; but with us , we keep alise certain distinctions of rank ; thus , the double doors of the s ilon are thrown open for Princesses and Duchesses while Countesses and Baronesses enter by a sin Ic one . Pray , my dear Madarse , be content with -s single door . ' But the widow of the broker was ambitious ; she h-id ibree millions : it is a large sum any where , cop ci illy so to the Faubourg St. Germain . The old 1 oily h-id already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She addressed herself , in confidence , to her former agent . Three millions and a fat widow were in the market ; nothing but a dukedom would secure the prize . The agent was active and zealous , for the percentage on such arrangements is always large . " An old Duke in the country presently came to his knowledge , who had expended the greater part of his estate in unfortunate bets at Chantilly . Negotiations were opened ; the Duke declared that with three millions , he would accept any woman he wanted no description ; it was quite useless . " In this way the affair was arranged in the most harmonious manner , the reversion of the widowe estate lying in the husband 's family . " When the Count L gave his next entertainment ( for the matter had been quietly managed ) , the widow-bride was invited under the old false title of Countess . She gave , however , her trite address to the footman of the antechamber ; and , with a magnificent entry through the double doors , was announced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blank old Duke . " The Count L felt a pang ; not for ny flaw in the forms , but in the thought that the opening of the double doors had cost him three millions ol francs ! " I ought to mention , perhaps , that the parties to this story are not American . " ANo now I will clinch this story with another , which , if it be true , will more than take away the satiric edge from the last . I must freely admit , however , that it has not one half of the same air of vraisemblance , and seems altogether too romantic to be true . This is the way it begins : A great many ol the poor Germans who come from Bavaria and the Rhenish provinces , to find a new home in the far away prairies by Wisconsin , pass through Paris . They arrive by the railway from Strasbourg , and usually traverse the city on foot , to reach the station of the Havre Railway , which is in an opposite quarter of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thronged portion of the Boolevard-passing dowis from the Porte St. Martin as far oftentimes as the Place de ha Madaleine . It is an interesting , and yet a melancholy sight , to see the poor outcasts from their own German land , in all the quaint fashions of frock and head-dress , which have outlasted centuries , trooping along in the middle of the gayest scenes of Paris-exiled forever from one home , and wholly uncertain where the future one will be . " Of course , never before in their lives have they seen such beautiful sights as meet their eye upoti the Paris streets ; and therefore they linger along the walks , prying eagerly into shop-windows-turning to gaze at a passing equipage-staring in wonderment at the brocaded ladies . " Not long ago there lingered a group of this kind at the showy shop-front of the Messrs . Goupil and Vibert-looking eagerly in at the pictures of Russian soldiers , of English horses , and Swiss mountsins , which always keep a crowd at the door .. Ammiong the lookers-on in this German group was a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her country , and more intent than any upon the pictures ofwide-apart scenes , which hung within the shopman 's window . Indeed so intent was she that she did not notice the leave of her companions , but remained rapt in the contemplation of a little Swiss-valley view , which recalled to her very fondly the land she had left behind her forever . // " Recovering herself presently , she looked around for her companions : up and down the street she looked vainly . She could not tell which way she had come ; her head was turned by the busy crowd around her . She ran fast , hoping to overtake them ; but , by a natural enough error , she ran in the wrong direction . On and on she flew , growing nervously excited as she went , until her eye caught sight of a group of people down a side-street , whom she thought she recognized as her own . She ran swiftly toward them , only to be thoroughly frightened by her mistake . Her head was completely turned . She appealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could comprehend her Alsatian dialect . Some smiled at her ; others , thinking her a beggar , offered her money ; still others met her wild look with insulting gestures . " From these she turned and ran madly away . The train her party was to take left at five ; the ship was to leave Havre the following day . Utterly fatigued and disheartened , the poor girl presently heard a clock strike five . She could sustain herself no longer , but fell with a groan upon the pavement . A crowd immediately gathered around . A lady who was passing ( I would give her name if I knew it ) ordered her carriage to be stojped , and interested herself in inquiries about the poor stranger ; no person could tell any thing of her . " The lady , attracted by her appearance , or directed by the impulses of a naturally sympathetic nature , ordered her to be placed in her carriage , and drove with her to her own home . The best inedical advice was obtained , and an interpreter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was too late now to follow her party , if she had chosen . A fever , moreover , had seized upon the poor child , and kept her fast in the wilds of a delirium for weeks . Phen she raved in her Alsatian tongue about the wooded hills and the sweet brooks of her green Alsatia-lost to her forever ! Or , with a change in her wild flights of fancy , she seemed to be following down the gay Paris streets her lost companions ; they sweeping out of reach , and out of sight before , and she crying out despairingly for them to stop one little moment . " But the fever passed ; health came to the poor girl again ; and she told her story intelligibly to the kind lady who had befriended her . The father and the mother were both dead ; it was with kind kinspeople that she was going beyond the water to find a home . She might go now , and find them if she would ; but the lady who had cared for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home floated dreamily over her bed , was now dearer to her than the kinspeople . She wished to stay and serve her : and the lady , not slackening her kindnesses , would make no servant of her ; but employed for her the best teachers of Paris , and grafted on her graceful Alsatian songs the finish of the metropolitan schools . " The fair-faced stranger , so bright , so rich in color , so coquette with her own native graces , drew the attention and the remark of all the evening promenaders in the Bois de Boulogne . Her name received such addition as made her pass for the young kinswoman of her kind benefactress , and she treated her always as a child . People knew that a large dowery would belong to the fair Alsatian stranger ; and whether it was this or her own graces I can not tell ( nobody ever can ) , she was wooed by a brave suitor , who succeeded in his suit , and in a week ta-day ( I write on Thursday ) she is to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty one ; is it not ? " I wish with all my heart it were true . " WELL-what next ? Are you tired of gossip ? While speaking of gossip , I feel a little curious to know if the American branch of the Bonapartes , by reason of their citizenship and quietude at home , are out of the reach of print-talk ? How seems it to you ? Or is yourcuriosity to know what the Prince Jerome has made of them so great as to overbear all your notions of delicacy ? It is odd , by-the-by , how curiosity , or interest , or what not , will at times overrun and drown all common notions which we live by , and pin our faith to ordinarily . I was struck by it the other day , in taking up a late ( to me ) copy of that staid old journal , the Evening Pest-immensely conservative and proper , as we all know . Well , what should I see in the Evening Post but a long programme of an approaching marriage ( it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea by ellision ) , with as many names ofbriclesmaids and groomsmen as ever appeared in a Saratoga letter of the Herald ! I must confess that I rubbed my eyes . It seemed to me droll . That the elegant old conservator of proprieties  --  the highly respectable Evening Post , should chronicle such a matter , seemed to me most extraordinary . Just the journal ( I had thought ) to forbear mention of names in speaking even of the approaching marriage of the Emperor of France , or of the young Princess of England ; just the one to squat upon its stateliness in the matter of kingdoms , and to soar always in an elegant cloudregion of high conservatism . " I come back now to my montons . The American Bonapartes are living , like any and all good American citizens , at a Paris hotel . You will agree with me that they show their good sense in this , and have done wisely ( supposing them unwilling to fling off their other-side citizenship ) , to decline the Prince 's invitation to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , to be sure , from day to day ; and a crowd of idle ones in the palace-court have gathered in the evening to have a look at the citizens Bonaparte enjoying their cigars upon the palace terrace . " It would seem , and does seem to many , that a lithe young scion of the Imperial house ( albeit there may lie a cross in the grain from the old Imperial divorce ) may yet be very available in view of the present circumstances ; for the heir-apparent , the Prince Napoleon , is certainly a most heavy-headed man , and has nothing but his striking likeness to his uncle to make him in any way a man of mark . Would it not be a strange play of fate if the next Emperor of France were to be the son of an Amer. ican lady , and educated at West Point ? " In that event , I suppose we might look forward to the growth of a Baltimore nobility ; and I should not lie greatly surprised to find every inhabitant of Maryland ( even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking on a title " Have you noticed Thackeray 's quiet hit at ax Honorable Major General Poker , of Cincinnati , residin* in Paris ? It makes a body wince to confess it , but there is not only one , but a great many Major General Pokers in Paris , from the United Statesnot only of the army , but of the navy-not only of the navy , hut of the militia  --  and not only of the militia , hut of the New York target-corps ! Upon my honor I confess to you , that I have been more awed in the presence of the dashing foot . // men attached to American carriages than even in that of the Emperor himself . " I have nothing more to tell you for this month ; so , adieu . "
