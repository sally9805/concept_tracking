txt ART . JY. - THE TRUE SUCCESS OF HUMAN LIFE . Thoughts for a Young Man ; a Lecture delivered before the Boston Mercantile Library Association . By HORACE MANN . Boston : Ticknor , Reed &amp; Fields , 1852 . Address on the Education of Woman , delivered at the Anniversary of the Pittsfield Young Ladies Institute . By RAY PALMER , D. D. Albany : Gray , Sprague &amp; Co. , 1852 . TEE first of these addresses has been so long before the public , and has had so large a circle of hearers and of readers , that a detailed description of it would be quite superfluous . It is written with the characteristic rapidity and fervor of Mr. Mann 's style , and utters lessons concerning manliness , integrity , and true mental accomplishment , to which every young man may wisely give heed . It is a signal excellence in its author , and it invests his name with an honor more clear and durable than any to be won in the political arena , that he estimates so justly and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the enthusiastic and indefatigable Secretary of the Board of Education in Massachusetts will be freshly rernembered , when the congressional career of Mr. Mann , for all the services he has rendered in it to liberty and truth , shall have been lost from sight in the swift succession of political events . The address of Dr. Palmer , on the education of woman , is more recent . It is carefully and gracefully written ; and presents with discrimination , yet with earnestness too , the true import and method of female culture . The evangelical spirit which claims distinct expression at the close , pervades its whole extent . And we have not lately met an address , of the nature and aims of this , that has seemed to us more happily adapted to its occasion , or more replete with just and useful thought . Much reflection on the subject , with the practical observations of one pei ' *onally conversant with the instruction of young ladies , is evinced and expressed in it . Leaving these two addresses now , and following for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to present in this article some thoughts concerning the theme which they severally and differently treat . The form of the article may be naturally enough an answer to the question , In what is attained the true Success of Human Life , for man or for woman ? Epicureanism says-this is the principle that gives essential unity to its // manifold forms- ' It is in GRATIFICATION ; ' of the appetites , the desires , the craving for enjoyment , and for rest in that . The great commercial development that distinguishes our times , says , practically and very imperatively , It is in COMMERCIAL SUCCESSES ; ' in large , swift , and permanent accumulations , of money , power , and mercantile reputation . What says Philosophy ? and Christianity , as agreeing with , or correcting and exalting her ? In what does the human creature , whom God has fashioned with such exquisite skill , and such expenditure of I ) ivine resources , accomplish the end for which he is designed ? And , of course , at what should the Educator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , to form and accomplish this human creature ? There are two things involved in the real success of man ; two things to be sought , therefore , by all who would educate him . The first is , the proper and thorough development of th' faculties of his nature ; and the second , the use of those faculties , thus developed , in appropriate , noble , and beneficent action . If we state the whole in a single sentence , it may be thus put : complete Spiritual Development , for the purposes of benign and useful Actzon , is the only just aim of man or of woman . The statement is an obvious one ; older than the catechism ; as old as the Bible . Yet it will not harm us , if amid these clamorous and tumultuous times we consider it anew . Indeed , it will be eminently useful to us , if we take from it impressions that shall be serviceable to us in the conduct of our own life , or that shall help and direct us in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life , wherever we observe that , is the law of Development . It is peculiar to life , and co*ixtensive with it . Wherever there is matter merely , and the qualities that describe that , whether it exist in unorganized masses , or is constructed into forms by chemical affinities , there is no evolution ; no process of growth , from a smaller toward a larger . The rock is passive . It knows no increase . It has once been compacted , by the forces of flood or flame that wrought it ; and now it abides . But it grows to no new forms , by interior pressure . So the crystal is shaped with beautiful exactness ; is suffused with light , or variously and brilliantly with color , according to its law . And perfect it is , within its province ; hanging its clear stalactite beneath the arches of the Cavern , or shining as the opal , or flaming as the diamond , on the brow that still exalts it with a more imperial lustre . But the crystal never changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all , nor germinates to new crystals . It is // separate and lifeless , and has no sphere to expand itself into . So with everything in matter , and the purely mechanical forces which affect that . The law of Construction , not that of Development , is there all-pervading . But the moment we enter the sphere of life , we meet the disposition to progress and growth . The flower-germ expands by regular advancements into leaf , and stalk , and calyx , and petals , the flushed , symmetric and consummate corolla . It is the law of its structure . The embryo animal is unfolded and matured , under the steady and usual laws that frame and govern the system of the creation , into the compact and powerful growth , or the lithe and delicate yet complex organism , which science , admires and explores with her analysis , and in which she confesses a trophy of the Creator . And the human child , so weak , dependent , and exposed at the outset , not surviving if the wind but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , or moisture , the smallest accident , the lightest compression-that little and frail , but living child , grows up by degrees to the stature and power of a majestic manhood , or is developed into the symmetry and clothed with the grace that invest with teir charm the peerless woman . The destiny of Progress , in other words , through development , toward perfection ,  --  toward the thorough and evident realization of all that is possible in their conditions of being-is upon living creatures from the start of their history . It shows a more wonderful operation of God in them . It separates them from matter ; marks them out as elect to nobler offices ; establishes their place on a higher level of existence . It is the manifest sceptre of life . Of course , then , the same great law accosts us , in only a higher and more imperative exhibition , when we enter the department of spiritual existence . For here life comes to its fullest expression , as enthroned , full-orbed , in the conscious soul . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , but also an avatar . With intellect to apprehend truth and its relations , a conscience to feel the obligations of duty , affections to arise and encompass the Infinite , and a will possessing liberty , that finite omnipotence ,  --  it evidently involves , in its personal unity , transcendent forces . Man derives responsibility and immortality from this structure of the soul . He is shown to be the rightful possessor of the world . And in the expansion of his perfected nature , while he touches the brute , and finds strange analogies to its instincts in himself , he aspires toward the angel , and catches the echo of far and high songs . He can root himself to the earth , in the grasp of // his desires ; or he can ascend , in the uplift and flight of his exulting hope , to the golden and sapphire sceneries of Heaven . As life , then , in the soul of man attains its highest terrestrial expression , the aptitude for development which we elsewhere discern in it must exist in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does so exist ; and often mutely but always really it is felt and revealed . In each faculty we discoverit. - That power , for example , which seeks to comprehend the relations of things , and to penetrate phenomena to the principles beneath them ; which would collate the similar , and distinguish the unequal , and generalize the individual , and encompass the distant in a principle of order , and which would thus frame theories and scientific explanations , for the comprehension and exposition of all the system of being around us ; that power , which we call familiarly the Understanding , our truly constructive and sysfrmatizing facultytends continually to expansion , and a visible progress . Having learned one particular , it is eager for others . Having formed one hypothesis , it either establishes and finally confirms that , &amp;n a still securer basis of induction and argument , or it supplants it by another , more adequate and just . It takes at the outset the discipline and culture of some other understanding as the limit of its hope . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellect measuring itself against absolute Truth , and feeling the movement of great original capacities that tend to the search and mastery of that , is moved to vaster effort by its immensity . So everywhere and innately , in its normal activity , it approximates the ideal . " Excelsior " is the word breathed above it at its birth ; which , according to the ancient and natural magic , has the power to prefigure and determine its career . The instinct of its being is advancement ascension ; higher , and further , toward perfect day . The same is as evidently true of the Reason ; that intuitive and almost impersonal power , which scans and investigates the absolute and impalpable ; which gives methods and inspiration to the constructive Understanding ; and which , as the teacher of the Imagination , presents to it ideals , informs it with the eternal laws of beauty , and makes it the interpreter of their mysteries to men , the Seer and prophet of invisible realms . This , ever aspires toward clear intuitions ; a more intimate sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the greatness and marvel of Being , expressed , as beneath the seraph 's eyes , to its eclaircised and regal gaze . No mystery short of that one , all-encompassing , the rilation of the infinite // to the finite and the transient ; no obscurity that lies lower than the level of incarnation ; is the claim of the Reason . So the Conscience and the Will aspire each toward perfection , in their natural impulse . Except as they are depressed by malign inward influence , or are detained and debilitated by adverse circumstances , so far as the forces that naturally inhere in them are allowed to have play , they ascend toward entire development and dominance ; till the conscience shall be sensitive , clear-sighted and undaunted , as a power of perception , and perfectly authoritative as impelling to duty ; till the will shall be superior to circumstances and the Past , and as the true architect of fortunes and the Future shall mould all before it into plastic consent . There is not an instance of historical heroism , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been allied with a will sublime and calm , and so has revealed its divinity to man-not an instance like that of the reformer before his princes , or of the incorruptible judge withstanding temptation and hostile authority , or of the poet , in blindness , poverty and age , beneath the frowns of royal power , still pondering Paradise and quarrying from it his diamond palaces , or still breathing out in sonnets and in psalms his praise to the Creator , as if exalted from all contact with the world , and made superior to its every opposition-there is not such an instance , for which the soul , attentively considering it , may not find in itself the original capacity . It is this which makes all such histories impressive . Everywhere in our nature , save at one point only , in all our appropriate human powers , we discern a central life , with its tendencies toward progress ; the aptitude for development , unto mastery and perfection . Everywhere , save at one point . And at that point we touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts of philosophy . Men like Pliny or Plutarch  --  the thoughtful , contemplative and intuitive minds , who have felt themselves related to invisible systems , and have turned from the bustle and pomp of circumstances to study the secrets and the destinies of the soul-have felt that here was a singular mystery . At the centre of our being , where this tendency to development should be deepest and strongest , because the relations of the soul to its Author become most intimate , at the point that is of the moral affections , aspiring toward God , we meet a want . The life-element is not there . We have arisen step by step , in the survey of our nature , toward this *summit and sun of it ; and this is absent . The taste for beauty , in nature or in art , abides unchanged . The taste which is gratified , in its sterner demands , amid the // hoarse severity of storms , beneath the weird and sleepless forest , under the glory of stars at night , or on the wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of affection toward Him who has framed all , and before whom all stands in the crystal immensity , as the signet on the hand of his constant Omnipotence , this we do not discover . On the other hand , we discern self-seeking , and its tendencies . At this point , therefore , the Christian demand of a regeneration confronts philosophy . Christianity expounds the occasion of this want , and would furnish its supply . As quickening man s will to new activities , or as calling down an energy from above upon the soul , the Church has always professed to meet this ; and she has in this function the ground of her permanence . She claims to be more than a civilizing power . She asserts another office than of outward reform . Through the truth , by the Spirit , distributed through her , she would renovate the heart . The splendid or the simple forms , hierarchies or brotherhoods , ordinances and rituals , annals illustrious with the heroism of martyrdom , archives bounteous with the learning of generations , litanies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstasy of confessing hearts , cathedral building their rocky oratorios as the scene of Divine revelation and action ,  --  all these are the drapery of the power of the Church ; the gorgeous or sombre robes , around that queenly yet ministering form which would ally the soul with its original again . But when these affections toward the Infinite are enkindled , the tendency with them also is to development . They grow up with meditation . They are nursed to new strength by each survey of the universe . The telescope gathers light from far systems upon them . The eye of the microscope leads them . forth to new range , in its revelation of interior worlds . The whole material organized system , as disclosed to our study , in its secrets and its breadth , in its harmonies and its stability , in the vivid evidencings of its maker throughout it , becomes a temple and home of these affections ; instinct with the forces of a continuous culture . And the Scriptures assemble for them revel lations and theophanies , the mission of angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . They never can tarry , therefore , in their proper development , they never can rest , in fulfillment of their law , till they flame to seraphic ardor and height ; till they sing and are glad before God ' * face ! Of all the powers inherent in our being , then , in their harmonious and appropriate action , the tendency is to enlargement and progress . As the insignificant germ works up toward // the fragrant and free-swaying flower ; as the seed advances toward the tree , whose affluent and majestic cope shelters the sod ; as the embryo of the egg is perfected in the eagle , that soars and sails in the immeasurable azure ; so the powers of the child , all callow and inconsiderable as they are at the first , tend naturally and steadily toward the stature of the man 's . It is the law of their being . It gives mystery , sublimity , divinity to the child , and makes his life momentous and august . It is a proof of God 's authorship ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him transcend the Present . They overleap attainment , the moment it is made . They aspire to an ideal , which imagination itself can scarcely define ; which history has not realized ; which only the Future shall open fullcircle . ' That Future itself takes reality and a presence , it grapples our deepest philosophical convictions , when we ponder the child ; since only amid its immeasurable scope can the powers that are in him find their full evolution . In this development , then , and spiritual progress , this unfolding of the powers which God has placed in us unto the measure which they prophesy , is found the first element of true human Success . The accomplishment of this should be the aim of every educator . The accomplishment of this should be the goal of every youth . Man 's end is not the accumulation of outward conditions of enjoyment or influence ; of wealth , or power , or fortunate circumstances , or pleasant social relations and prospects . It is not the acquisition of the means of self-improvement ; or , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Development , to new greatness and symmetry of power , is larger and is better . Attainment ought always to be auxiliary to such development . If not , it crushes , like Tarpeia 's shields . " Studies are to serve , " as Lord Bacon has said , " for delight , and for ornament ; " but also and chiefly , " for ABILITY . " We are to grow up upon them , to an ever newer fulness and proportion of power ; till all that we have been is merged and completed in a larger capacity ; till the aspiration of the Past is the possession of the Present ; till our manhood is perfected . This development , too , must accord with the bent of the original constitittion , in order to be really complete and thorough . It must carefully accept , and not traverse or resist the tendencies of nature . This law is obvious . Varieties adorn , we might almost say distinguish , the operation of the creator . There is no machine-work in his system . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and the absolute ubiquity of the will that frames all . // Nowhere , either , are these varieties more conspicuous or impressive than among men . A sphere of experience is possible to each . Each has his niche , assigned by his original individuality . There are differences of quality , of degree , and of structure . In one mind , the gold abides unmixed . In another , it is mingled with quicksilver or copper , oi . fused into mechanical coalescence with quartz . Jn another , it is not gold at all ; but iron or platinum . There is method in this . Such varieties are essential to a true and wide harmony . To those who survey us with immediate vision , to whom the spiritual is as evident as the material , these diversities form a scene of immeasurable richness . Consider it ! The most exquisite combinations of brightness and relief in the perfepted picture ; the most skillful and majestic union of sounds in the one concerted and magnificent strain of organ music ; the most charming arrangement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rock , and river , and hill , with nestling or clustering homes amid them , attract the taste and embosom it in peace ; - how shall these all be anything but a shadow , the faintest and most distant reflection and promise of that Variety in unity ' which is purposed and secured in God 's intelligent system ? where every soul has a beauty of its own ; where each may find a realm of action appropriate to itself ; and where the harmony of the whole is to be gained and established in the perfect accomplishment *f every one ? This is the system of intelligent life , as God has ordained it . Let every nature be developed after its law , then ; the discipline which meets it not obliterating its specialities , but disclosing and finishing them , as the polishing of the wood brings its grain to manifestation ;  - -  - this is needful to its success . The artist by nature is only truly developed in the recognition of this taste which imbues his constitution . When he looks to the fields , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of painting , or the noble charm of sculpture , or more , to the flushing face of woman , and the gleeful , exultant attitudes of childhood , and is flooded with the sense of enjoyment and light as their revelation of beauty arrests him , as he inhales the ambrosial aspect ' -. let the literature and the trophies of art meet his soul ! Let his taste be unfolded , and his powers be matured , and his beliefs be assembled beneath their inspiration . To try to transform his susceptible and esthetic nature into one more exact , dialectic and executive , were to try to write backward the decree of his maket ' ; to resolve that birds shall do errands and not sing ; and that elms shall bow their stately heads , and put aside their benignant coronals , to bless the squirrels with their nuts . // So when one turns to historical studies , in the movement of an imagination to which the Past is teeming and voiceful , and before which philosophy and eloquence are the goal , let these studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his quickened ear with the tread of generations ; till he feels himself the inheritor of the legacies of ages ; and enters with solemn and baptized soul , as one beneath the invocation of the Past , his work on earth ! Whatever the mind is constitutionally fitted for , it should therein have exercise . That power in it which naturally surpasses and dominates the others should have especial though guarded training . The Woman 's nature is differenced from the Man 's . There is sex in souls . Isis , and Osiris ; the virgin born of seafoam and floating on light with doves and graces , the strong and arduous god marching to war , before whom emperors clashed the shields ; - these are the obvious recognitions of the fact by that vigorous antique world which stood close to nature . It is the secret of the inmost affinities of our being . It is the centre of marriage , and the family-relation . It makes literature and life responsive and harmonious , not univocal . It makes true marriage mystical , sacramental ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , therefore , of her who has illustrated literature in her accomplishments , while embellishing and establishing the home with her affection , adorning it with her refinement , *and oftentimes hallowing it with the sanctity of her religion , should never want its appropriate culture . It should never seek that which is alien to it. - Everywhere it is the law , that that which is central and paraniount in our being , that which God has lodged in us as our special possession , is especially to be trained . It is the crown of our force . It is the hiding of our power ; the element of original value , in our nature . The voice of it is that which opens hearts to our access . The condition of success to us , the corner and also the pinnacle of our completeness , is its maintenance and development . Yet not disproportionately , and to monstrous excess , is any power to be nurtured . The balance and equipoise of all are to be guarded ; the moral cultivation is to be ever supreme ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it , which is found in childhood , which makes the world seem supernal , fireedged , which feels it filled with mystery and force , and which realizes the contacts of God and the Invisible-this must , so far as possible , be carried on to maturity , and be made to penetrate all our progress , in order to our perfectness . There is a principle here , which is often overlooked , but which ought never // to be so ; which every Educator , and every system of training , should intelligently recognize . The season of young life has its special charm . This need not vanish , as the experience advances . It may be carried on into the subsequent career , and the attainments and the powers of that be gilded with its clear morning light . We see this accomplished in the poets , whom the world has recognized ; and in them we accept it as an admirable element . We may see it in those whom nature has endowed with the poetic sensibility , or with the rarer and regal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poetic utterance ; who , through the defect of that-special mental sense which appreciates and suggests the musical cadence , or by the pressure of outward circumstances , have been shut out from song , and made doers , achievers ; who have stirred men 's hearts with their grand appealing thought , and dhave led the perilous van of reforms ; or who have wrought into more tremendous expression the poems that were in them , amid the shock of charging armies , upon the arena of political revolution , or in the secrets of Christian endurance . Jonathan Edwards had this , as his journal demonstrates . Augustine had it . Luther had it ; that granite mountain , with fountains in it . ' These men carried youngness and freshness of soul with them , through all their career ; as St. Chris . topher in the painting is seen bearing the young yet ruling Jesus across the swift and heady stream . Yet the childnature was not in them set over against the man 's . It rather melted into , pervaded and suffused it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's earnestness in the pictures of John . It was an element of freedom and completeness to them . Napoleon , on the other hand , had little of this . The French civilization , which culminated in him , was not favorable to it . His element was incessant and splendid action . He was not akin to nature in its simplicity . He could not have found a spirit within responsive to orchards and placid streams ; and the very ornaments of affection or enthusiasm which he wore seem rather the etchings upon a steel-blade , than the growths of a nature spontaneous and teeming . But Cromwell had this ; and so had Lord Strafford , of whom one would not think it if he could help it , but of whom we are told that in his stormiest scenes of life , he was wont to take refreshment with children in the garden , and to be a child and boy among them . In all truly graceful and bountiful natures we meet this element . The child stands near to nature , and its secrets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracle of morning ; ' the glory , and the dusk . He has faith in the Invisible . The // earth and life are embosomed in a Presence , not seen , but felt , and inly apprehended . The ideal is beneath everything . All occurrences are significant . The woods are populous still with fairies . Something sombre and portentous is in the darkness . The world is quick with mysterious forces . Its even and mighty pulses seem heating against his heart . There is apresence of the eternal around and within all . The universe is vital ; not a mill or a shop , but a vast scene of Life , progressive and ascending . Poetry is reality . Religion is authoritative . The symbols of the future are far-flashing facts , illuminating the present with their infinite radiations . Yet the spirit is mirthful and peaceful , full of humor , full of gladness , sunshiny and free . To perpetuate then this freshness of thought , and youthful grace , that it may imbue and adorn the knowledge and the energy of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul . We lose a part of our spiritual endowment , and therefore we come short of our perfect success , when we let this pass from us . The true education will establish and ennoble , instead of expelling it . It is a difficult task in our civilization ; far more so than to educate the intellect or the conscience . For the tendencies of this age are commercial and mechanical , not poetic or scholarly . We live in the outward . We believe in the sensible . The delicate light of fancy is lost in the glare of demonstration that immerses it . The silent , searching and apprehensive thoughts , which idealize the material , and find voices and activities throughout the solid frame of things , and meet the supernatural pervading the visible , have been more natural to other times . There is a real peril that a meagre and utilitarian spirit will debase all our knowledge ; that scientific comparisons will supplant devout consideration ; and j that stars will be measured and arranged in their groups , and * trees be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals be characterized and classified , as if such exquisite application of names , were of some intrinsic and ultimate value ; as if the just purpose of all such explorations were not to reveal with more vivid distinctness that Infinite Presence , which the child 's eye catches the moment it looks upward ; which equally shapes the planet and rounds the drop ; which poises the sun on its centre of light , while fitting the tiniest eye for its office ; which pervades all extent , gives unity to all existence , and makes every point amazing and sublime , as the scene of its operation ! To keep the freshness of soul that shall see this , to resist the hardening and deteriorating influences that play so swiftly back // and forth in our driving civilization , and to retain , in no sentimental and dilettante way , but as an element of culture , of power , and of virtue , this inner youngness , so that nature shall woo us as a great blessing mother , and stars shall rain bright influence on us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noble progress . To lose no element of grace or force , but ever to erect a new beauty on the existing ; to exalt the dithyrambic to the glorious lyric , to enlarge poetic insight and faculty till this rises to the Epic , to crown science in philosophy , and to finish all attainment with the loveliness and the majesty of a noble art ; - this is the true method not only of national but equally of individual civilization and culture . Education completes a man , in securing this for him . When the conscience is enthroned in supremacy within us , as being intrinsically our noblest power ; when the will is exalted by allegiance to it , made free in the liberty of acquiescence with the Infinite ; when the intellect is disciplined , invigorated and furnished , and yet the glow of its youth maintained ; when a just affection toward our author is enkindled , and all the powers are inspired by its impulse ; when , in a word , every spiritual force for which our nature has aptitude and scope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture ; then , the primary end of our being is attained . The soul is developed . Its life is unfolded . Not hundred-handed and gigantic but in the symmetry of the Greek Apollo , the symbol that expresses a perfected manhood , it stands in the creation ; its shapely powers , like limbs and arms , compacted and matured ; its many resources , the arching bow and eager arrows borne on the hand ; its princely port , and clear-eyed mien , that looks through nature and out on life , revealing a will akin with Divinity . It is ready for accomplishment ; for endurance ; for the future . It is independent of circumstances . It can enter that highest terrestrial experience , in which , in alliance with its author , it arises from the world , looks down upon powers , is master over Time . Then life is its element ; freedom its instinct ; the unlimited its domain . The level of inspiration is not far above this . The histories that have disclosed this , are the choice and inestimable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race would have been , except for the fall ; because they mark the just goal of our effort . Look into them , and you see the lofty colonnades through which the same subduing will may move in triumph to the same coronation . In the attainment of this , is nobly accomplished a part of man 's Success A part ; yet not all . For there meets us at once as we leave this law , another whose foundations are as central in our // being , and the brief exposition of which is necessary to complete the thesis with which we started . It is this : The powers , developed and cultured as we have described , must be used , for ends that are durable and wise , in order to our success . In other words , BENEFICENT ACTION , as at once the expression of this spiritual development and the condition of its furtherance , is the end of man 's being ; and every system of education is faulty and imperfect , that does not prepare him for this , and introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Action . Whatever has life , throughout the creation , is predestined to this by its original structure . Every tree in the forest acts constantly on others . Every part of it acts on every other . Their influence penetrates the whole adjacent scene . It sometimes touches human hearts ; and the tree , to those who were sheltered beneath it in the crisis of peril , or to those who received the inspirations of poetry from its majestic sweep of beauty , has been an almost personal mediator for its author . Its influence has been incorporated with the progress of civilization . It rustles and waves through the ages of history . So everything that lives , around or beneath us , is in movement in its realm . It has its sufficient department of endeavor ; till the very animalcuhe , which the blaze of the solar microscope reveals disporting in any drop of water , have organized frames and ordered lives , and are as apparently and continuously operative in their sphere as any creature between that sphere and ours . Of course , throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force which impels ; not intelligence , or conscience . The frame seems passive , so far as we can enter the mystery of its movement , to the pressure of a force , whether mechanical or intelligent , that has nothing of personalness or freedom in it , and that does not imply responsibility or a future . But still the movement is real , not apparent . It even has moral and spiritual connections ; and upon it is mirrored , as the arch of the heavens is reflected from the drop , the character of its originator . In the frail and attenuated vegetable thread which the microscope discloses , endowed with its capillaries , alive and active with its ascending juices , adorned with incomparable finish of color , and ever putting forth its reproductive energies ; - in the tiniest atomic creature , that is swallowed in a drop , as the ship is in the sea , and yet whose fleet and nimble life is unapproached by any fabric ; - in these , and all the life they represent , not less than in suns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatness and // kindness of their Creator . Each , in its courses , like an angel sing . ' What we find then , among these subordinate existences , we must look to find in Man in more impressive exhibition . In his comprehensive and sublime constitution , as has been suggested , all the powers below him are involved and combined . He gathers in himself their essential quality ; as the capital of the column receives to its form and expresses in its curves both the droop and the swell of the pillar beneath it . Yet he comprehends with it a more marvelous element . He has wings , as well as feet . He superadds to nature , in its topmost attainment , a power from above it ; which exalts him to new capacity and duration , and so to new realms of obligation and reward . His powers especially , therefore , prepare him for action , and ordain him to that ; an action that is other and higher than that of nature ; that is free , intelligent and moral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not one that terminates with the present necessity . This is the proper element of these powers ; their natural domain , and sphere of expression . This eager and outreaching persbnal force which stirs within us ; which has tragedies and comedies both compassed in its indivisible unity ; which holds the germ of revolutions , the idea and the forms of poems and of art , the power of persecutions , or of the endurance of martyrdom ; this soul , which can traverse the Past in its thought , and renew the intensest experience of that , making itself master of its action and fortitude ; which can forecast the Future too , and mould and direct that , which can even go up to the Invisible and Eternal , anticipate destinies , and seek to control them beyond the grave ; this soul , which with all this immenseness of range can love the present , the finite , the material , can kindle in other human hearts the thoughts and the desires that glow in itself ; which is one and yet complex , receptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of will , and framed inseparably amid the ever-responsive sympathies that permeate and organize human society ,  --  this soul was meant and made for ACTION . It must have that , as its arena of expression . It claims and commands that , as a necessity of its being . If it does not find it , it will languish or reel . Religiously , this is true . Scientifically , as well . The great German poet has rightly said : " The end of Being of human Being is an Action , not a Thought , though that were the noblest . " Such action is not only outwardly effective . It is a condition of development , a has been already intimated , to the mind itself . There must be a distributing , to the perfectness of the // appropriating and self-informing process . Our highest personal progress can never be realized , except through this . It is necessary even to true inward sanity and vigor . The history of every man of wise , proportioned and manly action , shows the eminent use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mind . The history of monasticism shows the peril of the neglect of it . The grandest tragedy of Shakspeare exhibits , with wonderful precision , yet with infinite copiousness and splendor of illustration , the same inevitable law of our nature . Hamlet is really , fundamentally , a treatise upon Action . A nature by constitution rather genial and courteous than executive and determined ; a nature inclined to introspection and abstraction , and addicted to that teasing and insatiable analysis which lets no state or act pass unchallenged ; a nature too , accomplished , by study and by use , in philosophy and art , is suddenly pushed up , by a spectral visitation , to extremest destructive and revolutionary action . The shock is too great for it . It revolts , as it is urged . It hurries , and yet hesitates . In the internal contest , as it whirls and is tossed , it is borne to that border-land of experience , where delirium shades in upon the pure light of reason ; where all is portentous , while all is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet shadows are real . A steady , determinate , and effectual effort is thenceforth impossible . The certain end of the career is collapse and dissolution . The very frame of the mind is shaken and wrecked , in the terrible contention . In this , and not in a simulated insanity ; in this , and not merely in a veritable insanity , produced by discoveries of enormous crime ; is the secret of Hamlet . Herein is shown the intuitive and capacious apprehension of that mind , which , retaining forever its own personal centre , could range with those of every class ; laughing with the glad ; being crushed with the despondent ; shouting and storming , in the rage of the passionate ; catching the faintest suggestion of feeling , and syllabling into harmonious terms the most hesitating , tremulous , and diffident affection , yet wavering and reeling , on the broken and perilous edge of sanity , with the fevered and the doomed ! The Hamlets of the world are not unknown . All indolence is abnormal ; all indolence is destructive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The action that is an instinct , encloses a reward . The tendency to action , in any human being conscious of faculty , mindful of God , aware of destiny , is as instant and intuitive as of the eagle toward his flight . But this action must be just and noble , in order to the real Success of its author . It must be directed to interests that are // essential and permanent , or it will finally disappoint him . The force expended in it , will not be matched by the results accornplished . Here also , religion strikes hands with philosophy , and gives to her suggestions authority and sanction . The interest which is permanent , in the system of human life , is not material accumulation , or physical gratification , but spiritual well-being ; a well-being that is founded upon knowledge and benevolence , in the soul of its subject , and that is guarded and guarantied by those relations to God , and to the universeof God , which these determine . For this well-being , man is naturally fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is realized , in the experience of any , there is a light within that gives its beauty to all the circumstances . Disaster itself becomes roseate and empurpled beneath its central radiance . It furnishes a pledge , it gives indeed an experience , of the enjoyment of Heaven . To extend this among men , then , is philosophically one s highest privilege and duty . In accomplishing it , he realizes success . As he incorporates in himself the spirit of benevolence , which is everywhere a spirit of unition and of peace ; as he nurtures and unfolds all his own mental powers , and informs them not with fancies or phantasms , but with Truth ; as he spreads among men the same elements of life , and strives to make them universal and supreme , he fulfills the design which is impressed upon his nature . His influence gains ubiquity and permanence . His personal life is exalted to relations that secure it from the changes and the accidents of time , and invest it with immortal significance and value . The intelligent universe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Being who made him , and who has sent him on his mission to this sphere of human life , connected as it is with immeasurable destinies , intended and formed him . He attains , that is , Success . Consider the make of any ship , and we see what it is meant for . The oaken ribs , the bolting irons , the tapering masts that open to the breeze their mighty vans , the solid and gigantic front that arches to an edge to meet the waves , the patient and hidden witness of the compass that points forever to its Mecca of the North , all these reveal the purpose of the structure . Commercial intercourse ; is its final cause . To carry between its decks the products of many lands ; to bear men and their enterprise beyond the cape of Hope , and past Mozambic ; ' to give to civilization ubiquity , and to bind the world in the federations of commerce ; - this is the mission foreshadowed in its frame . And so the nature and frame of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual force that // grasps the truth , the conscience that accepts the supremacy of duty , the affections that are capable of encompassing the lEternal , the infinite alliances that unite him with his fellows and make him influential as well as dependent , the great mute instincts that press toward effort and welcome its accomplishment , and that make us aware of accountableness to the future-all , demonstrate our design to act for great interests ; to spread benevolence and truth in our circles . To live ideally , not mechanically , is our prerogative . To he able to advance interests that are spiritual and eternal , is an honor which he who has formed us puts on us . And the imagination can not frame an enterprise so august that to realize or subserve it may not be our life 's work . It is not necessary to this , either , that one 's action be great action , in the usual and obvious significance of the term ; that it be done on a wide and conspicuous arena , and have a great company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years in its accomplishment , and that the life which it illustrates be prolonged to old age . It is necessary , simply , that it he truly good action ; intended and adapted to advance man 's *ve1l-being ; and that so it be done to the extent of our ability . Then it has virtue in it ; beneficence ; perpetuity ; and the power of reproduction . Then history takes it up , and delights to record it . Or , if it escape her more general scrutifly , the great currents of influence that circulate among men advance and protect it , and bear it forward . God 's providence keeps watch of it . It is a theory among some adepts that every physical influence makes impression on the Universe , so that words which we speak strike the centre of stars ; and that thus the eternal remembrance of the Omnipresent is just the eternal consciousness of these forces , as they advance and run abroad in their ethereal lines . The fancy has its fact in the eternity of good influences . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web of daily life , as shined on from within by the spirit of self-devotion , may be illustrious above the achievements of learning or of power , even as the travelworn raiment of the Lord , that common and coarse Judean fabric , when touched and transfigured by the glory from above , shone so as no cloth of gold could rival it . We are sitting today beneath the shelter of the influence of the good deeds of women , done centuries ago . Their words of kindness have become centres of institutions . Their ministrations of charity have shortened the pendulum of the ages of oppression . Wheresoever it is passed , a truly heroic and beautiful Life , which incorporates the power of goodness and truth , which // expresses a will so surely and fully insphered in the Divine will that it not only can pass , like the splendid Grecian 's , from Persian luxury to Spartan austerity , and be serene and unconquerable in both , but can breast continual seventies and yet abide embosomed in peace-such a life , never dies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household ; but the beautiful fragrance of it can not be hidden . It may terminate , for the earth , at its very meridian ; yet the virtue and the power of it shall survive its phenomena . It does , in its sphere , what He did in his , whose life though lowly and closed in gloom , has been the germ of civilizations and of worships . It is here that we recognize the real brotherhood among Workers ; that we see how they all are forwarding Millennium . Their aim is to measure them ; not their present accomplishment . This aim , in its unity , allies each one with every other ; the humblest , with the mightiest . Even the present accomplishment of the humblest , too , may be greater than it seems . The golden thread gives brilliance to a tissue . The drooping branch springs up again in pillared stems . " T is a little thing To give a cup of water ; yet its draught , Of cool refreshment , drained by fevered lips , May give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when nectarean juice Renews the life of joy in happiest hours . " The maiden , or the matron , therefore , in her gentler sphere ; the man who instructs the young in their duties ; the man who distributes truth from the pulpit , and seeks to express to men the powers of the Invisible ; the man who pleads causes , in the spirit of justice ; the man who applies new mechanical powers to advance human welfare , and harnesses forces irresistible and unwearying to the car of man 's progress , that God may be honored in it ; the man who scattQrs his wealth for others ' good , and makes it descend as light and as dew on the fainting and the darkened ; the man who enlightens the sick-room with his kindness , and makes the pain which he seeks to relieve a minister to goodness ; the man who balances stars on his scales , and holds them pendulous on the grasp of his words , that he may reveal their lesson of Deity ; the man who in statesmanship stands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world shake beneath him ; the soul that interprets the harmonies of the universe , in the spirit of purity , through the mystery of a song that holds the world 's hushed ear and throbbing heart at its command ; and the soul that moves softly in the prosaic paths of a daily obedience to recognized duty ; - ALI. // these are alike ! In the vast church of God , which includes all the God-like , whose sacraments are self-devotions , whose liturgies are lives , whose offices are mighty and glad obediences , and whose sabbath is Eternity , all such are embraced . They are heirs of the Universe* for they succor the interests of which that is the theatre . In the record and publication of such actions and lives , history becomes illustrious . It gathers from them a distinction and an office , almost akin to those which were given to the ordinary Jewish supper wheji laden with the memory of the sublimest self-sacrifice . it is in the accumulation , and the constant reproduction of such lives among men , that the Future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure . The voices are conspiring ; from manifold and ever-increasing points , across oceans and hemispheres , the harps and viols are balancing their strings , that bye-and-bye shall strike into this anthem . The visions of Poetry , the hope of Philanthropy , the promises of Prophecy , shall thus be fulfilled , and a better than the age of Astrea return . When the knowledge and the benevolence which God calls wisdom ' are made universal , the harmony of those orbs that now move serenely on their supernal round , and there seem ever choiring in praises unto God , will he but as the prelude to this far diviner hymn , encompassing the earth , and swelling in its peal through Heaven 's great arches . The noblest office our nature can accomplish , is in realizing such a life . Then , it vindicates and justifies the Power that framed it . Then , it rises to alliance , and interior sympathy , with the noble of the Past ; whose names have been written on pillories and in dungeons , but afterwards in letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , it bears on its front the baptism of His spirit who made the earth a temple in his advent , and over whose ascent the skies were parted . Yea , then we come , when we realize such a life-either common in its incidents or conspicuous and imposing , either long in its progress or sharply closed , but ever determined to the ends of benevolence , and made to contribute to a wider well-beingthen we come to alliance with the Infinite himself ; who formed these systems , who now upholds them , to make them the platform of the progress we assist ! It is wonderful to see how the natural is pervaded and exalted by the supernatural , in all man 's being , and in his works ; how near he stands to spirits and the Infinite ; so that not as passive beings , physically imaging , but as free and intelligent beings , consciously expressing , we may show forth the qualities and powers of our Author , and labor for the interests that are dear to His mind . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seek to // exalt us to communion with himself . Not as finished works , but as the bases of such works , did he erect these visible systems ; that Righteousness ' and Truth might be established upon them , and perfect happiness be secured in obedience to these ! Whosoever labors , then , in the maintenance of these and their diffusion in the creation , is a co-worker with his Author . He is borne upon an influence from the throne which is our centre . He moves in the line of creation and incarnation ; and the energy of the first , the endurance yet also the victory of the last , are imaged in his experience . HE ULTIMATES , IN THE GOD-LIKE . In this is realized the True Success of Human Life . The fact shines on us ; starlike , self-demonstrating . No matter what the world has thought of such an one . No matter what fortunes have encompassed him on earth . No matter what annals have been careless of his fame . Though he have labored in comparative obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle against outward wasting and pain , and more severely against inward passion , like the noble Beccaria ; though he have burned at the stake , like John of Huss , or been choked with the cord , like Savonarola ; though he have died without the sight , like sorrowful prophets ; have been fronted by hatred , and broken upon power , like great apostles ; have died , , like the Master , in the midst of his manhood ; - his success has been realized . As a child of the Universe , he has filled his vocation . He can say- " It is finished . " A noble brotherhood takes the custody of his name . Long centuries of culture come to fruitage in his career . Yea , the influence of his maker , more than on rocked and gleaming summits , or waves that stood as marble beneath the tread , is shown in his experience . The true apotheosis , is this ascent of the soul , till it rests out of sight in perfected attainment . The apotheosis of man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' as Ackerman has said , of Heathen and of Christian faith , ' - are both shadowed in the experience of him , who aspires toward his Author , till he finds Him within ; who ascends , through endurance and labor , to his rest ! The Temple is then built , to its noblest proportion ; and the Temple is filled , with the service and the Shekinah . To train the youthful mind to this athletic and beneficent maturity , is the office of the Educator . It is an office of immeasurable grandeur . To train men for this , and to give them opportunity and occasion for its expression , is the office of all the permanent institutions which God in his benignant economy has provided for the world . The Family , is to nurture the open // ing powers , and to teach them to unfold with freest progress , in the beauty of love . The Church , is to gather many families in one assembly , and to circulate a*nong them its p*wers and truths , for their further advancement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded and fortified walls , is to encircle and guard these primordial institutions , and in its province to help them in working out their results . The system is complete . So simple though it is , it is perfectly sufficient . It has vindicated its authority , and illustrated God 's wisdom , wherever it has been even approximately realized . But let either of the three cooperating institutions , be dropped from the circle , as in the aspiration and theory of Socialism , and the virtue of all is limited or eliminated . Let either of them cease to act for its true end , and its authority has departed . No blessing of God accepts and enshrines it . If a church , instead of training its families by the truth , and so developing a pure life in them , shall tickle them with shows , and degrade them into selfishness by assuring them of an outward and purchasable salvation ; if a family shall be changed to a transient collection of persons whom caprice or lust have assembled , whose relation is not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others and not subject to the parents , and where the whole group may be scattered in a day by insolvency or by death ; if a state shall make it&amp; own greatness its end , and subordinate to this the wellbeing of its subjects , ceasing to shelter and seeking to use them , building up from the wrecks of their happiness and progress its own solid masonries ; - then , in every such case , the authority of that institution has departed . No benison from our Author rests thereafter upon it . As a traitor and a spoiler it is ready for judgment . It can not escape , in the assize of History ! Artistic talent and accomplishment are likewise to be measured in their value , and assigned to their true place , from this point of view . Art has an office . It is not for amusement only , or for sensuous pleasure . The moral is its essence . The significance it reveals , as addressed to the inner faculty of man ; the relation it bears to his true and high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action ; - these are the just criteria of its worth . They determine its Future . Herein is the ultimate law of criticism , which all its minor canons must express . One hand paints a picture , elaborate and ornate , where exquisite lines and sumptuous colors intoxicate the sense , but where only the faculty of taste is gratified ; and another smites the canvas with almost frenzied and violent haste , yet wreaking a lesson in every line ;  --  and the latter shall reign , when the other has perished . It shall be free of the Ages . Civilization // shall adopt it , and carry forward its impulse . Herein resides the authority of the Masters ; in their self-consecration , surpassing their talent . There are single heads by Angelo , or Murillo , which contain in their lines and inspiring expression the grandest discourses . These live , of course . No matter how taste changes , or fashions of costume . The World , which is inwardly conscious of a destiny , can not lose such assistants . The Race in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deep consent of humanity , in all countries and ages , attests the supremacy of virtue above enjoyment , of the moral over the esthetic . Whatever in Art , therefore , asserts the Ideal and moves men toward it , whatever imparts to them spiritual force , and helps them to accomplish more perfectly their mission , becon ) es i.mmortal . So in Music . The strains that live and march through centuries , harmonizing races and different civilizations through their majestic spiritual power , are those which touch and arouse the soul , exalting it to new attainment and strength , or stringing it for sublime and beneficent endeavor . So , also , in Architecture ; that incorporate music . So in literary labor . The words that are permanently impelling and memorable , outhsting occasions and winning wide audience , the treatises that survive and immortalize their authors , are those which sustain real relations to this culture ; which make the man more man-like and divine . And the most brilliant rhetoric , which has not this virtue , flies like the shaft too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attainment become of use , scholastic acquisition accomplishing its end and rising instantly to its mighty bloom , when it utters great truths , and impresses them on others ; exalting them by this mastery . Yea , then is revealed the glory of Genius ; in its power to arrest and transform human action , and to advance men toward a noble manhood . It is mitred and anointed by this , a priest for God . If it fails in its office , retribution will be upon it . The true University ; it is venerable and august , in its relation to this manhood . The law of its structure is revealed as we here regard it . Its function is , and its grand prerogative , to advance its students effectually toward this . We mistake and underrate it , when we judge it from another and lower level . Its end is not reached in the imparting of knowledge . Its aim should be knowledge , in order to Development ; and knowledge and development , in order to Action ; to action with tongue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goodness and truth . It is by reference to this that it becomes , to the State which endows it and the history which it moulds , a crmtre of dignity , of illumination and of progress . It is fitly inaugurated // with religious ceremonial , and guarded and blessed by Christian men . It will never degrade itself intelligently or advisedly , into a mere school of science , or a place of instruction for immediate handicrafts . It will seek rather to accumulate new knowledges on the old , to expand its courses and make them more ample , to establish all.sciences in familiar residence in its majestic and finished circle ; to make itself an emporium of human thought . Not a monolith is the University , but a great imperial and pillared structure , it will build more widely and loftily its towers , till the cloister becomes a college ; and the college a quadrangle ; and the quadrangle a great , ever-spreading University ; whose buildings speak of different epochs ; whose walls have a power from past ages upon them ; whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity and precision of the mathematics , for their practical applications and their influence upon culture , it will add to them the expanding and enlightening researches of natural science . It will have a place for astronomy , for geology , for physics . It will delight to hang its walls with the pictured youth or the serene age of the wise of the Past . It will seek to draw around it the inestimable cincture of affluent libraries . The literature that breathes from the youth of the world , the literature still vivid with Phenician grace , or stately and regal with the Roman pride , will ever abide in the true University ; to encircle and enrich the mind which it trains . It will cherish the taste , by a power from the scenes where Homer sang , and Plato taught . It will discipline the judgment , by accustoming it to collision with the arguments of old . It will kindle aspiration , through its great and splendid models . It will press upon the youth the life of its epochs , and give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , shall be added to this ; the exposition of the problems of our nature and its relations . The literatures and acquisition of modern centuries will be accumulated upon these ; instruction in ethics , in politics , and in art ; the teaching of each branch of professional knowledge ; the scientific interpretation of sculpture , painting , architecture , eloquence , as well as of the music that exalts and enthralls as a minister of God . Especially will history be taught in the university ; - not that of which Bacon bath said that it doth rather set forth the pomp of business , than the true and inward resorts thereof , ' but that which really unfolds the causes , expounds the direction , and prophecies the results of human action ; that which gives an expression to the life of all Time , and is thus a treasury of principles , a record of Providence , a spring of impulse , a teacher of charity , a school of manhood . So fast as // resources shall be multiplied for it , all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truly self-conscious and intelligent University . Especially will it incorporate a thorough Christianity , among its moulding and formative powers . The relation of this Divine system to University education has been often overlooked , and oftener mistaken . She has been received as a servant , or as a dependent friend , where she should have been gladly and instantly enthroned , as the mistress and queen . For the relation of Christianity to every real believer , is but prophesied by that she has sustained to the race . Coming to publication when Roman order was dominant on earth , when the culture and art of Greece had realized its last and grandest trophies , and was fading like the sunset from the west which it had piled with chrysolite and gold , standing , a spirit of purity and of peace , amid the splendor and the power of these great civilizations , Christianity taught a truth higher than theirs . She made the stock of Hebrew theism to blossom as in a night , into discoveries of God , revelations of angels , a present Messiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers that opposed her . Yet she gathered and reconciled the forces that were in them , combining them by the mordant of a mightier principle , Benevolent Love . And so , on their wrecks , and over fresh continents , she is building a civilization more permanent and grand than theirs . In this civilization , when it is perfected , all learning shall be honored . Art shall have clear and generous development . Literary skill and accomplishment shall be welcomed ; shall be consecrated , even , through devotion to the truth . All noble qualities of human nature shall be unfolded ; all elements in it that are base be repressed ; the atmosphere of society be warmed and irradiated by universal charity and piety ; affectionateness , conscientiousness , tastefulness and heroism , be made the spirit of every household , be made the life of every heart. - For this consummation , prophets have waited , and martyrs died . Because she tends toward this result , Christianity was given by God to man , amid stupendous theophanies and miraculous attestations . Because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministering allies , and commerce her swift and far path . finder . Because she has such forces and tendencies , she should be enthroned in every University . What she does for the race , she will do for the personal believer and student ; she will do for the society of attentive youth . The more thoroughly she is recognized in any University , and made to embosom the minds trained in it , interpenetrating with her Divine force all resources of // Science , the more will she make that , in no common-place sense but truly , royally , the cherished mother of its students . The disciplined minds that go from its walls , will be its jewels . From the track of their benignant life , or of their high and principled public service , will ray back a light to make it illustrious . It will worthily introduce them to the University of Life . There , after all , is the larger arena for the attainment of the manhood which we have sketched . It is the virtue of lifeis it not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be realized this completeness and mastery . How far it may have been in reference to this end , to train men to ascend to a difficult virtue , to discipline and invigorate them by exercise and resistance , and so to prepare them for great offices in the future-how far it may have been for this end that malign and perverting influences were admitted upon the earth , and left to mark and mar its annals-who shall declare ? Certain it is , that he who now enters life aright , who grapples its problems , and masters its difficulties , and resists its temptations , and accepts its impulsions , and uses its helps-he who follows the definite line of duty through all the experiments and entanglements of the world , and who gathers upon his thought the instruction which they offer him-will reach a manhood Christian and noble , intrinsic and immortal . He shall judge angels . His stature shall be grander than if he had been nurtured in the garden ; his destiny more eminent , than if his virtue had been cloistered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that calmly , intelligently and successfully they may work in it , to train them for it , and to usher them into it , is the office of every Educator ; the office , especially , of the Christian University . Its true grandeur is revealed , as we contemplate it here . To seek and to realize the true Success of Human Life , as that has here been unfolded , is the privilege of every man especially of every young man . It ought evermore to be presented to them , thus ; by the teacher , and the preacher ; by the conductors of presses ; by the officers in all seminaries . The addresses of Mr. Mann and Dr. Palmer , to which we adverted at the commencement of this article , both imply the substance of that which we have drawn out more at length , and therefore are to be valued . We are more and more impressed with the conviction that the best minds of the country should give themselves to the work of instructing the young in the true ENDS of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , the young are dazzled by the promises of wealth ; commerce wins them swiftly and unceasingly to its pursuits ; // political prizes attract their desire ; and ease , dilettantism , and social distinction , lull and destroy , in their charmed embrace , too many rarely gifted and noble souls . Now then , more than ever , more clearly , continuously and authoritatively , should be expressed the true idea of human culture , its method and its fruits ; the done simplicity of it , shaming from luxury ; the innate and self-demonstrated nobleness of it , awakening magnanimous and lofty desire . It is part of the mission of writers to show , and part of the mission of preachers to proclaimand proclaiming it , to exhibit it in their character and careerthat acquirement and study are to be subordinate to Development ; that development itself , even at its perfection , is to be tributary to Action ; and that action , to be worthy of the powers of man , must be devoted to permanent and great interests ; must be harmonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , we of this age need.to be taught to consecrate every power with the chrism of self-devotion ; to act ideally , for spiritual ends , for our Maker , and for truth . To the emerald , of hope ; and the sapphire , that symbolizes a lofty aspiration ; and the amethyst , that keeps from intoxicating passion ; to the ruby , that guards the happiness of the wearer ; and the opal , that suggests a perfected accomplishment , we should add in its place , setting it central too in the Tiara , that " new white stone , " the diamond of God , wherein is written the name of His Son . Then , though life close suddenly , it shall find the most noble consummation above . Then , though life tarry long , it shall be full to the end of the youth of hope , and high endeavor . And then , as the race passes onward to its goalthe blood of martyrs , the truth of confessors , the life of the virtuous , the deeds of the heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lord , all coming to their result-our influence also shall live and act . It shall fall as the light , and distill as the dew . It shall run as the stream , perennial from the spring . It shall shake like Lebanon , in its majestic fruition .
