txt ART . 1. - DOCTRINE OF THE HIGHER LAW . THE late animated discussions of what is termed the higher law ' having partially subsided , there is now perhaps a favorable opportunity for a more calm consideration of the subject . During the intense excitement of controversy , the public mind is not always in a cQndition the best adapted to form a sound and settled judgment , respecting the merits of the case under discussion . The progress of the contest may have furnished ample mate , ials for an intelligent decision . But a less agitated state of feeling is needed , for a deliberate and judicious adjustment of the points in debate . The earnest contentions of advocates at the bar may prepare a case on trial , for a cool and impartial examination by the jury . When a cause has been ably pleaded before the public , they may be able to decide , whether the truth lies wholly with one of the parties , or whether a portion of it belongs to each . Our present object is not agitation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , ' there is reason to believe , that an important distinction has been kept too much out of sight ; the distinction between a refusal to obey a law , and violence offered to its execution , between non-obedience and forcible resistance . On one side , the writers or speakers adopt as a principle the apostolic injunction , that " whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God ; expending their elo // quence in depicting , in glowing colors , the enormity of forcible opposition to law ;  --  to human government sanctioned by divine authority . As they are silent on the point of obedience to laws believed to be contrary to the higher law of God ; their opponents draw the inference , unwarrantably perhaps , that they mean to enjoin indiscriminate conformity to all the laws of the land , however unrighteous some of them may be . On the other hand , if some writers dwell exclusively on the duty of obeying God rather than man ; of refusing to aid in the execution of laws manifestly iniquitous ; the inference may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the measures of government . In this way , Christian brethren , and even preachers of the gospel of peace , may be arrayed against each other , in determined conflict ; when in reality , there is no substantial difference in the opinions which they hold , on the subjects under discussion ; each believing that an unrighteous law is to be disobeyed , but not forcibly resisted . Yet jealousy and party animosity are roused , because each side thinks proper to lay out all its strength upon one only of the points under consideration , regardless of the misconstructions which may be expected to follow from its silence , with respect to the other point . On this subject , as well as on others , the pastors of churches need to be on their guard , lest they undesignedly lead their hearers into dangerous error , by this onesided mode of presenting even important truth . But there may be some who think that , so far as our duty is concerned , the distinction here made is groundless ; that if a particular law ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and on the other hand , if it is not right to obey it , it is right to resist it . Now what saith the scriptitre respecting this ? The apostle Paul , in the thirteenth chapter of his epistle to the Romans , has not only given us the fundamental principle of our obligations to civil government , but has stated distinctly the practical application of this principle . " Let every soul , " he says , " be subject to the higher powers ; for there is no power but of God ; the powers that be are ordained of God . Whosoever , therefore , resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God . " " Ye must needs be subject , not only for wrath , " that is , for fear of punishment , " but also for conscience sake . " The apostle Peter is , if possible , still more explicit . " Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man , for the Lord 's sake ; whether it be to the king as supreme , or unto governors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the punishment of evil doers , and for the praise of them that do well . For so is the will of God . " // Yet the sacred volume abundantly declares , what is manifest even from the light of nature , that we are bound to obey God rather than man ; the will of the infinitely wise and benevolent Ruler of the universe , rather than the will of a dependent and erring creature ; that if divine law conflicts with human law , the latter is to be treated as having no binding authority . This is evident from the very principle on which the apostles place our obligations to obedience , " for so is the will of God . " that surely can not be according to His will , which He himself has declared to be contrary to His will . The same apostle enjoins it upon children to " obey their parents in all things ; for this , " says he , " is well pleasing to the Lord . " Yet does any one suppose that it is well pleasing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands , by lying or stealing , in obedience to the will of their parents ? But the exception to the universality of our obligation to obey human laws , is not applicable to the prohibition of forcible resistance to government ; unless it can be shown , that God has required us to resist . It may be the duty of a man to disobey a particular law himself , when he can not be justified in offering violence to prevent its execution by others . We have a signal instance of the divine approbation of disobedience to human authority , in the case of the three Jews in the court of Babylon , who refused to worship the golden image which Nebuchadnessar had set up . The decree , with its tremendous penalty , was delivered to them in person , from the throne itself . Their declaration of their purpose to disobey was equally distinct.and resolute . " Be it known unto thee , 0 King , that we will not serve thy gods , nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approbation , in the astonishing miracle which He wrought for their deliverance . But this exainple of righteous disobedience , rising even to moral sublimity , furnishes no authority for active resistance to government . A parallel case is that of Daniel , exposed to the devouring fury of a den of lions , and rescued by divine interposition . Here also was disobedience without resistance . Daniel did notfight for his liberty . The God in whom he trusted delivered him . When the apostles Peter and John , soon after the day of Pentecost , were arraigned before the rulers of the Jews , and commanded " not to speak at all , nor teach , in the name of Jesus , " they answered , " Whether it be right , in the sight of God , to hearken unto you , more than unto God , judge ye . This was their justification for refusing to obey injunctions contrary to the declared will of God . But did they offer any vio // lence to the constituted authorities of their nation ? Not many days after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were with him , and were filled with indignation , and laid their hands on the apostles , and put them in the common prison . But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison door , and brought them forth and said , Go stand and speak , in the temple to the people , all the words of this life . " Here the angel of the Lord enjoins on the apostles direct disobedience to the injunctions of the high priest and his associates . But does he give them a commission to offer resistance to their rulers ? The long and glorious train of martyrs , in early and later ages , forfeited their lives for obeying God rather than man . Rtxt did they claim a right to resist the power of those by whom they were ordered to execution ? Physical force ought never to be employed by individuals , against the measures of a regularly constituted and righteous government . The higher law , the law of heaven , is most commonly appealed to , in support of the right of disobedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , in its application to the positive duty of obedience . In such a government as ours , at least , the laws which are not opposed to the known will of God are far more numerous , than those which are . The cases in which the divine law requires obedience to human laws are many more , than those in which it enjoins or permits disobedience . But how does it appear , that the Ruler of the universe adds the sanction of His infinite authority , to the government and laws of men ? Why are human enactments called " ordinances of God ? " Why are we required to obey them , " not only for wrath , but for conscience sake ; " - " for the Lords sake ? " The argument on this point is simple and brief . A God of boundless goodness seeks the welfare of His creatures . The best good of a community of men can not be promoted , civil society can not even exist , without some kind of government . The worst possible condition of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all restraint , except the merciless dictation of a mob , the most insufferable of all tyrannies . Natural reason and divine revelation concur , in showing the absolute necessity of human government , wherever any number of men have a residence . It is therefore the will of the Creator , that in every nation under Heaven , there should be laws , and power to execute them . But as He has not , except in the case of the Jewish dispensation , prescribed any particularform of government ; He has left it to the people to determine this for themselves ; either by remaining under their present constitution , or altering it at // their pleasure , provided they do not admit into it any article or feature contrary to His known will . On this condition , they can choose between absolute and limited monarchy , 1ereditary and elective nobility , simple and confederated republicanism . The existing government , till it is overturned or changed , by the people of the state or nation , is that to which the sanction of divine authority is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be are ordained of God . " The constitution and laws of a country are called in scripture " ordinances of man , " and also " ordinances of God ; " - ordinances of man , as they are formed by the people , or their representatives ; ordinances of God , so far as they are in accordance with His will . If in a political constitution , an article is introduced which is known to be contrary to the divine law , we are bound not to obey it , as it is not an ordinance of God . But this does not invalidate the other parts of the instrument . One or more unjust laws enacted by the legislature of a state , does not nullify the whole code of its statutes . No human govern.ment is perfect . No one , probably , is altogether free from injustice , in its structure and ordinances . If a single instance of wrong dissolves our obligations to obedience , all the governments of the world must lose their hold on the consciences of men . The duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cease , till they become so corrupt , in their whole structure and administration , as not to answer the purposes of a righteous government , and to justify a resort to revolution ; a revolution to be effected , under very peculiar circumstances , not by any minor portion of the community , but by the great body of the people . As private citizens are bound to obey those laws of the land which are not contrary to the will of God , so the ministers of justice are under a moral obligation to execute these laws ; unless they are entrusted with discretionary powers to dispense with their execution in particular cases . But they are bound to refuse to execute laws which are contrary to the higher law of God ; even though the refusal should involve the loss of their office . A man 's holding an appointment under human government does not release him from his obligations to the Ruler of the universe . But are we required to yield obedience to human authority in all cases not contrary to the known will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to that which has not been conferred according to the constitution of the country . A pretender to a crown to which he has no authorized title , has no valid claim to the allegiance of those whom he presumes to call his subjects . His assumption of power is not an ordinance of God , as it is not even an ordinance // of man . And if a man is a regularly constituted officer of the government , our obligation of obedience to him extends no larther than the power legally conferred on him . The decisions of a justice of the peace are binding , within the limits of his appropriate jurisdiction ; but beyond this , they have no more authority , than the opinions of a private citizen . If human laws are to be sometimes obeyed , and sometimes disobeyed , it becomes an important question , who is to be the judge of the obligation to obedience in particular cases ? Is each individual to determine this for himself , or is the government to decide for him ? The inquiry may relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , to its meaning and constitutionality , or to its expediency . In the first case , each man is himself accountable to his Maker . The divine cornmands are laid upon individuals . The responsibility of judging what is right in the sight of God , in a case in which any one is called to act , can not be thrown off upon others . " Every one of us shall give account of himself to God . " To enable us to decide right , respecting the morality of a required action , it may be very proper for us to seek for light , from those who are well informed on the subject ; but the final decision must be our own . No one , whatever countenance he may have from legal authority , can be justified in doing that which he himself believes to be contrary to the will of God . In a Christian country like ours , there is indeed presumptive evidence in favor of the rectitude of the laws . But this evidence is not so infallible , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unnecessary . To determine questions concerning the meaning and constitutionality of laws , is the province of the higher courts of judi* cature . On these points , their decisions ought to be received as final . What they declare to be law is law . If the inquiry be , whether a particular law is expedient , whether it conduces to the public good , this is to be determined by the legislature only . The very purpose for which the body is constituted , is to consult , and to decide by their vote , what laws will best promote the good of the community . This is the voice of the people , expressed by their repre*entatives . Or if the inhabitants of a country choose to be governed by an absolute monarch , then he is the legislature , as well as judge . His published will is law . As the laws of a state or nation are made , or ought to be made , for the welfare of the whole community , or at least of a major portion of it ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the legislature , is an " ordinance of man , " and as // such , is an " ordinance of God , " if not contrary to His known will . If this is not law , then there is no law in the land . If every man is to judge for himself , what will best promote the public good , and to make this the rule of his conduct ; then he is his own legislature ; doing that which is right in his own eyes ; making and unmaking laws at his own pleasure . All obedience to any law but his own will is out of the question . All reverence for the law of the land is at an end . But is a man to be forbidden the right of private judgment , with respect to the laws of his country . He has undoubtedly a right to his own opinion on the subject , provided he does not make this the rule of his conduct . He has also a right to express freely his opinions , to endeavor to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence to obtain a repeal or alteration of the laws which he thinks inexpedient . Bat till this is effected , he can not be justified in withholding his obedience . The right of public discussion is not inconsistent with obliga. tions to obey . If the interest of the community requires that there should be laws , it equally requires that they should be obeyed . A fundamental principle of every free government , is a voluntary and conscientious submission to law . How far is an executive officer to follow his own judgment , in the discharge of his official duty ? In doubtful cases , it does not belong to him to assume the prerogative of the judiciary , to decide what the law is ; what is its true meaning . Nor is it his province to determine whether a particular law is expedient or not , and to act accordingly . This belongs to the judgment and decision of the legislature . What they have enacted , he is bound to execute , whether , in his own opinion , it is or is not conducive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office requires him to execute , is contrary to the known will of God , he must decide for himself . It is a question respecting his duty to his Maker . Neither the legislature nor the judiciary can assume his responsibility in this . In treatincr of the distinction between mere disobedience to 0 law , and forcible resistance , we have already had occasion to advert to the danger of dwelling exclusively upon either of these , under the influence of party views and party feelings . A similar danger results from confining an animated discussion either to obedience of law , or to disobedience . One public speaker may expend all his high-wrought eloquence , in enforcing our obligations to obedience . By omitting to notice any exception , he may make the impression , upon some at least of his hearers , that they are bound to obey all the laws in the statute book , without making the inquiry whether any of them are contrary // to the law of God . Another , by confining his observations to the duty of disobeying the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are just and good . Another still may dwell at large on the right of private judgment , with respect to the rectitude or injustice of particular laws ; while he omits to state , that our belief of their expediency is not to be the condition of our obedience . The question is often asked , shall we obey God or man ; the divine law , or human law ? Answer , both ; the divine law always , human law , when it is not in conflict with the divine ; the latter because obedience to it is not only permitted but enjoined by the higher law of God . If the view which has now been taken of this subject is just , a solemn responsibility rests upon us , to be prepared to make a correct distinction between the cases in which obedience to human law is required by God , and those in which it is forbidden by Him . We may incur the divine displeasure by omitting to obey righteous enactments , as well as by obeying those which are unrighteous . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any violent political party . We can not throw off personal responsibility , by yielding to the current of popular opinion . We must be ourselves accountable to God , for the manner in which we discharge our duties to civil government . Is not conscience a safe guide , in cases of difficulty and doubt ? If we follow its dictates , shall we not be sure to go right ? Is it not a law in our hearts , higher than the law of the land ? When our conscience is itself right , the conduct which is conformed to it will undoubtedly be right . But the scriptures speak of an evil conscience , as well as of a good one ; of one that is weak , as well as one that is enlightened . The* conscience of the same individual may be at one time honest , at another time perverse . It may be under the influence of prejudice , of self.conceit , of party spirit , of corrupt propensities . Conscience is that by which we distinguish between right and wrong in our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and conduct . In nothing , perhaps , are we more liable to erroneous , partial decisions , than in what respects ourselves . Self.interest has a powerful influence over our moral judgments . Conscience includes two elements at least , consciousness , which is a notice of our own mental acts , and a comparison of these with some standard of r.ight , as the law of God , impartial benevolence , or the principle of immutable rectitude . To these there is frequently added , in customary use , certain emotions , as self-complacency or remorse , a feeling of // good or ill desert , an apprehension of danger . But the two essential elements are consciousness , and a reference to a standard of right . Now the decisions of conscience may be erroneous , in consequence of false views of this standard . He who makes his own inclinations the rule of right is almost sure to err in his moral judgments . What some persons call their conscience is far from being , in all cases , an unerring standard of rectitude . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in obedience to the canons of the Catholic church , to prohibit the reading of the scriptures by the people of his charge , his conscience is guided by a law which he places above the law of the Bible . Most governments forbid and punish perjury . But if a Romanist believes that his church , or its pontificial head , has authority from on high to set aside the obligation of an oath , he adjusts his conscience to a standard which he considers higher than the law of the land . But are not the decisions of conscience intuitive ; and is not intuition infallible ? Can a man be deceived with respect to that which he knows to be right ? To this we answer , conscience may be infallible in some cases , and not in all . Its prerogative is analogous to that of the intellect , which is given to enable us to decide between truth and error . In some cases , its determinations are intuitive , immediate , and infallible . But in a far greater number of instances , a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached may be merely probable . Those truths only are properly denominated intuitive which , like mathematical axioms , are immediately discerned , are perfectly certain , and are acknowledged by all who have thought on them enough to understand the meaning of the terms in which they are expressed . Propositions concerning which any reasonable doubt can be raised , are not strictly intuitive . Intuitional philosophy and intuitional theology are becoming popular . But much that passes current as such wants the character of certainty , which is necessary to give it a valid claim to the title which it assumes . Without some intuitive truths , there could be no reasoning at all ; as they enter into the structure of every argument . But because these are immediately discerned , and universally acknowledged , it by no means follows that all other truths have this character . So is it with the dictates of conscience . Some of them are sponta. neous and indubitable . Others are the result of various reasonings and influences ; and are far from being infallible . Are we not under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both toward God , and toward men ? " How can this result be effected by our efforts , unless we make con // science the standard of our conduct ? Can we ever be justified in acting contrary to the decisions of our conscience ? Certainly not . Hence arises the momentous responsibility under which we are placed in relation to conscience . It is a double responsibility ; in the first place , to do all in our power to maintain a good conscience , and then to see that it is made invariably the guide of our conduct . The only way in which we can act right , is by having our conscience right , and obeying its dictates . If our conscience is wrong , we shall do wrong , whether we obey it or not . Obedience to it will be a deviation from the law of righteousness . To disobey it must be wrong , because though the external action , in itself considered , may happen to be no violation of any right rule of duty ; yet the agent is culpable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that which he believes to be wrong ; as in the case referred to by Paul , the eating of things offered to idols . A man s conscience is his own rule of right . It is not a standard for others ; except so far as their 's accords with his . They are bound to conform to their own convictions of their duty . As he is not infallible , it is possible that they may be right , and that he is wrong . He ought to consider , that they have consciences , as well as he . They may indeed violate their obligations , and so may he . In their relations to civil government , they may be convinced , that they are bound to obey a law , which he thinks he ought to disobey . The claims of conscience are appealed to , to justify disobedience , more frequently than to enforce obedience . But its authority is as sacredly binding , in the one case , as in the other . In one , a man 's conscientious regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land ; in the other , the authority of God releases him from any obligation to obey those laws which are known to be in opposition to the divine commands . This may show the reason why he may deem it his duty to refuse to obey a law of the land , when he is not authorized to offer forcible resistance to the ministers of justice , in their endeavors to execute the law . If he claims a right to disobey it , because he thinks it unjust , he ought not to oppose them , in their efforts to execute that which they deem to be just , and which the nature of their office requires them to enforce . He is not forbidden , it is true , to use arguments to convince them that they have formed an erroneous judgment of the character of the law . But so long as they retain their opinion of its justice , he is bound not to resist them , in the performance of that which they deem to be their duty . He ought also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // law , were acting under the obligations of conscience ; and that this is presumptive , though not decisive evidence , that it is not an unrighteous statute , however inexpedient it may be . While he disobeys , from regard to the demands of his own conscience , the officers of justice may be required by their consciences to enforce obedience , or to inflict the penalty for disobedience . In this conflict of opinions , and of conduct , in which one party or the other is wrong , each is under high obligations to see that his conscience is right , in the view of God his final Judge .
