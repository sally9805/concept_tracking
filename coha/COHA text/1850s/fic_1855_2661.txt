PHILADELPHIA : QUAKER CITY PUBLISHING HOUSE , 32 SOUTH THIRD STREET . 1855 . Entered , according to Act of Congress , in the year 1855 , by H.M. RULISON , In the Clerk 's Office of the District Court , for the Southern District of Ohio . THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIMS . CHAPTER I. FLEMING 'S HOTEL . In the year 1785 , as , also , prior and subsequent to that time , there was a hotel situated in one of the less frequented streets of Pittsburg , then the largest town west of the mountains , and kept by one Fleming , whence it derived the name of " Fleming 's Hotel . " This house , a small one , and indifferently furnished , was a favorite resort of the Indians who visited the town on trading expeditions . Fleming had two daughters , who possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman -- beauty . History does not , to the best of our knowledge , give us the first names of the two girls ; and we will distinguish them as Eliza and Sarah . Unfortunately for these young females , they had ever been surrounded by unfavorable circumstances , and exposed to the vices of bad associations ; and that nice discrimination between propriety and politeness , which is a natural characteristic of the modest woman , had become somewhat obliterated , and the hold which virtue ever has by nature in the heart of the gentler sex , had been somewhat loosened . In short , the young Misses Fleming failed at all times to observe that degree of propriety which should ever characterize the pure in heart , and were , by many , accused of immorality . How far this accusation was true , we shall not attempt to say , but , doubtless , there were not wanting many tongues to spread slanderous reports . In early years of womanhood , Eliza had given her affections to one who sought her love under the guise of a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such characters usually are -- a libertine , whose only motive in seeking to win her confidence and young affections was to gratify his hellish passions in the ruin of virtue and a good name . Under the most solemn assurances of deep , abiding , unalterable love for her , and the most solemn promises of marriage at an early day , which if he failed to perform , the direst maledictions of heaven , and the most awful curses , were called down upon his own head , even to the eternal consuming of his soul in the flames of perdition , he succeeded in his design . Virtue was overcome , and the jewel of purity departed from the heart of another of earth 's daughters . Vain were the tears of the repentant girl to induce a performance of the promises so solemnly made ; false had been and still were the vows of the profligate ; but he continued to make them all the more profusely ; and hope , at first unwavering , then fainter and fainter , filled the heart of his victim . Once conquered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having taken something of a fancy to this lady , he was for a long time attached to her , and , in his way , remained faithful . Such were the mutual relations sustained by these two toward each other , when , one day , the betrayer entered the presence of the betrayed , and , in some agitation , said : " Eliza , my dear , you have always been a kind , dear girl to me , and I have resolved to repay your constancy and devotion by making you my bride in a few days ; but first I must demand of you a service , an important service . Can I depend on you ? " " You know you can ; let me know how I can aid you in such a manner as will insure me your hand , and I will serve you unto death . " " Bravely spoken ! Just what I expected of your devoted love ! But the service I shall require will sorely try that love ! " " Then let me prove its strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? my sincerity ? " " Have I not given you stronger proof than a thousand asseverations , or the strongest oaths , that my confidence is unbounded ? Without this trust , I should be wretched beyond endurance ! " " I am glad to hear you talk so . Still I fear you will not consent to serve me as I shall wish . " " Try me and see . " " Are you of a jealous disposition , my love ? " " Jealous ? What a question for you to ask ! " " It may appear strange , yet I would be pleased to have you answer me truly , and without reserve . Tell me your real sentiments without reserve or disguise . Much depends thereon . " " Truly , I can not say , never having been tried ; but I can verily believe that intense hatred would arise in my heart toward one of my sex who would attempt to supplant me in your affections . " " Suppose I should disregard their efforts , what then ? " " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing beside . " " ' T is well ! But suppose that I should tell you that I once loved another than you ? " " As you love me ? " " No ; with a boyish affection , soon forgotten . " " Then I would care nothing for it . " " Not if it left an incurable wound ? " " Did it ? " " It did ! " " My God ! How have I been deceived . " " Do n't be alarmed , my dear , the wound was not in the heart -- it was in pride . " " How ? " " I was not troubled at heart , but the girl I fancied gave me mortal offense , and I would be revenged ! " " How so ? What is this ? Do n't love , and wish revenge ! Revenge for what ? And that dark frown -- what means all this ? " " Be calm ; you are excited ; you fear my truth ; and where there is no confidence , love soon departs . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell in love with a beautiful girl of my own age ; but soon learned that she was not virtuous , and with this knowledge my love changed into desire . As the least return for my love , to gain which she had recourse to all the wiles and blandishments of a coquette , I wished to possess her for a time ; but she spurned me from her presence as she would a dog ! From that hour I have sworn to have my revenge and gain my point . My hour has now come , and I can accomplish my oath , provided I am secure of one thing . " " And what is that ? " " Your co-operation . " " Me aid in such a scheme ! " " Why not ? " " Why not ? Shall I turn the enemy of my own sex , and aid in the destruction of one who has never injured me ? " " She has injured you . " " In what way ? " " By destroying , in a good degree , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would , long ere this time , have been my wife ; but how could I trust my happiness with woman when woman had proved treacherous ? I had been once deceived , and distrust had taken the place of faith , when I met you . You know the result . Now tell me , has not this girl injured you deeply ? " " It may be so ; but why not let her go ? What good can it do to pursue her with vengeance ? Perhaps she has repented . How wicked , then , to destroy her peace of mind . " " Dream not that such as she will ever repent . But to satisfy you on this point , I can say , I know she has not changed from what she was ; and it is this knowledge that , above all things , urges me on in my plans . " " Well , what do you wish me to do ? " " Listen . I have just learned that this girl , in company with her family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio or Kentucky , and will put up at this house . Now I wish you to so place the young lady , that I can have access to her sleeping apartment ; this is all . " " I can not do it . " " You can ; I will take number eighteen for the night ; put her in seventeen , and it is all I ask . I am sure this is easily done . " " And thus bring about my own shame and her dishonor ? " " I tell you she is already dishonored ; and instead of bringing shame upon yourself , you take it away forever . " " Do not tempt me to do wrong ! Alas , I have done too much evil already ! I pray God I may be forgiven ! " " Come , now , be a good girl , and do me this one favor ; it is the last I shall require of you until I give you my name . " " I can not . Such conduct would disgrace our house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is hard to prevent such things being spread abroad . " " I will take care of that point . Your house shall not be injured one particle by the occurrence , I give you my word for it . Now do you consent ? " " Perhaps you still love this girl , and are trying to deceive me . " " I swear that I do not , that I love only you . " " Why , then , seek the society of this other ? " " I have sworn it , as I have already told you ; and this oath must be performed . Will you aid me or not ? " " I can not . I pray you again , do not tempt me ! " " But you must help me . I can not do without you . " " For God 's sake say no more ! Every feeling of my heart revolts at the thought ! Just think , for a moment , what it is you ask of me ! Think what would be my feelings ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you debase yourself and me by such an act ? " " I only desire you to decide between this and a worse debasement . Which will you choose ? " " What mean you ? " " That I will only marry you on condition you will accede to my present proposition . " " Have you not told me , time and again , that you looked upon me as your wife by the highest of all laws , the laws of nature and of God ? How , then , can you talk of not making me legally yours , in the sight of men ? " " I will , I tell you , if you will do as I wish in the present instance . Come , be kind , be gentle and loving , as you ever have been , and we will soon be completely happy by acknowledging our love before men , at the altar . " " This again ! Oh , tempter , betray me not ! " " You have your choice . I will never marry you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , will be the shame ? Which will you be , an honorable wife , or a despised offcast ? Your destiny is in your own hands , make your election . " " Oh , God ! I am in your power ! " " Then you consent ? " " What assurance have I that this promise will make me your wife ? Have you not promised the same thing scores of times ? " " Require any form of obligation , and I will give it ; as I mean what I say , make your own conditions . " " Give me a written promise . " He gave it as she dictated it : " I hereby promise to marry Eliza Fleming within one month from this 12th day of April , 1786 . This promise I most solemnly give , calling on heaven to witness it , and if I fail in its performance , may the curses of God rest upon my soul in this world and in the world to come . " LOUIS DURANT . " " That will do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Yes ; I am no longer free . But mind , all must be done quietly and kept a profound secret . " " Leave that to me ; I will be responsible for the result . " Thus was a net woven for an unsuspecting victim . Who was she , and what the cause for this unrelenting and revengeful feeling on the part of Durant ? Time must show . CHAPTER II . A VILLAIN UNMASKED . In a beautiful district of the " Old Dominion , " bordering on the Rappahannock , there lived , just previous to the time of the opening of our story , a planter , who had once been wealthy , but whose princely fortune had become much reduced by indiscriminate kindness . Possessed of a noble heart , a generous disposition , and the finest sympathies , he could never find it in his heart to say " no " to an application for assistance . Thousands had thus gone to pay debts of security ; and , at last , he resolved to move to the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as to cut loose from the associations which were rapidly diminishing the remains of his wealth . This planter , whom we shall call General Walton , ( the last name assumed , the title one given him by common consent , ) had one son , and an only daughter , the former twenty-one , the latter eighteen , at the time we wish to introduce them to the reader 's notice . Both were worthy , the one as a man , the other as a woman . He was noble , intellectual , manly ; she was beautiful , accomplished , intelligent ; both possessed those higher and nobler qualities of mind and heart which dignify and ally it to divinity . Ellen Walton , an heiress , jointly with her brother , in prospective , and reputed the wealthiest fair one in all the district , ( the world do n't always know the true situation of a man 's affairs , ) was not left to pine away in solitude with the dismal prospect in view of becoming that dreaded personage -- an old maid . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some her wealth , and some both . To all but one she turned a deaf ear ; that one , though the least presuming of the many , and too diffident to urge his claim until impelled by the irresistable violence of his love , possessed , unknown to himself , a magnetic power over the heart of the fair being . Many were the doubts and fears of both -- natural accompaniments of true , sincere , devoted , but unacknowledged , love -- but all were dispelled by the mutual exchange of thoughts , and the mutual plighting of faith . Vows once made by the pure in heart , are seldom , if ever , broken , and then by some higher duty or demand . For a time the youthful lovers were happy -- happy in themselves , and the joys of the new existence opened up to them by the magic wand of LOVE . But love has its trials , as all can testify who have tasted its potency in the heart ; and so these two learned . Their engagement was a family secret , not yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered their attentions , in the vain hope of ultimate success . Particularly was this the case with those who had an eye to the fortune rather than the heiress , taking the latter as the only means of obtaining the former ; and first among this number was Louis Durant , a man of corrupt principles , and deeply depraved feelings . A sprig of a noble family of small pretensions , whose pride far exceeded their means , he was desirous of obtaining wealth ; and being too indolent to enter a profession , too poor to become a merchant , and too proud to work , as a last resort , he wished to marry a fortune . Like most of his class , he was unscrupulous as to means so the end was attained . It was , therefore , an easy matter to conform , in outward appearance , to the society he was in . This he never failed to do . When with the Waltons , he was a pattern of generosity , and a pitying angel . When with the gambler , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a handler of cards . With the intuitive perception of woman , Ellen saw through his character at once ; and , though she treated him with civility , never gave him any encouragement . Blinded by her fortune , and construing her reserve into the bashfulness of a first passion , being too vain to acknowledge the inability of his powers of fascination to carry all before them , he gave himself up to hope , and already counted on the half of the Walton estate as his own , and spent many a shilling of his small funds on the strength of the anticipation . When he saw that the bottom of his purse would soon be reached , he sought an opportunity , declared himself in love , and asked the hand of Miss Walton . The General to whom he had always appeared a " fine fellow , " would leave his daughter to decide the matter . Thus referred , he lost no time in making Ellen the recipient of his " tale of love . " All his theatrical powers were called in action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far different from those intended . Though the outward semblance was complete , Ellen saw that the passion was feigned , and a still deeper dislike took possession of her feelings . But with gentle delicacy , she told him his passion was not returned . " Then , " said he , " let me win your love . I am sure your heart will yield when you are convinced of the depth of the devotedness of my affection . " " Do not flatter yourself with a vain hope . I feel that I shall never be able to love you ; and it is in kindness that I tell you so at once . " " Ah , adorable , angelic being ! One so kind , so considerate , so good , is too pure , too near akin to heaven , for man to possess . I only ask to be your friend . " " As such , you shall ever be welcome . " " Thanks ! thanks ! May I but prove worthy of your friendship ! " Thus terminated his first attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend was the first step in a plot already matured . As a friend , he could ever have access to the heiress , and be received more familiarly than in any other capacity , save as an acknowledged lover . This familiarity would give him the opportunity of ingratiating himself into her affections , of which , finally , he felt certain . He became a constant and frequent visitor at the mansion of the Waltons , and was ever received with cordiality . He let no opportunity pass unimproved to carry out his design . Goodness , benevolence , charity , were counterfeited most adroitly , until even Ellen began to think she had done him injustice by her suspicions . This is a favorable moment for a lover . Prove that you have been dealt with unjustly , and a woman 's heart is opened by sympathy to let you in . It was well for Ellen that her heart was already occupied , or this might possibly have been her fate . As it was , she became , insensibly and unintentionally , kind to Durant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his heart exulted in the prospect of complete success . When he thought the proper time had arrived , he prepared the way , and again declared himself a lover , with more eloquence than before . Again his suit was gently declined ; but this time he persevered until his importunities became unbearable , and with them , all Ellen 's old prejudices returned , strengthened ten-fold . If he could and would force himself for weeks and months upon an unwilling victim of his importunities , and attempt by such means to force her to accept his hand , he was depraved enough for any other wickedness . So she plainly told him she could not and would not submit longer to his unreasonable conduct ; that he must consider himself as finally , fully and unrecallably dismissed . " And give up all hope -- the hope that has sustained and given me life so long ? Oh , think , Ellen , think of my misery , of the untold wretchedness into which you plunge me , and let your heart , your kind , generous heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you often and often that it was impossible for me to love you , and that it was kindness to tell you so . If you have disregarded my oft repeated declaration , the truth of which you must long ere this have been convinced , the fault is yours , not mine . " " I know you have so spoken often , but still I have dared to hope . I loved too fervently for the passion ever to die before you denied me hope . Think of all these things , and then recall your words . " " You have repeated them so frequently , that I could not well avoid thinking of them whether I chose to or not . Let me now say , once for all , that importunities are utterly useless , and can prove of no avail . " " Then I am to understand you as casting me off from your presence ; and this being the end of your kindness , may I ask what was the object of that kindness ? " " I always endeavor to do unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you think such a course wrong , I can not help it . " " Then you would wish some person , who had the power , to show you all manner of good will , until your affections were won , and so firmly fixed as to be unalterable , and then cast you off ? " " No , I should be far from desiring such conduct on the part of any one . " " And yet that is your way of ' doing as you would be done by ! ' " " I am not aware of ever having done so ; if I have been the unwitting instrument of such acts , I am truly sorry for it . " " Then let your sorrow work repentance . " " Tell me how , and I will try to do so . " " You can not be ignorant of my meaning . " " I am totally at a loss to know how your remarks can apply to me , in any way . " " Then I will speak plainly . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bid me hope for a return of my love , and allured by that hope , founded on those actions , I have placed my affections so strongly , that I fear it will be death to tear them away . As you have caused me to love , is it demanding more than justice that I should ask you to at least try to love me in return ? " " Mr. Durant , you know that your accusations are untrue . Did you not just tell me that you loved before you ever spoke to me on the subject ? and have you not repeatedly , aye , a hundred times , told me I was cold toward you , ever evincing a want of cordiality ? How , then , can you have the face to ask a return of love on this score ? Since you have been at such pains to make out so contradictory a case , I will say that you but lessen yourself in my esteem by the attempt ! " " I see , alas , you are a heartless coquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my father 's wealth in your possession . I have read your motive from the beginning , sir , and have only refrained from telling you my mind , because I make it a rule to have the good will of a dog , in preference to his ill will , when I can . But as your conduct to-day has removed the last thin screen from your real character , and revealed your naked depravity of heart , I care not even for your friendship . You know , you feel , that you are a degraded wretch , and that you are unworthy of the society of the virtuous . " " Madam , those words just spoken have sealed your fate ! Dog as I am , I have the power to work your ruin , and I will do it ! I go from your presence a bitter and unrelenting foe ! The love you have rejected has turned into bitterness , and the dregs of that bitterness you shall drink till your soul sickens unto death ! I will never lose sight of you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hide in what corner of the world you may , I will find you ! When you meet me , remember I am an implacable enemy , seeking revenge ! " " Go , vile miscreant , from my presence ! Think not to intimidate me . Better an ' open enemy than a secret foe . ' I am glad you have unmasked yourself so fully . Now I know that I have escaped the worst fate on earth . " " Not the worst ! To be the wife of even a villain is better than to be his victim ! " " Leave my presence , sir , or I will call a slave to put you out ! Infamous wretch ! The curse of God be upon you ! " He went , quailing under the flash of her indignant eye , which made his guilty soul cower in abasement . When he was fairly gone , her high strung energies relaxed , and the reaction prostrated her strength . She sunk upon a lounge , and , giving way to her feelings , exclaimed : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Oh , God , pity me , and let not the wicked triumph ! In Thee I put my trust . Let thy watchful eye be over me , and thy power protect me . Oh , let me not fall into the hands of my enemy ; but preserve me by thy right hand , and keep me lifted up ! " Prayer gave her strength , and renewed her courage . Relying , with firm faith , on the goodness and watchful care of her Father in heaven , she became cheerful and composed . She very seldom saw or heard anything of Durant , but when she did , it always awakened fear . For a year she heard nothing of him , and , at last , the old dread had passed from her heart , when her father prepared to go to the West . As for Durant , he went from her presence muttering curses and threatening vengeance , among which was distinguished by a slave , grated out between his clenched teeth , " I 'll make her repent this day 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all h -- ll oppose ! " CHAPTER III . THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIM . The reader has , doubtless , arrived at the conclusion that Durant was planning the destruction of Ellen Walton when he so earnestly desired the assistance of Miss Fleming ; and it will now be perceived how false were his statements in relation to the character of the expected guest . Though unseen himself , he had taken every precaution to make certain of the party at the Fleming Hotel ; and just at the close of day he had the satisfaction of seeing his efforts crowned with success . General Walton , influenced by the tales his daughter 's foe had whispered to him in confidence , passed by the more elegant houses , which , but for defaming reports , he would have preferred making his abode during his short stay in the place , and took lodgings at the " Fleming . " Eliza Fleming made the acquaintance of her young female guest , and every fresh insight into Miss Walton 's character made her regret the hard necessity she was under of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind , but at length her determination was fixed . To procure the ruin of the innocent guest , ( for she had thoroughly satisfied herself that Miss Walton was innocent and virtuous , ) whom every obligation of hospitality required her to protect , was indeed damnable ; but to forfeit the hand of Durant under the circumstances was impossible , and not to be thought of . Poor Ellen ! Heaven shield thee ! Durant was not seen by any of the Waltons , as it was his object to keep them in entire ignorance of his proximity until such time as he chose to reveal himself . Miss Fleming knew where to find him ; and , according to agreement , met him during the evening , to arrange some matters connected with the plot . " Louis , you have required too much at my hands in this affair . I fear I shall not be able to comply with the terms of agreement . " " Then return my written promise of marriage , and live to be despised and a by-word among men ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had resolved to save your own honor and name at every hazard . " " But is this my only hope ? " " Yes , as true as there is a God in heaven , it is . I will forsake you forever unless you comply with my wishes in this affair . " " Then I must name some conditions , to which I shall demand the strictest compliance on your part . " " Name them . " " In the first place , then , to avoid the possibility of noise or mishap , I will give the lady a potion , which will stupefy her faculties , and cause a deep sleep to lock up all her senses for the space of three or four hours . I will so arrange it , that these hours shall be from eleven to three o'clock , and what is done must be accomplished between those periods of time . You shall , therefore , not enter number seventeen until after eleven o'clock , and you must positively leave it before three ; and you shall not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Waltons have left the city . Do you consent to these terms ? " " I suppose I must . " " Then the matter is settled . Remember the hours ; I shall know if my injunctions are disregarded , and you will fare the worse for it . " " Fear not . Come to reflect , I like your plan better than my own , as there is less danger in it every way . " " Enough . Good night . " " Hold a moment . Is there any fastening on the door between the rooms , on the side in number seventeen ? " " There is ; but I will take care of that ; and you know no one , unless well acquainted with the spot , could tell there was a door there . " " True , true -- I had forgotten that fact . " " Oh , I forgot one prohibition . You must in no case let a ray of light into seventeen . It might render all our precautions abortive , and defeat their object . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do so , and all will be well . Of course , no noise , even as loud as a whisper , must be heard in the lady 's room . " " I will be discreet ; trust me for that . I am glad you have come to the rescue ; I find there is nothing like a woman 's wit . " " Take care , then , that you are never outwitted by them ! " " Not much fear of that while I have such an ingenious ally ! " " Take good care to keep her an ally ; as an enemy , she might be equally ingenious . " And so they parted . As she left the room , she mentally exclaimed : " ' Come to the rescue ! ' Yes , I am truly glad I have ! " The guests retired to their beds , and all was still as the solemn silence of midnight . The old clock in the corner tolled the hour of eleven , and half an hour afterward , a stealthy tread might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon a door slowly opened on its rusty hinges , and in the rayless darkness Durant entered the number containing his victim . He reached the couch , and paused to assure himself that all was as he desired . His ear was saluted with a heavy breathing , as of one in deep sleep . " All right ! " he muttered within himself . " My hour has come . The vengeance of the ' dog ' shall be complete ! Oh , but how I will glory in my triumph , and the proud one 's disgrace ! I 'll make her feel what it is to insult a nobleman by blood ! Gods , how the memory burns my brain of that indignity ! An unknown girl to scorn and cast contumely upon one of England 's line of lords ! This night be the stain wiped out ! " Lost ! lost ! lost ! demon ! from thy presence we turn away ! Villain and victim , there is a God above ! * * * * * The morning dawned , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , needing the darkness to cover them , had been perpetrated on the earth . The Waltons left with the company they expected to join at Pittsburg on the succeeding day , not knowing that Durant had slept under the same roof with them . No , not so fast . One of their number did know the fact -- Ellen . Was it that knowledge that caused the paleness on her cheek , that aroused the anxious solicitude of her tender and watchful parents ? " Are you sick , my daughter ? " was the mother 's affectionate inquiry . But she was cheered by the assurance that there was no serious cause of alarm ; and that Ellen was only a little unwell . Without any mishap , they reached their new home in Kentucky . Two weeks had passed , and Eliza Fleming was still unmarried . During that time , she had seen Durant but twice , and he appeared desirous of avoiding a private interview . She was not slow to perceive this , and it filled her mind with misgivings of his truth , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand was acceded to ; and she said : " Why do you not make arrangements for our approaching marriage ? It is surely time you were about it . " " Oh , no hurry yet , " he replied . " There is plenty of time . " " Plenty of time ! Yes , if all that need be done , is to call the minister , and have the ceremony performed ! But it strikes me this is not all . However , what day have you fixed upon as your choice for the wedding occasion ? " " I ca n't say as I have thought upon any day in particular ; in fact , the subject had so far escaped my mind , that I had nearly forgotten it entirely . " " A devoted lover , truly ! What am I to think of such unmerited coldness ? " and she burst into tears . " Come , Eliza , let us understand each other , and be friends . " " Friends ! Is that all ? " " Lovers , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lovers only ; as we have been . " " Am I to understand you as saying you will not fulfill your written promise of making me your lawful wife ? " " You might be farther from the truth . " " Is this the reward of my devotion ? the fruits of my sacrifice ? Oh , God , who shall measure the depths of wickedness of a depraved heart ? Sir , I shall enforce my rights . " " You dare not do it . " " Why not ? " " The very attempt will ruin yourself , and your father 's business by bringing disgrace upon his house . " " I see it , sir ; but what if I still proceed ? " " You can not . " " I can . " " On what plan ? " " On your own written promise . " " You have no such promise . " " Do you deny giving it ? " " I do . " " Then your own hand-writing will condemn you . " " Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I have such a document . " " I know you have not . " " Then I will prove it . " And she went in search of the paper , where she had carefully placed it away . But no paper was to be found ! What could have become of it ? She returned . " Well , let me see your ' document , ' as you term it , " he said , in a taunting manner . " It has been misplaced by some means , but I will find it in time to answer my purpose . " " Perhaps . " " Durant , you know I have such a paper , and what is the use of denying it ? " " Again , I repeat , I know no such thing . " Then after a pause , he continued : " We might as well understand each other at once . " He produced a paper , and went on : " Here , I suppose , is the article you speak of . I see it is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again fall into your hands , I will destroy it . " And holding it in the candle , it was soon reduced to ashes . The outwitted girl sat dumb with astonishment , surprise and dismay , and , for several seconds , was speechless . When utterance came , she inquired : " How , in the name of reason , did you get that paper in your possession ? " " I will be frank : I watched you putting it away , and the next day I went and took it . " " And this is my reward for the signal service you demanded as the price of that written promise ? " " My continued love will be your reward . " " Your love ! Think you , vile miscreant , I would have the base semblance of affection from such a polluted thing as you ? No , sir ! Now that I see your depravity , worlds would not tempt me to wed you , degraded as I am ! How I have remained blinded so long is a mystery I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

From the presence of Miss Fleming , Durant went to an obscure old cabin near the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his , by the name of Ramsey , whom he often employed to do hazardous and dirty work , he himself was too cowardly or too aristocratic to perform . The object of the present interview was to learn on what boat the Waltons had taken passage . He was scheming again . " Ramsey , " said he , " what boats have left in the last two weeks to go down the river ? " " Only three , sir . " " Three ! Did you see them all ? " " I did . " " Did you know any of the passengers ? " " I did . Colonel Thomas Marshall commanded one of the boats , with whom there were a number of Virginians , several of them personally known to me . " " Was there a family by the name of Walton among them ? " " Walton -- Walton ? I do n't know them . " " A father , mother and daughter ; the girl eighteen , and uncommonly good looking -- present a much richer appearance than is usual with emigrants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat . " " Do you think they have reached Maysville yet ? " " If unusually lucky , they have ; but most probably not . " " Then there is a possibility of their being overtaken , you think ? " " There may be ; particularly if any bad luck has attended them . " " Quick , then , quick ! away !  - -  Have the boat decoyed to the shore , and captured by the Indians ! You understand , captured : the girl must on no account be killed . " " You do n't mean that I shall start out to-night in this storm and darkness ? " " Yes , and without a moment 's delay . Set the red dogs on the scent -- capture the girl , and you shall be rewarded on your own terms . Go , or it will be too late ! " With some hesitation Ramsey obeyed , and when once in for the business , pushed it forward with all the energy he could master . This fellow was on friendly terms with the Indians , a band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would follow his orders , or do his bidding . With a dispatch that would have done credit to the swiftest courier in the days of chivalry , he pushed forward through the wilderness to the usual place of rendezvous of this band , hoping to find and enlist them in the enterprise on hand ; but they were absent on some expedition of their own . Not to be discouraged by one disappointment , Ramsey paused only long enough to determine that his expected coadjutors were not to be found in or about their usual lurking place , then continued his course down the Ohio with unabated ardor , and on the second day came in sight of a boat just at dusk of the evening . A momentary scrutiny convinced him that it was the one he was in pursuit of , and he concluded it must have been delayed by some misfortune , as he did not expect to come up to it so soon , if at all . However this might be , one thing was certain , the boat was there , and more still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they felt secure and free from any dread of danger . So much the better for his purpose , thought the villain . Driving on through the forest , at a speed far exceeding the slow motions of the boat , he resolved to collect a body of savages , and intercept the prize . Fortune seemed to favor him ; for on the next day he fell in with a large force of warriors , who were " on the war-path , " and ready for any work that gave promise of blood , booty , or scalps . They were easily induced to further the designs of Ramsey , of whose character they were well aware ; and placing themselves under his guidance , he soon posted them along the banks of the river to watch for the coming boat . At dark it was descried , but being too far out to admit of being attacked , the enemy silently withdrew , and hastening forward , took a second position below the first . This was done several times , and , at last , Ramsey had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When within fifty yards of the bank , the Indians , to the number of several hundred , suddenly came down to the edge of the water , and opened a heavy fire upon the crew . The boat was commanded by Captain James Ward -- was a crazy old thing , with only a single pine board for a bulwark . The captain was at one oar , and his nephew , a young man , at the other . Knowing that all depended on reaching the middle of the stream , the captain used his best exertions to force the vessel out ; but his nephew let go his oar , and took up his gun to fire . As he did so , he was pierced through with a ball , and fell , mortally wounded . His oar dropped into the river ; and the exertions of the captain only tended to force the boat nearer the shore . Seeing this , the savages gave a yell of triumph , and prepared to take possession of the prize . Ward , however , seized hold of a board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving his own oar to one of the men , and made renewed exertions to gain the current , the enemy , meanwhile , pouring upon the crew an incessant volley of balls , thick as the falling hail of the storm , which soon riddled everything above the plank breastwork , and killed or wounded all the horses on board -- seven in number . During this time most of the crew were too badly frightened to do or be conscious of anything , excepting danger . One large , fat old Dutchman , in particular , was so taken aback , he threw himself down flat , with his face to the deck , hoping thus to escape with his life . Unfortunately for his peace of mind , however , his posterior protuberance was of such enormously aldermanic dimensions , that it projected above the defenses , and became a fine and laughable target for the savage marksmen , who aimed the great majority of their shots thereat . As the bullets tore through the old fellow 's unmentionables , and raking his hide , made it smart , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over ; but it was of no use . In spite of all the efforts he could make , the young mountain would remain in view in its exposed situation , to the great annoyance of its owner , and the equally great merriment of the enemy . In this sad predicament the phlegmatic hero of the flesh mountain lay , piteously bemoaning his fate , and cursing his foes . As the balls would rake the subnascent appendage , making it twinge with the sharp sting , he would cry out : " Oh ! oh , Lort ! haf ' mercy on me and mine ! " But his cries availed nothing ; and so losing all patience , he raised up his head , and , looking at the enemy , called to them : " Oh , now , t'ere ! quit t'at tam nonsense , will you ? " The boat was , finally , saved , with all on board , except the young man and the horses .

In this he failed ; already had it reached its destination , and the Waltons were in their new home . He returned , and reported his ill success to Durant , who was greatly vexed at the issue of his undertaking , but resolved to renew his efforts to obtain possession of Ellen , or in some way work her ruin . CHAPTER V. STILL AT WORK . An evil heart , bent on mischief , is never contented in idleness , but , like the volcanic fires , its passions and thirst for revenge , when not in open eruption , are actively at work in secret and darkness , preparing for new outbursts , bearing death along their path , and leaving devastation , blight and ruin in their wake . This was much the case with Louis Durant , after the failure of his attempt on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had set his heart , and to this end determined to leave no means untried , be they ever so base , which lay within his reach . To proceed openly , however , was not exactly practicable , as by so doing too many eyes would be upon him ; and he was too cowardly to face an open foe on fair ground . So he went to work in secret . After mature deliberation , and the revolving and the re-revolving of the matter in his mind , he concluded to join the Indians , and through their aid accomplish the consummation of his designs . In carrying out this plan , he was very materially aided by his old accomplice in crime , Ramsey , whose familiarity with the red men gave him at once the facilities for introducing his friend to their notice , which he did with a flourish and eulogium . Things went on smoothly enough while Durant was learning the language , customs , manners and habits of his new allies . He had as much as he could do to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believing he was deficient in them , they as often as possible put to the test . In many of these adventures he barely came off with credit whole , a thing he found absolutely necessary to maintain any kind of credit with this singular people , and , for this purpose , he called into action every particle of courage from every crack and crevice of his system , and brought the whole to bear upon one point , the wavering of his own heart , and , with it , the staying of his almost quaking limbs , and ready-to-run-away feet . He had just " quantum sufficit " for this purpose , and none to spare . These achievements occupied about two years in their accomplishment , at the end of which period , Durant , having established himself pretty fairly in the good graces of his red brethren , felt as though the time had arrived for him to put in execution his long intended project ; for , be it known , his desire for vengeance had neither slumbered nor died during the two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . These years , so full of restrained wrath on his part , were years of peace to his intended victim . Ellen Walton , save the fear of Indians , and the usual trials incident to pioneer life , had spent her time in hopeful quiet , full of love 's anticipated bliss in the bright future . Almost had she forgotten Durant and his threats . Pity she should ever be awakened from her blissful dreams to dread reality . Very early in the spring of 1787 , and not quite two years since her father 's settlement in the country , on a very pleasant day , she ventured to walk out a short distance into the forest , which adjoined their dwelling . Becoming interested in her own musings , she sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree , to give free vent and wide range to her thoughts . The reader can , doubtless , imagine as well as we , the rainbow hues of her straying fancy , as it reveled in the rosy bowers of love . " Miss Walton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illustration : " Looking up , she saw a tall , dark man standing before her , his eye bent upon hers with a look that sent the blood to her heart . "  - -  See page 36 . At the sound of her name , Ellen sprung to her feet , with a suppressed scream of fright on her lips . Looking up , she saw a tall , dark man standing before her , his eye bent upon hers with a look that sent the blood to her heart , she hardly knew why ; for certainly the individual before her was a stranger , or one with whom she had had so slight an acquaintance , as to remember nothing concerning him . While her mind was running over all the passing acquaintances she had ever made , and endeavoring among them to put the personage before her , he continued to scan her countenance with a steady gaze , as if to read her thoughts , which divining , he continued : " I perceive you do not remember me , though we have met before . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your looks made a lasting impression on my mind , an impression that time can never efface or obliterate ; and to this impression you are indebted for my present visit -- an unceremonious one , I must confess . " At this point of his discourse Ellen made a movement as if to retrace her steps homeward , seeing which , he went on : " Do not be impatient , fair maiden , or in haste to go , for I have that to tell thee which is of the utmost importance both to thy present and future welfare . " This adoption of the familiar and solemn style of address , had the effect rather to increase than diminish the tremors about the girl 's heart ; yet she silently awaited his words : " I am come to warn thee that great , very great and imminent danger is hanging , impended but by a thread , over thy head . " This blunt and unexpected announcement caused Ellen to start with a shudder , and sent the blood still more forcibly upon her heart , which labored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat so loud she was afraid the stranger would hear it . Noticing the effect of his words , he continued : " Thou hast an enemy , a bitter enemy , who has sworn to do thee an evil , and it is in his heart to keep the oath . I see by the pallor of thy countenance thou hast not forgotten him . " And true it was that the mention of " an enemy " called up her old foe to the most vivid recollection of the now thoroughly alarmed Ellen . With the utmost exertion of her strength and will , she could barely suppress the outward manifestations of her terror . " Well , this enemy , whom you had well-nigh forgotten , has never , for a single day , had thee out of his mind . Ever since his threat , he has been laying deep schemes to ruin thee , and once very nearly succeeded . For two years he has been at work in a new way ; his plans are about matured , and you will soon be in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emphasized on every word . All the time he was speaking , Ellen 's feelings became more and more intensely excited , and , at the close , had reached the limit of control . For a moment she was overcome , and leaned against a tree for support ; but seeing the stranger make a motion as though to assist her , she rallied again , and , becoming more composed , demanded : " How know you these things of which you speak ? " " It matters but little to thee , to know more than the facts in the case ; these I tell thee , but no more . " " Then you have come as a kind friend to warn me of my danger ? " " Aye , and more . " " Thanks ! thanks ! and pardon me if , at the first , I looked with suspicion on a friend . The circumstances of our meeting is my apology for the ungenerous thought . " " Thou hadst cause to suspect , if not to fear me , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my mission is not yet completed . " " Then let us go to the house of my father , which is but a short way off , and there hear what further is to be said . " " No , I have but little time , and this place will answer my purpose quite as well as your father 's house , with the situation of which I am well acquainted . " " Indeed ! Then you are not a stranger in these parts ? " " Not entirely so ; but as my business was with you , more particularly , it was natural that I should familiarize myself with your place of abode , that , if need be , I might render myself efficient in a case of emergency , which may arrive but too soon . " This allusion to danger re-awakened Ellen 's apprehensions , which noticing , he continued : " I have told you of overhanging peril ; yet I have told you but half . You are unable to escape from the net that is woven around you -- you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unseen toils that have been secretly laid to ensnare you . Every step you take is one of danger , and every effort you make to flee from that danger , may but drive you nearer to destruction . Such is the nature of your enemy 's operations , that while they are secret , they are sure ; and so thoroughly has every preparation been made , and so exact has every minute particular been examined and attended to , there is no possibility of his scheme failing , and equally no possibility for you to escape . " " Your words are words of doom . How am I to interpret your enigmatical conduct ? But now I thought you a friend , come to give me timely warning to guard against threatened danger , when , all at once , you declare my situation a hopeless one ! If you are my friend , why not warn me sooner , and in time ? " This was said in a firm manner , and gave the stranger to understand he had no common , timid nature to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Ellen 's mind that this man was some way connected with Durant , perhaps employed by him , and she began to conclude it might be a trick to frighten her , after all . If so , or if not , she determined to meet boldly what he had to say . The man perceived the change , and replied : " My seemingly enigmatical conduct is easily explained . It is true I have a long time been known to the fact that most determined designs of mischief were entertained against you , and that your enemy was ceaselessly at work to perfect his plans ; but just as I was preparing to come to inform you of this state of affairs , I was so unfortunate as to be desperately wounded in battle with the Indians . I have but just recovered ; the fresh scar you can see on my temple . " And brushing away the hair , he exposed a hardly healed , terrible gash . This appeared to satisfy his listener . " I have , therefore , done the best I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose inexorable decree I almost rebeled against bowing to . But I am here , my warning is given , and I can only regret that it comes so late . " These words and the exhibition of the scar restored Ellen 's confidence in the stranger , and , with it , her fears returned . He perceived this , and proceeded : " Though your case is a desperate one , there is still some hope ; there is a possibility of your deliverance from impending peril . " " Then let me know how I am to act . " " I fear to do so . " " Why fear ? " " It may prove a desperate alternative . " " Nothing can be so dreadful as falling into the hands of my enemy . " " Perhaps not ; still you may be unable to choose between the evils . " " Let me know them , and I will try . " " As I said , it may be a desperate alternative , and I must ask of you beforehand to pardon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what may prove one of two equally direful evils . Your only hope of relief from present evil is in me . " This was an unexpected announcement ; it fairly startled Ellen , and , in the moment of bewilderment , she made no reply . He continued : " Do not consider me selfish -- at least do not condemn me for my selfishness . If you have ever loved , you know what almost omnipotent power that passion has over the mind and heart . For long years I have loved you in secret , with a burning , consuming intensity of feeling , which defies all efforts to describe . I can not tell you all the joy or agony love has awakened in my bosom ; I can only say , that you have it now in your power to render me supremely happy , or abjectly miserable . If you will cast yourself on my love , I will save you from your plotting foe , and devote my life to your service , and to make you happy . If I had any other means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I have not . Just now I have not time to explain all that I would like to make clear , and must ask you , for the present , to take my word ; for at any moment , even now , your malignant foe may come upon us , and then all is lost . Can you accept the alternative ? " " I -- I thank you , but I can not . " " You say , in view of all the facts , this is your unalterable decision , from which I may not hope to persuade you ? " " It is . For all or any kind intentions and wishes you may have had or still entertain for me , please accept my sincere thanks ; but do not attempt to change my purpose , for it is fixed , and I would save us both the pain of repeating it . " " Then farewell , and God protect you ! " " Amen ! " This one word was said in such a fervent , and , at the same time , confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning away ; for a short time he seemed engaged in deep thought , which had the effect of totally changing his former , and apparently predetermined course of action . Turning again to Ellen , who saw his hesitancy of action , he said : " You rely , then , in God ? " " I do , most assuredly . " " And you have a hope that He will deliver you from the sad situation in which you are now placed ? " " I humbly trust He will shield and protect me from harm . " " Perhaps that confidence induces your present course of action ? " " Doubtless it does , in part . " " Well , let me tell you that angels nor devils can save you ! " " I have no wish to be saved by the devils . " " I wonder you can be at all merry in your situation . " " I begin to be less apprehensive than I was . " " Indeed ! and why , pray ? " " To be plain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or very creditable to my penetration , and , therefore , I had rather not make it . " " I see you suspect me , so you may as well know the truth . " Saying which , he threw off some outward disguises , and stood before the astonished maiden -- LOUIS DURANT himself ! " You see me , Ellen Walton , and in me your worst enemy , because you will not permit me to be a friend . I have made the present attempt to win you by stratagem , in the not very sanguine hope of success . I have failed -- now for my revenge . Know that all I have said concerning my plans , and the net I have woven around you , is true . You are now in my power , and I only forbear taking you captive at this time because I wish you to live for a short period in dread and suspense , as you once made me . " " Keep to the truth , sir , in making your statements . " " I intend to ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ! " " I have a very comfortable expectation for the future , thank you . " " Well , cherish it , then ; hug it close , for it will be short lived , I give you fair warning . " " The warnings of a man who comes with the tissue of falsehood , are of little worth . Keep them to yourself . " " Beware how you presume on my forbearance ; it may give way . " " I presume on nothing but your cowardice . " " Enough ! enough ! I will bear no more ! I go , but you will see me soon again ! Your doom is sealed ! ' Cowardice ! ' This from a woman ! Gods ! but I 'll remember this in my revenge ! " He started , as if to leave the place , but turned again , and said . " Girl , I dislike to leave you in this manner . For the love I bear you , I would still see you happy -- happy as a wife and not a despised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my honorable bride ; yes , you might still be . Passing by all your insults , I would still offer you my hand , and honorable marriage . " " Infamous villain ! how dare you insult my self-respect by even naming such a thing ? Never dare again , to couple my name with yours ! never , sir ! It is the basest sacrilege to humanity ! " " Very well . Our names shall not be coupled ; our destinies shall be ! Go , with the consoling thought to cheer you for a few fleeting hours . Here I stand and swear it -- witness my oath , ye trees ! witness it , earth and sky ! and , if such beings there are , witness it , angels and devils -- Ellen Walton shall be mine ! " He was so deeply absorbed in calling on his witnesses , he noticed nothing about him , and now looking to the spot where she stood , to observe the effect of his words , behold , Ellen was not there . His tragic agony had been wasted on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left the place in a rage . Ellen , though she had left , heard his words in the distance , and notwithstanding she had made a show of boldness , she was really alarmed , and greatly dreaded the future . She knew that an evil-minded man , however contemptible , was capable of doing infinite harm to a fellow-being , when determinedly set thereon . Thus , between hope and fear , her time was passed . CHAPTER VI . PLANS FRUSTRATED -- ESPIONAGE . Durant , who considered himself a perfect genius in contriving strategetical measures , now turned all his attention to the execution of the secret plans he had matured . He first accompanied a body of Indians , who were ready to march upon the settlements of Kentucky , with a select few , to whom he had confided his intentions of capturing a white squaw . With these villains he intended to attack the house of the Waltons , while the main body of the savages made their onset upon the bulk of the settlement , including the block-house . This measure failed , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a family by the name of Scraggs suffered in the stead of his intended victim . A Footnote A : " Western Adventure , " page 179-182 . He next resolved to go , with a few of his renegade followers , in a secret manner , and steal Ellen at night , or during some of her daily walks , when alone . Soon after crossing the river , he was taken sick , and his followers , mistaking his directions , went another way , and made a worse blunder than on the first occasion ; and a party of whites coming into the vicinity of his camp , the villain hastened to recross the river to the Ohio side , not yet knowing the fate of the expedition , that portion of the band who had been commissioned with the execution of the plot not having returned when he was forced to retreat . However , he was not long kept in suspense ; one of his men came back , and reported a wonderful adventure with a " big squaw , taller than the greatest warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and when two of the others undertook to get down the chimney , " big squaw took up mighty great wallet , all full of feathers , more than was on all the eagles of all the hunting grounds of the red men , and tearing it open , easy as we tear a leaf , poured them on the fire . Big black smoke puff up quick as powder flash , and down come Indian like he shot . White squaw take up big tomahawk , and strike both on the head . Me nearly in the door by this time ; big squaw jump at me with he great tomahawk , so big the great chief no lift it , and lifted it to strike . Me no like to be killed by old squaw , so me come away . " A very marvelous story told the Indians , full of high flourishes and exaggerations , but founded on truth , nevertheless . B Footnote B : " Western Adventure , " page 187 . Durant saw that some mistake had been made , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boasting , and the care with which he had laid his " hidden toils . " He was greatly exasperated at the failure of his plots , on the success of which he had built such sanguine hopes . After much reflection , and the formation and abandonment of many schemes for the accomplishment of his object , he finally hit upon a plan which he felt sure would succeed . This time he called into requisition the services of his old crony in crime , the infamous , but not untainted , Ramsey . With him and a couple of trusty Indians , he set out on his expedition , resolved to succeed at the risk of his life . Ellen he would possess at all hazards . The party reached a point which was as near the settlement as prudence allowed them to go , and here , in the deep forest , his three companions hid themselves , while he went forward to make observations , and work out the details of the plot and attack . Stealthily approaching the vicinity of the Waltons , he secreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orifice of which , at some distance from the base , he had quite a commanding view of the adjacent country for a considerable distance either way . Here he placed himself to make observations . It was in the early part of autumn ; the weather was mild and pleasant ; the forest had put on its diadem of rich colors , purple , scarlet and yellow , and was gorgeously beautiful in the ripened glory of its drapery . The season , the scene , the sunny warmth all invited to a participation in the enjoyment which nature held out to those who would accept her bounty , and refresh themselves in her sylvan bowers . It was on the second day of his watch , that Durant had the satisfaction of noticing the arrival of a gentleman at the house of Mr. Walton , which was followed on the succeeding day by a circumstance which at once gave him fresh encouragement and sanguine hopes . Ellen made her appearance , leaning on the gentleman 's arm ; they were out enjoying the pleasure of an excursion into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wended their way to his immediate neighborhood . Fortune sometimes favors the wicked , and , in this instance , she smiled on the villain ; for the lovers , fancying the spot , seated themselves on the trunk of a fallen tree , that lay close to the one in which he had ensconced himself , and by placing his ear near the orifice , he could distinctly hear what passed between them . " It is so refreshing to sit in the shade of the ' gray old forest , ' " said Ellen . " I have not enjoyed such a treat these many months . " " Why , with your facilities , I should think you would recreate every day in pleasant weather . " " That was my habit formerly ; but the last time I ventured out alone , I met with an unexpected streak of ill luck , which has deterred me ever since from laying myself liable to a repetition of the same bad fortune . " " Indeed ! You have not informed me of this before . " " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied my mind ; and , after all , it is hardly worth relating , though it made me feel very unpleasant for a time . " " I must know of this adventure . " " It was only the unlooked-for appearance of my old and sworn enemy , Durant , who made another attempt to deceive me ; but failing in his designs , finally renewed his threats of revenge . " She then , at her lover 's request , narrated the incidents of her interview with Durant , as already known to the reader . " Strange that the villain should form such an unaccountable dislike for you , when you never injured him in the least . " " I think his bad nature was excited , and his ill-will increased , by a few words of merited rebuke I was forced , by his unmanliness , to pronounce against him , the last time he was at our house in Virginia . " " And you have heard nothing from him since the day he obtruded himself upon your notice here in the woods ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made an attempt to capture me , with the aid of some Indians , soon afterward , but failed in his object from some cause . But notwithstanding I have heard no direct tidings from him , I feel a constant dread of evil , as though some impending calamity was hanging over me . " " Such fears had better be banished at once from your mind . " " I know it , and have tried to get rid of them , but they will , despite my efforts to the contrary , come into my mind . I do not and will not yield to them , though I find it impossible at all times to shake them off . " " Singular , truly ; I pray God , they presage no harm . " " Oh , I so much wish you could always be near me ; I dread nothing in your presence . " " I hope the time is not far distant when this dearest wish of both our hearts will be realized . " The conversation took a tender cast at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets between lovers , which they dislike for third parties to look into , we will take ourselves away , and leave them to enjoy their hour of happiness in undisturbed quiet . Several days brought a return of much the same routine of events , the lovers always spending an hour of each afternoon in the woods . Durant kept to his tree , and the others invariably occupied the same seat near his hiding-place . At the end of a week , Durant learned from the conversation of the young couple that the gentleman was to return to Virginia in a day or two , to make preparations for the coming wedding , which was to take place about the holidays , he being now on a visit to arrange the preliminaries , and enjoy for a brief time the society of his betrothed . When they had returned home , Durant muttered to himself : " Now is my time ! To-morrow is their last day for walking , and , like loving fools as they are , they will be so absorbed in each others ' feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easily surprised . Yes , to-morrow will be my time ! " And gloating over the anticipated triumph , he left his burrow , and hastened to his companions , to make known his intentions , and prepare everything for the event of the morrow . He and one Indian were to seize and secure Ellen , while Ramsey and the other should perform the more difficult task of capturing her lover . All the details of their arrangements were discussed and adopted ; and Durant , now that he felt certain of his victims -- for his hate of Ellen 's lover was bitter , though of recent date -- was almost beside himself with malignant and hellish joy . He saw before him the speedy accomplishment of his fiendish purpose -- the gratification of his inveterate hate and long sought revenge , by the commission of the most damnable act known this side of the " bottomless pit " of darkness ; and his sin-polluted heart actually swelled with venomous delight , and demoniac exultation . One of the fairest flowers of earth is to be plucked by his rude hand , and soiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his satanic designs ? CHAPTER VII . THE LOVERS Ellen Walton , ere she left the home of her childhood for the scenes of border life , was the affianced bride of Walter Hamilton , a young man of most promising talent , irreproachable character , and fine looking withal ; and , in a word , was worthy of the high favor he found in the eyes and the heart of his beloved . As gathered from the narrations of the last chapter , he was now on a visit to the wilderness home of his betrothed , to arrange for the nuptials , which were to be solemnized on Christmas Eve , the winter season being deemed most safe from the predatory excursions of the Indians . All these particulars their bitter adversary was familiar with ; and he so exulted over the sad termination of their plans , he could scarcely command his feelings , or act with becoming sanity . Without further ado , we will introduce the lovers at their last interview in the forest , previous to Hamilton 's return home . The same spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely on into the jaws of destruction , and opened the way of triumph for the plotting villain . " And this is the last time we shall enjoy together the sweet solitude of this sylvan temple of love ? " said Hamilton , after they had been conversing for some time on the hopes before them . " Oh , I pray it may not be the last time ! What fatal words ! " replied the fair Ellen , as a momentary pallor overspread her beautiful face . " You know , love I only meant for this visit . Of course , I hope to enjoy the same felicity many times when we shall mutually sustain to each other those dearest of all relations ; after that our hopes shall have been fully consummated . " " I know you did not intend to say the last time for life ; but the word last struck with a chill to my heart , and called up old dreads , which , unbidden , sent a thrill of fear through my spirit . I could not avoid the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would to heaven the unwelcome thought were banished from my mind , never again to return . " " Well , love , just banish it . You are certainly in no personal danger ; and there is hardly a possibility , let alone a probability , protected as I shall be , of my encountering serious danger on my way home . " " I know all you say ; I can see no cause of fear ; no reason to apprehend danger ; yet I do feel alarmed ; but it is a vague , undefined sensation , which I hope reason will soon banish from my mind . I am not now , and never have been , a believer in presentiments , and I do not intend to become a convert to the notion to-day . " " I am glad to hear you speak in that manner . There are but few things in the compass of possibility that may not be achieved , if we bring a resolute will to bear upon them . The belief in presentiments , signs of good and bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small degree , to ' make slaves of us all , ' and to detract very much from the happiness we might otherwise enjoy . I have known persons who were perfect slaves to such things , having their evil omens and good omens , their bad days and good days , their moon signs , their owl signs , their cat and dog signs , and I know not what all other kinds of signs , all of which were regarded with the reverence due only to sacred things . I must confess I have often been disgusted at the tomfoolery of some of these ' signs ' people . " " Really , I hope you do not intend to be personal in your remarks ? " " My usual reply to such inquiries is , ' if the shoe fits , wear it ; ' but you know , love , I had no intention of alluding to you in what I said ; at least , if you did not know it , I tell you so now . " " Very well ; your amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispel , in a good degree , my forebodings of evil , whatever may have given rise to them . I presume , if the sign is really reliable , I may now conclude that the danger , if any was near me , has passed away . " " One would naturally suppose that the more imminent the danger , the heavier would be the pressure on the spirits . " " And who knows but some unseen calamity was near us -- a serpent , for instance , whose deadly fangs might have proved fatal , or some other unknown or invisible foe , with power to work us evil ? " " Without entering the field of speculation , we will just suppose your snakeship has departed , and , as your spirits have recovered their wonted elasticity , let us talk of more pleasing and interesting matters . " " With all my heart . " And had the serpent , Durant , really withdrawn himself ? Had some long buried cord of human sympathy at last been touched in his heart , and the slumbering emotions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can . The lovers continued to converse of their hopes for the future , and regrets for the immediate separation ; and their attention became so fixed in each other , that it would have required some extraordinary occurrence or sound to arouse them . In reply to a remark of his companion , Hamilton said : " Yes , but four months , and our probation will be ended . Would that they would speed away as rapidly as the past week . Four months , and then shall our happiness be --  " The sentence was never finished . At that precise moment rude hands grasped each lover . A smothered cry arose to Ellen 's lips , but was hushed by a covering which was placed and fastened over her mouth . They were both secured with thongs , and led away into captivity . As Ellen was being secured , the miscreant captor hissed in her ear : " Be of good cheer , you are in the hands of Durant , the ' DOG ! ' who distinctly remembers your former kindness and amiability ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , Durant hurried off toward the Ohio , determined as soon as it could be done , to place that river between himself and captives and any pursuers that might follow them , when it became known that the lovers were missing . It was a matter of wonder with Ellen 's family what could keep her and Hamilton out so late in the evening ; and when darkness set in , and they were still absent , the wonder changed to alarm . Search was instantly made ; they were traced to their resting-place ; the evident marks of a scuffle were visible ; and the unanimous opinion of all was that they were in the hands of Indians . Preparations for pursuit were immediately instituted , and by daylight next morning , a strong band of armed pioneers , well mounted , were on the trail of the fugitives , determined to retake the captives , if such a feat were in the bounds of possibility . Durant had everything so arranged , that his party need not be subjected to a moment 's delay . Every member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous pursuit , and the lovers were not without hope that it would prove successful . In this hope , they , as far as circumstances and ability permitted , endeavored to retard the progress of the captors by slow movements ; and Durant was finally constrained to threaten them , if they did not step with greater alacrity ; for he feared they might be overtaken . At length the hilly banks of the Ohio were reached ; the clear waters of that noble stream lay before them ; and between the prisoners and despair , and no friends in sight to bid them hope ! Durant now concluded all was safe ; and the malice of his heart , which the pressure of circumstances had kept smothered , began again to display itself . Pointing to the verdure-clad and tree-crowned hills on the other side of the river , he said : " Once there , amid the lovely groves of Ohio , and you are beyond the last hope of recovery from my power , my beautiful girl ! Then and there I shall have the exquisite pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . For the present , receive my assurances , that nothing else could give me such unbounded satisfaction as the felicity unspeakable of having won my old and dear love from all competitors for her hand and person , and the certain assurance , that , for the time to come , she is all my own , without fear of rivalship ! " The bitter irony attempted in this malignantly polite address went to the heart of the fair girl ; but she resolutely set herself against any display of fear , or the least manifestation of alarm , well knowing that the marks of such emotions would but increase the revengeful feeling of delight evinced by her adversary . Just as Durant concluded his speech , the tramp of horses ' feet was heard in the distance , and the cry raised by the Indians : " White man come ! white man come ! " All hands sprung to unmoor the canoes , which were in readiness , concealed among the drooping branches of some trees which overhung the margin of the stream . While thus engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Indian who guarded him , sent Durant whirling round like a top to the distance of ten or twelve feet , seized Ellen in his arms , and with strength almost superhuman , and a speed miraculous under the circumstances , bounded away in the direction of the approaching horsemen , who were now visible through the interstices of the forest , a good way off , but coming rapidly on to the rescue , though , as yet , in ignorance of their near proximity to friends and foes . " Seize them ! seize them !  - -  shoot the infernal dog ! " roared Durant , in a hoarse voice of passion and rage , so soon as he recovered from the astonishment and fright into which the unceremonious assault of Hamilton had thrown him . Illustration : " Hamilton knocked down the Indian who guarded him , sent Durant whirling round like a top to the distance of ten or twelve feet . "  - -  See page 54 . His first command was not obeyed , for Hamilton and Ellen were already beyond reach when the order was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two guns without effect , and the leveling of a third by Ramsey , with a coolness and steadiness of nerve and aim which gave assurance of success . His finger was on the trigger , when Durant himself threw up the muzzle of the rifle , and sent the ball whizzing through the air , some ten feet above the heads of the fugitives . " My revenge must be fuller than that , or not at all , " he said . " The ball would have killed both , and I would not have had that for the world . " He had hardly uttered these words , when the sharp crack of the remaining Indian 's rifle , who had recovered from the blow given him by Hamilton , and was glad of the opportunity of so speedily avenging it , rung in his ear with piercing shrillness , and looking in the direction of the flying couple , Durant saw Hamilton stagger with his burden , and then both fell to the earth . Instantly the demon was roused within him ; every emotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burning thirst for revenge which rankled in his bosom ; and crying " Come ! " he rushed to the spot where the lovers lay , followed by his comrade . Both were wounded , but neither was dead . Lifting the bleeding Ellen in his arms , he bore her back , while Ramsey and an Indian did the same by Hamilton . Springing into their canoes , and bending to the oars with all the strength they could muster , they were soon far out into the stream , and had just reached a point of safety , when the pursuing party of whites came up to the water 's brink . Several shots were fired at the canoes without effect , and then the men tried to force their horses into the river ; but by yelling and splashing the water with their oars by the enemy , the beasts were effectually frightened , so that no efforts of their riders could induce them to attempt the unwilling task of swimming across . Durant could perceive the agony of the father and brother of Ellen , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to urge forward their stubborn steeds . Feeling perfectly secure , now that the pursuers were effectually baffled in their designs , he gave orders to cease the frightening demonstrations , and continue their course . In a few minutes the Ohio shore was gained , and they soon buried themselves in the deep woods beyond and were lost to the sight of those on the opposite bank , who reluctantly turned their faces homeward , and , in deep and mournful silence , retraced their steps , revolving in their minds what next could be done . Hamilton and Ellen were both severely wounded , the ball having passed through the right side of each , but no vital part seemed to have suffered , and the wounds were not deemed mortal of themselves , but might prove fatal if not properly attended to . Durant 's first care was to have them dressed and bound up ; and he used every means within his reach to expedite their recovery . He had them taken to a place of safety , a kind of cove , known to himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they were carefully nursed until in a fair way for speedy recovery . Until now , Durant had been careful to say and do nothing that might tend to excite the minds of his captives , fearing that inflamation might ensue , and rob him of his anticipated triumph and revenge . But so soon as their convalescence was distinctly manifest , the crisis and the danger past , he began to torment his victims ; the one of his wounded vanity , his disappointed avarice , and his venomous hate ; the other of his envy and jealous malice . In consummating his revenge upon Ellen , he would not only gratify his malicious and vengeful nature , but minister , also , to the basest passions of a corrupt human heart . Seating himself in her presence one day , he said : " I now understand why it was that I found no more favor in your sight while so foolishly attempting to win your love . Your heart was already occupied , a circumstance you took good care to conceal . Thank my stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , my dear , that he is a doomed man ? If not , permit me to inform you of the fact . " " Sir , what has he ever done to you that you should wish to harm him ? " " Done ! Has he not robbed me of your love , your hand , and made my life a hopeless desert and a weary waste ? " " No , sir , he has not . My heart was his before I saw you , and you , sir , attempted the part of a robber , not Mr. Hamilton . Now judge yourself by your own rule and what fate should be yours ? " " Ah , very fine logic , truly ; but , unfortunately , you have not the power to back it up . I presume you have never beheld the sacrifice of a victim on a funeral pile , nor more than read of prisoners burned at the stake ; how would such a spectacle affect you , think ? " This was said with a peculiar expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whatever its real effect upon the mind of his auditor , no visible tokens of dread or pain were manifested , and Ellen replied : " I do not know , so much would depend on circumstances ; but that I would abhor the actors in the scene of barbarous cruelty , I can well imagine . " This was not the kind of a reply expected , and Durant changed his discourse from an insinuating tone to a direct manner . " I perceive it will be necessary for me to render my meaning more explicit , and I now change the form of my query , and beg to know how you would probably feel , were you compelled to witness the burning of your lover at the stake ? " A momentary paleness blanched the cheek of the fair girl , as this heartless interrogation was fully comprehended , but recovering herself quickly from the rude shock , she replied : " I doubt not the sight would be a harrowing one , but I do not anticipate such an unlikely event . " " Pardon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this fate is in store for you . " " Why do you persist in this attempt at refinement of cruelty ? Bad as you are , I give you credit for too much humanity to believe your words are more than an idle threat , which you have no intention of putting into execution . " " Then you have given me credit for more humanity than is justly my due ; for I never was more earnest in my life , and it is my fixed determination to do exactly what I have intimated . " Ellen , who had all the time been really alarmed , now gave way , in her reduced strength of body , to the feelings which , until now , she had kept in subjection ; and , changing her tone , commenced pleading with the miscreant : " Mr. Hamilton has never harmed you , and can , therefore , only be hated by you through me ; do not , then , make him the object of your wrath , but let it fall on me . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This last remark , as it showed the depths and tenderness of her love for his rival , only excited him the more , and he repeated his intention of burning Hamilton at the stake in her presence , with many additions , purposely introduced to make a more horrifying impression . In vain she pleaded for her lover , and offered herself as the sacrifice ; the only effect of her prayers was to render him more savage and determined in his intentions and avowals . The excitement of the interview , however , in her case , superinduced a state of fever , which bid fair , for a few days , to render her recovery very doubtful . This result was not expected by Durant , and he in turn became alarmed , lest his dearly bought vengeance should yet slip from him . Every exertion was put forth for her restoration , and finally success crowned the well directed but ill intentioned efforts of the villain . Ellen 's fever abated , and she again began to mend . It would be some time , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the interim , he set his wits to work with a little different object in view . A new thought had entered his mind , the ultimate end of which he would endeavor to carry out . He had never fallen in love with savage life , because it was one of too much peril to suit his natural disposition to cowardice , and he would gladly return to civilized life , if he could do so safely -- his Indian home and habits having only been adopted as a means , and the only means , of ministering to his revengeful desires . His idea looked to the accomplishment of this object , and he was fain to believe he saw a way to succeed . As Ellen was to act a part in his newly formed plan , his manner toward her changed . He was polite and respectful in his words and attentions . He was , also , very kind and considerate toward Hamilton . They were both surprised at this unexpected change in the demeanor of their captor , but were unable to account for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen was much restored , he ventured on the following communication : " I have , " he said to her , " had very serious thoughts of late . A singular dream , which made a powerful impression on my mind , opened up to my mental vision the sinfulness of my past life , and convinced me of the necessity of repentance and reformation . I would gladly amend my ways , and lead a new and better life , but my way is hedged up before me . I am an outcast of society , made so by my own acts , the dark enormity of which I now behold with astonishment , and , unless some great influence is brought to bear in my favor , I dare not return to a Christian community , and if I remain here among the heathens , I may give up all hope at once , as it will be impossible for me , as one of the savages , to become a moral and Christian man . It is in your power , fair lady , to give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will extend to me the hand of salvation ? " Ellen hardly knew whether to believe in the man 's sincerity or not ; but hoping for the best , she replied : " If in your good intentions I can aid you in any way , I shall be most happy to do so . " " Thank you ; I expected as much from your generous heart , though I have merited nothing but hatred from you by my acts . I will consult Mr. Hamilton on the subject , before pointing out more definitely the mode in which you can serve and save me . " Leaving her presence , he placed himself before Hamilton , whom he addressed after this manner : " I am aware , my good sir , that you are on somewhat intimate terms with Miss Walton , the lady in another apartment of this rather dismal abode , and , I doubt not , have much influence over her . If so , I very much desire the benefit of that influence , to aid me in the best and noblest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions and desires of reformation , and the impediments in the way , much in the same manner as he had done to Ellen ; after which he continued : " Now , to relieve me from my embarrassing situation , I deem it needful to form a connection with some influential person or family , whose recommendation and protection will secure me from harm , and restore me to the bosom of that society from whose enjoyments and privileges I severed myself by a rash act , committed in an hour of passion , and followed up by a strange course of infatuation ever since . I know of none upon whose names and aid I would sooner cast myself than upon you and Miss Walton , as your families are of the first respectability , and could throw an effectual shield around me . I would , therefore , that you let me bear to the young lady the assurances that you approve my plans and purposes , ( if you really do so , ) and that you are willing to aid me yourself , and hope she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still confined by his wound , which had been a much more serious one than that inflicted upon Ellen ; and in his then state of prostration , was not as well prepared to scorn the motives of Durant , or penetrate his designs , as he might have been under more favorable auspices ; and having no reason to doubt the sincerity of the seemingly repentant man , he entered into his plans at once , with all the warmth of a benevolent and Christian heart . He said : " I can hardly believe it necessary that I should say a word to Miss Walton , to induce her to put forth her best endeavors to serve you in so worthy a work ; but , if need be , bear to her the assurance of my hearty approval of your designs and wishes , and that I shall do all in my power to aid you in the laudable efforts you are making to return to a Christian country , and a virtuous life . " " As I have , very unfortunately , laid myself liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place your approval on this slip of paper ? " Saying which , he handed him the paper and a pencil . He wrote as follows : " MISS WALTON :  - -  The bearer , Mr. Durant , has laid before me his intentions and wishes , and the difficulties in the way of his reformation . I most heartily approve his plans , as they seem to be the most judicious that now occur to me , and hope you will assist him to the utmost of your ability in his very worthy object . " HAMILTON . " As Durant run his eye over the lines , a peculiar expression of satisfaction crossed his features , and with the warmest thanks on his lips , he departed , and lost no time in again presenting himself before Ellen , whom he thus addressed : " I have just laid my case before Mr. Hamilton , whose opinion on the subject you will find here expressed in his own hand-writing . " And he gave her the slip . She read the lines traced upon it , when he proceeded : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily approve and as heartily enter into my plans , all disquiet in my heart would at once be set at rest . " " I am quite sure I shall object to nothing Mr. Hamilton approves ; and in all good endeavors , I shall be most happy to render you all the assistance I can command or bestow . " " Then I need entertain no further apprehensions , and will at once make known to you the details which seem to me necessary to be carried out . There are very few persons in the settlements who have any knowledge of my connection with the Indians , and my first request is that you never , under any circumstances , allude to this connection , or let it be known that I have been here . Have I your promise ? " " Most certainly . " " I desire , in the second place , that you will say as much good of me as you can , ( and that , I am sorry to say , will be but little , ) to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have nothing good to say , then that you will say no evil , and especially if my Indian life is alluded to . May I hope for your favor in this respect ? " " I will do my best to exonerate you in all cases where your reputation is at stake , and to aid you in reaching a place of honor in society . " " Thank you . I have but one additional solicitation to make , and if to this you can give your assent , I shall be truly happy , delighted , and confident . " All this time he had been driving at one point , which he had now reached , but was slow to present . A momentary pause ensued ; Ellen was in doubt as to the nature of the requirement , and he of the propriety of making it . But he had set his all upon the desperate stake for which he was playing , and it would not now do to leave the game . He at length went on : " I shall not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some family of note and respectability . I am not as extensively acquainted as some others -- in a word , I know of no young lady but yourself to whom I can offer my hand , and having loved you so long and ardently , I can do nothing less than make this as my final request , that you consent to become my wife . I make this request the only condition of release , and upon your acceptance of my hand depends my present and future hope , my salvation in time and eternity . My fate is in your hands , and you can raise me to heaven , or cast me down to hell . Will you save me ? " It would be quite impossible to depict the consternation this announcement created in the mind of Ellen . In spite of her better judgment , and the precedents in the villain 's former life , she had suffered herself to be beguiled by his seeming sincerity of manner into the hope that he was really desirous of reforming ; and even now she could hardly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as the whole truth shone out to her comprehension , she saw through his scheme at once -- that all his seeming repentance was a pretense as hollow as his own heart . The hope that had begun to swell in her heart was blotted out in a moment . She replied without hesitation : " I can not accede to your last proposition . " " Why not ? " " It is impossible . " " Then you willingly consign me to wretchedness in this life , and to perdition hereafter . " " I do no such thing . You are not responsible for my acts ; and your repentance can be just as sincere without a wife as with one . " " You are mistaken . If I am doomed to remain among the Indians , I shall never be able to reform , however earnestly I may desire to do so ; and if I go to the settlements , I shall be slain as a foe , unless protected by family ties and influence ; these I can secure in no other way than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely different opinion ; and I think your whole scheme a very thin and flimsy contrivance , of which you ought to be ashamed . " " But there are two against you . Mr. Hamilton , as you have already seen , perfectly coincides with me in his views , and --  " " I beg leave to correct you . Mr. Hamilton never consented to your last proposition , for the very good reason that it was never mentioned to him ; in this respect you have tried to deceive me ; but to put the matter to rest , at once and forever , let me say , as mistress of my own decisions , that whether he should consent to your proposition or not , I never will ! " " Then , as you voluntarily cast me off , and consign me to infamy and hopeless wretchedness , be the consequences upon your own head . I came to you and implored assistance in my extremity , but you turned away , and left me in despair . Do not , therefore , accuse me of cruelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a free gift . You know that I have the power of life and death over yourself and Hamilton , and I now ask you , as a last resort , to choose between assenting to become my wife and seeing your lover at the stake ! You may well start and turn pale ; for as sure as there is a sky above and the earth beneath us , I swear that one or the other fate shall be yours . Make your own election , and , in doing so , bear in mind that Hamilton 's death will be gratuitous , if caused , for you shall then be worse than my wife . As a lawful companion , I will use my best endeavors to make you happy ; as a companion in what the world calls guilt , I will bind myself by no such promise . Think of all these things , and then decide . " " Louis Durant , the very proposition you make , accompanied as it is by the alternative , is one of such black enormity , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would spurn your offer as I would the proffered hand of Satan himself or of the vilest imp in the loathsome pit of night where he reigns ! You have your answer . As well try to pluck the sun from his place in the heavens or wrench the sparkling stars from the firmament as to alter my resolve . " " Perhaps you will think differently when the trying hour comes , perhaps repent when it is too late . " " Never , sir villain ! Do you suppose I can not penetrate the thin gauze that is intended to hide your motives ? Your highest aspiration is after the Wealth you imagine me to possess ; if I were poor , you would not even offer me your hand , let alone make such efforts to obtain it . I see through all your devices , base miscreant , including your sham repentance , which deserves the descent of God 's just indignation upon your guilty head , and polluted soul ! " " Your perceptions are exceedingly acute , I must confess ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject , so vital to us all , and hope that reason may yet prevail . " Much after the same manner he continued to persecute her , day after day , and with no better success . In the meantime Hamilton had so far recovered as to be able to walk about . To him Durant appealed ; but his offer of freedom , on condition of using his influence to induce Ellen to consent to become his captor 's wife , was rejected with the contempt and scorn it merited , and a brave man could give it . This was the last peg upon which the villain hung a hope of working out his purpose , and he now resolved to fall back on his first intention , and execute his long threatened vengeance . The stake was prepared after the most approved Indian model , and the fagots piled high around it . The two victims were then led out to see what awaited them ; and this excess of cruelty , this torture in advance , was forced upon the lovers with a view to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ; but with the same result as before ; they were pale with hopeless despair , but firm and unwavering in purpose . " I would die a thousand deaths of torture , my beloved Ellen , rather than persuade you to sacrifice yourself to save me , " was Hamilton 's language to his companion in distress . " Life without you would be a burden ; and I can now die with a pleasing hope of reunion beyond the grave . " Durant would not permit a continuation of such interchange of thoughts , and they were separated . On the following day Hamilton was fastened to the stake , and an Indian stood ready with a torch to fire the combustibles so soon as the word of command was given . " Behold the fate of him you pretend to love ! " said Durant to Ellen , whom he had dragged to the spot . " His destiny is yet in the balances ; say but the word , and he shall go free ! " Pale as death itself , and scarcely able to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ! I am prepared for the worst ! " " The worst ? " and he hissed in her ear some words of infamy . " Oh , God ! not that ! not that ! " and she reeled as if struck with a blow . " Then , in the name of reason , save yourself , save both ! It is easily done . " The villain 's words calmed her in a moment , and she responded : " Either fate is more than I can bear ; but I will not perjure my soul to save myself from any fate it pleases God to send upon me . " " And you will not be an honorable bride , then ? " " Yours ,  - -  never ! " " Fire the fagots ! " he commanded in a voice of rage , and the order was instantly obeyed by the Indian who stood impatiently awaiting the word . CHAPTER IX . THE BURNING STAKE The material around the stake was the most highly inflammable that could be collected , and a mighty blaze soon spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in air , and its forked tongues hissing like serpents ! Snapping , crackling , roaring ! the devouring flames rushed to their work of death ! The stake was in the center of the heap , the wood being piled around it at a distance of some feet , leaving an open space on all sides , in which the prisoner could walk , being fastened with a cord , some ten feet in length , one end of which was lashed to the stake , a large post , driven firmly into the ground . This vacant space was purposely left , that the sufferings of the doomed might be prolonged , a species of cruelty common in Indian tortures . As it would be some time before the flames would touch Hamilton , though his sufferings from heat would be excruciating in a little while , murdering him by slow inches , Durant hoped that the sufferings and reflections of this interval would bring repentance at the eleventh hour , and cause his victim to plead for mercy on his own terms . The fiery circle kept drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death at every moment ; yet no groan escaped the lips of Hamilton ; and he evinced the steady and unflinching heroism of a martyr . At a sign from Durant , the Indians prepared themselves with long splinters , which were to be fired at one end , and then driven into the flesh of the sufferer ; the guns were loaded with powder , to be fired against the naked person of the prisoner when the signal should be given . Hamilton saw all these preparations , but they shook not his firm resolve for a moment . His proud soul rose above all the horrors of the scene , and remained calm in the dignity of its earthly despair and eternal hopes . He knelt down by the stake and engaged in prayer : " Oh , Father ! give me strength to endure this trial by fire ! Forsake me not in this hour of extremity , but send Thy ministering angels to strengthen and sustain my spirit , that it faint not with the consuming flesh ! And , oh , God ! protect Thy persecuted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grasp of the destroyer ! Let not the wicked triumph ! my God , let not the wicked triumph ! but shield , oh , shield the innocent ! Thou art He who canst do wonders ; make known Thy power in the rescue and salvation of the afflicted child of misfortune from the hands of the spoiler ! Not for myself , but for her , I implore Thee for deliverance ! Oh , hear my prayer in her behalf , and send help in the hour of need ! " Durant listened to this prayer in spite of himself ; there was a something about it which held him spell-bound , fascinated ; and he forgot , for the moment , that his followers were awaiting his orders -- everything , in fact , but the one scene before him , the man on his knees at the stake . And there was another of those present no less deeply interested , though in a different way -- Ellen , who was in agony at the sight before her . A thought entered her mind -- a wild thought , which only despair could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the close of Hamilton 's fervent prayer , she sprung from the midst of her enemies , and ere they comprehended her design , or had time to lift a hand to stay her progress , rushed through the flames , and fell on her knees by the side of her lover . In a moment they were in each others ' arms , shedding tears on each others ' bosoms . The spectators of this strange exhibition were struck dumb with wonder , as they beheld this act of devoted heroism , and looked on in astonishment , then exchanged glances of bewilderment and consternation . A solemn pause ensued , as though all were paralyzed by such a deed of self-devotion to death . " Tear away the fire ! scatter the burning embers ! " at length fell from the lips of Durant , as he aroused himself from the spell that was on him . " Quick ! for your lives ! for if they are not rescued , you shall all die ! " His command was obeyed with alacrity , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertions . Unobserved by any of the actors in this strange and exciting drama , a dark cloud had gathered and spread over the face of heaven , black as the heralding banner of an approaching hurricane , from whose bosom the lurid lightning leaped forth , and the deep-toned thunder resounded . Presently the large drops of rain fell peltering on the leaves ; then the first heavy dash of the fitful storm came down , and presently extinguished the fire , which , by this time , was pretty well scattered over the ground . Walter and Ellen , still locked in a close embrace , were rescued from the jaws of the devouring element , and restored to a state of life more painful to contemplate than the prospect of ending existence in each others ' arms , even at the stake . But He who had interposed to save them , was now speaking through the storm in a voice which made the guilty Durant tremble with conscious-smitten fear . Flash followed flash in quick succession , and the jarring thunder , loud and terrible , broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the howling wind , like ten thousand furies , came crashing and roaring through the forest , bearing whole trees on its driving wings , while others bent low before the blasting swoop of its leveling might ! Cowering like a condemned criminal , the dark-deeded villain crept toward a shelter , dragging with him his captives . Suddenly a dazzling flood of light , blinding and bewildering , enveloped the whole party , and , at the same instant , an earth-shaking , sky-rending burst of sound stunned them all to prostration . It was some seconds before any one recovered . Then Hamilton arose and lifted Ellen also . On looking around , they perceived a large oak had been riven by the descending bolt at a short distance from them . A splinter from the tree had struck Durant on the breast and temple , and he lay bleeding and senseless upon the earth , but whether dead or alive , none could tell , as they had no time to certainly determine the point at such a moment . Hastily gathering him up , Ramsey and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were all glad to congregate themselves during the continuance of the frightful tornado . Once sheltered , Walter and Ellen gazed out upon the raging tempest in bewildered amazement , not unmixed with awe . Never had they beheld the elements so fearfully agitated as now ! Blacker than midnight were the pall-like clouds that " hung the heavens . " Loud as thunder was the roaring of the wind . Incessantly the vivid lightnings blazed forth in blinding flashes ; while above all the mingled commotion of the storm strife , the bursting thunders boomed . Like feathers in the breeze , great limbs of trees were wrenched from their places , and whirled , and twirled , and borne away . The tough oaks were twisted from their stems , or pulled up by the roots , while the smaller trees were snapped off like brittle reeds . " Terribly grand ! " said Hamilton to his companion . " A fearful display of God 's power ! " responded Ellen . " A mere breath of his omnipotence -- nothing more ! " For half an hour the tempest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soon after the clouds rolled away . During its continuance , the wild passions of the savages were awed into quiet , and their hearts filled with other thoughts and emotions than those of vengeance and cruelty . They were silent as the grave , and harmless as silent . The party now found time to look about them . Durant had manifested signs of life , but was evidently badly hurt . Presently he opened his eyes , and stared about , but his glances were those of bewildered delirium . A high fever was burning in his veins ; its fires penetrated to the head , and , reveling amid the brain , unhinged reason , and let loose the fierce passions so long time grown strong and o'ermastering . Who shall paint the darkness of a corrupt heart , when for years the basest feelings human nature is capable of experiencing have been nourished until more than mature ? It was more dreadful to listen to the ravings of Durant than to witness the fearful war of the elements . The tempest just over , was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom . We shall not attempt to record all the dark revelations he made of his own evil thoughts and deeds , as we would spare the reader 's feelings from the shock so revolting a record would produce . In his delirium he raved of the past , and unbosomed his intentions for the future . First he seemed to be enacting over the tragic scenes of the day . " Tear away the fagots ! " he cried . " I say , tear them away ! Stupid blockheads ! do you not know that I must have my revenge on the girl ? Scatter the fagots ! Gods ! if she dies the heart 's blood of every dog of you shall be spilled ! I -- I must , I will have her alive ! " During the utterance of those words his voice , gestures , and expression of countenance were in keeping with the language itself , and truly horrible . Suddenly a change came over his countenance ; the dark lines of passion retreated , and an expression of timidity or fear came in their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if communing with himself , he spoke in a subdued voice of the last scene in his conscious life . A few sentences were audible and connected , showing how his mind was affected by the tempest : " How I dread the storm ! It tells me there is a God ! that the thunder is his voice , and the fierce wind but the motion of his breath ! And the lightning ! oh , the lightning ! how it looks into the heart and exposes all its secrets to the eye of Deity ! What a flash was that ! Come ! to the cave ! to the cave ! " With the concluding words his quiet ceased , and he struggled as if exerting himself to do something very hastily . A moment more and a short , frightened cry , escaped his lips , and he sunk back , as if dead . It was plain that he was re-living and re-enacting the day , and its scenes ; and in this condition he remained for some time ; then his insanity took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposing the future of his life and designs . He raved and cajoled , commanded and persuaded by times ; was now quiet , and , anon , in a fever of excitement , or rage . After one of his quiet moods , he slowly aroused and addressed himself in this manner : " That oath ! it was a great mistake , this worst blunder I have made . In spite of myself it will haunt me . And the curse ! that awful curse ! Gods ! will it never cease ringing in my ears ! night and day , sleeping and waking it never leaves me ! I see her now ! How weird-like her prophetic looks ! How like the sentence of doom are her words , as , with flashing eye and quivering lip , she says : ' As you have wilfully , voluntarily , and wickedly called it down upon your own head , may the curse of God rest upon you in this world and the world to come . ' Gods and demons ! if their should be ' a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ! and , worst of all , they are proving a reality ! I am accused ! my ' plans of villainy ' do fail , and I am a ' vagabond upon the face of the earth ! ' But I 'll not endure it longer ! I 'll shake myself from these haunting fears ! aye , and I 'll prove them false ! I 'll do it if all the curses of the universe rise up before me ! Avaunt , ye specters ! I 'll be a man despite your efforts to frighten me by your grim presence ! " Again , in another strain , he broke forth with this development of his inward thoughts . " Heigh , ho ! I am on the track now , and nothing can save her ! Oh , but I 'll be sweetly revenged ! I 'll teach the proud minx to insult a Durant ! Wo n't she be humbled , though ! ha ! ha ! ha ! How she will struggle and beg for mercy ! But will I pity her ? Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I but possessed her now ! " And again : " Proud as ever ! Never mind , I 'll bring her down ! I 'll wreathe that lofty brow with shame ! I 'll strike her through her lover ! To save him at the stake she 'll yield ! I 'll revel in her charms , and then -- then what ? Ha ! ha ! As a reward for her condescensions , I 'll burn him alive ! Ha ! ha ! Fool , she 'll be to think I 'd let a rival live , when her heart was his ! " * * * " How pale she is ! the charm works ! she 'll bend to my will at last . * * Not yet ? Look at his agony , have you the heart to see him suffer so ? Ah , how dearly you must love him , to stand by and see him burn to ashes when a word from your lips would rescue him from the flames ! " * * * * * * * * " Let me see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; perhaps a little reflection will induce him to persuade her to yield . At all events I 'll try the experiment . Ho ! Ramsey , cut him loose ; we 'll adjourn the fun to another day . " Having thus given a few snatches of the revelations made by the villain in his delirium , enough to show what were his intentions toward his prisoners , and the utter blackness of his heart , we will depict another phase of his madness , in which he imagines the swift feet of retribution to be on his track , while the future was uncurtained to his distempered gaze . " Coming ! coming ! coming ! and there is no escape ! * * Away ! ye grinning devils ! out of my sight , ye imps of h -- l ! Begone ! ye ghostly demons , forever pointing with your long fingers ! what would you have me see ? " His eyes were wild with a horrible stare , as if fixed by the magic power of some ghastly sight , while large drops of perspiration oozed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow ! In fixed horror he thus remained for some moments , then fell back and covered his eyes with his hands , as if to shut out the dreadful scene ! Then rousing again , he exclaimed in another key : " No ! no ! no ! not that ! I 'll not come to that ! Alive , and food for crawling worms ! No ! no ! no ! Then birds of prey feasting upon my flesh ! Oh , God ! the curse ! the curse ! " This last vision seemed to overpower him , and he lay moaning most piteously for a length of time . Then the wilder phases of a distempered mind came on , and he again resumed his frenzied tone , manner , and language . " Begone ! ye lying fiends , avaunt ! I 'll not believe your hissing tongues ! ' T is false ! all false ! Back , or I 'll smite you to the earth ! Back ! back ! " And he fought the air furiously , for a brief period , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour 's sleep followed , from which he awoke much debilitated . With his waning strength , the delirium took a milder form . The vail of the future seemed still to be lifted , to give him a glimpse of coming events , but the scene that appeared was not dreadful like the ones which had preceded it . " Happy at last , despite my oath , my vengeance unachieved ! All my deep-laid schemes of no avail ! Oh , Eliza ! thou art indeed revenged ! Thy worst predictions are realized . " The fever soon returned in violence , and once more his ravings were dreadful . " Ho , Ramsey ! keep them safe , on your life , keep them safe ! do you hear ? Your life , if they escape ! I 'll not be thwarted in my wishes ; I 'll move all h -- l but I 'll be revenged ! ay , I 'll walk through fire , flood and storm to gain my ends and work their ruin ! They shall not escape my vengeance , I swear it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not dwell longer on this unpleasant picture of a wretched man exposing his own dark soul to the eyes of others . All the night long he continued to rave in this fever-crazed manner , Hamilton , and much of the time Ellen , too , a witness of his madness . As morning drew near he fell into a more tranquil slumber , and the violence of the fever seemed to have passed . With the early dawn seizing a favorable moment , when all their enemies were asleep , the lovers made their escape . Ramsey and the Indians were so much occupied with Durant , they did not think of the prisoners as they would have done under other circumstances , though they did not feel desirous of seeing the deeds of the past day re-enacted . It was some time before they noticed the escape , and then no pursuit was instituted until after the morning meal was dispatched . Hamilton and Ellen made the best of their way down the Ohio , and early in the evening had the good fortune to fall upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ellen 's brother , who had busied himself day and night to raise the force and go in quest of the captives , having resolved never to cease his efforts until his sister was rescued , or her fate learned and her death avenged . The meeting was a happy one ; and as the object of the expedition was accomplished , the party returned home , when there was a time of general rejoicing . CONCLUSION . We have little more to say . As the reader will conclude without reading the fact , Walter and Ellen were married , according to their original arrangements , and afterward lived in the enjoyment of that happiness which love alone can procure , and which can be found only at the domestic fireside where peace reigns ; their descendants may still be found in Kentucky and other western states . Durant recovered from his hurt , and lived for some years to plot more mischief , and fail in his designs . He at last quarreled with one of his savage followers , and in a fit of anger , struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forgotten or forgiven . The Indian vowed to be revenged , and he kept his oath ; dogging the steps of his foe , he found an opportunity to inflict a wound , which felled his adversary to the earth . With proper attention he might have recovered , but his enemy left him disabled and bound , to die by slow inches ! His wound , at first very painful , soon began to mortify , and he felt the worms in his still living body ! Vultures came to feast upon him , ere the vital spark of existence had gone out within him , and he had not the strength left to lift a hand , or speak a word in his own defense , though their long beaks were stretched over him and planted in his flesh and eyes ! And when death at last came , and laid his icy fingers upon his heart , for the final stilling of its disquiet and guilty throbbing , his failing senses were suddenly and momentarily aroused , and the curdling blood sent again with quickened impulse through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horrible sound of the howlings of wild beasts in the distance ; and the last things that his closing , almost sightless balls beheld were the glaring eyes of the monsters of the forest , as they gloated over their prey ! The sight was enough to finish the work of dissolution , already advanced near to completion , and the sluggish blood rushed for the last time upon his paralyzed heart with such chilling coldness and mastering power , that it ceased to beat , and the wretch was dead ! Then a fight took place over his putrefying carcass , and the screech of the vulture , mingled with the angry growl of the wolf , as they contended for the remains of the man of crimes in their wild fury and ferocious hunger ! A few hours longer , and the flesh was all torn from his frame , and only a ghostly , grinning skeleton was left of the once proud and vicious Louis Durant ; and yet fresh beasts arriving upon the scene , disappointed in their anticipated feast , howled a dismal requiem over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bleach in the winds and storms of heaven ! Such was the terrible end of the villain , while the victims of his hate and malice , against whom he had plotted so often and so fiendishly , were happy in the enjoyment of life 's best blessings ; and thus the story points its own moral . THE END
