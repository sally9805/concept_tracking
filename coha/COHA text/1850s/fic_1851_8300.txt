Sigourney , L. H. ( Lydia Howard ) , 1791-1865 : DEATH OF A YOUNG WIFE . from Death of a young wife ( 1851 ) O sweet and radiant ,  --  reft away , As fleets the blossom from the spray , When sudden tempests blow ,  --  We dreamed not of thine early blight , Who bore the promise , warm and bright , A longer span to know . We well remember what thou wert , The fair of brow , the pure in heart , The lily of our love ; And it becomes us now , to clear The eye of faith from darkening tear , And point its glance above . For there , methinks , we see thee stand , Amid the white-robed seraph band , A cherub by thy side , Who breathed not here the wintry air , But swiftly fled to show thee where Thou shouldst in bliss abide . Young wife ,  --  young mother ,  --  daughter dear ,  --  We name thee not without a tear , Such as the soul may know That mourned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy heavenly birth , Doth mingle praise with woe . No pain is thine , nor weary care , Nor burden such as we must bear , Who , lingering , year by year , Find frost around the forehead cling , And fall like a forgotten thing , With scarce one sorrowing tear . The hosts who watch us , lest we stray ,  --  The unseen guardians of our way , Who do their Maker 's will ,  --  Love they not those whom thus they shield ?  --  So , though thy form be unrevealed , Thy ministry by clouds concealed , Sweet angel !  --  love us still .
