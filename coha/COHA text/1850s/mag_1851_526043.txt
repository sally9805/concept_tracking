Santa - Rosa . SANTA-ROSA. qwq M* DEAR FRIEND : - Time has nearly obliterated the memory of the short Piedinontese revolution of 1821 , and that of the personage who played in that revolution the principal part . This oblivion has nothing in it unjust . In order to endure in the memory of men , one must have done things which endure . It is not only through weakness , as it is supposed , that men adore success ; it is in their eyes the symbol of the greatest virtues of the soul , and of the first of all ,  --  I mean that strong sagacity which engages in no enterprise without having weighed all its chances , and without having been assured that it contains nothing which could render constancy and energy in vain . The most brilliant courage against the impossible touches but little , and the most heroic sacrifices lose in some sort their value in the service of imprudence . Without doubt , the Piedmontese revolution was above all a military movement , destined to arrest Austria at the moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Neapolitan Parliament , and to rule Italy . The great fault of the chiefs of this military movement is that they put on their banner , by an ill-understood condescension , the device of an excessive and foreign liberalism , the inevitable effect of which was to create divisions , to disaffect the nobility , in whom resided fortune and power , and to shake allegiance to government . And then , the success of a contest of arms on the part of the house of Savoy against Austria depended upon two conditions : 1st . That France , if she did not openly sustain Piedmont , should not oppose it , and should even secretly serve it ; 2d . That the Neapolitan army should hold out in its resistance at least several months . Now , these two conditions were necessarily wanting . In 1821 , the French government already inclined to the fatal re-action which soon terminated in the ministry of M. VilkIe , and later in the ordinances of July ; and every one in Piedmont who had any military exper*ence knew that it was chimerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore was condemned to fail . It did great harm in that small country , which owes every thing to sagacity combined with audacity , and which can be enlarged in size and increased in importance only by the same means which for three centuries have made it what it has become . Placed between Austria and France , the house of Savoy has been elevated only by serving in turn one against the other , and by never having but a single enemy at a time . The Piedmontese monarchy is the work of political management ; political management alone can maintain it . It came near being destroyed in the revolution of 1821 . A respected King abdicating the throne ; the heir of the throne compromised , and almost a prisoner ; the flower of the nobility exiled ; the first commander of Italy , the pride and the hope of the army , General Gifflenga , disgraced for ever ; you , my dear * Sir Win . Hamilton , dedication of his edition of Reid to Cousin . j Edinburgh Review , April , 1851 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fortune , and above all by your character and your genius , to represent Piedmont so usefully at Paris or London , condemned to inaction for your whole life perhaps ; officers like Saint Marsan , Lisio , and Collegni reduced to the necessity of breaking their swords ; finally , he who surpassed you all ,  --  permit me to say it ,  --  he whose heroic soul better directed , and whose superior talent ripened by experience , would have been able to give to his native Piedmont and to the house oe Savoy the minister most capable of guiding her destinies , M. de Santa-Rosa , proscribed , wandering in Europe , and going to die in Greece in a contest hardly worthy of him : such are the bitter fruits of an enterprise at once most noble and most imprudent . Europe scarcely remembers that there was a liberal movement in Piedmont in 1821 . Those who have the instinct of the beautiful distinguished in that passing report certain words which revealed a great soul . The name of Santa-Rosa resounded for a moment ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greece , and it was learned that the same man who had shown a shadow of greatness in his short dictatorship of 1821 , had bravely died in 1825 , while defending the isle of Sphacteria against the Egyptian army ; then ensued a profound silence , an eternal silence , and the memory of Santa-Rosa lives only in a few souls scattered at Turin , at Paris , and at London . I am one of these . My relations with Santa-Rosa were very brief , but intimate . More than once I have been tempted to write his life , that life half romantic , half heroic ; but I have renounced that project . I am not about to dispute with oblivion the name of a man who failed of his destiny ; but several persons , and you in particular , who take a pious interest in his memory , have often asked me to recount by what adventure I , a Professor of Philosophy , an entire stranger to the events of Piedmont , happened to be so intimately connected with the chief of the Piedmontese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear and unfortunate compatriot . I am about to do that which you desire . I shall abstain from all general , political , and philosophical considerations . My subject shall be only Santa-Rosa and myself . This is not a historical composition ; it is a simple home picture , traced for some faithful friends , to awaken certain sympathies , to recall certain memories , and to serve as a text for certain sad conversations in a circle narrowed day by day . The public , I know , is indifferent , and ought to be , to these entirely domestic details between two men , of whom one has been long since forgotten , and the other soon shall be forgotten ; but in this long malady which consumes me , and in the sombre inaction to which it condemns me , I find a melancholy charm in reverting to those days for ever vanished . I love to bind my languishing life to that animated episode of my youth . I evoke for a moment before me the shade of my friend , crc I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two tombs , and destined to die in your hands 1* In the month of October , 1821 , suspended from my functions as Professor of the history of Modern Philosophy in the Faeult* des Lettres , and menaced in my teaching of the Normal School , which itself was soon after suppressed ; confined in an humble retreat situated by the side of the garden of the Luxembourg , I had been , as an addition to my misfortune , in the course of unrelaxed toil upon the unedited manuscripts of Proclus , violently attacked with that affection of the chest xyhich during all my youth frightened my family and my friends . I was almost in the condition in which you see me to-day . I know not how at that time there . fell into my hands a pamphlet entitled " The Piedmontese Revolution , " having for an epigraph this verse from Alfieri : " Sta Ia forsa per lui , per me sta ii vero . " My journey in Italy during the summer and autumn of 1820 , my attachment to the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Piedmont and Naples , naturally interested me in that production ; and although sick , shunning every lively e*iotion , especially every political emotion , I read that pamphlet as one would read a romance , without search-. ing in it for any thing else than a diversion for my ennui and the spectacle of human passions . In fact , I found a true hero of romance in the avowed chief of that revolution , the Count de Santa-Rosa . That man so ruled the events of those thirty days , that he alone engaged my attention . I saw him at first , a partisan of the English parliamentary // system , demanding for his country only a constitutional government , two chambers , even a hereditary peerage ; and then , when the fatal example of the Neapolitans and the adoption of the Spanish constitution had carrie ( l away all minds , no longer occupying himself except with a sino'le thing , the military direction of the revolution , and , borne by circumstances to a veritable dictatorship , displaying an energy that his enemies them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spirit of chivalrous moderation so rare in times of revolution . I still recollect and wish to reproduce here the order of the day which he published March 23 , 1821 , at the very moment when the constitutional cause seemed to be despaired of : - " Charles-Albert of Savoy , Prince of Carignan , mnveste ( l by his Majesty Victor-Emanuel with the authority of regent , has named me , by his decree of the 23 ( 1 of this month , regent of the ministry of the army and the navy . " I am , therefore , a legitimately constituted authority , and it is my duty , in the terrible circumstances in which the country is found , to let my cOmpanions in arms hear the voice of a subject , affectionate to his King and a loyal Piedmontese . " The Prince Regent abandoned the capital during the night of the 21st and 22d of this month , without notifying the National Junta or his ministers . " Let no Piedmontese accuse the intentions of a Prince whose liberal heart , whose devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope of all well-disposed people . A small number of men deserters of their country and servants of Austria , have without doubt deceived , by an odious tissue of fal-ohoods , a young Prince who has not the experience of stormy times . " A declaration , signed by the King CharlesFelix , has appeared mu Piedmont ; but a Piedmontese King in the midst of Austrians , our unavoidable enemies , is a captive Kin , , ; nothing that he says can or ought to be regarded as coming from him . Let him speak to us on a free soil , and then we will prove to him that we are his children . " Piedmnontese soldiers , national guards ! do you desire civil war ? Do you desire the invasion of strangers , the devastation of your plains , the conflagration and the pillage of your cities and your villages ? Do you with to lose your glory , to soil your ensigns ? Go on then . Can armed Piedmontese ri*e up against Piedmomitese t Gas the breasts of brothers strike against the breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-officers , and soldiers ! there is no longer any means of safety . Rally to your colors , surround them , seize them , and run to plant them on the banks of the Ta:sin and the Po . The country of the Lombards awaits you , that territory which will devour its enemies at the sight of your van-guard . Woe to him whom different opinions upon the institutions of hiM country should separate from this necessary resolution ! he would not deserve to conduct Piedmontese soldiers ; he would not merit the honor of bearing the Piedmontese name . " Companions in arms ! this epoch is European . We are not abandoned . France lifts up her head , too much humiliated beneath the yoke of the Austrian cabinet ; she is about to extend to you a powerful hand . " Soldiers and national guards ! extraordinary circumstances demand extraordinary resolutions . If you hesitate , country , honor , all are lost . Think of these things , and do your duty ; the Junta and ministers will do theirs . Your energy will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CharlesFelix will one day thank you for having preserved for him his throne . " Finally , when every thing was lost , SantaRosa negotiated a general pence with the Count de Mocenigo , Minister of Russia at the court of Turin , on condition of an amnesty and some internal ameliorations ; offering on this condition to renounce the amnesty for himself and the other constitutional chiefs , and to submit to banishment , the better to secure the peace and happiness of the country . This noble conduct struck me forcibly , and for seine - days I repeated to all my friends : " Gentlemen , them-c was a man at Turin . " My admiration redoubled when IL learned that the hero of this production was also'its author . I could not restrain a feeling of respect , at seeing in the defender of an unfortunate revolution that absence of all party spirit , that magnanimous loyalty which does justice to all intentions , and in the most poignant sorrows of exile gives way to no unjust recriminations , no bitter feelings . Enthusiasm in a noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time a moderation full of dignity , to say nothing of the rare talent displayed on every page of this work , exhibited in my eyes one of those heautiful- chai-acters , a hundred times more interesting than the two revolutions of Naples and of Piedmont ; for if philosophy in me seeks , in contemporaneous events , the movement of eternal principles and their visible manifestations , so man does not with less ardor seek humanity in human things . And what feature of humnan character is more admirable than the union of moderation and energy l This ideal of which I had so often din-earned seemed presented to me in Santa-Rosa . I was tol4 that he was in Paris . I longed to knox* himn , and a friend whom I had made is // Italy brought him one morning to my chamber . I had just been spitting blood , and the first words I said to him were these : " Sir , you are the only man whom I can , in my condition , desire yet to know . " How many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying , he condemned to death , concealed under a feigned nam&amp; , without resources , and almost without bread ! Omitting the details of our conversation , it will be sufficient to say that I found still more than I had expected . In his look , his gait , in all his words , I easily recognized the fire and energy of the author of the proclamation of the 23d of March ; and at the same time my feeble health seemed to inspire him with an affectionate compassion , expressed each moment by the most amiable cares . Seeing my critical situation , he forgot himself and thought only of me . Our long conversation , of which he bore the burden , having left me agitated and feeble , he returned in the evening to inquire about me . The next morning he came again , and so the morning after ; and at the expiration of a few days , we felt as if we had passed our lives together . The name which he had taken was that of Conti . He lodged near me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a furnished attic chamber with a friend from Turin , who had voluntarily left his country to follow him , although he had taken no part in the revolution , and was in no wise compromised by it . Who then is this man , with whom one can prefer exile to the sweets of country and of family ? It is impossible to express the charm of his society . To me , this charm , I repeat , was in the union of strength and kindness . I saw him always ready , at the least ray of hope , to engage in the most perilous enterprises , and I found him happy too in passing his life obscurely by the bedside of a suffering friend . His heart was an inexhaustibk store of affectionate sentiment . To every one he was good , even to tenderness . Did he encounter any unfortunate person in the street ? he shared with him the farthing of the poor . Was his poor old hostess sick ? he took care of her as if she had been a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel ? he lavished it , like every thing else , with an irresistible instinct , of which he seemed scarcely conscious . It was this that rendered it im possible to know bim without loving him .. I doubt whether any human creature , even a woman , could have been loved as well . He had at Turin a friend , to whom he was able to confide his wife and children , and another had accompanied him in his exile . Behold in this a striking proof of the sentiinent which he inspired . At an early age he was attached to the regiment of his father in the service of the army of the Alps . Here a young man of his own country had been given him as a comrade . Having left the army at Piedmont , this young man lost sight of his youthful master ; but a deep remembrance of him never left his heart . One d y the noble Count , lying in his wretched garret in the street Francs-Bourgeois , saw suddenly standing before him the poor Bossi , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public journals the adventures of his young officer , and could take no rest until he had discovered his abode and offered to him his scanty savings . How many times , after this , while repairing to the prison of Santa-Rosa , have I found , at the door of the Salle Saint-Martin , Bossi or his wife with a basket of fruits , waiting whole hours for ah opportunity to glide in with me and place their offering before the prisoner , with the respect of an old servant and the tenderness of a true friend . From the end of October , 1821 , until the 1st of January , 1822 , we lived together in the sweetest and most profound intimacy . During the whole day , until five or six o'clock in the evening , he remained in his little room in the street of the Francs-Bourgeois , occupied in reading and preparing a work on the constitutional governments of the nineteenth century . After dinner , night approaching , he left his cell , reached the street d'Enfer , where I resided , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I too had arranged my mode of life somewhat like his . I passed the day in taking medicine and in studying Plato ; at evening I closed my books and received my friends . Santa-Rosa had a passion for conversation , and he talked wonderfully ; but I was so languid and so feeble that I could not support the energy of his words . They produced fever and nervous excitement , which terminated in prostration and faintness . Then the energetic man gave place to the most affectionate creature . How many nights has he spent at my bed-side // with my old nurse ! As soon as I felt relieved , he would cast himself , all dressed , upon a sofa , and , by the aid of a good conscience and incomparable health , sleep , despite all sorrow , till the break of day . I must here sketch his portrait . SantaRosa was about forty years of age . He was of medium stature , about five feet two inches . His head was large , his forehead bald , lips and nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing elegant in his manners ; his tone was strong and manly , and his forms of expression were infinitely polished . He was far from being handsome ; but his face , when it was animated ,  --  and it was always animated ,  --  had something so passionate , that it became interesting . What was most remarkable in him , was an extraordinary strength of body . Neither large nor small , neither fat nor lean , he was in vigor and agility a veritable lion . If he forgot himself in the least , he no longer walked , he bounded . He had muscles of steel , and his hand was a vise in which he could hold the strongest . I have seen him lift , almost without effort , the heaviest tables . He was capable of enduring the longest fatigues , and seemed born for the labors of war . Of this occupation he was passionately fond . He had been a captain of grenadiers , and no one had received from nature more of those physical and moral qualities which make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . His whole person and his very aspect gave the idea of force . I have never seen a more touching specfade than that of this man , so strong , who had so much need of air to expand his chest , movement for the exercise of robust limbs and inexhaustible activity , metamorphosing himself into a true Sister of Charity , now silent , now gay , restraining his words and almost his breath , that he might not disturb the frail creature in whom he was so interested . The gentleness of the weak affords little that is seductive , for we may say that it is perhaps mere weakness ; but the tenderness of strength has a charm almost divine . We held in fact the same opinions , and he contributed not a little to strengthen me in my convictions . Like myself , he was profoundly constitutional , neither servile nor democratic , without envy , and without insolence . He had no ambition either of fortune or of rank , and was indifferent to material well-being ; but he was ambitious of glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made duty a matter of religion , but he also felt the need of loving , and of being loved , and love or tender friendship was necessary for his heart . As to religion , he passed in Italy for a man of great piety , and in fact he was full of respect for Christianity , which he had carefully studied . He was even somewhat of a theologian . He told me that in Switzerland he argued against the Protestant theologians , and defended Catholicism ; but his faith was not that of Mazoni , and I have discovered little more at the bottom of his heart than the faith of the Savoyard vicar . Greedy of knowledge , besides , attaching every thing to politics , he devoured in my books whatever belonged to morality and practice . Although liberal , or rather because he was truly so , he dreaded the influence of pretended liberal declamations ; and observing the decline of religions faith in European society , he felt the want of a noble and elevated moral philosophy . He possessed naturally good metaphysical powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in the world has so much encouraged and sustained me in my philosophical career . My designs became his own , and if he had remained in France , he would have given to the cause of philosophy in its moral and political apl*lications another excellent writer , a firm , elevated , and persuasive organ . His mind doubtless was not that of a man of letters , nor of a philosopher , but of a military man and of a pohitican . That mind was correct and upright like his heart . He detested paradoxes , and in grave matters , the expression of hazardous , arbitrary , personal opinions , inspired him with deep repugnance . He chiaed me often in regard to some of my own opinions , and led me continually from the narrow and dangerous paths of personal theories to th' great road of common sense and universal consciousness . He had neither breadth nor originality of thought , but he felt with depth and energy , and expressed himself , spoke and wrote with gravity and with emotion . His work on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was his first effort ! What would he not have done had he lived I In politics , this pretended revolutionist. // possessed so much moderation that , if he had been in France in the Chamber of Deputies , at this period , the close of 1821 , he would have been seated between M. Roger-Collard and M. Lain6 . My friends aud I were at that time badly treated by the Ministry of M. de Richelieu , and we were not always just towards him . Santa-Rosa , with his accustomed gravity , rebuked my sudden outburst of passion , and was astonished at those of my more prudent friends . I remember that one evening being at my house with M. Hermann and M. Roger-Collard , he took part in a serious conversation , in regard to what was necessary to be done under present circumstances , - whether the Richelieu Ministry , defended by M. Pasquier , M. Lain6 , and M. Desolles , should be permitted to exist , or whether it should be destroyed by an alliance with the right side , led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if MM . Corbidre and Yill*le came to power , they would not possess it six months ; and , the Richelieu Ministry overturned , he saw , following MM . Vilkde and Corbi*re , the prompt triumph of the liberal cause . This was a very seductive perspective for a proscribed man like Santa-Rosa . In six mouths , after the reign of a violent and ephemeral power , a liberal Ministry , which had at least softened the exile of the Piedmontese refugees in drawing me and my friends from disgrace , would open to Santa-Rosa a future in France ! With what respect did I hear the noble outlaw invite me to oppose with all my strength a party intrigue which he severely reprehended . " Take no thought of me , " said he ; " I shall do what I am best able . You , you must do your duty : your duty as a good citizen is not to combat a Ministry which is your last resource against a faction hostile to all progress and all light ! It is not lawful to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e of overturning at last MM . Corbi*re and Yill&amp;le , and you are sure of doing evil by delivering power into their hands . As for me , if I were a deputy , I would try to strengthen the Richelieu Ministry against the Court and the right side . " My opinion was the same as that of SantaRosa . It did not prevail , and on that day a fault was committed which for seven years weighed heavily on France . The Richelieu Ministry was overthrown ; MM . Corbi&amp;re and Vilkie attained to power , and they remained in it until 182* . Evil days came upon France . When the Ministry of M. Vill&amp;le had replaced that of M. de Richelieu , the faction which possessed power , whilst it attacked in France , one by one , every liberty and every security , united more and more closely its foreign alliance , and the Governments of Piedmont and of France leagued together to pursue and torment the refugees . They were in Paris under feigned names , and in general they lived tranquil and retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and de Lavean , sought religiously to satisfy the resentments and the fears of the Court of Turin . Instead of watching , which was its duty and its right , it persecuted . Santa-Rosa received warning that the police was upon his track , and that he would be arrested . Once arrested , he might be delivered up to Piedmont , and the sentence of death pronounced against him , and his friends might be executed . I thought that the first storm should be permitted to pass over , and contrived for Santa-Rosa a retreat at Arcucil , in the country house of one of my friends , M. Viguer . Here we both established ourselves , and lived together during the first months of 1822 , scarcely ever receiving a visit , and never venturing beyond the inclosure of the garden . I continued my translation of Plato ; he , his researches iAto constitutional governments . It was there , in our long winter evenings ' conversations , that Santa-Rosa related to me his exterior and interior life , and the perfect truth , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cards , of the Piedmontese revolution . He was born on the 18th of November , 1 *82 , at Savigliano , a city of southern Piedmont , of a good family , but whose nobility was of recent date . His father , the Count of Santa-Rosa , was a military man , who fought the first battles o* Piedmont against the French Revolution , and carried with him to the army his son Sanctorre , then between nine and ten years of age . If the father had lived , the career of the son would have been decided ; but the Count de Santa-Rosa was killed at the battle of Mondovi , at the head of the regiment of Sardinia , of which he was Colonel ; and not long after , the victories of Napoleon and the submission of Piedmont put an end to the military career of young Sanctorre . He retired to his family at Savigliano , and , partly in this city and partly in Turin , made , under the // celebrated Abby Vaisperga de Caluso , great profiency in classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters . The name of his family was so respected in his province , and he himself bore it so well , that at the age of twenty-four years he was *elected by his fellow-citizens Mayor of Savigliano , and passed several years of his youth in the exercise of this office , wherein he acquired skill in civil affairs . But this was not a career for a man without fortune . He was then persuaded , despite his disinclination , to enter into the French administration , which at that time governed Piedmont : he was made sub-prefect of Spezzia in the State of Genoa , and he performed these functions during the years 1812 , 1813 , and 1814 , up to the Restoration . Santa-Rosa hailed with enthusiasm the return of the house of Savoy ; and in 1815 , believing that the arrival of Napoleon at Paris during the hundred days would bring about a long war , he left the civil for the military service , and made the very short campaign of 1815 , as a Captain in the grenadiers of the royal guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he once more left the career of arms , for one in which his civil and military knowledge were happily combined , that of the administration of military affairs . He entered the Ministry of War , and was charged with very responsible duties . It was then , I believe , that he married a young person who was able to boast more of birth than fortune . By this marriage he had several children . He was in high estimation , favored at court , and destined to a brilliant career , when the Neapolitan revolution broke out ; a revolution which Austria undertook violently to suppress , thus openly affecting the dotriination of Italy . I ought to impose upon myself a religious silence in regard to the confidential matters which the friendship of SantaRosa committed to me , but I may , ought to say one thing : that in the profound solitude in which we lived , speaking to a friend whose political opinions were as well defined as his own , Santa-Rosa assured me twenty times that his friends and he had connection with secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last extremity , when it was demonstrated that the Piedmontese government was without force sufficient to resist Austria ; that a military movement would be powerless if it depended on a civil movement ; and that for a civil movement the concurrence of secret societies would be indispensable . He deplored this necessity , and he accused the nobility and the Piedmontese proprietors ( gli possidenti ) of having destroyed both the country and themselves by not performing their duty , by not boldly warning the King of the perils of Piedmont , and by forcing patriotism to have recourse to secret plots . His loyalty disdained all mystery ; and wihout confessing the fact , I saw that his chivalry experienced a sort of inward shame at having been driven little by little to this extremity . He continually repeated to me : " Secret societies are the pest of Italy ; but how can we dispense with them , when there is no publicity , no legat means of expressing one 's opinion with im* punity l " He told me that for a long time he resolved not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all action , and to limit himself to great moral and political publications , capable of influencing opinion and regenerating Italy . This is what he called a literary conspiracy . Certainly it would have been more useful than the sad contest of 1821 . His fancy was to recommence this literary conspiracy from the midst of France . His consolation was that he had *never done any thing for himself , and that he had only thought of his country . his clear conscience and natural energy , united , secured to him , in our solitude of Arcucil , a tranquil and almost happy life . My bad health and his imprudent friendship , together with the baseness of the French police , tore him from his solitude and ruined him for ever . If he had remained with me , he might have reshaped his destiny ; he might have passed the whole period of the Restoration in honorable labors , which would have given glory to his name ; he might have re*iThed the revolution of July , and then could have chosen either to re-enter Piedmont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like M. de CoN legno , into the service of France ; and in. this case an immense career would have been before him , if , at the same time , this proud mind , disdainful of good as well as bad fortune , had ever been able to consent to have any other country than that which lie had wished to serve , and which his misfortunes themselves had rendered more dear and more sacred . Alas ! all this future was destroyed in a single day . One day the // condition of my lungs so frightened SantaRosa , that lie conjured me to seek help in Paris . I yielded ; I returned to the Luxembourg . Santa-Rosa , uneasy , could not remain at Arcueil , and in the evening I saw him appear at the side of my bed . Instead of staying with me , he desired to pass the night in his old lodging ; and before going there he had the imprudence to enter a coffeehouse in the Place de l'Odeon , for the purpose of reading the journals . Scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven or eight agents of the police , thrown on the ground , conducted to the Prefect , and cast into prison . It appears that he had been recognized at the barrier where some time before he had been described . During the same night of his arrest , he was interrogated by the Prefect of Police . From the moment of this first interrogatory , Santa-Rosa acknowledged his true name , and expressed those sentiments which had made a lively impression upon the fanatical but honest M. de Laveau . He repelled with indignation the accusation of having engaged in machinations against the French Government ; he declared that he was absolutely a stranger to all that was passing in France , and that his only and involuntary crime was in being at Paris under another name than his own . Having been interrogated in regard to his connections in Paris , he named me as the only friend he had . He asked as a favor that I should not be brought into this affair , and that I might be spared a visit which might be fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be demanded , and even the most severe reparation , rather than expose him who had given him hospitality . The sentence of extradition having been pronounced , Santa-Rosa seemed to accept his fate with that simple pride which never fails of its effect . He seemed uneasy only on a single point , the consequences which this affair might have upon my health . Whilst this was passing at the prefecture of police , I was in my bed , covered with leeches , and in the most deplorable condition . The following day , between four and five o'clock in the morning , I heard a loud knock at my door , and suddenly five or six gendarmes rushed into my room , having at their head a commissary of police , who , showing his scarf signified to me , in the name of the King , that he had orders to make strict search among my papers . I did not know what all this meant , and it was only at the end of the examination , the result of which was to discover to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commissary informed me that I had been searched on account of Santa-Rosa , who had been arrested the evening before on leaving my house . Struck by this intelligence as with a thunder-bolt , I transported myself immediately to the house of M. de Laveau , and demanded of him why , if he accused of conspiracy against the French Government a man who knew no other person than myself at Paris , he had not placed me under the same arrest ; or , if he dared not also to accuse me of conspiracy , why he complained of a man who could have done nothing except through me and with inc . If it was not in fact a question of conspiracy against France , I showed him what a lack of magnanimity there was in pursuing a proscribed person , because he was under another name than his own , when moreover this proscribed person was a gallant man , and inoft*nsive in his life ; and I asked to see Santa-Rosa at once . M. de Laveau was a party-man like M. Franchet ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an honest man . He had just interrogated Santa-Rosa a second time ; he had just read the report of the commissary of police on the results of the search made at my house , and was beginning to feel that the accusation of conspiracy against the French Government was deprived of all foundation . My visit , by proving to him that we were not afraid , and that we did not fear a trial , was sufficient to persuade him . At the same time he thought that he must still affect some doubt , and announced to me that the trial would take place . I demanded to appear in it a evidence , and a few days after I was summoned before the magistrate , M. Debelleyme , since Prefect of Police , and now member of the Chamber of Deputies . The examination was short and minute . M. Debelleyme displayed impartiality and perfect moderation . He conceived , in regard to the prisoner , a just idea of his morality , and always spoke to me of him with respect and benevolence . Thi* ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of action on the ground of conspiracy , the only one which had occasioned the arrest . As to the affair // of the passport under a false name , the crime of the prisoner was acknowledged* but in terms most honorable to himself . Mention was made of his loyalty , and of the frankness of his avowals . This ordinance of " no cause of action " was not made until the expiration of two months , and during all this time poor Santa-Rosa remained a prisoner at the prefecture of police in one of the rooms of the Salle Saint-Martin . The first days of the arrest having passed , I obtained permission to visit him every day , and some others afterwards obtained the same permission . It was then that I learned still better to know the character and the mind of Santa-Rosa . At the first moment he had two fears : the first was that of being delivered up to Piedmont , that is , to the scaffold ; the second , that the excitement of all this affair and the visit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even fatal to me . When he saw me enter his prison in apparently better health than usual , his serenity of mind returned to him , and during the two months that he remained in the Salle Saint-Martin I did not hear him complain either of his fate or of any one around him . He prepared himself to die well , if delivered up to Piedmont , and read no longer any thing but his Bible . Afterwards , when this fear was removed , his attention was directed to the details of the proceedings against him . He was touched by the regard testified for him , and penetrated with respect for the excellence of the French law , and for the independence of the magistracy . Santa-Rosa should have been seen in his prison . It was a very good roomy airy , salubrious ; he was in no bad condition , and enjoyed himself wonderfully . The jailor , who had long followed his occupation , and who had acquired some knowledge of men , soon saw with whom he had to deal , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him Jt'Iionsieur le Oornte , and this was not displeasing to Santa-Rosa , who spoke to him with kindness , and concluded by so far securing his affections that this jailor seemed entirely like an old servant of his house . SantaRosa was informed by him as to his fortune , his family , his children . The other consulted him . Santa-Rosa gave his advice with mildness , but with authority . One would have said that he was again at Savigliano in his mayoralty , speaking to one of his employees . When he left the prison the jailor told me he was losing a great deal . It was so in my own house . My nurse loved him more than she loved me ; and even now , after the lapse of twenty years , she speaks of him only with the utmost tenderness* It was in this prison that I met Santa-Rosa 's old servant in the army of the Alps , Bossi , a bad head and a good heart , who knew not how to manage his affairs , but who would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is needless to say that thes two months , during which we passed two or three hours of each day together in the Salle Saint-Martin , united us more and more closely . It seems , after the ordinance of " no cause of action " rendered by the magistrate , M. Debelleyme , that the result of that affair ought to have been at least to leave SantaRosa tranquil at Paris . Such was not the case . At first there was a primary arrest by the police . It was necessary that the royal court should interpose , and formally pronounce a dismissal , if no other cause of arrest should be met with . Through the police of M. Corbidre , opposition was made even to the execution of the second judgment ; and after Santa-Rosa had been justly declared out of the reach of further arrest , and consequently free , M. Corbi*re , by ministerial interference , decided that M. de Santa-Rosa and several of his compatriots , arrested in the same manner as he , should be consigned to some province under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat larger than the Salle Saint-Martin , to which Santa-Rosa was condemned by the Minister of the Interior and of the Police . That shameless and wicked act towards a man evidently inoffensive , and who w'ms able to find cons9lation only at Paris , in the company of a friend whose liberal opinions and very tranquil life ( since that life was nearly all passed in his bed ) were known ,  --  that act which destroyed Santa-Rosa in separating him from Paris and from me , caused him , by its useless rigor , a real irritation . He protested , demanded permission to remain at Paris , or passports for England . No answer was given him , and he was transferred to Alen*on . Here are portions of some of his letters from Alen9on , which make known to us the // life which he led there , his sentiments and his labors " ALENCON , May 19 , 1S22 . " We arrived yesterday at Alen9on . The orders of the Minister subject us to the surveillance of the local authority , and this surveillance will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hour of two , we must present ourselves to the Mayor , and enter our names in his register ; that is all . I have declared very calmly , very simply , but in terms very clear and very significant , my position to the Mayor . He had no good reasons to give mc for all this , and I demanded none of him either good or bad . The intercourse , too , was not very animated , hut it was polite , which did not hinder it from being sufficiently interesting to your good-natured friend . Besides , I love the Mayors , and for a reason . One of them is a good old man , with a feeble , pleasant voice . His colleague , whose name ends in i*re , and who walks as straight as an i , did not receive us so well . I have promised myself that if I ever become again ruler of my dear city , I will guard myself from giving unpleasant moments to the poor devils who shall be brought to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will console me for being no longer in my prison of Paris . The indignation which the injustice that I experience causes me has not diminished , but I shall not let it trouble my repose . This is enough to say about myself I am coming to a subject that I can not quit . You think you are really better than in November last ; this better ou0ht to give you a beginning of courage , because it is a beginning of hope . Reflect a little on the pleasure , the vivid , the inconceivable pleasure of becoming again yourself , and on the pleasure I shall feel to see you in the full possession of your power of thought and action . " " ALENcON , June 2 . " I am lodged , my dear friend , in the street aux Cleux , in the house of M. Chopelain , an upholsterer . I have two chambers sufficiently large , and convenient enc ugh ; but a sorry view upon the street , and upon a small ugly court , has replaced the lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my window a year ago . I wished yesterday to see the environs I found the stagnant Sarthe and some quite fertile fields . By dint of search I found a little shade in an arbor of apple-trees . The city is very badly built ; it has a passable public garden , and quite a number of comfortable landlords . To judge by certain vague indications , the Alen*onians are very good people , somewhat curious , but very innocently so . I do not believe them to be litigants , Normands as they are , for their courthouse is only half constructed . The cathedral is large , with painted windows ; but the interior is half Gothic and half bad Greek . I heard a priest there preaching to some children . He cried loud enough , but I did not understand one word of his beautiful discourse : it was nevertheless in French , but delivered according to the custom of Normandy . " I am enamored of Paris ; there is a good portion of myself in that city which I always wished to hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have not received the response of the Minister , yet I was expecting it much . I shall not cease to complain , should it be for no other reason than to remind them of their injustice . They like very well to see those they have persecuted resigned and silent : I shall not give them that pleasure . " Besides the works which we agreed upon , I ask of you , 1st , M. de Bonald , Ligi-dation Primitive ; ' 2d , M. de Ia Mennais de lIndiffirence ; 3d , Chfteaubriand de la Monarehie selon la ( iharte . " " ALENcON , June 11 . " Yesterday your two letters , that of the 3d and that of the 9th , reached me at the same time . I had need of them . The unea&amp;ness which I felt in receiving nothing from your dear person began to become anxiety . It would have been folly in you to make a journey when it is so warm . Do not be astonished in regard to the books which I ask you for ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of reasoning , and above all of feeling vividly my ideas , than the reading of works which combat the truth with a certain force . Besides , in those which I ask you for , one finds true and strong things by the side of the most deplorable sophisms . In a word , Bonald and La Mennais oblige me to rise from my chair , the fire in my face , and to walk in my chamber , assailed with a torrent of vivid and grand ideas . I feel more what I really am in reading the writings of our adversaries than in reading those of our friends ; for , in our friends , how certain things trouble me , ch grin me ! It is only the indignant man who can be true and strong , for indignation has nothing personal in it . I finished yesterday the " Esprit des Lois . " The last books , which had almost caused me ennui for twenty years , and even thirty , have been singularly pleasing to me this time . I found an explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Alen9on . How much time it takes to bring about an emancipation ! I yield to necessity , my friend ; but Alen*on is one of the saddest necessities of the eighty-four departments of the kingdom . I am so lonely l But tell me , ye unfortunate , is it not solitude that you need ? Yes , but not this . This is worth nothing to me . I know myself , and I feel that this banishment to Alen*on is a frightful misfortune to me . That which 1 needed was precisely that Arcueil of sweet memory , that solitude at the haven of Paris ; that alone remains to work for . But this is my last complain*t ; you shall have no more of it . Would- that I could finish by a eapilob in terza rime in praise of our dear Paris ! I keep for you your room ; you shall choose the apartment on the north side or that on the south side . I occupy the former during the day , and sleep in the latter . I am a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come , you and your Plato ; you shall be well received . But you shall come only when the journey can do you good ; understand me , when it can do you good ; cosi e non altrimenti . O my friend , I am convinced that your philosophy , in the present state of things , would bring great good to men . Are you not frightened to see in Europe great religious and moral truths abandoned almost without defense to the blows of two sorts of men equally opposed to the order and // prosperity of society ? Do you not see that victory , on either side , will be only an achievement against true liberty , the alliance of which with true morality is an imperishable law of eternal order ? Dear friend , in this strife of evil against good , in this contest between the two principles , ( but no ; evil is not a principle , it is only an act , ) it becomes one 's duty to make his voice heard when he has the consciousness of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation of Plato , have crossed your true career . . . . I , my friend , I have health , a tender heart which is full of warmth , an imagination made for that heart ; I have a just spirit , but no profindity ; and I have an education so defective , or , to speak more truly , I am so ignorant upon a great number of important points , that it becomes an almost insurmountable ob-tacle to most of the enterprises that I would undertake . I have without doubt a certain practice and a knowledge of the material of affairs which is rarely joined to an ardent imagination ; it is this which can make of me a citizen fit to serve my country during the storm and after the storm . But it is in a very differently exalted manner that you can serve human society . I , who have the consciousness of an indefinite lengthening of my moral existence , of my existence of will and freedom , who have it for you and for me ,  --  I earnestly desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your influence upon the prosperity of other passengers , no great good being without great rewar ( l . You see , my friend , that I love you well , and like a true devotee as I am . " The Congress of Florence does not cease to run through my head . There is something very odious in that abandonment of the Greeks to the more or less ready vengeance of the enemies of the Christian faith . " You have commenced the session of the Chambers by the discharge of pistols ; that is a touching imitation of English usages . You take what is best from your neighbors ; I compliment you for that . As for me , I confess to you that I would prefer that Alen*on should be somewhat more like Chester , Nottingham , or some other town of the British empire . Will M. Roger-Collard have occasion to confound his adversaries , as he did last winter ? I fear that he has not chosen a question worthy of him . Remember me to him : you know my feeling of preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adieu , my dear friend . I love you because you love me , because you are a Platonist , and because you are a Parisian , and still more for an occult reason which is worth more than all the others because it is not expressed . I felt it yesterday on receiving your two letters after some days of expectation . " " ALENCON , July 1 ' . " You recommend to me a commentary on and a refutation of the Contract Social . ' It is a fine idea , I own ; but I fear that the execution may not be within my power . I prefer to pursue my work commenced on governments . I am occupied in reading Daunou on Guaranties . This work has two distinct parts . In the first the author examines as to what constitutes liberty or guaranties ; he characterizes them , decomposes them , circumscribes them ; all that appears to me in general well conceived and well done . In the second part* it is sought in what manner different governments grant or limit these guaranties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In my work I shall refer this second pirt to a point of view rather practical than theoretical , and I shall enter into details for want of which the work of the orator resembles a book of geometry rather than one of politics . Perhaps I shall commence by publishing a small portion of my work ; for example , the conciliation of the guaranties which liberty claims with those which force claims , that is military organization , in a free government . It is only one point , it is true ; but do you not think , my friend , that the careful farming of a part of the territory that lies fallow is more useful for the advancement of science than a cultivation of the whole , the result of which would be uncertain ? There are without doubt geniuses of immense vigor who can lay hold of every thing , like Montesquieu ; but I am not one of those . Besides , ours is the time for culture by parcels . We are so far advanced that a vast enterprise , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not yet ripe for a great enterprise profoundly conceived and perfectly executed . If I could have cultivated well my lot , my dear friend , I should have deserved well of my fellow-men , and should have obtained sufficient reputation to assure and embellish my existence . 1 have also formed the project of a work on Circumstances ; but I fear that I shall not he able to execute it . I had some unwell days at the end of June . Do you know that myhead sometimes refuses to work ? I have also a troublesome rush of blood to the brain . Woe to me , if I do not take much exercise ! And I am yet quite young . I believe I shall be a long time young in tenderness of heart and in the enchantments of the imagination . Mv mother was only thirteen years old , and there is something in me that responds to this extreme youth of maternity . I feel that I am young , and that I am not completed . My heart alone received the finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sismondi wrote me a letter filled with kindness ? I have received also a letter from Fabvier , of whom I shall speak to you another time , and for a reason . " That letter of Fabvier , and the ennui which was visibly gaining on the poor prisoner , and , above aIl , , the need of seeing him again , determined me to go and rejoin him , in spite of my wretched health and the positive orders of my physician , M. Laenneck . I confided to no one my determination ; took the diligence , and rode fifty leagues day and night ; arrived in the most pitiable condition , but finally did arrive . I occupied one of Santa-Rosa 's two chambers , and we lived thus during a month in fi-aternal intimacy . I have often been sick ; more than once affectionate cares have been lavished on me : never have Ikuown such cares as those bestowed by him . It would be impossible // to describe the tenderness which he showed me , and henceforth I shall speak of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed our union . I could read in his soul , and he in mine , every feeling and every thought . There was manifested the last degree of confidence , and the veils which still covered the most delicate parts of our life were raised , as it were of their own accord , in those moments of abandon when the firmest souls , reposing in confidence , are no longer troubled with reserve . From that time our intimacy could not be increased , and took at once a character of sweetness and manliness which it always preserved , even during the long years of our separation .
