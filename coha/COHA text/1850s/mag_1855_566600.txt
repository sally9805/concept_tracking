txt ART . JX. - TIIE PERMANENCE OF THE PULPIT . " MAN , " says Vinet , " is the medium through which God has purposed that truth shall come to man . " " Christianity , a religion of thought , should be spoken . " Such , in fact , has been the conviction of men in every age of the Christian Church . Whatever their theories about the validity of sacraments , the nature of ordination , and the mode of introduction to the ministry , there has been a singular unanimity in respect to the divine appointment of preaching . The most zealous Romanists , and the High-Churchmen , who go to the farthest extreme in relying upon the efficacy of baptism and priestly absolution , do not forget to maintain that the ministry have authority to speak for Christ , however munch they underrate the importance of the comm*ssmon . And , on the other hand , the firmest opponent of every form of doctrine pertaining to an apostolical succession , has some theory that provides for the continuance of a preached gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters , suggestions about the inefficiency of the pulpit of the present day . Some think it has become sadly degenerate ; some fear it has been losing ground as compared with other agencies ; and many are sighing because it seems to accomplish so little good . Multitudes of ordained ministers have left the immediate work of preaching the Gospel . The statistical tables of the N. S. Presbyterian Church for 1854 , show that out of *fteen hundred ministers in this country , connected with that organization , upwards of three hundred and fifty are without a pastoral charge ; some of these are engaged in teaching and other professions ; some are superanuated , and some have suspended labor at midday . The number of those preparing to preach the Gospel is small when compared with the number of places needing an educated muinistry . And among the reasons that have led to // these results , we think one is to be found in a conviction , e.xtending through many minds , that other agencies are more effective than the pulpit in advancing the cause of Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be the great instrumentality in the conversion of the world to Christ , we think it important in this state of things to examine the basis of our confidence is the pulpit , and to enquire if it is indeed firm and reliable . Have we then , at the present day , reason for confidence in the preaching of the Gospel as distinguished from all other modes of Christian effort ? or have we reason to believe that the ministry can be superseded by some more efficient agency , and that the influence of the pulpit is on the wane ? Shall we prepare the way for our descendants to receive the preached Gospel , or shall we devise other means by which to keep them in the faith , and to extend the knowledge of Christ ? In answer to these inquiries , we propose to review the grounds that form the basis of our confidence in the preaching of the truth , as the great means of advancing the Saviour s kingdom upon the earth . I. The fret that the preaching of the Go* ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its permanent value a a means of grace . The fact itself needs no present demonstration . Our Saviour gave the commission to the eleven- " Go ye into all the world , and preach the Gospel to every creature : go ye , teach all nations , baptizing them-teaching them to observe all things which I have commanded you : and , ho , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world . " The inference from this fact is , that the preaching of the Gospel is designed to be continued till the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ . For surely , He who had chosen by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe , must know wl*at means will best promote his glory ? And whatever objections may be urged at the present day against the preaching of the Gospel as a means of convincing and converting men , might with equal validity be adduced against it in the first century of the Christian Church , for human nature is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . And if this was the plan of Infinite Wisdom then , why should we question the permanence of the arrangement ? God might have selected other means of teaching the truth . He might have caused the great facts of our Saviour 's life to be taught by dramatic representations . Pictures and images in countless variety might have been the ap // *pointed mode of bringing truth before the mind . Sacrificial offerings , akin to those presented before the advent , might have proclaimed a Saviour crucified instead of a Messiah yet to come . Man 's ingenuity might have been put to the test to represent before assembled congregations the fearfulness of the scene witnessed on Calvary , and thus to lead men to Christ . Or discarding all human instrumentality , God might have sent angels from their heavenly homes to whisper in the ear the secrets of eternity . But it pleased him to make choice of the preaching of the Gospel  --  the appeal of the living speaker , testifying of that which he knows ; and why should we not firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of his ways and the blessings of salvation . But some one asks , can we not suppose a change in the condition of mankind that shall make the preaching of the Gospel less important ? May not the progress of science and of art so alter the circumstances of men , ( if indeed it has not already done it , ) as to exalt other means of propagating the faith at the expense of this ? Are we shut up to the preaching of the Gospel ? have we not been told how the dreamer in Bedford jail prolongs his ministration through the printed page , and gains the attention of tens of thousands whom he never thought to address ? Have we not heard of the wonderful things the Lord hath wrought by the writings of Flavel , and of Baxter , and of Doddridge , and of a host of others , whose influence is extended by the press in every direction , and in circles ever widening ? And have we not here simply an indication of that which shall be ? May not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may we not fulfill its spirit and secure its great result , if remaining under our own vine and fig-tree , we simply send the printed Gospel to the remotest nations of the earth ? These questionings prepare the way for a second proposition : II . That the adaptation of preaching to the nature and mental habits of men confirms our confidence in its permanent value as a means of grace . There are three essential elements in the idea of a preached . Gospel . There must be ( 1 ) a living preacher ; ( 2 ) he must speak with direct application to an audience of his fellow men ; * and ( 3 ) he must announce salvation through Christ , with a personal experience of its reality and its value . Other things are incidental to these . It matters not , for example , when or where one speaks ; the enclosure of the sanctuary walls , and the hours of the Sabbath , are matters of convenience and propriety rather than of necessity , and they do not of themselves give efficiency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // preach Christ in a school-house or in a log-cabin , as faithfullyand as successfully as beneath a frescoed dome ; his words may be with power , whether spoken in the graveyard or in the grove - within prison walls , or by the river side-in the caves of the mountains , or on the wreck where all expect a watery grave . Nor is it es8ential that the preacher should have been set apart to the work of the ministry , or have been taught in the systems of the schools , or that he should hold rank , or office , or title , in the Church of Christ . In early days , when God was pleased to allow great persecution of His people at Jerusalem , they were all scattered abroad , and in their dispersion they went everywhere preaching the Word . But the three things spoken of as essential , are perfectly adapted to human nature . Men like to look upon the living speaker , to catch the expression of his countenance , to hear the utterance of his own lips . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may rivet their minds and compel their attention *n a way which no printed volume can do . The love of eloquence has not died away . Men are as fond of it now as they were in the days of IDemosthenes . TIe that can speak well has power with the people . And there is nothing that can take the place of his personal address . Men may read the printed report of a speech , but they will do it wishing they had been present to hear for themselves , and all the while they will be striving to ' recall the expression , the manner , the tones of the orator , and tasking their imagination to reproduce the scene . A striking illustration of this is seen in the eagerness manifested in *ew York last Spring to hear Mr. Sumner . his manly , earnest address , delivered there before an audience of thousands , was at once published and widely circulated in two or three of the leading city papers . But before a week had passed , once and again assemblies equally large were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech repeated , word for word , by the man himself . An enthusiasm had been awakened which demanded the presence of the living orator . What advocate would prefer to print his speech and send it to the jury to read at their leisure ? What political orator would not choose to meet face to face with those whose opinions he would modify , and whose prejudices he would remove ? Who that has a point to carry , does not deem it important to see that his words reach the mark , and to correct at once all misunderstanding , by repetition , by illustrations , and by varied forms of expression ? Again , the sympathy between a speaker and his audience , as well as the sympathy prevailing among his hearers and rciicting // 439 1855. upon himself , gives power to the preaching of the Gospel . The words of an orator have greater effect when men are assembled , and he is aiming to produce an immediate result . It is not siml*old desire to save time and labor that leads the politicians*o mass meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of men to feel as those around them feel . And when one addresses a crowded and attentive and excited assembly , and rouses them by his eloquence , the circumstances react upon him ; he is inspired with new zeal , and rises above his own level . Such , without question , has been true in respect to the most powerful productions of the pulpit . The preaching of the Gospel is not a mere reading of essays , indefinite and without aim and point ; but it is the announcement and enforcement of truth ; and that truth , however men may disregard it , is vitally important to them ; nothing more so : so that when they come to look at it without prejudice , and sometimes even in spite of every prejudice , they find it has demands upon their thoughts and affections whichi they can not cast off . This truth , faithfully , affectionately presented , and meeting with a response in the still small voice of conscience , is an essential element in the preached Gospel , and make this ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another element of power results from the fact that the work of preaching the truth is committed to those who have a personal experience of its value . The first preachers of the Christian faith testified of the things which they themselves had witnessed ; and their successors , having the same spirit of faith , and having learned the same truths in the experience of their souls , can say , " We also believe and therefore speak ; we speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen . " It is no utterance of vague conjectures , no dramatic rehearsal , no formal recitation , no vain babbling , that corresponds to our ideas of preaching God 's truth . There must be sincere conviction based upon divine testimony and confirmed by actual trial of its value , and when this exists , he who preaches is in a position to win the confidence of men and to speak with power . But imot to dwell longer on this point , we think the common sense of every one decides that the pulpit has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where is the congregation that would seem it possible to maintain its organization for any length of time , and to extend its influence and enlarge its sphere , without the stated preacing of the Gospel ? Where is the most zealous advocate of the power of the press that in times of special awakening would be satisfied // to silence every public exhortation , and to carry on the work by a judicious distribution of tracts ? And where is the benevolent association which has any great hope of securing the attentive regard and the contributions of Christians at large , without resorting to pulpit appeals , made either by its itinerant agents , or by the pastors and preachers statedly ministering to the churches :  --  or that in place of anniversary exercises* with powerful thrilling speeches from the most fervent and eloquent of living orators , would be content with the silent perusal of select passages from its annual report ? And what society even , whose interest it is to magnify the power of the press , does not seek access to the pulpits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its power , and of persuading them to give ? But that this may not appear to be mere theorizing , let us direct our attention to a third fact : III . The history of the progress of christianity gives us ground of confidence in the efficiency and permanent value of the preaching of the Gospel . From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of Christ has been advanced most rapidly by public addresses to the assembled congregations . The forerunner of the Messiah , proclaiming that the kingdom of heaven was at hand , attracted great multitudes to the wilderness from Jerusalem and all the region round about ; and they were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins . Our Saviour spoke sometimes to the select company of his chosen Apostles , and sometimes to thousands whom his fame had gathered , and who bore testimony that never man spake as lie spake ; and of these , many , whose numbers no man knoweth , believed on him . He left his followers the commission to preach his Gospel everywhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardships , to persecution and death , but preaching with boldness and with success , until Christianity within half a century had gained a foothold in almost every nation , and the foundations were laid of a spiritual temple , which has been rising higher and higher , and against which no device of Satan can prevail . It is believed that wherever Christianity has made rapid progress , it has been owing mainly to the preaching of the truth . Other means have come in as auxiliary , but this has been the grand power . In modern days the greatest triumphs of the missionary enterprise have been pained in connection with the voice of the living preacher . Tracts and books have been serviceable , but they have not been the most efficient means ; when thrice *50,000 volumes had been distributed in // China , it was stated on the best authority , that " so far as was known hardly an instance had occurred of a Chinese coming to a missionary to have any passage explained , nor any person converted who attributed his interest in religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar testirn*iy might be brought resfrecting like efforts elsewhere . Says one man in our own land , t " I have put the Sabbath documents into every family in town , and never seen any results ; I have put Alleine 's Alarm into every family in town and never seen any results ; I have put the Missionary papers , the American Messenger and the Christian Almanac into every family in town , and never seen any results . " The Bible Societies of Christendom have published and circulated in half a century past upwards of forty millions of copies of the Scriptures , enough , if properly apportioned , to furnish one Bible or Testament to every five families on the face of the earth ; and this in addition to all the copies published by private enterprise , and thQse issued by royal authority , and the innumerable volumes containing comments in addition to the text . But many a person into whose hand a Bible is put allows it to remain unopened on his shelf , or to be a mere ornament to his parlor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sends him with a troubled heart to consult God 's book respecting the way of life . The influence and the value of the press are beyond all estimate ; but prone as the heart is to evil and hating the light lest its deeds be reproved , there is ordinarily need of the faithful admonition of the pulpit , and of its earnest exhortation , before the ungodly will consent to read a volume on practical piety . No one will question that the colporteur enterprise in this country has accomplished great good in the past ten years , but no small portion of its results is due to the attempt to preach the Gospel in connection with the circulation of printed truth . It is so far forth the work of an uneducated ministry . To a considerable extent , too , the Sabbath School system relies upon this agency , adapting the preaching to the comprehension of the young , and imparting sprightliness to it by means of anecdotes ahd narrative . The recently devised plans for ragged schools or boys ' meetings are but another modification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , originally formed to secure the distribution of tracts , employs no * The Middle Kingdom , ii , 343. j Quoted in a most valuable " Report on home Evangelization " made to the General Conference of Maine , and printed in the Minutes of the Conference for 1854. // less than a dozen lnis8ionariee , whose aggregate salaries are perhaps tenfold the amount appropriated for tracts . The ministry have not always been equally earnest or devout , but as they have been , so has been the Christianity of the age , and perhaps the influence of the pulpit is seen in nothing more distinctly than in this , that a church rarely fails to i'eflect the image and character of one who has long ministered to it in holy things Such then are the strong foundations of our confidence in the preachinq of the Gospel as the great means of advancing the knowledge of Christ among men . It is divinely appointed , it is obviously adapted to the wants of human nature , and its efficiency has been already proved . It will doubtless continue till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear that at the present day this means of grace his but little success , or that the influence of the pulpit has suffered great diminution , we might find our confidence shaken , or might have surmisings that the institution of the ministry is out of date , or at least in need of some radical change to increase its efficiency . But this is a view which does not commend itself to our judgment . We choose rather to say , IV . That the present success of the preached Gospel , though not all we could desire , is such as to confirm and not to weaken our confidence in its permanent value as a means of grace . There is an admission here that the efficiency of the pulpit is not as great as the friends of Christ can wish ; that the laborers do not secure as much of the ripening harvest as we should expect ; and that the success of the ministry is not uniform but various . But we think that a comparison of this generation with former ones does not indicate such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any apparent present weakness and inefficiency may be accounted for , without at all reflecting upon the agency which God has seen fit to employ in bringing souls to salvation . It is admitted , then , that the preaching of the Gospel does not accomplish all that we ( lesire . This conviction rests with its greatest pressure on one who surveys the whole period of his ministry , and recalls to mind the sad refusal of many to hear the voice of instruction and to seek for peace with God . The warning which he has given has been without effect ; the offer of salvation has been unheeded ; the story or Christ 's love has been like an idle tale . JTe knows that he has the truth by which men are to be led to Christ ; he knows that with all patience and long suffering lie has expounded // the Scriptures ; he knows that notwithstanding great imperfections and weakness , and fear and trembling , he has yet son gift to declare the whole counsel of God , and to preach the Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear , he is constrained to say , " Lord , who hath believed our reiJort , and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed ? * And his lamentation goes forth responsive to that of his divine Master " how often would I have gathered thy children together and ye would not ! " And one may feel this weight not merely in respect to the general course of his ministry , but also in respect to particular effort . The discourse on which he has spent time and labor , seems to lose its influence as the sound of his voice dies away . Even while he speaks , his ardor awakens no emotion , and the vacant gaze and listless manner of one and another , show too plainly that with some it matters not what he says . And as the congregation is dispersed , he sees no reason to believe that the truth he has preached will be a controlling and ever-present power during the busy days of the week . And in such circumstances one would be inclined to ascribe the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the evil was a wide-spread one , and that others had the same experience with himself In addition to this , the fathers whom we honor and who stand between us and a past generation , tell us of the giants whom they revered in their youth-men full of the holy Ghost and of power ; and they mourn and weep because of the degeneracy of these latter days . They tell us that among the living occupants of the pulpit , few can be found to compare with the great preachers of the past ; that the position and work of the ministry is less respected than formerly ; that once religion had a recognized place in the instructions of the common school ; that courts of justice were opened with prayer ; that at the close of service the congregation remained standing in token of respect , as their minister passed down the broad aisle ; that the young were trained to look with most profound reverence upon the preacher of the Gospel ; and that the marked change in these respects is convincing proof that the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are led by these suggestions to take up and read again the precious narratives that show with how great power God hath been pleased in times past to clothe some of his chosen servants. * We read of Shepard , whose success in the ministry was so great that as people returned from service , the question most likely to be asked was , " who hath been wrought upon to-day ? " // S We read of Edwards preaching at Enfleld from his writt*n notes and with his composed manner , when " there was such a breathing of distress and weeping that he was compelled to speak to the people and desire silence , that he might be heard . " We read of Whitefield , followed by crowds from place to place , speaking to large assemblies in every town , addressing twentylive thousand on Boston common , and uniformly preaching with power so that the careless were awakened and converted , and the people of God edified . And when we turn from thoughts of these and of others who seemed so constantly to have spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quietness with which the Gospel message is now delivered and received , we are tempted to admit at once , without questioning the assertion , " that the effectiveness of the pulpit , in comparison with other efficiencies , has declined among us to an alarming extent , within the last fifty years . " And yet we may deceive ourselves as we look back on past generations and attempt to compare them with our own . We may look only at the bright lights and forget the dark shades . The preaching of any age is not to be judged simply by the eloquence and success of a few men like Edwards and the Tennants . If the records of New England history contain evidence of the successful ministry of a Shepard , they disclose also other scenes of barrenness , as when such a man as Hopkins saw his church at Newport so much reduced as to have only thi'ee male members , and his congregation but a mere handful . If there was a great awakening a hundred years ago , it came at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal piety was not deemed essential for church-membership , and when the churches and even the ministry were filled with unconverted persons . And the half century succeeding that awakening , was a period of marked religious declension . When the era of modern revivals began , about sixty years ago , the land was threatened with infidelity , youthful piety was hardly thought of as possible ; the assembly upon the Sabbath was the only religious gathering of the week , and every prospect was dark and gloomy . In respect to the condition of religious mattei 's at that time , we quote from a writer whose own memory extended back to not a few of the years of the last century , and whose testimony is reliable . He says , ( Christian Spect. v , 210 , ) " It was not till within a few months previous to the memorable era just referred to , that we ever heard of such a thing in the whole circle of parishes of which we had a personal knowledge , as a sinner being in great anguish of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first case of the kind // which came to our knowledge , needed to be explained not only to us , but to others also who had then passed the middle period of life . It was extensively regarded as a wonderful and almost a frightful phenomenon ; and was properly accounted for by only a few of the people , and those chiefly advanced in age , who had either witnessed similar cases in the days of Whitefield , or gained some just views of their nature from books or from tradition . " And the same writer in assigning some of the causes of the religious declension in New England during the latter half of the eighteenth century , subsequently remarks , " The pulpit was in some degree answerable for the decline of religion in those times . * * There was too little thorough investigation . There was not a suitable adjustment of topics to the state , either of the whole congregation or of individuals , who needed respectively a portion of meat in due season . Their preparation for the pulpit was made generally on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter half of that day . Their discourses were crowded with too many particulars which , although not perhaps altogether irrelevant , were frequently trite and unessential. * * That was an age , also , in which the pulpit was peculiarly barren of iliustratwn. * * * The ministers to whom we have referred , discarding , as most of them did , the agreeable and quickening stimulus of copious illustration , were formal and dull in their manner , and produced little impression on the minds of their hearers . * * That we have not overstated this defect in a large proportion of the ministrations of that day , will be obvious to all who have been conversant with the printed and manuscript sermons which have come down from those times ,  --  to all who shall make due inquiry on the subject of the most intelligent of aged people now living , and indeed , to all those who have a distinct recollection of very many of the worthy ministers who , in a good old age , departed to their rest before the commencement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From these defects , it is easy to infer that the power of the Christian pulpit was exceedingly weakened as to its practical effect . * * That there were almost no revivals in that long period was owing , we believe , among other causes , to the lamentable want of those qualities in the selection and presentation of revealed truth , which are essential to its highest utility , as God 's most appropriate instrument in subduing the world to himself . " ( Quart . Chr . Spect. v , 220-224 . ) And in additon to this , it must be remembered that we might speak the names of living men , or of others who have ful*lled their ministry in these latter days , who have met with success // in the pulpit hardly less than that of the most noted among the preachers of former generations . Why then should we say the former days are better than these ? In all ages men have mourned over the barrenness of their ministry . In all ages they have wept because so few believed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when our posterity come to compare this age with those that have preceded it , when due regard is had to the protracted era of revivals , and to the innumerable conversions under a plain and pungent preaching of the truth ; to the earnest Christian effort and the liberal benefactions which have come in response to the appeals of the pulpit ; to the prosecution of the missionary work at home and abroad ; to the advance of the temperance reformation and of other philanthropic plans ; to the utterances for human liberty and human rights ; - whien regard is had to all these things with which the ministry has had so much to do , we think it will not be the judgment of posterity that the pulpit has lost its power , or has become sadly degenerate in the execution of its work . But while we thus speak , the admission of the fact that the preaching of the Gospel does not accomplish all that we desire , calls for some explanation of the failure that will not reflect upon time value of the institution itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great . The tm*uth must often exert a noiseless invisible influence . It is likened to seed : and as that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die , so the truth , to be most powerful , must enter into the heart , and not remain upon the surface . He who casts his bread upon the waters must be content if he finds it after many days . And since lie that planteth is nothing , neither he that watereth , and since the harvest for which they both labor is not theirs but the Lord 's , it will be no strange thing if they sometimes fail to see how much of the result is really due to their work . Again , it is not to be expected that the ministration of the Gospel will always convert them that hear it . The discourse that at one time deeply moves an audience and melts them to tears , may at another time be entirely without visible results . While the preacher of the Gospel is a savour of life to some , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard our Saviour , believed the Gospel ; and the young ruler that came so eagerly to ask what he must do , was soon willing to return to his former life . But God 's dealings with men will be justified , and his love be made manifest , even though all should refuse to come // to Him for life . It was no fault of the servants that the persons bidden to the great supper refused to come . Again , individual characteristics of the ministry will tell on the results of the preached Gospel . If in any case there is a low degree of piety , it will weaken the power of the pulpit . If one lacks confidence in the instrumentality given to him , his words will fail to be with power . If he is not prepared for the work assigned him , or if he can not vary the style alJ ( l character of his preaching , so as in some measure to meet the varying wants of his audiences , there will be less good accomplished and less efficiency shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richest wisdom . Aud if he is tasked beyond measure by the frequency of his labors and the urgency of his work , he may be inadequte to the task of preaching with power . But individual deficiencies of this character , however numerous , should not hupair our confidence in the superiority of the means which divine wisdom has selected fiw proclaiming the knowledge of salvation . It has pleased God , by the foolishness of preaching , to save them that believe . Again , when the influence of the preached Gospel seems to us quite small , we must take into account the fact that so few are brought statedly and regularly under its power . Congregations otten have been content to have preaching , without putting them.9elves to much trouble to secure an audience . Preachers have been too well satisfied with having congregations ot respectable size , even if vastly greater numbers were left unprovided for , or were never asked to come to the house of God . Hence their ministrations so generally have reference to those accustomed to the sound of the Gospel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address again . Under other circumstances they would preach differently . A large majority of our population do not , statedly , hear the preaching of tl** Gospel . IMlultitudes live and ( lie without hearing a discourse full of the truth of the Gospel , which they are able to understand . A recent investigation of fhcts in the State of Maine shows , that while more than half the people of every town might attend public worship , less than one-fourth do ordinarily attend . Two hundred and teu persons out of every thousand make up the various religious assemblies of all shades of belief and of doubt , and the other seven hundred and ninety persons of every thousand are as regularly absent from every place where worship is professedly offered to God . Here , then , we have reason to complain , not of the inefficiency of preaching , but of the neglect to go out to the highways and hedges and persuade men to listen to the Gospel . If , now , in every town and city , there // were more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in respect to plans for home evangelization ; if there was more earnest and more constant effort to bring the masses outside of the churches under the influence of the preached Gospel , the power of the pulpit , with God 's blessing , would be*iii to be apparent even as in the days of Bunyan or of Whiteileld . And whenever any community awakes to effort for home evangelization , the preaching of the Gospel will be the means above all others to promote their ends . Again , the pulpit may have lost power , apparently but not really , in the breaking up of social restraints , which results from sudden changes of population , and immigration from foreign lands , and fluctuations of wealth . One effect of this is , that men act out their character with greater freedom and boldness than was their wont . The prediction is fulfilled that many shall run to and fro , and that knowledge shall be increased . The minister is no longer the oracle.11 e is respected less officially than personally . What he says is subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastery ; and sometimes it may seem for the interest of each to disparage the ministering of the other . And there are apostles of error , wolves in sheep 's clothing , who bring contempt upon the Gospel by their false doctrine . But in all this there is nothing that can undermine the foundations of the truth , or build up a permanent barrier against it . It was long ago foretold that the time would come when men would not endure sound doctrine ; but after their own lusts should heap to themselves teachers , having itching ears ; and should turn away their ears from the truth , and be turned unto fables . Still the truth is powerful , and the weapons of our warfare are mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds . There is 1 ) 0 reason here why we should not desire to have more laborers gathering in the harvest . Again , the fact that this is an age of intense excitements presents a reason why the pulpit does not exert a unif*rm power . We live and act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hither and thither under the influence of strong emotion . Sometimes they are carried away with religious excitement and then they are left high and dry upon the shore as the wave of emotion recedes . No two things can monopolize the mind at once . Strong excitement respecting slavery , or intemperance , or local politics , is unfavorable to the influence of the truth ; denominational zeal may run so high as to interfere with godliness ; and the race for wealth in which so many competitors are found , carries many a man out of the // 449 reach of the Gospel . With such excitements , preaching is heard only by sufferance , and the moment it is over , the thoughts fly away to other themes . And yet this is only admitting that the heart of men is fully set in them to do evil ; that it is deceitful above all things , and to be despaired of for its wickedness . But how shall such hearts be reached if not by the kind warning of dano'er and the announcement of glad tidings by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has proved ? Finally , the influence of the periodical press upon public Opinion seems at times to rival the influence of the pulpit . This has suddenly come to be one of the greatest forces operating on society . Its influence for evil or for good is incalculable . The prejudices and partialities which are fostered by a newspaper w hichh as been regularly read for years , become deeply rooted in the mind : the tone of the paper may change , its character may vary , new editors may supplant former ones , but unless the transition be too abrupt , its opinion will be adopted , its word will be believed , its guidance followed . Is it possible , then , for the periodical press to exert an influence for evil which shall make preaching powerless ? or to exert an influen ce for good which shall make it unnecessary ? Whatever might be accomplished if all those connected with the press were arrayed against Christianity , it is obvious that any attack now made can be resisted with the same weapons . The press may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eate prejudice against the pulpit ; but it is under too great restraints to carry such Opposition very far . Public opinion controls the pi*ess in many points quite as much as the press directs and moulds it ; and public opinion is in favor of the institutions of the Gospel ; so that before any successful thrust can be made against the pulpit , the whole current of public sentiment must be turned aside . There is reason to hope , however , that the great battle is over , and that Christianity has won the day . Once the secular press ignored religion , but of late years it has come more and more to recognize Christianity as a fact . IN ow the proceedings of religions meetings are extensively reported , and sermons , ordinary and extraordinary , find a place in the columns of the daily newspaper , to be scattered most widely through the land . Can it then supplant the pulpit , and prove it more efficient and more economical as a means of good ? A sectarian journal can not , because it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already committed to its views . The secular press can not espouse and defend the minor peculiarities of belief ; or be de // voted mainly to religious instruction . Nor can a paper conducted by way of compromise between denominations accomplish this , because each one would feel that some supplementary views must be added by the living teacher . In fine , then , however great the power of the periodical press to mould the mind , and to combine and unite public sentiment , it can not supersede the utterance ot the heart through the lips . Politicians do not expect this of it . They rely , and they must rely , on the power of eloquence ; and so must it be with religion . God 's way is the best way . The press shall he the auxiliary of the pulpit . But first arid foremost in our efforts to advance the kingdom of our Lord , we will follow His example and preach the Gospel . The feet ot the messengers that bring good tidings of good shall stand on every hill-top . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the story of redeeming love . Unman lips shall perform a duty which angels would gladly undertake ; and while each laborer stands at his post of duty , there shall go up from every quarter of the world the glad song of " Harvest Home .
