txt ALTHOUGH the work before us is somewhat out of date , the subject of it is one of perpetual interest ; and although we can not plead for amusements precisely after the manner of Mr. Sawyer , we shall hope to speak in accordance with the Scriptures , and with the views of enlightened and serious Christians . In the life of our Savior , we have an example entirely to onr purpose ; and with a consideration of it , we commence the discussion . When he had called and charged his twelve apostles , he sent them forth to teach and preach in the villages of Judea and Galilee . " And they went out and preached that men should repent . And they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them . " Their mission accomplished , the apostles returned unto Jesus , and made report . " They told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught . And he said unto them , Come ye yourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat . " Christ called his disciples originally , and he calls them now , to ialor in his service . His language to them is : " Go , work in my vineyard . " But when they have worked , until the necessities of nature require relaxation , he then permits and commands tbem to rest . It is as much their duty to rest , under such circumstances , as it is to work , under others . It is as really a sin to over-work in the service of Christ , as to nuder-work . It may not be so common a sin . It may not be one into which , in this lazy , trifling world , we are so likely to fall . Still , we have no more right to violate the laws of our being ( which are the laws of God ) one way than the other ; and the violation of them in either way is sure to bring its penalty along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of our Savior for seasonable re8t . And his teachings on this subject are in strict accordance with those of the Scriptures generally , and with those of nature . The God of Nature has not only made work an indispensable condition of living comfortably in this world , but he has made abundant provision also for rest . Every morning has its evening , and every day its night , when weary // mortals are constrained , by the very necessities of their nature , to repose , to rest . iRest may be total , as in quiet sleep ; or only partial , as in gentle , agreeable relaxation , diversion , or recreation . We use these three terms , not because they are of precisely the same import , but because , in their several imports , they are all equally to our purpose . Relaxation implies continuance of labor , but with less of vigor , with less intensity of application . And this constitutes a species of rest . It is often all the rest we need . Diversion implies , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jaded mind or the weary body from some particular kind of effort , which has become wasting and injurious , to some other kind which is lighter , easier , more agreeable . Thus the student , wearied in the investigation of a difficult subject , diverts his mind by light reading , or by some easy and pleasant occupation . And the tired laborer diverts himself by some agreeable change of employment . Diversion is a relief and blessing to us , in every period of our lives . The secret of managing peevish , crying children *s , not to scold them , but to divert them . Turn off the little troubled mind from the worrying thought , or the painful object , and fix it upon something else . This is the only mode of rclieving a certain class of diseased minds . The monomaniac , for example , has occupied himself so constantly with some engrossing subject ; he has thought so much of it , and talked so much , and felt so deeply , that he can now think of nothing else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become absorbed in it , and can not rid himself of it . He has no longer the control of his own thoughts and feelings . Now the only way to relieve such a person is , to d'tvert Aiim . Change the scene ; introduce him to new and diverting objects ; draw his thoughts and his sensibilities , if possible , out of the deep channels in which they have been running ; and the diseased mind will soon recover , a normal , healthy action will ere long be restored . We used the term recreation in this connection . This is of more general import than either of those above defined . It denotes primarily an end , a result , but more commonly the means of producing such result . A recreation is literally a restoring of the exhausted mind or body to that state of health and vigor which had been temporarily lost . But the term is more commonly used to denote some pleasing , invigorating , health-giving exercise , by which such restoration is effected . It may be a walk , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation , a change of scene or employment . A diversion gene rally operates as a recreation , though every recreation is not a diversion . And the // same remark may be made with respect to relaxation . IRecreation , as we said , is the more general term , including under it the other two . With this necessary definition of terms , we come back to the example of our Savior . When he directed his disciples to turn aside , and rest a while , he did not intend , probably , a total rest . He did not wish them to lie down and go to sleep . Certainly , he did not limit them to such a rest as this . What he intended was , that they should take time , after their severe labor , to recreate , to recruit , to invigorate and strengthen their wasted powers , and thus prepare for greater usefulness . How he would have them spend their season of recreation , we can not now say . Perhaps in agreeable conversation , in reconuting past experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receiving new lessons of instruction . In some way , he would have them recreate and refresh themselves , and prepare for new scenes of labor and usefulness . Recreations , then , of the right kinds , and within proper limits , are not only permitted to us , but enjoined upon us . They are enjoined by the very necessities of our nature . They are enjoined by the authority of our Savior . They are as really our duty as prayer , or praise , or study , or preaching , or anything else . Thus much , we think , may be safely said in behalf of needful recreations . We now advance a step , and inquire whether the same can be said in behalf of amusements . TY14at are amu8ement8 ? Much depends on the idea attached to this term . Some writers ( among whom is Mr. Sawyer ) regard amusements and recreations as the same . They use the words interchangeably . And if this be correct , then the same authority may be pleaded for them both . But is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same ? We think not . There seems to us to be a wide difference between them  --  a difference indicated both in the etymology of the words , and in their more general and respectable use . We know not indeed , that anyfull line of distinction can be drawn between e*eternal act8 , leaving all amusements on the one side , and recreations on the other . Such a line might be drawn , we think , a certain way ; but whether it could be carried entirely through , it is not material to inquire . The distinction on which we would chiefly insist , is internal . lit lies not so much in the outward act , as in the motive , the o4jeet , the end in view . A recreation , from the very structure and meaning of the word , is something which recruits , restores , and prepares the man for better service , and should be engaged in , always , with this end in view . But an amusement , in its motive , is quite another thing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to engage in pleasurable occupation , not so much to be invigorated and benefited , as to be amused  --  to be gratified , in other words , for the mere pleasure of it . Such is amusement , in the strict and proper acceptation of the term ; amusement , as distinct from needful recreation . And such it is confessed to be , by those , in general , who pursue it . Ask that young man who was out almost the whole of the last night at the ball-room , or the bowling-alley , or at some other place of amusement , and who got up late this morning , with parched lips , and an aching head , and a fluttering pulse , whether he went there for the purpose of recruiting and restoring exhausted nature , and whether such has been the effect of his debauch upon him . He will tell you , if he is honest , that the powers of nature , so far from being recruited , have been wasted , and that he had good reason to expect beforehand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusements , not to be recruited and strengthened , but to be pleased . He went for the enjoyment of it , from motives of personal gratification . And the young lady who danced till four o'clock this morning , will , if she is honest , confess the same . Her amusement , she knows did not recruit nature , but exhausted it . It did her no real good , either physically or morally , nor did she expect beforehand that it would . But she went to be pleased . She went from motives of personal gratification . Such , then , are amusements ; and such is the manner in which they differ from needful , laudable recreations . In external act , they differ frequently ; there being many amusenients which can never be resorted to for purposes of recreation . In purpose , in motive , they differ always ; the motive of the latter being to recruit and restore , and thus prepare for greater usefulness ; the motive of the former being a love of pleasure , or the desire of personal gratification. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : Are amusements authorized in the Scriptures ? There is authority , we have seen , for recreations . Is there like authority for amusements ? And if so , where are we to look for it ? You will say , perhaps , in the Old Testament ; and in proof of it will refer us to the annual festivals of the Israelites ; and to other great and joyful occasions , in which they were accustomed to sing and to dance . * Very frequently , the same external acts or courses of action change their character with a change of motive , and from being recreations , become amusements . Thus a student participates in a game of ball , or of quoits , as a recreation . It is needful for him , and he has no other object or end in view . But he soon becomes attached to the game , and pursues it far beyond what the purposes of recreation require . He pursues it for the mere pleasure of it . It has now ceased to be a recreation , and become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were seasons of pleasant recreation , and of devout religious worship and instruction . They drew the people together from all parts of the land , and werd well calculated to render them not only pious , but social and happy . But there was nothing in them , so far as we have been able to discover , of the nature of amusements , properly so called . Certainly there was not , as they were instituted , and before they had been perverted and abused . On occasions of great rejoicing , the Israelites were accustomed to sing and to dance ; but then their dances were not for amusement . On the contrary , they were a part of their religious worship . Such was the dancing of Miriam and her associates , on the shore of the Red Sea. * Such was the dancing of David , when he brought home the ark of God . Such is the dancing referred to by the Psalmist , when he says : " Praise God with the timbrel and the dance . " " Let them praise his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of religious worship- " praising God ; " and is no authority whatever for dancing as an amusement . It is remarkable , that wherever dancing is spoken of in the Bible , except as a religious exercise , some mark of reprobation is usually put upon it . Witness the following passage from Job : " They send forth their little ones like a flock , and their children dance . . . . Therefore , they say unto God , Depart from us , for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways . " Witness the dancing of the daughter of ilerodias , which pleased ilerod , and resulted in the murder of John the Baptist . But to return to the subject : Where , we ask again , are awusements , in the proper sense of the term authorized in the Scriptures ? If any one can tell us , we will gladly listen to him ; for we do not know where . iLet him give us the chapter and verse . But we go farther , and insist that amusements , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spirit , in motive , they are contrary to some of the cardinal requisitions of the Bible . They are so , in that they are 8elfsh . Amusement , we have said , is the pursuit of pleasure , for pleasure 's sake , or it is the plunging into pleasurable courses , for the mere sake of personal enjoyment . And is not this selfish ? We regard avarice and covetousness as selfish , in that they are the love of gain , for the personal gratification which gain affords ; and ambition is accounted selfish , in that it is the love of power , for the same reason ; must not amusements then be accounted // selfish , in that they are the love and pursuit of pleasure , for the same reason ? Personal gratification lies at the bottom of all alike . This is the ruling motive in all alike , and how shall the conclusion be resisted , that this motive constitutes them all alike selfish ? But selfishness , if not the very essence of sin , is , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct opposition to that cardinal and universal law , which requires us to love God , and not ourselves , with a supreme affection . Besides , how are amusements , in the sense explained , to be reconciled with Scriptures such as these ? " Whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as unto the lord . " " Whether ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God . " " Wherefore , glorify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God 's . " Amusements are the pursuit of pleasurable courses for personal gratification-for pleasure 's sake . But the Scriptures forbid us to do anything from such a motive . Whatever we do , we are to do it as unto the Lord . Whether we eat , or drink , or whatsoever we do , we are to do all to the glory of God . And as amusements are in spirit and motive sinful , so their tendencies , it is believed , are always evil . The tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under proper limitations , is good , and only good . It is essential to health , happiness , usefulness , we had almost said to life itself . But amusements being of another nature , their fruits are of another kind . They are of the opposite kind , as their history abundantly shows . The expense of amusements-their pecuniary expense-is enormous . We will not undertake to compute it ; it is more than the world can well bear . But great as this expense may be it is not the heaviest bill incurred . The expense to reputation , to usefulness , to health , to life , is much greater . How many fair characters have been forfeited , how many bright prospects have been clouded and blasted , how many good constitutions have been ruined , how many valuable lives have been thrown away , in the pursuit of fashionable amusements . And then the effect of amusements upon the spiritual interests of those who engage in them is to be taken into the account withdrawing the thoughts from God and things divine , dissipating serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieving away the Holy Spirit . The amusements of men , at some periods , have been characterized by the utmost barbarity and cruelty . The gladiatorial shows of the ancients , where men mangled and butchered each other for the gratification of thousands and tens of thousands of spectators ,  --  these were choice amusements in their day . And // bull-baitings , and bear-baitings , and horse-racings , and cockfightings , involving the greatest cruelty to animals , and resulting often in broils and murders ,  --  these are choice amusements now . The excitement , the interest of them is intense . They so lire the soul and stir the blood , as to render all other amusements worthless . But it will be said that no one pleads for amusements such as these , but only for such as are decent and harmless . And yet if you plead for amusement , in the proper sense of the word , at all , you plead for that which is of the same essential nature as these . You plead for that which , if left to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , or to that which is worse . The natural tendency of amusements , as of every other form of sin , is downward . You engage in what you call a decent amnsement now , for the mere pleasure of it , or from motives of self-gratification . But soon you are cloyed with that ; it ceases to gratify . And now you must have something else , and something of a little stronger and more stirring character ; and when you are cloyed with that , you must have something a little more stirring still , and thus you go on , and go down from one thing to another , till very soon , if not restrained , you reach the bottom . You become a pleasure-hunter of the lowest class . Much labor has been expended in endeavoring to show what amusements are innocent , and what injurious ; what should be tolerated , and what condemned . But no clear line of distinction has ever been drawn , or ever can be ; and for the very good reason that none exists . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thorough , radical distinction ; reaching to the end , the motive , the object of each ; making the former , under the proper conditions , not only harmless but useful , and consigning the latter to selfishness and sin . This is the distinction which we have endeavored to set forth and illustrate , and of the validity of which our readers will judge . There will be objections undoubtedly to the views which have been presented , some of which it is proposed now to consider . It will be said , perhaps , that if the God of the Bible prohibits amusements , the God of nature tolerates and encourages them , and thus natural and revealed religion are set at variance . But how shall it be made to appear that the God of nature tolerates and encourages what we have defined as amusements ? That the God of nature has not shown himself indifferent to the happiness of his creatures , but has made provision for their happiness in a thousand ways , we rejoice to believe ; and that it is lawful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so liberally imparts , we as fully believe . But all this comes vastly short of // our entering on the direct pursuit of pleasure , for the niere sake of personal enjoyment . God has kindly made the gratification of our appetites a source of pleasure to us , and we are bound thankfully to accept the pleasure which is thus afforded . We may do this , and yet eat and drink to the glory of God . But when we indulge our appetites for the mere sake of indulgence , then we stand on a different footing , we become epicures at once . God has also endowed us with external and internal senses , and he has so ordered things in the worlds of matter and of mind , that these become to us sources of high enjoyment , and we are not to be afraid of the happiness thus afforded us . We are to accept and enjoy it with all thankfulness ; this we may do , and should do , from a supreme love to God , and with a heart of benevolence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , and pursue them , as many do , from motives of mere personal indulgence and gratification ; then , as before , we stand on a different footing , we become epicures of a higher sort , we are " lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God . " It will be further objected , that if amusements are interdicted to grown people , they surely can not be to children and youth . These love amusements , they crave them , they must and will have them ; and , as Mr. Sawyer argues in the work before us , if they can not have them openly and decently , they will plunge into them secretly , and perhaps shamefully . We hardly need assure our readers that we feel a deep interest in children and youth , and should be unwilling to deny or to grudge them one lawful pleasure-one innocent enjoyment . The amusements of the young naturally divide themselves into two classes those which are appropriate to little children , and those which are indulged in , in maturer years . The first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moral character . They are the mere outbursts of animal feeling , and are no more praise or blameworthy , in a moral point of view , than the frolic of a kitten or a lanib . So far as the amusements of children at this period can be said to possess a moral character we suppose they are in general sinful , and that for two reasons : first , because all the moral acts of unrenewed souls are sinful ; and secondly , because they often &amp;1iow themselves to be sinful . They partake evidently of the nature of pride , envy , revenge , selfishness , malice , and even of cruelty . With regard to the pleasures of those who have passed the season of childhood , and arrived at maturer years , while we admit that certain courses of action belong appropriately to them , and that they may require more of recreation and diversion than // persons advanced in life , we deny that they have any more right than older persons to forget God , and live unto themselves , and pursue pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulge in amusements , as they have been before defined . We hold that the same great law of love which binds the man of sixty , has been constantly upon him from his childhood and youth . ile was as truly under obligations to love God supremely , and do all things to his glory , at the age of ten , or of twenty , as lie is now . It is undoubtedly true , that every age and condition in life has its appropriate employments and enjoyments . When Paul was a child , it was proper for him to speak as a child , to understand as a child , to think as a child ; and when he became a man , it was proper for him to put away childish things . But let children be taught in their earliest years to love God , and not themselves , with a supreme affection ; to receive and enjoy everything as from him and to do everything with a view to his glory , and not to their own personal gratification , and whatever they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite certain they should not do at all . But it will be said that we , like Israel of old , have our festal occasions-days of rejoicing-our annual thanksgivings and anniversaries of American Independence , when it is proper , surely , to indulge in amusements . We have , indeed , our annual festal days-days of cheerful , grateful remembrance , which may well be devoted to sacred song , to devout thanksgiving , and to other demonstrations of holy joy . But can it be proper , under pretense of honoring God on such occasions , to break his laws , and to sin against him with a higher and bolder hand than at any other time ? Yet such , undoubtedly , is the manner in which these days are often spent , more especially by the votaries and advocates of amusements . There can be no question that more sin is committed on our festal days , we fear vastly more , than on almost any other days of the year . These are the seasons , emphatically , for giddy frivolity , for uproarious mirth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest forms of vice ; and all this under pretense ot amusement , and the proper observance of a joyful day ,  --  a strange way this of expressing our gratitude to God for mercies past , and propitiating his favor for the time to come ! It is as if we should hope to please and honor him by insulting him to his face ! But it is asked by Mr. Sawyer and those who thin*k with him : Why can not amusements be reformed ? Instead of being placed under the ban of religion and of social morality , why may they not be incorporated into them , and be regulated by them ? ILet Christians participate freely in the amusements of the age , give von . ix . 23 // them a character , and keep them from running out into dangerous excesses , and all will be well . To this we answer , first of all , that the course here recommended has been often attempted , and has always failed ; a reformed theater  --  a reformed bowlingalley-a reformed gaming-table  --  a reformed ball-room-these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our notice for the first time . The experiment has been tried oftentried under the most favoring circumstances  --  and we have no hesitation in saying that it has always failed . The patrons of amusements do not wish them reformed . Reformed so as to be acceptable to serious Christians , they would no longer be amusements for them . There is but one way of reforming sin , and that is to abandon it . To gloss it over under false appearances , and cling to it , and persist in it , is of all paths the most certain to ruin and to death . It is admitted by those with whom we argue , that amusements , placed as they now are under the restraints of Christian example and influence , are peculiarly liable to excess . Those who love them plunge recklessly into them , and indulge them to their hurt . What then , we ask them to consider , would be the result , if the restraints of Christian example and influence were taken off ? In that case , where would the lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society be likely to go with them ? Not only would the excesses of the wicked be increased , but they would no longer think it strange ( as they did in Peter 's time ) that Christians did not " run to the same excess of riot with them . " They would run to the same excess of riot , and serious , evangelical religion would disappear from the earth . The distinction which we have endeavored to illustrate between recreations and amusements is , in our view , a very important one . It is radical . The former are required of us both by reason and the word of God ; the latter are discountenanced and prohibited by both . The consequences of the former , when kept within the proper limits , are only good ; while those of the latter are hurtful and disastrous . So they have shown themselves in all past ages ; so they will be in the ages to come . " A corrupt tree can not bring forth good fruit . " " Do men gather grapes of thorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our subject still remains , viz. : the laws , the cond*it'ion* by which recreation is to be regulated ; so that it shall be not injurious , but salutary ; not offensive to God , but well pleasing in his sight . We can not promise to notice all these laws , but will mention some of them . // the same . What would be a relief to some , would be a weariness to others . For example , the person of sedentary habits and pursuits requires physical exertion , strong muscular exercise , such as is furnished by athletic sports , or some kinds of manual labor ; while the weary husbandman needs no such thing . He can be best recreated in some more quiet way . The tired student requires to have his mind diverted , as well as his body exercised . He must engage in something which shall withdraw his thoughts from the exhausting subject , and fix them upon something else . While he whose muscles are more wearied than his head may recreate , and refresh himself with those very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of our recreations , therefore , every one must be guided very much by his own particular circumstances and necessities . 2 . The same rule may be extended to the measure of our re-* creations . Some persons require more , and some less . Some kinds of labor are so agreeably diversified , that they carry their own recreation with them ; while others are so monotonous and fatiguing , that no one can bear them continuously for any great length of time . The poor laborer of this class must recreate , or he must die . In estimating the needed amount of recreation , the great o4jeet of it should be kept constantly in view ; not personal gratiflcatiom merely or chiefly , but renewed health , strength , and vigor , and so a preparation for increased usefulness . Recreation may be lawfully pursued until the object of it is gained , that is , ifit islikely ever to be gained in this way ; but no farther . Indulged farther , it is very likely to change its character . It is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be such , both as to their nature and circumstances , as not to violate any plain and positive command of God . This is a very obvious rule , and one of importance . For example , the law of God requires that we love our neighbor , and seek his good . If then , under pretense of recreation , we contrive to injure our neighbor in any way ; or expose him to personal inconvenience or suffering , we are no longer excusable , but criminal . The law of God requires that we use all suitable means to preserve our own life , health , and reputation . If then we indulge in recreations which go to expose life , or health , or reputation ; if we are out at unseasonable hours , and in the company of evil men ; our recreations are no longer innocent and salutary , but injurious . Again ; the law of God requires that we remember the Sabbath day , and keep it holy ; and this cuts off at a stroke all Sabbath recreations , except such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion . // 4 . Our recreations must not be allowed to interfere with more important duties . This is a kindred rule to the one last considered ; and yet it is sufficiently distinct to require a separate consideration . IRecreation , we hare already said , is a duty ; and yet it is not one of the more important and indispensable duties . At least , it is not so in all circumstances , and at all times . What we mean to say , therefore , is , that we are so to regulate our recreations , both as to their nature , their amount , and the times in which to indulge them , as not to interfere with more important duties . If we find , at any time , that our recreations are encroaching upon the more necessary duties of life , or go to make these duties irksome ; or if we find that they interfere with our religious duties  --  the devotions of the family , the closet , or the social circle , giving us a disrelish for such duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the result of our recreations we may know that they have passed the prescribed limit somewhere . The great object and end of recreation is to make our duties more pleasant , not less so ; to prepare us to engage in them with a greater zest , and to better account , and not the more to trifle with and neglect them . Hence , when we find that our recreations are having this latter effect upon us , we may know that they are out of place or proportion somewhere , and that they require to be examined and regulated anew . 5 . Tn choosing our recreations , we are to avoid such as are peculiarly liable to abuse ; and more especially such as kave been abused to such a degree as to become scandalous . We hold this to be a very important rule , and one which can not be safely disregarded . Some kinds of recreation are so captivating , so engrossing , that if indulged in at all , they are very likely to be indulged to a ruinous excess . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mere pleasure of it ; and then they change their character , and become sinful amusements . Now such recreations should either be avoided altogether , or should be indulged in with great caution , and with a vigorous and prayerful self-control . There are also recreations which are not only liable to abuse , but which actually have been and are abused , to such a degree as to become scandalous . The devil and his agents are in full possession of them , and will not give them up . Sober people can not engage in them without disgrace , and without countenancing their multiform abuses and evils . We need not stop to name these dangerous recreations . A moment 's thought will enable any intelligent person to fix upon them , or at least upon some of them , and less than a moment 's thought will satisfy every serious Christian , that all such indulgences are to be scrupulously // avoided . If we would not be identified with their guilty votaries ; if we would not be accessory to their ruinous results ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins ; they are to be scrupulously avoided . 6 . Our recreations , as a general thing , ought not to involve any very considerable expense . In these times , when there are so many ways in which property can be turned to good account , not only for the relief of poverty and suffering , but for advancing the interests of Christ 's Kingdom in the world , no considerate person , and certainly no Christian , will think of expending large sums for the mere purpose of recreation . Ie will contrive to recreate himself in some cheaper way . Finally , our recreations should all be pursued for the proper end , or which is the same , from the right motive . This rule is important on more accounts than one . A due observance of it will aid us in c1*oo8ing our recreations . There are some courses of pleasure which can not be indulged in from proper motives . We might as well think of stealing or lying for the glory of God . Of course , all such are to be avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a moral view , depends upon its observance . In judging of our actions , God looks primarily at the end , the motive ; and where this is wrong , nothing merely external can be right . The proper end of recreation we have stated more than once . It is not self-gratification , but increased health , vigor , and usefulness . It is to rest and refresh the tired spirit , or the weary body , and thus prepare for renewed and increased exertion in that work of life which God has given us to do . In all our recreations , then , let this great end and aim of them be kept constantly in view ; * let them be selected and pursued with reference to this end ; let them be pursued so far as they really conduce to this end , and no further ; let this be the guiding , controlling motive in them all ; and God will approve of them ; our own consciences will approve ; and the results , it may be hoped , will be continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued from the motives , and under the limitations , here prescribed . But if these rules are transcended or neglected , and we venture upon courses of self-indulgence for the mere pleasure of it , our pleasures then become sordid and selfish , offensive in the sight of God , and destructive to the best interests of the soul . * We do not mean that , in their seasons of relaxation and diversion , persons should be constantly watching and scrutinizing their motives . This might defeat the very object of diversion . But let the end and aim of life be habitually , consciously , such as has been indicated ; so consciously , that any considerable deviation from it shall be instantly noticed . // We close this discussion with two remarks . 1 . In cutting off sinful amusements , let no one charge us with iudifference to the happiness of our fellow men . So far from being indifferent , we seek and prize their happiness ; and it is because we prize it , that we have made the distinctions , and engaged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment has our heavenly Father opened to us , in his works , or in his word , which we have not left open ? What sources of enjoyment , but such as he has prohibited , have we closed up ? In the enjoyment of friends and of social intercourse ; in the enjoyment of all that variety of good which is set before us in the outer world ; in the enjoyment of appetite and sense even , so far as they can be indulged in to the glory of God ; in the possession of those higher enjoyments , resulting from the pursuit and the acquisition of knowledge , and the right performance of dutypeace of conscience , and joy in the Holy Ghost ; indulged , also , with the multiform diversions and recreations of life-all that the necessities of nature and our own best good require ; with such sources of happiness spread out before us , and urged upon us ; what ought we , as rational beings , to desire , or to ask for , more ? And why should we complain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a class of pleasures , which are in their nature sinful , and whose influence can only be to degrade and injure us ? What do those who rely so much on their amusements expect to do with themselves in heaven ? Cut off from all their favorite sources of happiness ; having no pleasures but such as are social , intellectual , and spiritual ; will not heaven be to them a dull and gloomy place , where they will find little to enjoy , and from which they will desire , if possible , to escape ? 2 . Let our readers , one and all , remember , that we were sent into this world , not for sport and amusement , but for labor ; not to enjoy and please ourselves , but to serve and glorify God , and be useful to our fellow men . This is the great object and end of life . This is that for which life was given us . In pursning this end , God has indeed permitted ns all needful diversion and recreation . He has consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected our duty with our happiness , that there is no such thing as being solidly , permanently happy , but in obedience to his will . But the great end of life after all is work-work , for God-work for the advancement of his kingdom , and the best good of our fellow men . The Christian fathers have a tradition that John Baptist , when a boy -- being requested by some other boys to join them in play-replied , " Icame into this world , not for sport . " Whether the Baptist ever said this , we are unable to decide . But whether he did or not , it is a remarkable saying . // It is a true saying-however cutting may be the reproof which it carries to not a few of our fellow men . It is a saying which we may all with propriety adopt : " lYe came into this world , not for sport . " We were sent here for a higher and nobler object . Let ns not , then , forget this object . Let us live and act in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onr final Jud we may hope to hear him say : " Well done , good and faithtul servants ; ye have been faithfnl over a few things , I will make yon rulers over many things : enter ye into the joy of your Lord .
