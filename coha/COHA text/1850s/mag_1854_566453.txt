ART . VIIL-TIIE SOUTHERN APOSTASY. church Review , October , 1854 . AnT . VIL-The Church among the Slavepopulation of the Southern State8 . THE Church Review derives some importance from the fact , that it has united in its support several distinguishable varieties of opinion in the Protestant Episcopal Church , and much of the talent and learning of its clergy . In the latest issue of that Quarterly , we find an article bearing on the great question of the times . With commendable discretion the editors take care to avoid responsibility for the opinions and arguments of the article ; for they are aware that among their readers " there are entertained , on this topic , very diverse and very decided opinions . " Yet they commend the " communication " to the attEntiou of their readers , because it " shows in what light a most exciting subject is regarded among intelligent and Christian men of the South . " We take the article then as it is set before us . Bearing in mind the editorial disclaimer , we will not impute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it represents , the opinions of this Southern contributor . Still the question arises in our thoughts , whether an exposition of the view in which that " most exciting subject is regarded among intelligent and Christian men " of the North , is likely to be published in the next or in any subsequent number of the erudite and " Catholic " Quarterly , which commends to the attention of its readers the Southern view of slavery , as represented in the article before us . Whenever the Church Review shall d*e to say , distinctly , that slavery-even this American slavery , with the slave-trade which is its life-is intrinsically oppressive and . unjust , we hope the fact will not escape our notice . The article before us deserves attention for the explicitness as well as the authority of its testimony to the fact , that the Southern churches generally , of all distinctive names , have apostatized from the first principles of righteousness . We call the attention of our readers to the fact of the great Southern apostasy . The writer , whose communication in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall state the fact in his own words . After having said , that at the North Slavery is regarded by some " as a moral and political evil , of which it would be desirable to relieve the country , " and by // others " as an unpardonable crime and a stigma upon the national character , which is to be wiped away at all hazards , " and that at the South , " while various shades of opinion prevail upon this subject , yet all are united in one sentiment , viz , to sustain the institution at all hazards , " he proceeds as follows " Time was , when many persons , in the Southern States , admitted that Slavery was a moral evil ; for which , however , they endeavored to persuade themselves they were not to be held accountable , the institution , as they argued , having been fixed upon them by the acts of former generations , and become , in process of time , so blended and interwoven in all the relations of society , that to eradicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether this position was , or was not , defensible , yet the agitation of this question has caused the subject to be investigated , and the effect of this investigation is the opinion now widely prevailing among the Southern people , that Slavery , as it exi8ta among them , is neither a gi eat moral , national , nor political evil , but that the institution is a wise and benevolent one , and has the undoubted sanction of Holy-writ . " Here , then , we have explicit testimony , first , in respect to the present position of Southern Christianity . " The opinion now widely prevailing among the Southern people " is that slavery-not Hebrew slavery , nor some other possible form of involuntary servitude , but " slavery as it exists among them " - slavery with the slave-markets of Norfolk and New Orleans , and with laws to keep the Slaves in brutish ignorance , " is neither a great moral , national , nor political evil , " but is " a wise and benevolent institution , " and " has the undoubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness , is the " prevailing " sentiment and doctrine of the Southern religious bodies . Equally explicit is the testimony of this witness , secondly , to the point that " time was " when the state of opinion at the South , in regard to slavery , was far different from what it now is , far more in harmony with the general sentiment and belief of Christendom . This is what we call an apostasy . The ethics of slavery , and particularly the question whether it is right to enslave millions of unoffending and helpless persons , have not been discussed for the first time within the last few years . We will go no farther back than to the age of Richard Baxter . We are aware that the great Non-Conformist is not much of an authority with the Church Review ; but we are writing for a far larger class of readers , with many of whom the name of the saintly man who wrote the Saints ' Rest and the Call to the Unconverted , is among the most venerable in all the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complicity with modern " Abolitionism . " In the voluminous collection of Baxter 's Practical Works , the Christian Directory has the foremost place . ( YoL I of the ancient // folio edition ; Vols . JI-VII of Orme 's edition , London , 1830 . ) It is " a sum of Practical Theology and Cases of Conscience , " and is divided into " four parts : -I . Christian Ethics , or private duties ; II . Christian Economics , or family duties ; Ill . Christian Ecclesiastics , or church duties ; IV . Christian Politics , or duties to our rulers and neighbors . " The fourteenth chapter of Christian Economics is divided into two titles , as follows " Title 1 , The Duties of Masters to Servants . Title 2 , Directions to those Masters in Foreign Plantations , who have Negroes and other Slaves ; being a solution of several cases about them . " We commend the whole chapter to the Publishing Committee of the American Tract Society . The question whether they ought not to publish it for universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devout and conscientious consideration . Baxter lived two hundred years ago , contemporaneously with the Westminster Assembly . On the one hand , he rejected the offer of an episcopate in the Church of England , because he could not compromise his conscience ; on the other , he was the friend of Archbishop Usher . Among the many parties of a factious age , his greatest ambition was to be a i'econciler , and to persuade all good men that they might at least agree to tolerate each other 's errors in judgment concerning things not essential to godliness . Of all the authors that have been laid under contribution by the Tract Society , there is not one ( save Bunyan ) whose works have had a wider celebrity , or whose name and fame are less the property of any church * or sect . " Why then should not the Publishing Committee , at the moment when , as they doubtless think , opinions on slavery in opposite portions of the country are verging to opposite extremes , call upon Baxter to expound , for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he expounded it two hundred years ago ? Is Baxter an " Abolitionist " and incendiary ? Would an unmutilated chapter out of Baxter 's Christian Directory , written and published before " Abolitionism " was ever dreamed of , and before Georgia and the Carolinas began to be settled , expose the Society to time denunciation of Southern Synods , and its colporteurs to the summary process " of Lynch law ? We need not answer our own question . It is a sufficient illustration of the humiliating position in which the American Tract Society finds itself , that its executive officers are not only restrained from putting into circulation anything that favors the peculiar doctrines of " modern , Abolitionism , " but dare not commit the institution even for the old doctrine that was held by every honest man in Christendom two hundred years ago . What the Tract Society // can not do , can not be done by any other publishing Board or Society that is not willing to be denounced by all the religions bodies of the South , and to expose its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence and death . This fact , so far as it reveals the position of the religions bodies at the South , is an illnstration of what we mean by the Southern Apostasy . Tnrn then to Baxter 's Christian Directory , Part II , dhap . XIY , lit. 2 . The topic is , in brief , Directions to slaveholders . ' We are sorry that we can not transfer the whole section to our pages ; but we will give as full an abstract as our limits will permit . The first Direction is , " Understand well how far your power over your slaves extendeth , and what limits God has set thereto . " The specifications are , 1 , " Sufficiently difference between men and brutes . Remember that they are of as good a kind as you ; that is , they are reasonable creatures as well as you , and born to as much natural liberty . If their sin have enslaved them to you , yet nature made them your equals , " &amp;c. 2 , " Remember that God is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety in them , " &amp;c . " God 's interest in them and by them must be served first . " 3 , " Remember that they and you are equally under the government and laws of God . And therefore , God 's laws must be first obeyed by them . " " Nor can you without rebellion or impiety expeet that your work or commands should be preferred before God's. " 4 , " Remember that God is their reconciled , tender Father , " &amp;c. 6 , " Remember that they are the redeemed ones of Christ , and that he hath not sold you his title to them . " The second Direction is , " Remember that you are Christ 's trustees , or the guardians of their souls , and that the greater your power over them , the greater your charge is of them , and your duty for them " You must exercise both your power and love to bring them to the knowledge and the faith of Christ , and to the just obedience of God 's commands . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law was in those days , the baptized or " christened " negro had legal privileges and immunities , of which the savage and heathen slave was supposed incapable . The fact is a suggestive one in respect to the moral sense of Christendom in that age , as compared with the deteriorated moral sense that now expresses itself in laws to forbid emancipation , and to keep the slaves down at the level of savage ignorance . In reference to a state of law now obsolete , the venerable author gi*es out an expostulation with those masters that " keep their negroes and slaves from hearing God 's word , and from becoming Christians . " In the same connec // tion , he states and ifudertakes to solve three cases of conscience . We give his statement and solution at full length . " Quest . 1 . is it lawful for a Christian to buy and use a man as a slave ? Quest . 2 . Is it lawful to use a christian as a slave ? " Quest . 3 . What difference must we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quest . 1 . I answer , There is a slavery to which some men may be lawfully put , and there is a slavery to which none may be put ; and there is a slavery to which only the criminal may be put , by way of penalty . " 1 . No man may be put to such a slavery as under the first Direction is denied , that is , such as shall injure God 's interest and service , or the man 's salvation . 2 . No miLn , but as a just punishment for his crimes , may be so enslaved as to be deprived of those liberties , benefits , and comforts , which brotherly love obligeth every man to grant to another for his good , as far as is within our power , all things considered . That is , the same man is a servant and a brother , and therefore must at once be used as both . 3 . Though poverty or necessity do make a man consent to sell himself to a life of lesser misery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it not lawful for any other so to take advantage by his necessity , as to bring him into a condition that shall make him miserable , or in which we shall not exercise so much love , as may tend to his sanctification , comfort , and salvation . Be*iause no justice is beseeming a Christian or a man , which is not conjoined with a due measure of charity . " But , 1 . He that deserveth it by way of penalty may be penally used . 2 . He that stole and can not restore may be forced to work it out as a servant ; and in both these cases more may be done against another 's ease or liberty , than by mere contract or consent . He that may hang a fiagitious offender doth him no wrong if he put him to a slavery , which is less penal than death . * . More also may be done against enemies taken in a lawful war , than could be done against the innocent by necessitated consent . 4 . A certain degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the innocent . That is , so much , ( 1 . ) As wrongeth no interest of God . ( 2 . ) Nor of mankind by breaking the laws of nations . ( 3 . ) Nor the person himself , by hindering his salvation , or the needful means thereof ; nor those comforts of life , which nature giveth to man as man . ( 4 . ) Nor the commonwealth or society where we live . " Quest . 2 . To the second Question , I answer , 1 . As men must be *ariously loved according to the various degrees of amiableness in them , so various degrees of love must be exercised towards them ; therefore good and real Christians must be used with more love and brotherly tenderness than others . 2 . It is meet also , that infid*ls have so much mercy showed them in order to the saving of their souls , as that they should be invited to Christianity by fit encouragements : and so , that they should know that if they will turn Chris-* tians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of truth and piety shall have . It is therefore well done of princes who make laws that infidel slaves shall be freemen , when they are duly Christened . 3 . But yet a nominal Christian , who by wickedness forfeiteth his life or freedom , may penally be made a slave as well as infidels. 4 . And a poor and needy Christian may sell himself into a harder state of servitude than he would choose or we could otherwise put him into . But , 5 . To go as pirates and catch up poor negroes or people of another land , that never forfeited life or liberty , and to make them slaves , and sell them , is one of the worst kinds of thievery in the world ; and such persons are to be taken for the common enemies of mankind ; and they that buy them and use them as beasts , for their mere commodity , and betray , or destroy , or neglect their souls , are fitter to be called incarnate devils than Christians , though they be no Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the third Question , I answer , That the solution of this case is to be gathered from what is said already . A servant and a voluntary slave were both freemen , till they sold or hired themselves ; and a criminal person // was a freeman till he forfeited his life or liberty . But afterwards the difference is this : that , 1 . A free servant is my servant , no further than his own covenant made him so ; which is supposed to be , ( 1 . ) To a certain kind , and measure of labor according to the meaning of his contract . ( 2 . ) For a limited time , expressed in the contract , whether a year , or two , or three , or seven . " 2 . A slave by mere contract is one that , ( 1 . ) Usually selleth himself absolutely to the will of another as to his labor both for kind and measure ; where yet the limitations of God and nature after ( and before ) named , are supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is one that selleth himself to such labor , during life . " 3 . A slave by just penalty , is liable to so much servitude as the magistrate doth judge him to , which may be , ( 1 . ) Not only such labor , as aforesaid , as pleaseth his master to impose . ( 2 . ) And that for life . ( 3 . ) But it may be also to stripes and seventies which might not lawfully be inflicted on another . " 1 . The limitations of a necessitated slavery by contract or consent through poverty , are these : ( 1 . ) Such a one 's soul must be cared for and preserved , though he should consent to the contrary . He must have time to learn the Word of God , and time to pray , and he must rest on the Lord 's day , and employ it in God 's service ; be must be instructed , and exhorted , and kept from sin . ( 2 . ) He may not be forced to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not ( though he forcedly consent ) be denied such comforts of this life , as are needful to his cheerful serving of God in love and thankfulness , according to the peace of the Gospel state ; and which are called by the name of our daily bread . No man may deny a slave any of this , that is not a criminal , punished slave . " 2 . And the most criminal slave may not be forced to sin , nor denied necessary helps to his salvation . But he may penally be beaten and denied part ofhis daily bread ; so it be not done more rigorously than true justice doth require . " Quest . But what if men buy negroes or other slaves of such as we have just cause to believe did steal them by piracy , or buy them of those that have no power to sell them , and not hire or buy them by their own consent , or by the consent of those that had power to sell them , nor take them captives in a lawful war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Answ. 1 . It is their heinous sin to buy them , unless it be in charity to deliver them . 2 . Having done it , undoubtedly they are presently bound to deliver them : because by right the man is his own , and therefore no man else can have just title to him . " Quest . But may I not sell him again and make my money of him , seeing I leave him but as I found him ? ' " Answ . No ; because when you have taken possession of him , and a pretended propriety , then the injury that is done him is by you ; which before was only by another . And though the wrong be no greater than the other did him , yet being now done by you , it is your sin . " Quest . But may I not return him to him that I bought him of ? ' " Aasw . No ; for that is but injuring him by delivering him to another to continue the injury . To say as Pilate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , ' will be no proof of your innocency , yea , God 's law bindeth you to love , and works of love , and therefore you should do your best to free him : he that is bound to help to save n man , that is fallen into the hands of thieves by the highway , if he should buy that man as a slave of the thieves , may not after give him up to the thieves again . " The author then disposes of the whole subject by adding to the two " Directions " already given , the following : - " Direct . Ill . So serve your own necessities by your slaves , as to prefer God 's interest , and their spiritual and everlasting happiness . " * * // " Direct . lilY . By how much the hardness of their condition doth make their lives uncomfortable , and God hath cast them lower than yourselves , by so much the more let your charity pity them , and labor to abate their burden , and sweeten their lives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " * * " Direct . V. Remember that you may require no more of an innocent slave , than you would or might do of an ordinary servant , if he were at your will , and did not by contract except something as to labor or usage , which else you would think just and meet to have required of him . " * * " Direct . VI . If they are infidels , neither be too hasty in baptizing them , when they desire it , nor too slow . " * * " Direct . VII . Make it your chief end in buying and using slaves , to win them to Christ , and to save their souls . " We are not concerned to demonstrate the full coherence and consistency of Baxter 's views in every point . Nor is it important for us to inquire whether the prevalent public op inion , at the present time , in those States and nations whichh ave abolished all personal slavery is , or is not , in advance of the positions held by Christian casuists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are undertaking to show is not whether there Ihas been progress elsewhere , but whether in regard to certain first principles of justice and Christianity , the religious bodies in our slave-holding States have apostatized from the ancient accepted doctrine . Baxter did not deny , absolutely and without qualification , the lawfulness of slavery . He gives " directions to masters who have negroes and other slaves , " just as the Bible does . But his directions , like those which the Bible gives , can not be generally obeyed without abolishing , and that speedily , all that we commonly mean by slavery ; just as the moral sentiments by which they are dictated , like the moral sentiments of the Bible , are utterly opposed to the actual institution which bears that name . He expressly admits that there is a slavery to which a convicted criminal may be doomed in punishment of his crimes , He admits that there is a sort of involuntary or coerced service , which may be exacted of " enemies taken in a lawful war . " He admits that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an innocent man may lawfully consent to be a slave , even as long as he lives . But he does by no means admit that the enslaving of innocent men , without their consent , is just or reasonable . He seems not even to have imagined any such system as that with which we have to do in the discussions and agitations of the present age ; a system of hereditary and perpetual slavery , seizing upon children from the moment of their // birth and counting them as merchandise ; a system which prohibits emancipation , and condemns the enslaved race , through all its generations , to absolute and hopeless bondage ; a system which , in a nominally Christian commonwealth , imposes on half the population ( fused and blended with the other half to an indefinite extent by a mixture of races ) such a servitnde as would be a fit punishment for atrocious crimes . Every thought of Baxter 's Christian casuistry , every sentiment of his nature as a Christian , abhorred a system like that . And yet that is the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the religious bodies in our Southern States are united in the determination " to maintain it at all hazards . " Once they were not thus united , but now at last , as this witness testifies , they agree in holding that such a system is altogether righteous , and can not be condemned but in defiance of God 's word . This institution of slavery is to their faith divinely warranted . The belief in its righteousness , and in the impiety of seeking or desiring to abolis ? h it , is incorporated with their religion . How can it be pretended that their Christianity , if this witness truly represents it , is the same with that which molded and inspired the character of Richard Baxter ? If his religion was essentially Christianity , what shall theirs be called ? We have no intention of accumulating authorities to show what was the sentiment of Protestant Christendom on the ethics of slavery before , the rise of modern controversies and agitations . It might be suggestive if we should exhibit in this connection the views of slavery which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our revolution and a few years later . The opinions , for example , of those two most renowned citizens of Virginia , Washington and Jeffersdn , were freely and strongly expressed in condemnation of the institution ; and none of our readers will suppose that the prevalent sentiment of the various Christian bodies in that age was less opposed to slavery than were the feelings and judgment of those great men But we need not attempt to ascertain by any such argument , what was the accepted orthodoxy on this subject before the commencement of recent controversies . It will suffice for our purpose if in addition to our large quotation from Baxter , who certainly does not appear to have written in any partisan interest , or with any consciousness of propounding some novel or peculiar doctrine of his own-we lay before our readers a document often referred to , in which the sentiment of the Presbyterian Church in the United States was summed up and authentically published in 1818 . The // Presbyterian Church was then , as now , essentially a conservative body , loving its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforming zeal against slavery . None of its great names had been identified with any extraordinary denunciations of the system , such as had been uttered by the father of Methodism . A most considerable portion of its strength was then , as now , in the slaveholding States ; and it was aot less likely then , as now , to be influenced by Southern prejudices and interests . Surely then the unanimous declaration of the General Assembly , solemnly pronounced , on such a subject , and at that time , may be taken as a sufficient indication of what was then the prevalent judgment of the great Christian public in this country and throughout the world . In such a document we are sure to find nothing else than the safest and most accepted orthodoxy . Nor may we omit to say that this act of the General Assembly was drawn up by that very distinguished man , Dr. Ashbel Green , then President of the College at Princeton . ( See Life of Dr. Green , p. 41T-published by the Presbyterian Board of Publication . ) Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to commit himself for any position in advance of the most undoubted orthodoxy . If the Nicene creed may be taken as an unquestionable historic landmark , showing us what was the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity in the reign of the first Constantine , this act of the Presbyterian Assembly in 1818 , may be taken as showing beyond all dispute , what was at that time the orthodox doctrine about slavery . " The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church , having taken into consideration the subject of SLAVERY , think proper to make known their sentiments upon it to the churches and people under their care . " We consider the voluntary enslaving of one part of the human race by another , as a gross violation of the most precious and sacred rights of human nature ; as utterly inconsistent with the law of God , which requires us to love our neighbor as ourselves ; and as totally irreconcilable with the spirit and principles of the Gospel of Christ , which enjoin that all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paradox in the moral system-it exhibits rational , accountable , and immortal beings , in such circumstances as scarcely to leave them the power ' of moral action . It exhibits them as dependent on the will of others , whether they shall receive religious instruction ; whether they shall know and worship the true God ; whether they shall enjoy the ordinances of the Gospel ; whether they shall perform the duties and cherish the endearments of husbands and wives , parents and children , neighbors and friends ; whether they shall preserve their chastity and purity , , or regard the dictates of justice and humanity . Such are some of the consequences of slavery-consequences not imaginary  --  but which connect themselves with its very existence . The evils to which the slave is alway8 exposed , often take place in fact , and in their very worst degree and form : and where all of them do not take place , as we rejoice to say that in many instances through the influence of the principles of humanity and religion on the minds of masters they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded as a human being , and exposed to the danger of passing into // the hands of a master who may inflict upon him all the hardships and injuries which inhumanity and avarice may suggest . " From this view of the consequences resulting from the practice into which Christian people have most inconsistently fallen , of enslaving a portion of their brethren of mankind-for God hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth ' - it is manifestly the duty of all Christians who enjoy the light of the present day , when the inconsistency of slavery , both with the dictates of humanity and religion , has been demonstrated , and is generally seen and acknowledged , to use their honest , earnest , and unwearied endeavors , to correct the errors of former times , and as speedily as possible to efface this blot on our holy religion , and to obtain the complete abolition of slavery throughout Christendom , and if possible throughout the world . " We rejoice that the church to which we belong commenced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of endeavoring to put an end to slavery , and that in the same work , many of its members have ever since been , and now are , among the most active , vigorous , and efficient laborers . We do indeed tenderly sympathize with those portions of our church and our country , where the evil of slavery has been entailed upon them ; where a great , and the most virtuous part of the community , abhor slavery , and wish its extermination , as sincerely as any others  --  but where the number of slaves , their ignorance , and their vicious habits generally , render an immediate and universal emancipation inconsistent , alike with the safety and happiness of the master and the slave . With those who are thus circumstanced , we repeat that we tenderly sympathize . At the same time , we earnestly exhort them to continue , and , if possible , * to increase their exertions to effect a total abolition of slavery . We exhort them to suffer no greater delay to take place in this most interesting concern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands . " As our country has inflicted a most grievous injury on the unhappy Africans , by bringing them into slavery , we can not , indeed , urge that we should add a second injury to the first , by emancipating them in such a manner as that they will be likely to destroy themselves or others . But we do think , that our country ought to be governed in this matter , by no other consideration than an honest and impartial regard to the happiness of the injured party ; uninfluenced by the expense or inconvenience which such a regard may involve . We therefore warn all who belong to our denomination of Christians , against unduly extending this plea of necessity ; against making it a cover for the love and practice of slavery , or a pretence for not using efforts that are lawful and practicable to extinguish the evil . " And we at the same time exhort others to forbear harsh censures and uncharitable reflections on their brethren , who unhappily live among slaves , whom they can not immediately set free ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their influence , and all their endeavors , to bring them into a state of freedom , as soon as a door for it can be safely opened . " Having thus expressed our views of slavery , and of the duty indispensably incumbent on all Christians to labor for its complete extinction , we proceed to recommend  --  and we do it with all the earnestness and solemnity which this momentous subject demands  --  a particular attention to the following points . " We recommend to all our people to patronize and encourage the society , lately formed , for colonizing in Africa , the land of their ancestors , the free people of color in our country . We hope that much good may result from the plans and efforts of this society . And while we exceedingly rejoice to have witnessed its origin and organization among the holders of slaves , as giving an unequivocal pledge of their desire to deliver themselves and their country from the calamity of slavery ; we hope that those portions of the American Union , whose inhabitants are , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and liberally , and earnestly coöperate with their brethren in bringing about the great end contemplated . " We recommend to all the members of our religious denomination , not only to permit , but to facilitate and encourage the instruction of their slaves , in // the principles and duties *f the Christian religion ; by granting them liberty to attend on the preaching of the Gospel , when they have the opportunity ; by favoring the instruction of them in Sabbath schools , wherever those schools can be formed ; and by giving them all other proper advantages for accquiring the knowledge of their duty both to God and man . We are perfectly satisfied , that as it is incumbent on all Christians to communicate religious instruction to those who are under their authority , so the doing of this in the case before us , so far from operating , as some have apprehended that it might , as an excitement to insubordination and insurrection , would , on the contrary , operate as the most powerful means for the prevention of those evils . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care of this Assembly , to discountenance , and , as far as possible , to prevent all cruelty of whatever kind in the treatment of slaves ; especially the cruelty of separating husband and wife , parents and children ; and that which consists in selling slaves to those who will either themselves deprive these unhappy people of the blessings of the gospel , or who will transport them to places where the gospel is not proclaimed , or where it is forbidden to slaves to attend upon its institutions . The manifest violation or disregard of the injunction here given , in its true spirit and intention , ought to be considered as just ground for the discipline and censures of the church . And if it shall ever happen that a Christian professor in our communion , shall sell a slave who is ftlso in communion and good standing with our church , contrary to his or her will and inclination , it ought immediately to claim the particular attention of the proper - church judicature ; and unless there be such peculiar circumstances attending the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed , without delay , by a suspension of the offender from all the privileges of the church , till he repent and make all the reparatien in his power to the injured party . " Did the Christianity of the South hold in 1818 , a different doctrine about slavery from that which is defined in this solemn act and testimony ? Did Southern synods and presbyteries secede or threaten a secession ? Was there an indignant minority ready with a protest , and demanding for it a place on the records of the Assembly ? Ko such thing . " The full expression of the Assembly 's views , " as the reader has it now before him , was " unanimou8ly adopted , " and was not only published with the minutes of that Assembly , but was afterwards republished in a volume prepared by order of the Assembly , and including such acts and proceedings of that body , as appeared to be " of permanent authority and interest . " Our copy is from the Assembly 's Digest , published in 1820 . Undoubtedly then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he testifies that a few years ago , the wrongfulness of slavery was generally acknowledged by thinking persons in the slaveholding States . There is no reason to donbt that the prevalent opinion and profession of the religious bodies in those States was on that point generally accordant with the accepted orthodoxy of Christendom . It was a matter of course that by every man professing a personal experience of Christianity , slavery was acknowledged to be wrong in the abstract , unjust in its origin , afflictive in all its bearings , and most to be deplored because of ' the perils and mischiefs that were supposed // to be inseparable from every plan for the removal of it . The churches of all denominations , in those States , may be supposed , very naturally , to have been deficient in the application of church censures to masters offending against the law of love in their dealings with their servants . Probably their regard for the natural rights of persons held in slavery , was not , practically , what it ought to have been . Probably their sensibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their labor , anJ which holds them as cattle existing for the benefit of their owners , was blunted by familiarity , and by unthinking sympathy with the public sentiment embodied in law and usage all around them . Probably a strict investigation into the actual discipline of the Southern churches at that time and into their practicql views and feelings , as manifested in the current notions about the rights of masters compared with the duties of masters and the rights of slaves , would have revealed a very great deviation from the standard of duty set up alike in Baxter 's Christian Directory , and in the " full expression of the Assembly 's views on slavery . " But after all , the prevalent theory in the Churches  --  the acknowledged Christian doctrine  --  the faith professed in the name of Christ-was that every innocent man ought to be free , and that though the sudden and unprepared emancipation of the enslaved class would be attended with many inevitable evils not to the masters only , but to society and to the enslaved themselves , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate abolition of slavery was to be waited for with prayer , and with effort to prepare the way for so blessed a consummation . To what extent , then , have religious bodies of the Southern States apostatized from their former position and profession ? We have already exhibited on this point the testimony of the writer in the Church Review , his intelligence and credibility being vouched for by the conductors of that periodical . He assures us that modern inquiries and discussions there , have resnlted in great discovereries and the prevalence of a new doctrine . Every man who is in the habit of looking into Southern religious journals , is familiar with the fact that now in all the South , ( with the exception of Kentucky , East Tennessee , and possibly some other districts similarly situated , ) slavery is constantly and unequivocally justified in the name of religion . In no sense is it admitted to be wrong ; but on the contrary it is held to be a Christian institution , warranted by explicit testimonies of the word of God . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another part of his communication , with his own argument in defense of slavery // 1854 . The Southern Apostctey. - an argument which may be taken as a specimen both of the logic that seems conclusive at the South , and of the religion which that logic expounds . We may find room to analyze his argument before we dismiss the subject ; but just now we can not refrain from confirming his testimony to the fact by another testimony equally respectable , though from a very different source . Let the Presbyterian Synod of Mississippi testify on the question whether the Southern apostasy is a fact . This is one of the Synods of what is commonly called the Old School Presbyterian Church . At a meeting sometime in 1853 , notice was taken of the decease of Rev. James S mylie ; and a committee was appointed to prepare a suitable %emorial for the records of the Synod . A paper was accordingly prepared by the Rev. John II . Van Court , one of the oldest surviving members , and having been reported by the committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published . From that authoritative document , which happened to arrest our attention as it was published in a Southern Presbyterian newspaper , we give the following pertinent and most suggestive paragraph . " There is one production from his pen which produced a strong sensation in various parts of the United States . When the abolition excitement rose in the North , he resolved , as many others ought to have done , to give the sacred Scriptures a thorough searching to ascertain the doctrines and duties there inculcated in relation to slavery . He determined to investigate the subject in the most candid manner , and to receive whatever was taught , with the most fearless and implicit faith . The result surprised himself . He found that the teachings of Scripture were greatly at variance with the popular belief . He wished to communicate his discoveries to others . He wrote a sermon on the subject , and preached it at Port Gibson . It gave great offense , not only to the church , but also to his brethren in the ministry , who seriously advised him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the Presbytery of Chillicothe , ( in Ohio , ) assumed the lofty position of instructors of their brethren of the South on the subject of slavery , exhorting them to abandon it as a heinous sin . They wrote a letter to the Presbytery of Mississippi on the subject . This letter was received by Mr. Smylie as Stated Clerk . He wrote a reply to be laid before the Presbytery for their adoption . He read this reply to one of his brethren before the meeting . As he had entered into the teachings of Scripture in relation to slavery , the reply was long ; and many of his views differed from the views of his brethren . On these two accounts he was told that his reply would not in all probability be adopted by the Presbytery . It was then agreed that the brother whom he had consulted should write another reply , in a different style and manner , and more concise , and that this should be offered if his was not adopted . The concise reply was adopted by the Presbytery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a religious newspaper at Cincinnati , and tTlere was no further annoyance from the Presbytery of Chillicothe . Mr. Smylie then determined that he woul4 publish his . views in a pamphlet form . Such was the variation of his sentiments from those of his brethren , that all whom he consulted , with but one or two exceptions , attempted to dissuade him from this step . with that honest inflexibility of purpose and confidence in the correctness of his own conclusions Which ever distinguished the man , he published his pamphlet . For a while // he was covered with odium , and honored with a large amount of abuse from the Abolitionists of the North , for teaching that the Bible did not forbid the holding of slaves , and that it was tolerated in the primitive church . These doctrines are now received as true both North and South , and they constitute the basis of action of the most respectable religious bodies , even in the North itself ; so that Mr. Smylie has the high honor of giving the true exposition of the doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencement of the abolition excitement , and of giving instruction to others far more learned and talented than himself . " This testimony is as explicit as it is authoritative . Mr. Smylie , roused to investigation by " the abolition excitement in the North , " began to search the Scriptures in a free and independent way , and made a great discovery . " He found that the teachings of Scripture were greatly at variance with the popular belief . " Wishing " to communicate his discoveries , " he digested them into a written sermon . The preaching of that sermon " gave great offense not only to the church , but to his brethren in the ministry ; " so contrary was that new divinity of his to what had previously been acc4ted as orthodoxy , there not less than in all the rest of Christendom . Again he produced some of his new views in the form of a letter from the Presbytery of Mississippi to the Presbytery of Chillicothe . Again it was found that " many of his views differed from the views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt the letter he had written in their name . With the characteristic zeal of those who make new discoveries in theology , he resolved on publishing a pamphlet , so that the wisdom that had been given to him need not die with him . But " such was the variation of his sentiments from those of his brethren , that all whom he consulted , with but one or two exceptions , attempted to dissuade him . " But he would not be dissuaded ; and now his doctrines-then so startling and offensive-are " received as true both North and South . " The Synod of Mississippi is quite competent to testify as to what is received as true in its own diocese ; but as to the faith and doctrine of the Northern Churches , we and our readers know more than they . It is not likely that the matter of fact will be denied in any quarter . The Christianity of the Southern States has undergone a change . Once it was not committed and pledged for the defense of slavery . Now it professes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Abolitionism " - meaning by that word , all earnest opposition to slavery-as an error that undermines the authority of the Bible . Yet there is another witness whose testimony , in the circumstances in which it is given , has a significance of its own . Our readers are aware // that certain sciolists at the South have undertaken to vindicate the institution of slavery , in the form in which it exists there , and to reconcile it with the moral sense , by denyin**hat the enslaved are of the same species with the enslavers . The principle of those philosophers is , that though all men ought to be free , Africans , with their crisped hair , their black skins , and their other peculiarities , are not of the same species with the European race , and therefore are not men in the sense of* the proposition which affirms that liberty is an inalienable human right , but , like other inferior animals , were created-if , indeed , there is a Creator-for the convenience and use of the superior species . Christianity , they argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God made all nations of men , to dwell on all the face of the earth , " and with its command , " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , " is essentially incompatible with " Southern institutions . " And where the condition of public sentiment is such , that the rectitude of the laws and usages which make up the " institution** of slavery must be assumed as a first principle , and every other principle in politics , in morals , and in religion , must be trimmed and adjusted accordingly , such an argument against Christianity has great strength . How then was such an argument to be refuted * The professional defenders of Christianity at the South , and the ministry and churches under their guidance , fell into the snare of the devil . Challenged by infidelity to show their loyalty to slavery , they undertook to hazard the authority of Christianity upon the claim of its superiority to infidelity , as a warrant for buying and selling men in the market , and for exacting from the poor an uncompensated service by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelity and Southern Christianity , is the question , which of the two systems offers , on the whole , the safest and most available defense of slavery . The infidel argument is , for substance , " If all these human races , the African and the European alike , are in reality of one blood , as the Bible plainly teaches-if the negro and his owner are brothers of the same race-then our institution of negro slavery is indefensible , and if we are to be consistent , we must all be Abolitionists : but our institutions must be defended , and Abolitionism ' is the most horrible of crimes ; therefore the human races are not one but many ; the slave and his mastereven if they happen to have had one father-are not brothers of the same original species ; and the Bible , with its doctrine of universal brotherhood , is a fable . " To this the Southern apologists for Christianity reply , in effect , as follows : - " Infidelity can show no sufficient warrant for enslaving an inferior race . // Admitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may , for all that , be of the same species , nor is his inferiority or his dependence any valid reason , by the light of nature , for taking him by force and making a slave of him . Our institutions can not be adequately justified without a positive revelation from God , authorizing slavery . Such a revelation infidelity can not pretend to show . Such a revelation Christianity has in the Bible . Infidelity then , and not Christianity , is dangerous to the stability of our institutions . And to confirm this inference we have the fact , that many of the most notorious Abolitionists at the North are also notorious infidels , imputing to the church and to the Bible a complicity with slavery . " It is after such a fashion that Christianity is defended at the South against its enemies-one head of the " internal evidence ' * being , in effect , the warrant which the Christian revelation gives for the peculiar institutions of the slaveholding States . An instance of this happens to be just now current in the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lutheran Congregation in Charleston , is a man of eminent attainments in science , and particularly in the department of Natural History . He has published something by way of reply to Nott and Gliddon 's shallow and pretentious book on the " Types of Mankind . " We have not seen the reply itself ; but in a journal representing the interests of Southern Methodism , we find some portion of Dr. Bachman 's appendix , treating of this particular topic . He is a most respectable representative of that new method of defending Christianity , which is now so much in vogue among Southern theologians . Observe thenhow he exhibits the bearing of his subject on the " peculiar institutiojis " of the Southern States : " We are induced yet to offer a few remarks on the bearing of the doctrine of the Unity of the Human Race on the domestic institutions and vital interest of the South ; and this note is intended expressly for the mature reflection of our Southern community . Politicians who resorted to DeBow 's and the South . em Quarterly Reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been instilled into their minds by Dr. Nott and others , have been taught to believe that the best argument that could be urged in favor of slavery , was to prove the negro of a different species . Hence , those who have supported the doctrine of the Unity , have sometimes been stigmatized as Abolitionists and enemies of the South . We trust that one who has never lived in a State where no slavery existed , and has been identified with the institutions of South Carolina for the last forty years-one who , in the North as well as the South , openly and fearlessly defended them on every necessary occasion-may be allowed to express his sentiments on this subject without the danger of having his motive misinterpreted . The following are our views : That all the races of men , including the negro , are of one species and of one origin . That the negro is a striking and now permanent variety , like the numerous varieties in domesticated animals . That varieties having become permanent , possess an organization that prevents them from returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring up among them . Thus the many breeds of domesticated animals that have arisen , some only within a few years , would never return to the form of the wild species , without an intermixture . That the negro will remain as he is , unless his form is changed by an amalgamation , which latter is revolting to us . That his intellect , although underrated , is greatly inferior to that of the Caucasian , and that he is , therefore , as far as our experience goes , incapable of self-government . That he is thrown on our protection . That our defense of slavery is contained in the Holy Scriptures . That the Scriptures teach the rights and duties of masters to rule their servants with justice and kindness , and enjoin the obedience of servants . " Whether Dr. Bachman carries the argument through all its ordinary course-whether he undertakes to demonstrate , or ventures to assume , that the African races , from Egypt to the Cape of Good Hope , are the descendants of Ham-whether he infers from the recorded prediction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants , the , ju8tice of enslaving both negroes and mulattoes-whether after the manner of that consummate blockhead , the author of " Studies on Slavery , " and some others , he interprets the limitation imposed by Moses on a stiff-necked people , forbidding them to enslave each other , and requiring that all their slaves should be of the heathen nations that surrounded them , as if it were a positive and perpetual command requiring every Christian man to be the owner of slaves-does not appear in the newspaper from which the foregoing quotation has been transferred . But it is important to observe with how absolute and undiscriminating a loyalty , this truly able and eminent man commits himself , and the cause and interest of Christianity , to the support of " the institutions and vital interest of the South . " Not less important in reference to our purpose , is the method in which he shows the impotence of infidelity to justify slavery against the moral sense , and the impolicy of giving up the Bible . Having briefly sketched the infidel argument derived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " We would here observe , that if every word of this were true , and the negro was proved to be of a different species , it would not release us from our obligations as men and Christians . That if they could even succeed in proving the negro of a different species , the South would gain nothing , whilst we would have abandoned all the strong arguments that are derived from the Scriptures , on the right of holding this species of property . It should be borne in mind , that when the most violent Abolitionists of the North , Garrison , Abby Kelly , etc. , were met by arguments from the Bible in favor of our institutions , they openly renounced the Bible which taught this doctrine , and denounced all the institutions of Christianity . Thus our belief in the diversity of races brings us no advocates from the open infidel . " But more significant than anything else in the quotations we are making , is Dr. Bachman 's testimony to the " unexampled // unanimity of sentiment that now exists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the ground of that unanimous sentiment , namely , the confident reliance of the religious public on the Bible as the impregnable bulwark of Southern institutions . " Having gained nothing from those who discard the Bible as an uninspired book , what , we ask , has produced that unexampled unanimity of sentiment that now exists in the whole South on the subject of slavery ? Our table is crowded with pamphlets and sermons , with speeches in Congress and dissertations by clergymen and laymen , on the subjec*t of slavery . The teachings of the Bible are the most effective weapons that are used . There it is shown that the ancient Israelites were the owners of slaves . There the duties of master and servant are taught , and there is Paul 's letter to Philemon , entreating him to receive back his runaway slave . Our representatives in Congress used the arguments contained in the Scriptures , and their opponents dared not tell them that the historical parts ( and all that refers to slavery is historical ) were uninspired and untrue . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity of species can never be maintained . It is as contrary to science as it is to the Scriptures . The suspicion of interested motives will be excited against the South in supporting a false theory bya denial of the Holy Scriptures . We can effectually defend our institutions from the Word of God . When we abandon that strong towei* of defense , we are left without weapons , exposed to the ruthless assaults of its enemies . In a political point of view , we regard the effort made by Nott and Gliddon , to establish their theory by a denial of the veracity of the historical Scriptures , as more dangerous to our institutions than all the ravings of the abolitionists . " Neither the statement of the writer in the Church Review , nor the testimony which we have brought from other sources in confirmation of his statement , will be adequately appreciated , unless the reader is careful to observe what it is which the Southern clergy and the Southern churches have so unanimously undertaken to justify , for it is chiefly at this very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doctrine - that departure from former professions and from the common senti4ment of Protestant Christendom , which we have called the Southern apostasy . What they have undertaken to defend in the name of Christianity , and to sanctify with proof texts from the Bible , is not merely the holding of slaves under certain conditions , but slavery itself . What they have undertaken to maintain , is not merely that a master who , b'eing invested by the laws with power over certain helpless and friendless human beings , feels himself bound not to renounce that legal power , but to use it in the fear of God for their protection and good government , does not forfeit his right to be acknowledged as a Christian man . Nor is it merely that under a government which dooms a certain class to slavery , a Christian man may sustain , with a good conscience before God , the relation of a master toward those who are slaves not by his will but by the // law of the land , if in that relation he gives to his servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which is just and equal . Had nothing more than this been attempted by the religions bodies of the South , they might have commanded the respect that is one to those who hold an established and conservative position . None could have charged them with apostasy from their former professions . Nor would they themselves have boasted , as we see them now boasting , of the unanimous agreement to which they have at last attained . But this is far from being all that they have attempted . The observant reader has already seen that what they undertake to defend is nothing less than slavery itself-what they call " Southern institutions , "  --  the sum of the arrangements , laws and usages that make up the system of " slavery as it exists " in those States . When they undertake to defend slavery as a system warranted by Christianity , they do not mean the slavery which Moses tolerated and regulated as he tolerated and regulated the power of a husband to divorce his wife at discretion ; nor do they mean some imaginary slavery separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean-at least they rarely fail to say that they mean the actual " institutions of the South , " " slavery as it exists " all aronnd them , slavery with the barracoons of Norfolk and the " slave-depots " of New Orleans . Once the habit of the South was to offer excuses for slavery as a curse entailed upon them , as an evil for which there had been found no practicable remedy ;  --  the sudden emancipation of an ignorant , barbarous , and essentially hostile population , was too perilous an experiment to be thought of ; there must be time for the negroes to be civilized , enlightened , and Christianized , before they could be fit for freedom . It was in such methods that religious men were acci*istomed to apologize for slavery , not as a permanent institut , ion intrinsically right , but as a thing that must be borne with for a season , in order that it might be gradually and safely abolished . But now , as our readers have seen , they hold altogether a different position  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position which scorns the old landmarks of orthodoxy , and defies the moral sense and the human sentiments that utter themselves in the literature of all the Christianized nations . To show the tone of Southern argumentation about slavery at the present day  --  and especially of the argumentation used by religious men , we return to the writer in the Church Review . ILl e does not indeed exhibit all the details of the argument for slavery . Refusing to address at all " that class of per VOL . XII . 65 // sons who deny that the Constitution of the United States or the Word of God in any manner recognizes or countenances slavery , " he very naturally omits the Scriptural argument ( so called ) about " the cursed race of 11am , " and all other arguments so frequently derived from the Bible . He proposes to reason with another class of readers prejudiced against slavery , " whose impressions are the result of early associations , of education , of a want of proper information upon the subject , whose opinions , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not approve of the institution , yet feel no inclination to interfere directly with it , " and therefore he resorts to another line of argument . The only fault he finds in this class of readers , is , that " they do not approve of the institution , " ( the emphasis is his own , ) and he entreats them " to divest themselves as far as possible of all prejudice " while he attempts to enlighten them . What then is to be the aim of his argument ? Certainly it can be nothing else than to bring them over to his way of thinking about slavery-nothing else than to bring them into that state of mind in which they will " approve of the INsTImTION* ' which condemns millions of human beings , for no crime or fault of theirs , to involuntary servitude through all their generations . And it is only just to admit that so fi*r as this argument has anything like force or coherence , it is an argument tending to this aim and no other . Lest the writer should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning , we will permit him to speak for himself . He begins with rejecting " the ideal theory of perfect equality in the condition of men , " which affords , as he says , " so beautiful an introduction to our Declaration of Independence , " and having affirmed that " so long as the pre*sent state of society exists in the world , a disparity in the condition of men , resulting from a different degree of intelligence , of enterprise , and a thousand other adventitious causes , must be expected to exist , " he proceeds , " This position being admitted , what is the necessary inference ? That in all states of society there are two classes of persons , the one subservient , at least'to some extent , to the other . The man of superior intelligence , of enterprise , of capital , directs and controls the lab6r of those deficient in these qualities or endowments , and to , a great degree , reaps the benefit thereof . And although the legal rights of the two may be identical , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , with any prospect of success . To this struggle for equality , this contest between labor and capital , between animal force and superior intelligence , many of the revolutionary movements in society are attributable . To this cause may be ascribed the immense emigration from the older and more populous countries of the Eastern Continent to our more favored land . And yet even here , in this boasted land of freedom , of intelligence , of equal rights , how often does the upheaving , as it were , cf the lower // strata of society , give sad but too sure indications of the oppressed , yet restless condition of the operative who struggles with his employer for increased wages and finds how unequal is the contest I Who can tell how many families of delicate females and helpless children , in our large cities , are dependent almost for their very existence upon the sufferance of some millionaire Who can estimate the amount of poverty , suffering , and consequent crime , which may be found in the many unfrequented streets and lanes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the blight of slavery does not exist . Who among our Northern capitalists , who give employment to the many thousands , by whose labor their already overgrown fortunes are yet swelled larger , ever gives a passing thought to the condition , moral or religious , of his operatives ? Does he follow his laborer as he drags his wearied limbs homeward , after a hard day 's labor , to inquire whether his situation is comfortable ? Does he feel the obligation to provide for the moral or religious instruction of his dependents ? Or is it the case that he cares naught for the laborer when his energies are exhausted. , his strength worn out , and his availability at an end ? Alas ! we fear they too often forget or neglect these things , and in their anxiety to pluck the mote out of their brother 's eye , forget the beam that is in their own ' We have thus followed the **irriter through what seems to be the first stage in his proposed " examination of this important question , " namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " approved . " What are the materials of the argument thus far ? Fir8t , we have the gross logical error which confounds equality of personal rights , with equality of condition-equality in respect to the claim of the individual on the civil community for protection of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , with equality in the possession of wealth  --  the equality which is simply another name for equity , with the imaginary and preposterous equality promised by Socialism . None but a very stupid or a very dishonest reasoner could commit the paralogism which confounds the principle affirmed in the Declaration of Independence and assumed in the great commandment , " Thou shalt love thy neighbor a thy8elf , ' with the most preposterous of social chimeras ; and which concludes that because the latter is not a fact in history , the former is not a principle in morals . Newt , we have the more natural , but not less fatal blunder which supposes that the cooperation of capital and labor he the production of wealth , implies in all circumstances the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital on labor . This we say is a more natural blunder ; - for any careless thinker , accustomed to the sight of sla*re-labor , and ignorant of those familiar facts and principles of human nature which constitute , in their analysis and applications , the science of political economy , may very easily take up as an axiom the shallow notion , that all labor is servile , and every laborer helpless and dependent in his relation to employers . But it is none // the less a blunder for being a natural result of the position from which this writer surveys his subject . Under a just government , recognizing the laborer as having in every respect the same personal rights with the capitalist , labor and capital are mutually dependent and mutually subservient . Wherever a righteous government guards with equal vigilance the personal rights of all men-including ot course , the right of every man to the use of his own limbs and faculties , and to the possession of whatever he can produce or earn by his labor-capital will seek to distribute itself in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnestly as labor see soemployitself in the reproductive consumption of capital . It is as necessary for capital to seek investment as it is for labor to seek employment ; and capital , by its very nature can never be invested reproductively-that is , it can never be employed as capital-but by giving employment to labor , and so becoming the subsistence and the reward of labor . Out of this blunder comes the assumption that the free laborer , like a slave , gets no just compensation for his labor-nothing but what the employer chooses to give him . Equally preposterous is the assumption , ( originating in the same blunder , ) that where labor is free , capital is in the hands of a wealthy and ruling class who never labor , and labor is performed by the hands of an inferior and dependent class who have no capital . Even the Irish servant girl who has deposited her first spare dollar in the Savings Bank , is a capitalist in a small way ; for there is a dollar of her 's which must be employed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere , in order to yield the interest that is pledged to her . And on the other hand , the wealthy New England farmer with thousands of dollars interested in monied institutions , is himself a laborer . Thirdly , we have the ignorant intimation that in a free country the poor , or the operatives , are " oppressed ; " and that there is a perpetual " struggle for equality , ' *hopelessly maintained on their part  --  a " contest between labor and capital , between animal force and superior intelligence . " To this supposed struggle for equtdity , the writer attributes " many of the revolutionary movements in society , " and the immense emigration from Europe to this country . And he talks about " the upheaving , as it were , of the lower strata of society , " even here " in this boasted land of freedom , of intelligence , of equal rights , " to wit , the free-labor States of this Union . Now with the largest and most compassionate charity for the writer 's ignorance , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worse than nonsense . He who talks thus about the causes of " revolu // tionary movements in socioty , " betrays a disgraceful sympathy with European despotisms . The struggle wihich agitates Europe with a conflict of ages , is a struggle not of labor against capital , but of peoples against selfish despotisms and more selfish oligarchies . On which side is it that " superior intelligence'is found , and which side is it that is sustained by the " animal force " of conscript armies ? Where were the Neapolitan lazzaroni found in 1848 ? Who reared the barricades in the streets of Naples ? - who in Milan ? - who in Berlin ? - who in Vienna ? The emigration from Europe to this country , is not mere labor fleeing from the oppression of capital ; it is labor and capital escaping from lands where labor and capital alike are taxed oppressively for the costly and tawdry splendor of a throne , for a luxurious and unproductive aristocracy , for the livened drones of an established and multitudinous priesthood , for a standing army consuming the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs of national life ,  - -  to a country where labor and capital alike , exempted from such burdens , are sure of their legitimate gains . And what are the " upheavings of the lower strata of society " here ? Who can say that he has seen anything of the kind ? True there is now and then a fight among Irishmen on the line of some railway construction . We remember a serious theater riot a few years ao'o in New York . We remember the burning of IRomish churc*hes at Philadelphia , and of a convent near Boston . We are aware of the disturbances which have sometimes attended the rendition of fugitive slaves ; and we retain the memory of the anti-abolition riots in sundry places , almost twenty years ago . But which of all these thing 's bears any more resemblance to a geological " upheaving of tTie lower strata of society , " than the riots do , which take place at the South , whenever private malice wreaks itself on an obnoxious individual by denouncing him as not bearing true allegiance to Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this argument an insolent insinuation that " Northern capitalists " never give a passing thought to the condition , moral or religious , or to the physical comfort , of their operatives . Our readers need not be told how false this is . In one way or another it happens that our manufacturing villages , and cities are eminent , even in New England , in respect to the amplitude of their means and arrangements for promoting the moral and religious welfare of their entire population . No places are so well provided with churches , with schools , with cheap or gratuitous Lyceum lectures , with whatever can help to waken and encourage the spirit of intelligence and self-improvement , and the habit of forethought // and accumulation . So for as this has been done by men of wealth in a princely care for the people employed by their capital , it is well ; and so far as it has been done by the operatives themselves , out of the proceeds of their own free labor , and with a manly care for their own welfare as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glory of our free-labor system is , not that the rich capitalists take care for the comfort and the moral and religious welfare of the poor laborers , but that the laborers are able , and being able , are ready in every respect to take care for themselves and for each other . What has been done by the Lawrences and Appletons of Boston , and by others like them less known perhaps to fame , is far less important for the refutation of this writer 's calumny , than what the workers in manufacturing villages and cities are continually doing for themselves . It might be in point to tell what such a capitalist as Mr. Williston of Easthampton has done to make the beautiful village which he has enriched by his enterprise and skill , a model for the world ; but it is far more pertinent to know that those who work in his employment are not at all dependent on his charity , and that what they have done for themselves is more than he could do for them . The question whether any Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs homeward , after a hard day 's labor , to inquire whether his situation is comfortable , " is simply ludicrous to one who knows anything of the facts . Such a question presumes that the condition of working people in a free State is the same with that of slaves in a slave State . What sort of a figure would the great clock-maker of New Haven , for example , ( Mr. Jerome , ) make , going about to the dwellings of the men employed in the immense establishment of which he is the head , and enquiring with humane condescension whether they are suffering for want of the necessaries and comforts of life ? The inquiry whether they and their families are in a comfortable condition , would be resented as an insult . Those men d o not live in cheerless cabins , nor in garrets nor cellars , but in dwellings with conveniences and comforts which many a Southern slaveholder never knew . Their savings are snugly and lucratively invested . Some of them are probably shareholders in the manufactory in which they labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not expecting to be rich , oi who may not become rich by the ordinary blessing of God on industry and frugality . As for " the laborer when his energies are exhausted , his strength worn out , and his availability at an end , " we can not but wish that a committee of Southern philanthropists would explore the free States and try to find him . He is not in the ahushouse , // unless intemperance and vice have brought him thither . He is not begging in the streets , like an old horse turned out by an ungrateful owner to graze upon the common and to die of cold . Let such a committee find him if they can , and ask him whether the employer whom lie served so long cares for him now in his helplessness . We are not saying or implying that there is no poverty in the free States ; but we beg our Southern friends to understand that the workers in the great operations of our productive industry , are neither paupbrs , nor " dependents . " The poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the poor are not the " operatives , " but the inoperatives-those who do not work , whether because of incapacity for productive labor , or because of inability to find employment suited to their capacity . Most of them are the feeble , the sickly , the helpless and forsaken , of that great army of peaceful invasion which pours itself into the free States from the old world , year after year , at the rate of more than a thousand a day . The " streets and lanes " where these people are found with their " poverty , suffering , and consequent crime , are not , in any sense , " unfrequented . " The city missionary , the tract-distributer , the Sunday school teacher , and the visitors and agents of many a charitable society are there . But neither the city missionary ; nor the tract-distributer , nor the Sunday-school teacher , nor the giver of alms , has ever suggested that the condition of those people could be improved by selling them as slaves " in lots to suit purchasers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument in the paragraph which we have quoted ? What is there in it that can lead a right-minded man , however ill-informed , toward the conclusion that the inetitution of slavery " is a wise and benevolent one , and has the undoubted sanction of holy writ ? " Reduced to its proper dimensions , the argument is just this . Freedom can not put all men upon a level in respect to wealth and outward condition . Wealth gives to its possessor some advantages over those who support themselves and their families by their own labor , and still more over those who have no means of subsistence . But what is there in all this to show that the poor ought to be the property of the rich , bought and sold in the market , forbidden by law to be the owners of anything , and robbed of all their labor ? What is there in the argument thus far , to show us that personal freedom is not to be desired ; or that an innocent man can be deprived of his freedom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who would not rather be poor than be a slave ? Would not even this writer in the Church Review , if he were to choose // for himself instead of choosing for his neighbor , prefer poverty , hunger , rags , beggary , nay death itselS to the condition of a slave , with the liabilities and perils which that condition involves under the institution of slavery as it exists by Southern laws ? We proceed to exhibit the next stage in the process of this writer 's argumentation ,  --  be*ging our readers to remember that the object of the argument is not to show that slaves are better treated than they might be , but to obtain from the moral sense of thinking men , a verdict of approval for the institution of slavery . " We have taken particular pains to learn something definite and reliable as to the condition of the Southern slave . We find that the amount of labor required of him is much less than that performed by the laboring class of whites ; while from all the anxieties of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old age , and maintenance of his children in youth , to which all of us , and our laboring classes in particular , are subject , the negro at the South is entirely exempt . Indeed , the aged negro , whose strength has been spent in the faithful service of his master 's family , is no ordinary object of interest . He is provided not only with all the necessaries of life , but many of its luxuries ; he is beloved and indulged by his Master , respected and revered by his Master 's children and those of even his own color , and spends his declining years in luxurious ease . An old family servant is , perhaps , of all people in this world , the most privileged character . And this , we are well assured , is no fanc*r picture , but just such a character may be found in almost every Southern family . " Admitting the accuracy of every word in the statement , let us observe how the argument brings us toward the conclusion . 1 . Slaves are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men whose earnings are their own . 2 . Slaves are exempt from the anxieties to which freemen are liable about their sup* port and that of their children . 3 . An old family slave is a most uncommon pet ; he spends his declining years in luxurious ease , and is perhaps the most privileged character in the world - more privileged ( we may suppose ) than an ex-president , more respected and revered than a senior bishop . From the tripod of these three statements can we leap to the conclusion , that therefore the institution of slavery is to be approved as righteous and divinely sanctioned ? What ? Shall we justify the institution of slavery because we are told that slaves are not in fact treated as badly as they might be ? Surely that fact , if it be a fact --  ' - however creditable it may sometimes be to the masters-is not the merit of the institution What if the slaves perform less work than is expected of those who work under the stimulus of hope and love , and the desire of gain ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are cut off from the access of all those motives which God has ordained as the legitimate stimulus to industry ? What if the slave is put not // above but beneath the reach of all anxiety ? Did not God ordain the natural anxieties that beset us in our freedom , as the legitimate stimulus to industry and accumulation ? And are we to conclude that God is well pleased when men are taken out of that discipline by being put into the condition of the ox that knoweth his*owner and the ass that feedeth at his master 's crib ? What if we are delighted here and there by the sight of an old pet negro , or even one in every Southern family ? Does that prove to an enlightened and awakened mind , that the code by which two millions of people , native to the soil , are dealt with as foreigners , savages , enemies and captives-is all right ? In the next stage of the argument we find the writer 's mode of dealing with an objection . " It is frequently urged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that separations take place among families of negroes , and that these separations depend upon the mere caprice of the Master . Before we notice the guards that are thrown around the negro , to prevent the frequeut occurrence of these separations , let us look around in non-slaveholding communities and see how many families there are whose members are scattered almost to the four quarters of the globe ; and what causes these separations but necessity , imaginary or real , or , at least , the desire to better their condition ? How many of New England 's sons and daughters , annually leave the homes of their childhood , separate themselves from their parents , brothers , sisters , and dearest friends , and launch out to the West or South to improve their fortunes ? And yet they do not regard these separations , the result of a necessity as inexorable as ever exists in the case of the Southern slave , with any great degree of horror. ** The objection is , that under the institution of " slavery as it exists , " the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred relations of mutual affection and duty , in which the God of nature has connected husband and wife , parents and children-that " the institution " ignores and denies the divinely sanctioned property of the ens aved husband in his wife , and of the enslaved wife in her husband , making their relation as chattels in the hand of an owner paramount to all - other relations , human and divine-that it makes the children born of an enslaved mother as much the possessions of that mother 's owner as the produce of his fields , the chickens of his poultry-yard , the lambs of his slieepfold , and the calves of his stalls - that thus parents and ghildren , husband and wife , may be separated , and are separated in fact , not by any necessity in the arrangements which God has instituted , but by the hand of ruthless human power . The answer is nothing better than a felon 's logic . It assumes that whatever calamity or sorrow lights upon man in the sovereign providence of God , may be righteously inflicted upon man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man 's goods , can you justify yourself by saying that the // loss of property is one of the most common incidents of human life ? If in the street you knock a man down with a bludgeon , will the policeman decline to arrest you , when you tell him that another man was knocked down yesterday by the falling of a brick from a scaffold , and was hurt just as badly ? If you set your neighbor 's house on fire , is it a sufficient justification that houses are often burned by accident ? If you kill a man by poison or by pistol , is the action justifiable on the ground that in the course of nature it is appointed unto all men once to die ? There is another answer to the same objection , which if we should omit , we might seem to do some injustice . It is not unlike a plea in mitigation of damages . " But . let us return to the Southern slave . In many of the slave States , a mother and her younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and even where no such statutory regulations exist , public opinion , stronger and more influential than laws themselves , protects them . Even in Louisiana , a sugar producing State , where the condition of the slave is generally supposed to be worse than in any other sections of the country , among the earlier acts of its Legislature we find an act prohibiting the separation of a mother from her young children , and also an act making provision for the religious instruction of the slaves . In nearly if not all the slave States , the Grand-Juries are specially required by law and solemnly sworn to inquire and diligently search whether the negro population have been provided with comfortable houses , clothing , and food . The negro is protected in his person as strictly as a white man is , and although from the very necessity of the case , authority is vested in the master , by which proper discipline is secured , yet the master dare not inflict any cruel or unusual punishment upon his slave . In the course of the present year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced to imprisonment in the State Penitentiary for ten years , who had inflicted such injury on his slave as to render necessary the amputation of his leg below the knee . " All this is somewhat deficient in statistical exactness . In how " many of the slave States " is it true that a mother and her children are protected by law against the possibility of separation ? Two years ago , ( see New Englander for 1852 , p. 601 , ) we had occasion to show on the authority of Wheeler 's Law of slavery , ( p. 41 , note , ) that Louisiana is the only slave State which has " any statutory restriction or limitation as to the separation of parents and children " in the sale of slaves . Is it disingenuousness , or inexcusable carelessness , which affirms of many what is true of only one ? In either case , what reliance shall we put on the statement , that " in nearly if not all the slave States , the Grand Juries are specially required by law and solemnly sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been provided with comfortable houses , clothing , and food ? " And even if these two statements were true in the widest extent , what possible coherence // is there between such statements and the conclusion that the institution of slavery violates no principle of justice ? The statement that " the negro is protected in his person as strictly as a white man is , " would be pertinent if there were any truth in it . That it is essentially untrue , is partly conceded when the writer adds by way of limitation , that " from the very necessity of the case , authority is vested in the mas&amp;er , by which proper discipline is secured . " Could not this writer have told his readers , ingenuously , what the fact is which he tries to cover up with these dainty phrases ? " The master , " he tells us , " dares not inflict any cruel or unu8ual punishment on his slave . " What kind of punishment is cruel or unusual , in such a sense that the master dares not infljct it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slave ? Is the master invested with authority to coerce obedience to that rule , at his own discretion or his own caprice , by the torture of the lash ? Is any " white man " - unless he happens to be a slave bleached white by amalgamation-subject to such a rule enforced by such " discipline ? " Would this writer think his own person as well protected as the person of any other white man , if a master were placed over him with power to inflict at any moment , for any disobedience or any blunder , or for nothing at all , without investigation , without the possibility of redress , forty stripes save one ? Would he think himself adequately protected , as well protected as other white men , if the laws were so framed that any drunken ruffian meeting him in the street , might spit upon him , kick him , beat him , and lash him , and in doing all that commit no crime ? Would he think his own person adequately protected , if under such an assault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , were wjiolly denied to him , and if he could not lift his hand against that ruffian without incurring a dreadful legal penalty ? The illustrative example of protection to the persons of slaves is not without significance . A master in the State of Alabama was sentenced to ten years imprisonment in the penitentiary , for having " inflicted such injury on his slave as to render necessary the amputation of his leg below the knee . " This illustration corresponds exactly with the definition of " unu8ual rigor " in the Louisiana code . " The slave is entirely subject to the will of his master , who may correct and chastise him , though not with unusual rigor , or so as to maim and mutilate him , or expose him to the danger of loss of life , or to cause his death . " This is the state of the law which this writer attempts to represent by saying , " the negro is protected in his person as strictly as a white man is , and although from the very necessity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which proper discipline is secured , yet the master dare not inflict any cruel or unusual punishment on his slave "  --  a cruel or unusual punishment being such as renders amputation necessary . After mentioning that " throughout the slave States the Sabbath is secured for the slave as a day of worship , and the negro from the rising of th' sun to its setting , while attending public worship , is as free as his master "  --  a statement which we challenge him to verify by quotations from the statute-books of those States ,  --  our author repeats the old story which has been rehearsed froni time immemorial by the defenders of slavery ,  - -  viz , that " in many of the essentials of comforts , the exemption from excessive labor , the enjoyment of religious privileges , the condition of the Southern negro will compare favorably with that of any laboring class in the world " - as if that ( even admitted to be strictly true ) could justify the " institution " which robs him of his labor , which makes his wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all his life to the arbitrary power of a master . He then proceeds , " But we are told the poor negro is deprived of the benefits of education , and that the Word of God is a sealed book to him . Although many slaves can read , the teaching of them to do so is prohibited by law , but this has been done mainly , if not solely , to prevent the evil effects of violent , revolutionary , and incendiary publicatIons , which abolitionists and fanatics have endeavored to circulate among them . And let those , who insist so urgently upon the education of the Southern slave , look at the appalling list of crime among themselves , where the boast is that education is open to all , and endeavor to solve the question whether education of the head , without that of the heart , a system so common at the North , tends to promote either the temporal happiness or the eternal salvation of the recipient . Does it make him a better Christian as well as a wiser man In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is here represented . In Kentucky and Maryland , if we are correctly informed , there is no restriction upon the education of slaves , or of the free people of color . In Virginia it has been recently announced , as the result of careful inquiry and consultation , that any master may teach his own slaves . In this particular then , the writer 's statement is too sweeping . The fact is not quite so bad as he would make it . But what is more important is , that having exaggerated the fact , he undertakes to justify it even in that exaggerated form . And this he does by two distinct considerations . His first argument is drawn from the necessity of keeping the slave in ignorance of letters , lest by reading what " abolitionists and fanatics " have printed , they become misinformed as to their own condition-as if the servant who has been taught to read , could not read in the Bible the // same warrant for enslaving the race of Ham which his master finds there-as if these multiplied arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him-as if it were impossible to make a book for distribution on the plantations which would demonstrate to reading slaves the happiness of their lot , and teach them to appreciate with kindly sympathy the less privileged condition of the " laboring class " in those States where laborers , unfortunately , not being owned by capitalists as property , have nobody to care for them . His second argument in defense of laws that prohibit the teaching of negroes to read , is drawn from the great principle that " the education of the head without that of the heart , " does not promote " either the temporal happiness or the eternal salvation of the recipient " - an argument which assumes either , that teaching men the use of letters is always likely to ruin them for time and for eternity ; or that there is something in the special condition of the slave , which m*kes it impossible to teach him to read without a fatal separation of the head from the heart . We have thus given the entire argument by which this writer attempts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to slavery , as he thinks , is that they " do not approve of the institution . " This we have done , not so much for the sake of showing the inconclusiveness of the reasoning , as for the sake of raisiz*g the inquiry , what must be the moral state of a mind that can use such logic , or can find any force in it , on such a subject . The man who can confound the idea of the equality of personal rights with the idea of equality in wealth and condition , and who can infer that because all men are not equally rich , therefore it is right that the poor should be slaves  --  the man who from the fact that some people in every civilized and industrious country , are either incapable of earning a support for themselves and their families by their labor , or unable to find remunerative employment , can deduce the conclusion that an institution which makes merchandise of human beings , and which in some States denies to half the a ion the ownership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injustice  --  the man who can think that if a slave is not compelled by the fear of punishment to perform quite as much labor as some freemen in he hope of gain , and if he is relieved from the necessity ( by being denied the opportunity and the right ) of forethought for himself and his children , there is no wrong in the institution which makes him a slave  --  the man who can argue that because in a state of freedom families are sometimes separated and broken up by affliction and death or by the pressure of poverty , therefore // there is no injustice in tearing husband and wife asunder by the hand of power , and none in robbing parents of their children-the man who can gravely argue in a Protestant religions journal , that because inflammatory and fanatical books are printed somewhere , therefore it is right not only that the circulation and reading of those books should be prohibited , but that millions of human beings for whom the Gospel was revealed , should be by law forbidden to be taught to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the grossest popular ignorance , established and guarded by law , is better , more hopeful in respect to temporal and spiritual interests , than a system of public schools in which every child shall have the opportunity of acquiring the rudiments of universal knowledge  --  the man who can weave all this into an argument designed to win approval for the institution of slavery as it exists in the slaveholding States of this Union , is not merely a blunderer . His defect is a defect not of logic merely , but of moral sense . By sophistry or by sin , or by both together , his heart has been hardened , his moral nature has been blinded and seared , till he is no longer cognizant of the most axiomatic distinctions between right and wrong . The same moral defect characterizes all the defenses of slavery as it exists . They invariably assume , at one point or another , that there is no such thing as justice , in the sense in which justice is synonymous with equity-no such equality of man with man as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second great commandment , honored alike in the Old Testament and in the New , presupposes . Invariably they are constructed after the same general , fashion , and with the same unconsciousness of moral distinctions . It was divinely predicted ( so runs the argument ) that all the descendants of Ham should be slaves : the negroes , and all in whose veins there is any tincture of African blood , are descendants of Ham : therefore the concrete institution of slavery as it exists in the Southern States , is right . If the perversion of Scripture in the first member of the syllogism , and the violent assumption of an unproved and forever unprovable genealogical fact in the second , are significant of intellectual perverseness , the conclusion is no less significant of a seared conscience . Such a conclusion , even if the premises were true , is as if Judas and Caiaphas and Pilate , knowing what it was that they were doing , and knowing that " the law and the prophets and the psalms " had foretold the humiliation and the crucifixion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was no injustice or wickedness in their proceedings , // and that the timid disciples who would have hindered the consummation if they could , and the women from Galilee who stood weeping near the cross , were infidels and fanatics . The New Testament ( so runs the argument ) requires masters to give to their servants that which is just and equal ; therefore there is no injustice or iniquity in the inetitution which reduces millions to a hopeless bondage , keeping back the hire of all their labor , and denying that even their persons are their own . Our slaves are fat and sleek , ( so runs the argument , )  --  the tasks which we compel them to perform are not greater than what freemen elsewhere are bound to do under the stimulus of hope and affection ; they have no care for the future , having no prospect of anything but bondage for themselves or for their children therefore the institution which enslaves them and puts them out of the allegiance of the State without any fault of theirs save that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them legally incapable of any human relation-is worthy of approval ; and he who thinks that they have any natnral and inalienable rights which such an institution violates , is a fanatic and an Abolitionist . When men argue in such methods and come to such conclusions , it is preposterous to answer them as if they were only entangled by errors in logic . Such reasoning , in support of such conclusions , should not merely be censured as incoherent and inconclusive . It should rather be denounced to the moral sense as wicked and inhuman . Yet we have seen that such is , at this moment , the position of Southern Christianity as a whole . The religious bodies in the slaveholding States have apostatized with one accord from the principles which they formerly held , or to which , as professed by Christian people everywhere else , they gave at least a silent consent . Doubtless many individuals , scattered throughout the region of the apostasy , hold in a safe and quiet way , the old principles of righteousness , and like their fathers are hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicable . But , except in a very limited district of the South , no such feeling of hope or of desire finds utterance through any organ of Southern opinion . All the authentic utterances that can be taken as representing in any sense the churches and ecclesiastical powers of the slaveholding States , show that the testimony which this writer in the Church Review has given concerning them , is true . They have undertaken to vindicate not only the holding of slaves whom the State has put into that condition , and whose emancipation is forbidden by the State , but slavery itself in the abstract and in the concrete- " the institution of slavery as it exists . " They have undertaken not // merely to excuse the continued existence of that institution as an evil which must be tolerated till it can be gradually and safely abolished , but to vindicate it as intrinsically just and as having an ample charter in the record of God 's revelation . It is not an idle curiosity to ask how this apostasy happened . In what way was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moral law , calling themselves by the name of a Saviour whose work of divine love toward them is fitliest and most frequently represented by the figure of hi* redeeming them out of slavery , and praying to a God revealed as the avenger of the oppressed , were led into a heresy so offensive to Christian sensibility ? We answer , The Southern churches were brought into this shameful position , not as Judas was led to the betrayal of his Lord-by selfish calculation and the love of filthy lucre , but rather as Peter was led to the denial of his Master-by a fear that paralyzed the conscience . A little more than twenty years ago , the Southampton insurrection , occurring at a time when the price of slaves was depressed in consequence of a depression in the price of cotton , gave occasion to a sudden development of opposition to slavery in the legislature of Virginia . A measure for the prospective abolition of the institution in that ancient commonwealth , was proposed , earnestly debated , eloquently urged , and at last defeated with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great a peril , and strengthened soon afterwards by an increase in the market value of cotton and of slaves , the slaveholding interest in all the South was stimulated to new activity . Defenses of slavery , more audacious than had been heard before , began to be uttered by Southern politicians at home , and by Southern Representatives and Senators in Congress . A panic seized upon the planters in some districts of the southwest . Conspiracies and plans of insurrection were discovered . Negroes were tortured or terrified into confessions . Obnoxious white men were put to death without any legal trial , and in defiance of those rules of evidence which are insisted on by Southern laws . Thns a sudden and convincing terror was spread through all the South . Every man was made to know that if he should become obnoxious to the guardians of the great Southern " institution , " he was liable to be denounced and murdered . It was distinctly and imperatively demanded that nobody should be allowed to say anything , anywhere , against slavery . The movement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York with " immediate abolition " for their motto , was made use of to stimulate the terror and the fury of the South . The United States // mails were broken open for the sake of finding and pillaging the " incendiary matter " supposed to be put in circulation by the Anti-slavery societies . Public meetings were held in Charleston and other Southern cities ; and the people of the free States were required to abolish by law or by mob-violence , as might be most convenient and effectual , all freedom of the press and of speech against slavery , and so to save the Union . The position of political parties and of candidates for the pres. idency , just at that juncture , gave special advantage to the agitators-an advantage that was not neglected . Everything was done that practiced demagogues could contrive , to stimulate the South into a frenzy , and to put down at once and forever all opposition to slavery . The clergy and the religious bodies were summoned to the patriotic duty of committing themselves on the side of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we mistake not , that their apostasy began . They dared not say that slavery as an institution in the State is essentially an organized injustice , and that though the Scriptures rightly , and wisely , enjoin justice and the recognition of the slave 's brotherhood upon masters , and conscientious meekness and patience upon slaves , the organized injustice of the institution ought to be abolished by the shortest process consistent with the public safety and the welfare of the enslaved . They dared not even keep silence under the plea that the institution of slavery is political , and therefore not to be meddled with by religious bodies or religious persons . They yielded to the demand . They were carried along in the current of the popular frenzy ; they joined in the clamor , " Great is Diana of the Ephesians ; " they denounced the fanaticism of abolition , and permitted themselves to be understood as certifying in the name of religion and of Christ , that the entire institution of Slavery " as it exists , " is chargeable with no injustice and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapse from duty and from the first principles of righteousness , it is not strange that not repenting and bringing forth works meet for repentance-not going out like Peter under the Master 's look of sorrow and reproof , and weeping bitterly , they have " waxed worse and worse . " After such a lapse on their part , it is hardly wonderful that at the time of the Presbyterian schism in 1838 , Presbyterians of the New School party in Virginia descended to the unsuccessful baseness of pretending that their antagonists were unsound on the subject of Southern interests , inasmuch as the great Old School leader , Dr. IR . J. Breckeuridge , of Kentucky , had retained his integrity as a free and fearless opponent of slavery after the old style of Presbyterian orthodoxy . Nor is it to be wondered at that VOL . XII . 66 // among all the utterances of opinion that can be regarded as proceeding directly or indirectly from the religious bodies of the South , in this year of grace 1854 , there is heard no breath of protest or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violation not only of justice but of the public interest and the public faith , to raise the price of slaves and to stimulate the hideous traffic in human flesh by extending the area of slavery . Those religious bodies , as represented by their various organs , and by their leading men , have sold themselves into a bondage from which nothing less than the power and grace of God can redeem them . 19 uless God in his mercy shall bring them back from the apostasy in which they now so basely glory , they will not dare to raise the faintest objection on grounds of justice and religion against the proposed restoration of the African slave-trade ; for in the condition to which they have fallen they have no grounds of justice or religion on which such an objection can be raised . The flimsy sophistries with which they attempt to justify the institution of slavery as it exists , will be instantly exposed and exploded if they attempt to withhold them from the justification of the slave trade as it did exist before Congress was invested with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be deplored , that hardness of heart , that practiced insensibility to the most elementary moral distinctions , which has learned to tolerate without remonstrance or rebuke the coast-wise and inland slave-trade from Maryland and Virginia to Louisiana and Texas , is all-sufficient to endure , without a murmur of disapproval , a restoration of the slave-trade from Africa to New Orleans and to ilayti , under the flag of the United States . We will not here enter upon the question whether if this apostasy continues , the relations of mutual recognition and intercourse between the churches thus apostate and the churches of similar denominations elsewhere , can be perpetuated . But we may say that the churches in these free States should at least keep themselves pure . They ought not to tolerate in their own *ninistry , or among their members , the offense of holding forth that antichristian doctrine to which the Southern churches have so generally apostatized from the position which they held kwenty years ago . That doctrine has begun to be propagated , *raftiily and timidly , in the Northern Churches , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston is a fraud . If the *author of " A Letter of Inquiry to Ministers of the Gospel of LII denominations , on Slavery , " can be identified , as " a Northern Presbyter " or church member , the church with which he is connected ought to deal with him promptly in the way of fit rebuke and censure .
