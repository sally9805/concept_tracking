txt ART . IV. - THE RELATION OF BAPTIZED CHILDREN TO THE CHURCH . An Exposition of the law of Baptism ; as it regards the mode and the sulijects . By EDwIN HALL , Pastor of the First Congregational Church , Norwalk , Conn . Fourth edition , revised and enlarged . New York : Baker &amp; Scribuer , 145 Nassau street . 1850 . Ai*nn many hopeful signs of the times , there is one alarming characteristic . The homes of our land appear to be degenerating . Is there not a decrease of household piety ? and a weakening of domestic bonds and affections ? The period of youth , that period once characterized by modesty and diflidence , by regard for parental counsel and authority , and by respect for age and experience , is well nigh abolished . Children spring up at once into men and women , they are precocious in their desires and passions , prematurely ambitious and avaricious , eager to cast off the restraints of home and set up for independence . A class of philosophers noticing this tendency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipate the day when the conjugal relation shall be avowedly , as it now often proves in fact , a temporary arrangement : when the love of l ) parents and children , of brothers and sisters , amiable prejudices and excusable , perhaps useful , in a dark age , will give place to a democratic philanthropy in the strong light of a higher civilization . To counteract this tendency , to redeem and save our homes , the gracious covenant of God with believers in respect to them and their households , needs to be restored to its legitimate place in the faith and regard of his people . We propose therefore , to institute the following inquiry What is the actual position of baptized children , under the economy of redeeming grace , as regards the essential qualifications of membership in the church of Christ ? The original covenant made with Abraham was in these words : " And I will establish my covenant between me and thee , and // thy seed after thee , in their generations , for an everlasting covenant , to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( Gen. 17 : 7 . ) This covenant included the patriarch and his seed . In iRom. 11 : 16 , 17 , 18 , the following occurs : " For if the first fruit be holy , the lump is also holy : and if the root be holy , so are the branches : and if some of the branches be broken off , and thon , being a wild olive tree , wert graffed in among them , and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree ; boast not against the branches ; but if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee . " Thus the perpetuity of that covenant and the extension of its privileges to Gentile converts are beautifully symbolized . The original covenant embraced children . That covenant is still in force , and includes children now . This is the ground taken in this article . If it be maintained , then what is the position of baptized children , or in other words , children embraced in this covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong expectation that they will early give evidence of piety . It is to be shown first , that the Abrahamic covenant is still in furce ; and secondly , that being in force it authorizes the strong expectation that children embraced in it , or baptized children , will early give evidence of piety . It is to be understood , however , that we speak of children whose parents are true believers , not mere nominal Christians , and whose views , sentiments , and influence in reference to their children , in a good degree correspond with their obligations . The external rite of infant baptism , apart from its connection with such parental character and conduct , is with out value ; it is the seal of a bond the essential condition of which has not been fulfilled . But before proceeding to the scriptural evidence of the proposition we have undertaken to maintain , we wish to present certain considerations that seem strongly to favor the same conclusiOn and to prepare the mind to find such evidence in the scriptures . First , God in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eternity of the whole human race dependent upon the conduct of the first human pair . Their fall involved their posterity in sin and ruin . Every individual of the race enters the world with a vitiated nature , some say with a sinful nature , others say with a nature that uniformly leads to sin when moral agency begins ; all say with a nature , that would have resulted in the eternal ruin of all , had not God mercifully interposed with redeeming grace . This merciful interposition was no part of the original constitution of things , according to which the consequences of Adam 's disobedience passed over , and affected // in so serious a manner his posterity . That constitution itself with this liability of abuse was among the works and arrangements , which God on resting from creation contemplated with entire satisfaction and pronounced very good . With this constitution before us , we shall not deem it matter of surprise to find in the economy of grace , an arrangement of an analogous character by which spiritual blessings are pledged to parents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own piety and fidelity . However let us not be understood to assert or intimate , that these blessings come through the operation of any natural law of descent . That is not our view . It is indeed among things supposable , that the direction of this natural law is reversed in the case of children born of believing parents , and that its reversed operation renders it as much a matter of course , that such children should enter the world with a bias to the right , as it is that the offspring of irreligious parents are born with a bias to evil . Although this hypothesis is among possible suppositions , yet it is by no means one that we regard as tine . It is referred to , that it may be disclaimed . The point of analogy between the original constitution of things as respects the relation between parents and children , and the economy of redemption in that regard , is the fact of dependence under each of children in reference to spiritual guod , upon the character and conduct of their parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of sequence is the same in both cases , nor is that important to the argument . This dependence being known to exist in one divine arrangement does more than obviate any presumption against its being found in another bearing u*xn the same interests ; it creates a rational ground of expectation that it will be found there . In the second place , in the established course of things in this world , the good character and conduct of parents contribute to the temporal welfare of their children . Every father knows that if he be virtuous in his habits , enterprising and industrious in his calling , and win for himself a name among men , the advantage of such a course will not be confined to himself ; but will extend to his children . He knows that their temporal destiny is in an important sense in his hands , that upon hini , his character , influence and exertions , they are dependent for subsistence , for manners , for moral habits , for the means of education , and for position in society ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world from the point of elevation to which he may have raised them , that they will go forth guided by his counsels , furnished by his means , and under the auspices and prestige of his name . He knows that on his departure from the earth he shall // leave to them whatever wealth he may have gained , whatever honors he may have won , all the temporal results , the accumulated fruits of his whole life . The extension to things spiritual of the principle that underlies this general arrangement in regard to things temporal , might rationally be expected . Such an extension of the principle is what we discover in the gracious covenant into which God enters with believers in behalf of their children . In the third place , God has placed parents in a position , and invested them with authority in relation to their children , that afford every conceivable advantage for forming the mind and moulding the character . He has commanded them , in the use of those advantages and in the exercise of this authority , to train up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they in a spirit of obedience and piety enter heartily into the design of this divine scheme , and in some good degree execute the human part of it  --  the part assigned to them-will God suffer it to fail of its contemplated result , by withholding on his part that grace which is essential to its efficacy ? The manifest importance of this view will justify something more than a passing glance . Let us consider the natural position of parents , and the authority delegated to them in reference to their children . On entering the world , the infant , a sensitive mass of passive organized matter , inclosing the germ of a spiritual and immortal being , is committed for protection and nurture to the care and offices of its parents . Months elapse ere it can comprehend the import of the simplest word , during which the impressions made . upon it are conveyed by the mode in which it is physically treated by them , by the tones of their voices , and the expression of their countenances . And it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education has not already begun , that as to any effect upon its character , it is a matter of indifference , whether the manifestations to which it is subjected are gentle or rough , whether the tones that fall upon its ears are affectionate and soothing or harsh and irritating , whether the countenances to which it looks up always beam with kindness and love or are frequently lit up with the frown and glare of evil passions . The influence exerted upon it in these ways can not indeed be fully described or accurately measured . Let it not on that account be set down as of no importance . At length the meaning of words begins to dawn upon the opening understanding , and the period of instruction by verbal statement and precept and of control by comumandument arrives . The mind , naturally inquisitive and thirsting for knowledge , and at the same time docile and credulous , eagerly imbibes whatever ideas are presented for its recep // tion . Con8cience is unfolding itself and gradually acquiring its rules of right and wrong , the elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depravity has been but partially developed in action , it has not become entrenched in fixed habits of transgression . With all his opening faculties in this absorbent state , the child is snbmerged in the waters of parental influence . They answer his inquiries , unravel his perplexities , solve his doubts . They are the medium through which the ideas of all things beyond household objects and incidents reach him , they are his oracle on matters of religious truth , their opinion and practice his standard of right on questions of moral obligation . As time rolls on he comes into more direct contact with persons and things beyond the domestic circle , but still he remains subject to their rule as to the nature and extent of that intercourse . Their will is law as to the methods and means of his education , in respect to labor and amusement , with regard to the books to be read , companions to be cherished , and the thousand other arrangements that constitute the moral world in which he lives and moves and has his being . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcing their authority ; they have also the special sanction of God to invest it with weight and solemnity . " Honor thy father and thy mother . " " Children , obey your parents in the Lord , for this is right . " " Children , obey your parents in all things , for this is well pleasing to God . " Such is the natural position and delegated power of parents from the entrance of their children into the world , through the whole of that portion of their lives during which the character is formed . What a perfect system of influence has God placed at their disposal ! To what end he would have them devote it in all its energy , he has not left them in doubt . " Train up a child in the way he should go . " " Bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord . " Now , if they are obedient and faithful , not perfectly so , but to such a degree as sincere Christian parents may hope to reach , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by withholding his blessing ? With these considerations in mind , can we think it wonderful that there should be found in the Bible a covenant in which God pledges himself to do what we have seen there is independent reason to expect he would do ? We now proceed to examine the Abrahamic covenant . What was that covenant ? Is it still in force ? If so , what is its import in behalf of baptized children ? To ascertain the character of the covenant , it is necessary to consider several passages in Genesis that refer to it . Gen. 12 : 1,2,3 : " Now the Lord had said unto Abram : get thee // out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father 's house , unto a land that I will show thea . And I will make of thee a great nation , and I will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessino " * And I will bless them that bless thee , and curse him that curseth thee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blessed . " Gen. 15 : 4 , 5 , 6 " And , behold , the word of the Lord came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir , but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir . And he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them ; and he said unto him , so shall thy seed be . And he believed in the Lord ; and he counted it to him for righteousness . " Gen. 17 : 1-11 " The Lord appeared to Abram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God : walk before me and be thou perfect . And I will make my covenant between me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly . And Abram fell on his face : and God talked with him , saying , As for me , behold , my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of many nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but thy name shall be Abraham : for a father of many nations have I made thee . And I will make thee exceeding fruitful , and I will make nations of thee ; and kings shall come out of thee . And I will establish my covenant between me and thee , and thy seed after thee , in their generations , for an everlasting covenant , to be a God to thee , and to thy seed after thee . And I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God . And God said unto Abraham , thou shalt keep my covenant therefore , thou , and thy seed after thee , in their generations . This is my covenant , which ye shall keep between me and you , and thy seed after thee ; Every man-child among you shall be circumcised . And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskins ; and it shall be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These several passages taken together teach that in a series of manifestations , God made , established and sealed a covenant with Abraham his friend , having respect to blessings temporal and spiritual , the temporal sustaining to the spiritual the relation of subordinate means to a higher end  --  the relation of scaffolding to the building , of the casket to the treasure . The temporal blessing promised was a numerous natural posterity , who should have for a possession the laud of Canaan , and be distinguished among all the nations of the earth . The spiritual blessings pledged in the covenant with Abraham were , that Jehovah would be a God to him and his seed after // him ; that the Messiah in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed , should , as to the flesh , be of his seed ; and that he , Abraham , should be the father of many nations . The meaning of this last phrase is explained by the apostle Paul , IRoin. 4 : 11-17 : " He ( Abraham ) received the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith , which he had yet being uncircumcised : That he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be not circumcised ; that righteousness might be imputed to them also . " " For the promise , that he should be heir of the world , was not to Abraham , or to his seed , through the law , but through the righteousness of faith . " " Therefore it is of faith , that it might be by grace : to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed ; not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all . As it is written , T have made thee a father of many nations " - that is , Abraham was to be the patriarch of a spiritual household consisting at first of his own natural descendants , and embracing ultimately the regenerated nations of the earth , and so he would become the heir of the world . Such was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covenant having been fulfilled in those particulars which were in their own nature , incidental , subordinate and temporary , remains in force as to the matters spiritual embraced in it , or whether it has been disannulled or superseded . Has that covenant , which promised , among other things , a Messiah in the line of Abraham , in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed , ceased to be operative ? Have we not now a Savior who took upon him , not the nature of angels , but the seed of Abraham  --  and are not the blessings of his salvation spreading at this hour among the nations of the earth ? Has the covenant which promised to the patriarch a spiritual seed among Gentile nations become null and void ? Are there not multitudes of those of whom Abraham as to blood was ignorant , and whom Israel acknowledged not , now exercising that faith which he had being uncircumcised ; multitudes of Gentiles who are Christ 's , and therefore , according to the inference of the apostle , Abraham 's seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not the law which came by Moses do away or disannul the covenant made with Abraham ? - The covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law which was four hundred and thirty years after , can not disannul that it should make the promise of none effect-saith the apostle Paul . It was in pursuance of the covenant , that God proceeded in that matter . He beheld the descendants of his friend in their degradation in Egypt . He heard their groaning , and with signs // and wonders and an outstretched arm , he delivered them out of the hand of Pharaoh and bore them as on eagle 's wings to the land promised to their fathers . In pursuance of the covenant he gave them his holy law , and for their spiritual edification established among them a ritual of worship , the shadow of better things to come ; he arranged for their government a civil code happily adjusted to the ecclesiastical establishment  --  the whole system being admirably fitted to their state and suited to preserve among them the knowledge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as a high wall of separation between them and the surroundino ' heathen nations . " He brought the vine , " his visible church , pout of Egypt ; he cast out the heathen and planted it ; he prepared room before it ; and caused it to take deep root , and it filled the land . " The law of Moses having answered , in its day , the end for which it was designed , waxed old and vanished away at the approach of Christianity . Now what relation did Christianity sustain to the covenant ? It was another and grand step in its fulfillment , it was the coming of the promised Messiah , it was the destruction of those embankments that limited the current of its blessings to a particular race , that they might flow abroad unobstructed among all the nations of the earth . On this point the New Testament writers are full , explicit , and glowing . In their view the Old and New Testament churches were identical , founded on one and the same covenant . How clearly this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ olive tree ! The argument of the apostle is , that the Gentiles now occupy the position in the church of God , which was once filled by the Jews , but from which they fell by unbelief . They , the descendants of Abraham ,  --  the natural branches-were broken ofF by unbelief ; the Gentiles-branches from a wild olive treewere graffed in through faith and partake of the richness and fatness of the olive tree . The natural branches may again be graffed into their own olive tree , if they continue not in unbelief . Thus , the church is but one olive tree ; there has been no other , there is to be no other . Zachariah , the father of John the Baptist , speaking as he was moved by the Holy Ghost , declares , that Jesus Christ came to perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant , the oath which he swore to our father Abraham . This surely is to the point that Christ came not to destroy but to fulfill the covenant . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , being made a curse for us ; for it is written , cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree : that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ : that we might receive the // promise of the spirit through faith . Brethren , I speak after the manner of men . Though it be but a man 's covenant , yet if it be confirmed , no man disannulleth , or addeth thereto . " " Know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham . " We are compelled to omit many other equally apposite passages , but the passages cited are sufficient to show that the covenant made with Abraham has not been repealed or annulledthat it is still in full force , and forms the basis of the Christian church . Therefore , he that believes now , or is Christ 's , is Abraham 's seed , and an heir according to the promise ; he comes into the place of Abraham , he stands in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is as fully authorized to consider not himself only but his child also , as included in the covenant , and entitled to the application of its seal . That seal , it is true , has been changed ; it was circumcision , it is now baptism . Abraham believed God , and by divine commandment was circumcised ; the apostles were directed to baptize those who believed . The import of the seal remains the same , though its form is altered . Circumcision was a bloody rite , it was always a grievous yoke to be borne . It had come to be associated , in the minds of many Jews , with the formalities of Judaism , and had it been retained might have led them to imagine that these also were to be engrafted upon Christianity . The change in the form of the seal did not in the least affect the substance of the covenant , did not disannul any part of it , nor add aught thereto . It is as Qomprehensive since the alteration as it was before . And being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sealed now as certainly as they were then-the authority for infant baptism is as clear as was the authority for infant circumcision . But where is your specific text , demand those who differ with us on this point , in a tone of triumph ,  --  Where is your specific text warranting the baptism of infant children ? This mode of putting them atter is ingenious , we had almost said , cool . Where is our authority for not mutilating the covenant of God , for forbearing to dissect out a most interesting and important feature of it , for doing what it requires us to do ? May not the tables be turned here ? Is not a specific scriptural warrant required to justify an opposite course ? If it be but a man 's covenant-if it be confirmed-no man disannulleth it or addeth thereto . Yet , the language of the New Testament on the subject is precisely such as we should expect it to be , on the supposition that the views we advocate , are just and scriptural . Infant baptism is alluded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion , no disagreement in practice . Specific precepts were not given , because they were not needed . The covenant itself , whose perpetuity was fully argued and clearly settled , was plain , was understood and observed . Incidental statements implying that the children of believers were included with their parents in its provisions , and were baptized , occur here and there . All is natural and easy , and in keeping . A few specimens will suffice . " The Lord opened the heart of Lydia , that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul . And when she was baptized and her household she besought them To the jailer who asked what he should do to be saved , Paul said , " Believe on the Lord Jesns Christ and thou shalt be saved , and thy house . " The language strikingly resembles that addressed to Abraham , " I will be a God to thee and thy seed after thee . " " The jailer was baptized and all his straightway . " Paul baptized the household of Stephanas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice the excruciating ingenuity by which their plain import is attempted to be explained away . We quote them to show that the language of the New Testament on the face of it is in entire harmony with the view we have presented , and such as we might expect on the supposition that that view is correct . The conclusion then is , that the covenant made with Abraham is still in force , that it includes the infant children of believers , and authorizes their baptism . We come now to our second proposition . What is the import of this covenant in behalf of children that are thus included and baptized ? Does it furnish ground of strong expectation that they will early give evidence of piety ? The covenant phrase , " I will be a God to thee , " is to the adult believer a pledge of the eternal favor and friendship of God . On what philological principle can this phrase be understood to mean less when the sentence is continued by adding , " and to thy seed " ? To say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child believes , is to say the phrase has no meaning at all as a special promise to the believing parent . For God will be the God of those children that are out of the covenant  --  the seed of the ungodly-provided they believe . " Whosoever believeth shall be saved . " Is it said that the fallen child is not qualified to enjoy the friendship and favor of God ? We ask , are there any obstacles to his being qualified which God can not overcome ? The very point is whether the promise can mean anything unless it be understood to justify the expectation that the child will believe ,  --  that he will be qualified to enjoy the favor and friendship of God . // Again , baptism is in reference to the church an initiatory rite . XMe need not argue this point , as there is no difference of opinion in regard to it . Our Baptist brethren are strong in this conviction . Writers on our side of the question are constrained to admit that baptism introdnces the child into the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy . The scriptural qualification for admission into it in the case of adults , is genuine piety . This candidates are required to profess , and of this they must furnish credible evidence , before they can with propriety be received . Consider next that God authorizes , nay more , requires believing parents to cause their infant children to be baptized , and so to be introduced into his church . What is the intention of God in thus proceeding ? Is it that these children so introduced into his holy church shall remain in it ? How can we doubt that ? Any other supposition would lay him open to the imputation of folly and fickleness . Does he intend they shall remain in it without piety ? This is not supposable . The only supposition is that He intends to renew them . Is there not ground here for a strong expectation , that such children will early give evidence of piety ? Such , in our view , is the import of the Abrahamic covenant in behalf of baptized children . And we showed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is nothing in the constitution of things , nothing in the proceedings of divine Providence , that furnishes any presumption against the correctness of this constitution . Nay , more , it is in harmony with everything in the government of God that might be supposed at all analogous to the matter under consideration . There is , however , a single objection to this view which we will notice . It is said that this fine theory is overturned by facts ; that few baptized children early give evidence of piety ; that the majority of them never exhibit such evidence at all ; in short , that they are not found to differ from other children . That there is some ground for such a representation we do not deny . Facts of this description very naturally attract the attention of the irreligious ; they are described by them in sweeping and exaggerated terms . They also furnish our Baptist brethren with abundant staple for argument , and they have , moreover , lowered the tone of many of the friends of the covenant as to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of Scripture , leading them to adopt such construction of particular passages as they deem most easily reconcilable with this state of things . In regard to the objection founded on these alleged facts , we observe that it is faulty in point of princijAe . It is not true , as // it implies , that the import of the covenant , or of any promises of God , is to be measured by the degree of benefit actually secured by men under it . All his promises are conditional , and their meaning is not lowered because the conditions are not fulfilled . Our unbelief or neglect does not affect their import . Let God be true and every man a liar . Then , as to the facts . Let it be remembered , as it is undoubtedly the case , that many who offer their children for baptism , are destitute of true religiofi ; in some families this is true of both parents , in others of one of them . Let it be remembered also that such as in the judgment of charity are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are often specially deficient in regard to parental obligations . Nor do we hesitate to acknowledge this to be true of clergymen ; they are ordinarily better preachers and pastors , we think , than they are fathers . Certainly , these things deserve consideration before we allow facts , in reference to the actual character of baptized children , to limit the import and meaning of God 's gracious covenant . But after aU concessions have been made , it is nevertheless true , that piety may be traced in families from generation to generation ; it is true that , in the revivals of religion , the majority of subjects are among the young , and belong to religious households . Statistics on this subject , were they to be gathered up , would most clearly demonstrate that God has not forgotten his covenant , and that the blessings of it are bestowed upon the church in as full measure as , all things considered , could be expected . This view of the import of the covenant , in regard to baptized children , invests the rite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not uncommon nor , we fear , groundless , that there is manifested in our churches a growing indifference to this ordinance . By some parents it is neglected altogether , by others it is observed after urging and expostulation , by others still , voluntarily and promptly indeed , yet , apparently without any very distinct apprehension of its import , or any deep impression of its value . The preparation for the rite consists , we have reason to fear , in too many cases , in deciding upon the name to be given and the robe to be worn . The chief solicitude felt at the time is lest the child should discompose the assembly by his unseasonable cries . The ceremony is performed , the prayer is offered , the occasion passes by , and there , too frequently as a matter of fact , the affair ends . This indifference is to be traced either to the absence of piety on the part of parents , to a low degree of it , or , and as we believe , more commonly , to of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance // views and impressions of the import and value of the covenant of which it is the seal . Signs and seals , when they cease to represent anything important or valuable , naturally become matters of indifference . Titles and badges that convey no rank , that invest with no power , are contemptible . Crowns and scepters , apart from place and authority , are mere baubles . So religions rites , emptied of their meaning , become worthless forms and lose their hold on all but superstitious minds . We see then what is needed in order that the ordinance in question may be restored to its proper place in the estimate and regard of the church . The import of the covenant must be understood ; confidence in the faithfulness of God must be strengthened ; the appropriate channels through which heavenly blessings flow down upon the children of believers must be opened , and then the ordinance of infant baptism will no longer be neglected or undervalued . Then the church would look upon such baptized children as her charge ; she would regard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lambs of the fold with tender care she would admonish their parents , and encourage and aid them in the work of training them for God ; she would expect , and ordinarily would not be disappointed , that in due time they would be found ready to sanction what had been done in their behalf , and to subscribe with their own hands to be the Lord 's . Many scenes in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ are fraught with deep interest . Such was that , when waked from sleep by his terrified disciples , he rose from his pillow in the ship on the tempest-tost sea of Galilee , and said to the furious winds and the dashing waves , " peace , be still , and they obeyed him ; " and that is another such scene , when Jesus stood with the weeping Martha and Mary in front of the cave in which lay the corpse of their brother and his friend . We behold first his lips quiver with emotion , and his eyes fill with tears in sympathy , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come forth ; " and the sheeted dead moves and rises up in obedience . But no scene of his history ( the garden and the cross excepted ) is more touching than when we hear his clear , mild voice rising above the din of the crowd that surrounded him , and saying , " Suffer little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me , for of such is the kingdom of heaven ; " and then see the multitude divide , and those little children brought to him , and received into his arms and blessed . The baptism of children is a sort of renewal of that scene , it is a covenant-keeping God taking our offspring into his arms , and while he admonishes us as parents , of our responsibility to train them for him , promising on his own part , and // setting his seal to the promise , that if we are obedient and faithful , he will be to them a God and portion . Next , a deep practical impression on the minds of christian parents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire and endeavors to secure its fulfillment in behalf of their children , would exert a most happy influence upon their own religious character . The parental relation itself enlarges the heart ; it presents dear objects of affection ; it opens new springs of feeling ; it furnishes fresh motives to exertion ; it awakens high and boundless hopes . Parents identify their children with themselves-they look upon them as parts of themselves-an extension and multiplication of their own being . Through them the circle of their hopes and fears , of their joys and sorrows , is immeasurably widened . In them they expect to outlive themselves-to survive their own dissolution . Behold that young mother ! with what ineffable tenderness she presses her smiling babe to her bosom . She is more delighted with your notice and praise of that than by any conipliments on her own loveliness . The father looks on with a countenance beaming with affection , slightly shaded with a feeling of responsibility . 0 the strength of this love ! Hear Jacob say , " It is enough ; Joseph , my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him before I die . " Hear David cry out in anguish of soul , " 0 my son Absalom ! my son , my son Absalom ! would God I had died for thee , 0 Absalom , my son , my son ! " When do men on drawing the sword throw away the scabbard , resolved to conquer or perish ? When do they fall , if fall they must , fighting in the last ditch , and to the last gasp of their lives ? It is when they feel that they are fighting for their homes , their wives and their children . God breathed into our hearts this love for our offspring , or rather it is his love to them flowing through our hearts , its appointed channel . The covenant sprung from the same exhaustless fountain of divine love . But this , our natural affection , strong and beautiful as it is , may be perverted to the injury of its objects , and to our own moral detriment : it may venerate avarice ; it may fan the fire of ambition* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , competitionsall having respect only to the worldly prospects of our children . This same natural affection , guided and sanctified by the spirit of the covenant , embraces children in all their interests , in all their relations , and specially as responsible creatures of God and heirs of immortality . It is then it lifts the heart above the world to God  --  to heaven . What motives to the cultivation of personal holiness the covenant presents to Christian parents ! - that they may always have access to their heavenly Father , that they may be ever ready to // lay hold upon it in faith , and to plead for its fulfillment without being condemned of their own hearts , and that their religion may be so deep and habitual , and so pervade the ordinary tenor of their lives , that their unconscious influence may daguerreotype only good impressions upon the susceptible minds that surround them in their daily walk . Then their positive efforts to fulfill their covenant obligation will all react favorably upon themselves . This will be the case with their endeavors so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors of life , that while their system tends to impress ideas and to form habits of order , industry and frugality in the household , it shall be seen by every one without explanation , and felt even by those too young to reflect on the subject , that the concerns of the present life are and are deemed subordinate to things spiritual and eternal . Parents will be profited themselves by striving earnestly to exercise their authority with judgment , impartiality and equity ; to govern without governing too much , without destroying all voluntariness , without turning the household into a machine . The effort to reach the happy medium will be a species of constant self-discipline . It will be a most profitable school ; the habitual study , to preserve religion , its duties and exercises , free from every disagreeable association ; the study how best to impart religious instruction and give spiritual counsel , to become all things to every individual of the family group ; not saying too much or too little , adapting what is said to the age , intellectual and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member ; the study to acquire the faculty of turning to good account circumstances and occurrences , joyful events , disappointments , seasons of sickness , the recovery of health , birth-days , the revolution of the seasons , the flowers of spring , the falling leaves of autumn ; the study to gain the art of shading off imperceptibly things temporal , till the thoughts , without being conscious of any abrupt transition , are raised to things eternal ; the study to become skillful in linking all things in their mind with God , in turning their little trials into submission , their happiness into gratitude , their , joy into praise ; the study to make such attainments and accomplish such results , how can it fail to exercise and improve every Christian grace ? Again , a revival of faith and interest in God 's covenant among the rnfli%8try , would benefit them , and augment their usefulness . One objection to the Catholic clergy is , that they are without domestic affections . Clerical piety is tinctured with a species of celibacy among us . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than with the salvation of individuals ; it is abstract , and consequently vague in its concep // tions , and diffused and weak in its affections . The clergyman , while musing over the concerns of whole sects , denominations and nations , forgets the spiritual condition and prospects of his own children , and of the children of his flock . And then the spirit of the age , about which so much is said , is bustling and mechanical . The intellect is tasked , the affections are neglected : an immense amount of religious matter is produced in sermons , speeches , addresses , and for newspapers and periodicals , to say nothing of the multitude of books that are poured out upon the world . But this matter so abundant is for the most part the fruit of the brain simply , and lacks the bloom and high flavor of those clusters that have sunned themselves into ripeness under the influence of large , warm , holy hearts . The age is fruitful in expedients to shorten processes-in inventions that abridge labor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedite things spiritual , we are in danger of leaving those great natural advantages that result from the constitution of the family , for our own inventions . It seems to be forgotten that there are processes that can not be hastened . The time required to traverse space may be indefinitely reduced . Cotton may be spun and woven , boards planed and matched , pins made and headed , and various other similar results reached by means and methods more easy and expeditious than formerly . But we believe wheat requires about the same number of months to reach perfection , and we have not learned that the time of the gestation of their young by animals is shortened in any degree , or that the period of full physical development is greatly diminished . These are vital processes , and such in a sense are the developmemits of character . It would be well for the ministry to consider this , and to rely less upon their own devices and more upon the covenanted grace of God . After all , it may be said , that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevation of Christian character , and a degree of parental fidelity that can not rationally be anti'cipated as a general attainment . Such remarks , which , in the judgment of some , smack of practical wisdom , often serve to cut the sinews of faith in the plainest and most precious promises , and to release the uneasy conscience from the pressure of indisputable obligation . Is there then no hope that the general tone of religious feeling may be elevated ? Must we ever live at this poor , dying rate ? Beside , the faith and practice of Christians in relation to covenant promises and duties have not come up to the standard reached in other respects . The duty of the church in regard to missions was as plainly inculcated in the Scriptures fifty years ago as it is at this day . The precepts and promises were strewed as thickly // and as conspicuously through the sacred volume . They were read and supposed to be understood . But , for some reason , they were practically disregarded . The great change that has taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general advance in Christian character , but by a special waking up to the claims of that particular branch of Christian obligation . The same thing has often occurred in the history of Christianity . Is it too much to hope for something of the kind in respect to the matter under consideration ? We confidently expect a great change of this character . Sin entering the world , and seizing upon and appropriating to its propagation all the constituted laws of descent , has , through them , corrupted all the generations of men , and thus given a terrible illustration of the power of the family constitution for evil . But in the work of redemption , we are persuaded the covenant authorizes the belief that God designs of his grace to furnish a counter illustration of its power for good . The work of Dr. Hall , at the head of this paper , has already been noticed in the New Englander , but as the fourth edition has recently been issued from the press , we have taken the opportunity afforded by the present discussion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able and satisfactory examination of the mode of baptism . Dr. Hall also takes up the leading subject of our present article , and we are happy to find a substantial agreement of views .
