HICKOK 'S EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY . ART . IV . - Empirical Psychology ; or , The Human . Jlind as given in Consciousness . By LATJRENS P. HICKOK , D. P. New York : Ivison and Phinney. 18*6 . OF this work , first published two years since , there has just appeared a new edition . As it is no mere compend or digest of previous knowledge , but has in it much that is bold and peculiar , it deserves and will justify more than a passing notice . There is not in it that careful and detailed discussion of particular mental powers which we find in Stewart and other authors ; but there is , in its place , a general survey and classification more radical and compplete than any hitherto presented . The acquisition of particulars , however important , is always of less moment than the possession of that broad view which presents an entire subject in its fundamental characteristics and abiding distinctions , and which makes the survey of the parts yet more pleasurable and profitable , by first giving their relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which particulars are grouped , and by which they are explained , bears us further towards true science , and gives us greater facility in acquiring and possessing the field before us , than the most laborious explorations and discussions of one or another of its detached portions . If this work has left much ground unoccupied , it has yet spread the outline of its survey over the whole . There is no elaborate and graceful completion of parts , but a strong , bold sketching of leading features . The first division of mental phenomena is threefold , into those of the Intellect , the Susceptibility , and the Will ; a triplicity which the author sustains in all his leading subdivisions . The Intellect , or the capacity of knowing , is again divided into the Sense , the Understanding , and the Reason . This division will detain us for a moment . What a vast amount of discussion lies behind these three words , - Sense , Understanding , and Reason , - words which a single breath can utter , and which , once uttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction of truth ! // There are not many more apt illustrations of the axiom , that single words thoroughly understood and well defined may contain and retain for future use conceptions which it has cost the best minds , in their successive efforts , ages to realize . What caskets of wealth and of wisdom are those terms which science , from amid the struggles of opinions and the throes of the human mind , is able , from time to time , to render as its offspring to the waiting world ! Gravitation , Affinity , Polarity , Reason , are each words that comprehend and incasure the results of the most powerful and continuous efforts of an incalculable series of the greatest intellects . Human knowledge is not homogeneous , - a mere accumulation of acquisitions obviously derived from the world about us . Our most simple judgments are complex , nor does the mind readily detect their parts , or the sources from which these parts are severally derived . It is not till the mind is capable of well-sustained and subtile effort , that it even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to refer these elements to their appropriate faculties . The proposition , The apple is spherical , will , in analysis , fall into three parts , each given to the mind by a distinct faculty . Considering the apple simply as made known to th eye in color , we have in the mind , as our first element , a perception . This perception , which is the subject of our propo. sition , is reached by the mind acting through the medium of sensation , and the mind , thus acting , constitutes the sense . The predicate of our proposition contains the idea of form , which is itself but a modification of the idea of space , being nothing more than the relations in space which the superficial particles of a body bear to one another . The idea of this special form , that of a sphere , being but a modification of the general ide a of space , is our second element , and is not given to us through sensation , but on the occasion of sensation is brought forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon is to be understood in its external relations in space . But these two - the perception given in the sense , the idea given in the reason - are united in a proposition , - the one being affirmed of the other . This act , by which we reach a conclusion , a judgment , is that of the understanding , and constitutes our third element . // So also in the expression , The apple is produced by the tree , we have the same phenomenal element , united in a judgment with the idea of production or causation , furnished by the reason ; and by this idea , the apple , as a present existence , is explained in its causal relations as the effect of something which has gone before it . Thus it is with all our knowledge . It pertains to the external , the phenomenal , but is not solely given by it or constituted from it . The mind , acting intuitively in the reason , furnishes on the demand of an occasion the appropriate ideas by which the phenomena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , space , resemblance , and those others which are necessary to make the world the orderly , intelligible product of complete wisdom . The office of the understanding , acting in memory , conception , association , abstraction , judgment , is to take all the phenomena given us in the sense , and to combine them with , and irnderstand them by , their corresponding ideas furnished in the reason . This process is reasoning , and if it be correct reasoning , the product is knowledge . The correlation between the sensations and the grouping , explaining ideas , is like that between matter and form , - between the plan and the details of the plan , - between the thought and the vocal sounds that give utterance to the thought , - between the divine conception and the creations which made that conception external and real . The reason is that faculty by which nature becomes a language to us , suggesting ideas , and comprehended and explained in ideas . It is to the world what the antiquarian is to the cipher : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere appearances , resting in the sense , into knowledge , occupying and gratifying the understanding . By the animal , the carvings on an obelisk are not apprehended as aught different from the marks of time on its surface ; but give him reason , and he immediately seeks something back of them by which he may unite and explain them . The sensational world is to man a cipher , and as the fundamental ideas of the solution have already been given to him , there remains , as his high mission , their complete and diverse ap // plication . Here the understanding busies itself , and the reason struggles to furnish it that apt modification of the idea of cause or resemblance which may unlock the mystery . The animal sees all things in space , and experiences them in time , but distinguishes them not from the space in which they abide , or from the time through which they exist . But man , gifted with reason , instantly apprehends things in their obvious space and time relations , and , by a careful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learns to understand the universe in all its multiplied forms , movements , positions , and sequences . So , too , in causation , the world is not able even to suggest an inquiry to a mind not endowed with reason ; but the mind so endowed takes this fundamental idea , and goes forth to explain , with a variety of conceptions and applications , mechanical , physical , and vital phenomena . Under the suggestions of experiment , and by the proofs of experiment , it insures its progress , till gradually the idea is made to settle down into the phenomena , as a thought into the characters which giv* it utterance . Early in the history of philosophy , the distinction between the two parts of knowledge furnished , the one by the reason , and the other by the sense , was apprehended , though not well understood or clearly defined . Philosophers , misled in part by the early success which attended mathematics , and by the independence of experience , which belongs to investigations in that department , were willing to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their parts from the primitive conception which enclosed them . But mathematics , with its few and simple ideas , and these considered only in their fixed numerical relations , can never be taken as an example of the true method of progress in other departments . Every purely ideal system , possessing itself of the form rather than of the substance of knowledge , has quickly , by the remote and empty character of its form tiLe , so far separated itself from things and facts as to perish in its own sterility of results . A reaction from this undue and dangerous estimate of ideas has more than once forced the mind of man , in its progress towards truth , into assigning to sensation and experience a position , as sources of knowledge , 32 // correspondingly dangerous . We can no more fly , winged of sense alone , than winged of reason alone ; the two , with answering parts and corresponding powers , must sustain the mind in its acquiring and knowing . The universality and necessity of those ideas which come to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere experience . Sensation , far from giving us those notions which make its phenomena orderly and comprehensible , can , as the material of knowledge , exist only by their means , and without them would be as empty of truth as the reflection in the mirror or in the eye of the animal . The hand may move for ever along the outline of an object , yet , unless there already exists in the mind the idea of direction , and of change of direction by which the movement is guided and made intelligible , no idea of form will thereby be given . Between these two extremes , philosophy has oscillated ; and that classification alone is radical and valuable which assigns the two elements of knowledge to their appropriate faculties , and makes them both minister to the processes of the understanding . The next important division of our author is that of the susceptibilities into the animal , rational , and spiritual . The first two of these classes arise naturally from the previous divisions of the intellect ; - the animal emotions springing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the rational , on the occasions given by the reason ; - and these two would seem to cover the whole ground , as no feeling can arise except in connection with some intellectual action , and the sources of intellectual action are now exhausted . Man is possessed of a free will , - is able to accept or reject certain ends of action . In the permanent choice of an end , he places himself in harmony with all that is included in that end , and in hostility with all that is excluded . This voluntary disposing of the soul our author terms a spiritual disposition , and finds in it " an independent source of feeling , and thus occasion for a distinct sphere of susceptibility . The spiritual susceptibility has its source in the l ) ersonal disposition , and is utterly exclusive of all that belongs to constitutional nature , whether of the animal or rational . " Of these spiritual emotions , the clearest illustrations given are those of // 1857.1 HICKOK ' S EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY . Christian love and faith . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is immediately given the occasion for new emotions , and the emotions of a heart going forth in love and faith are those termed spiritual . Such , so far as we understand it , is the basis of the third division of the susceptibilities , and in it we confess ourselves unable to discover any clear or valid distinction . That the spiritual emotions are preceded by an act of the will as a condition , though not as an efficient cause or occasion of their existence , can constitute no such distinction . In the animal emotions , it is not the qualities simply that draw forth our feelings , but those qualities in their relations to ourselves , our plans , our purposes . These relations depend sometimes on our volitions , and sometimes not ; sometimes on permanent , and sometimes on wayward purposes ; but whatever be the occasions of the relations in which qualities present themselves to us , it is evident that these occasions constitute no valid - basis for classification , since the emotions do not spring up in view of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , new relations . The bear in the forest may be an object of fear ; in the cage , of curiosity . Here , there is a change , not of object , but of relation , and that not by our act , but by the act of another . This hour we propose to spend in pleasure , and the friend that comes on business is now unwelcome , while he that seeks enjoyment is welcome ; the next hour we devote to business , and the emotions are reversed on the appearance of the same persons . The character of God is perfect , fitted to call forth love ; but we have opposed ourselves to his law ; our plans and the attributes of God are in mutual hostility ; the selfish heart , clinging to its own wilful gratifications , is able , with anger and resentment , to reject all that opposes its sinful purposes , and thus , with a constitutional ability of appreciating and loving the excellence of God 's character , it excludes love by the stronger and antagonistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a later period , the heart submits itself to God ; the barrier of transgression being now broken down , and conflicting passions driven out , the intellect readily apprehends , and the heart cheerfully responds to , the excellences before rejected . // In these instances , the emotion is modified by the relation in which we stand to the object of emotion ; yet , in all of them , the constitutional susceptibility existed previously to the relation , and was waiting to be called forth on the fitting occasion . If , then , our classification rests in part on the character of the object of emotion , whether it be given in the sense or in the reason , it must rest wholly upon that character ; we can not suddenly forsake this criterion , and establish a third class upon a new one . Certainly this is true when the new criterion would run through and destroy our two previous divisions , since many , both of our animal and rational emotions , as already seen , are preceded and modified in their occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spiritual susceptibility , friendship is also given in illustration . " Among individuals there may be kindred interests , pursuits , and constitutional temperaments ; and these may render two , or any number of them , mutually congenial to each other , and the intercourse of such may be intil ate and highly agreeable . But when there has been a decided commitment of soul , and a reciprocal flowing out of the spirit each to each , there is in this a union of dispositions ; and at once a cordiality of feeling springs up , much deeper and sweeter than all the conenialities of common interest or similar temperament . " Separating the philosophy from the rhapsody of this passage , we yet fail to see at what point the emotion of friendship is suddenly transmuted from a rational into a spiritual emotion . So far as feeling arises from mere convenience and a calculation of advantages , it is an animal emotion , and not friendship ; but when it springs from the higher qualities of beauty , truth , and virtue , given in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as existing in a living person , goes out in love to that person , it is then a rational emotion , and , if reciprocated , is the basis of what we term friendship . No act of the will , by which friends are set apart to each other , can otherwise modify this emotion than by giving to it a fuller , freer play . Animal feelings may indeed mingle with the rational , and our satisfaction may be increased by a secret sense of exclusive possession ; but these are not of the essence // IJICKOK ' $ EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLO Y. of the relation . This seems to us to lie solely in the emotions of admiration and love , drawn forth in view of high rational qualities , and thus , with or without a " commitment of soul , " to be neither other than , nor different from , a constitutional , rational emotion . The qualities which are the objects of emotion are given us through the sense and through the reason . In animal emotions , - setting aside that sympathy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - the objects of sense , in their relations to our enjoyments and plans , are the things contemplated ; and hence , as the occasions of these feelings are given wholly in our animal constitution , they are rightly termed animal . The qualities , on the other hand , given to us in the reason , are not only reached through this nobler mental power , but are able to kindle our emotions by what and for what they are in themselves , wholly aside from personal relations . It is an excellency that now occupies us , and not a gratifl*ation . The rational emotions , springing from qualities belonging to the reason everywhere , which are identical , necessary , and universal in all rational existence , are separated by a broad gulf from those transitory emotions which accompany our sentient existence . As the understanding reveals no qualities to the mind , it can not itself be the independent source of any emotion ; but it may employ itself , now in *nnfolding the properties and relations of external objects , thus giving breadth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of truth or virtue , thus helping to kindle a higher life of feeling . But beyond these , we have no further source of emotion . The only remaining division that invites attention is that of the Will , into Immanent Preferences , Governing Purposes , and Desultory Volitions . The term " preference " does not refer to taste or inclination , but designates a " proper election , " and is termed immanent as lying in the mind " without any overt manifestation . " " It was in thine heart to build an house to my name . " A purpose is an election of a general end of action , and , as abiding in the mind , prompting and guiding the successive executive acts by which the end is reached , it is named the governing purpose . " Turn // ing aside from the main end , while the governing purpose towards it is not renounced , is termed a desultory volition . " These divisions , as now explained , though marking differences , are yet open to some criticism . They seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relations in which the volitions stand to the action and character of the person putting them forth . A governing purpose and a desultory volition are equally " elections , " and , as elections , differ from each other by no fixed characteristic . The number of executive acts , by which a governing purpose completes itself , can be no such characteristic , as a desultory volition must also often include subsidiary acts , and this fluctuating number can never constitute a distinction of kind , and not always even of degree . The real difference ' marked by these two classes seems , as we have intimated , to lie between volitions , in their relations to the disposition and character of the person whose they are . Those by which a given disposition is secured , or which are in the direction of that disposition , are governing purposes ; those aside from , or opposed to , that disposition , are desultory volitions . That which is a governing purpose in one individual may , in another , be a desultory volition , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition from person to person , - it may shift its name backward and forward , while remaining intrinsically the same . So , also , the immanent preference of one may become the governing purpose of another . David has it in his heart , and Solomon has it in hand , to build the house of the Lord . Aside froni the fact that these divisions seem to fall short of marking real distinctions in mental acts , they are not made in reference to the same point , and hence overlap and include one another . An immanent preference relates to the mahifestation or suspension of the volition , and as all volitions are either manifested or suspended , the whole field is covered by immanent and manifest preferences . Again , a governing purpose and a desultory volition have reference to the disposition of the individual , the one securing and the other thwarting the disposition ; and here the whole field is a second time covered . The point of classification being thus shifted , // the divisions will blend with one another , and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either an incipient governing purpose or a desultory volition . These criticisms may , at least , show that the classification , in this part of the work , is not marked with entire clearness and firmness . The portion of the subject that seems especially to have drawn out the power of the author , to evince most clearly the strength and vigor of his thought , and to reward the reader most abundantly by the rich and suggestive character of the ideas presented , is that pertaining to the will and the freedom of its actions . In no department of knowledge is a true conception more important or more difficult to be reached . In none has the labor of the best minds so often served solely to mislead , tending to results the most intolerable and disastrous , by arguments apparently unanswerable . No conception , whether true or erroneous , so colors and modifies all our thinking , as this of the will . It stands broadly related with all departments of action , and through these relations it everywhere leaves its traces of a dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Necessity and chance are opposites and extremes . Nature , in the flow of all her events , alike in her vital and in her mechanical processes , is necessitated . The present is but a medium , receiving its power . from the past and bearing it on to the future . Each point , each force , is a point , is a force in the stream , caused and causing - first pressed and then pressing . Thought and feeling even , as they float on this current , have no power over it , and are themselves conditioned in their action by it . The stream , and the driftwood eddying , lingering , lodging , floating on its surface in sportive freedom , are yet swept on by the same irresistible causal power to ends , in all their accidents , fixed and unchangeable . Nature knows nothing beyond herself ; she draws all things into her ceaseless flow , and explains all things in these , their necessitated relations . Chance , on the other hand , cuts asunder every relation , loosens every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground between these two , or aside from these two ? If not , then is freedom impossible , and a will in freedom a de // lusive phantom , inviting and mocking pursuit . Our only escape from chance - from mere fortuity by which nothing is to be reached - is into the meshes of necessity , dragging us to one end , and one end only , whether of life or of death . A free will must , in action , be at once without chance and without necessity ; with all the certainty of law , and none of its indissoluble connections . The will must be able to act , at once , orderly and freely , uncontrolled and self-controlling , affected , yet unconstrained , by the pressure of motives . The links of necessity are to be broken asunder ; its certainty and order are not thereby to escape us . The conception which should contain this idea of will in freedom , it is evident , can never and should never render itself up to a logical criticism , or suffer an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such a process can proceed only along the links of fixed and causal relations , - can move only in the stream of nature ; and hence , all that it lays hold of , and passes over , it inevitably presses down and sinks into that stream . This would be to suffer our explanations to destroy our conceptions , and to throw away with one hand what we had just secured with the other . A free will , if the terms free and freedom are not wholly illusory , is something supernatural , - above and beyond the flow of nature ; and therefore no explanation which is itself of nature , and shares the necessity of nature , can be flung , like a net , upon it , except to drag it down and destroy it . It is the very condition of our effort that we rise above nature , and hence we can not , in that very effort , keep within her fixed logical relations . The idea of freedom , the alternative alike of necessity and of chance , is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the very nature of the case , unable to render a complete explanation of the conception , we may yet define the Will as " the capacity for electing . " This definition justifies itself to the common consciousness of men . Indeed , this common consciousness has ever been the citadel of freedom , from which the most subtle devices and enginery of logicians have not been able to expel it . Men are everywhere haunted with the conviction of having been able to do better than they // HICKOK ' S EMPIRICAL PSYCHOLOGY . have actually done , and the whole burden of guilt comes and can come to the human mind only in connection with a clear and well-defined consciousness that each step in the descent was one of choice . No reasoning has ever been able to break down in the minds of men the axiom of morals , that responsibleness is measured by ability . The strength of this common consciousness is also clearly seen in the reluctance with which the philosophy of necessity approaches its own conclusions ; the subtle phraseology with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to restore , or seem to restore , with one hand , what it has destroyed with the other ; the pertinacity with which it insists on a valid , vital distinction between inabilities , when it can no longer mark that distinction ; and the tenacity with which it clings to those technical terms , which afford a thin haze in which to shelter the naked idea . No less is it seen in the firmness with which the opposing philosophy has held to its convictions , though sadly worsted in the argument , and utterly unable to explain its conceptions . Our definition is also justified , when we look at the objects between which man in his free action is called to elect . They are not the same in. kind , and therefore admit of no comparison in degree . An object of appetite , making its appeal through the sense , and the law of right , through the reason , can not be brought to the same scale of measurement , and thus be found the one to overlap the other . Heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance against weight and its degrees . Certainly , these are not more distinct in kind , more incommensurable , than are gratification and right . Nor can these two , gratification and right , be resolved into happiness , and thus applied to a common scale . Right can never be so resolved ; and he who does right on the ground of the pleasure secured , has not yet done right . Two objects , wholly distinct , without the possibility of comparison in degree , exclude necessity as springing from the presence of motives , and leave election possible . The expression , " The strongest motive controls the will , " may be either a mere truism , meaning nothing more than that the will is governed by the motive by which it actually is governed , or it may be an effort to assign a definite power to // motives , and thus , by a surreptitious introduction of the idea of force into the realm of freedom , to render a comparison in degree possible . The moment we accept the effort as legitimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into necessity . Comparisons drawn from the external world , having ever in them the antagonistic connections of necessity , will not only fail to enlighten , but must necessarily mislead us in our discussions upon freedom ; but there are analogies drawn from a higher source , which , if they do not illustrate a free will , yet show the necessity of the conception , and prove that it shares its most perplexing difficulties with other generally admitted ideas . Man can never attribute to God any freedom higher and purer in kind than that which he first finds in himself . It is solely because the image of God is within us , that we are able to find and comprehend the substantial being of God without us . The moment that we deny - freedom to ourselves on the ground of any impossibility in the conception , that moment we deny it to God , and heaven and earth at once sink into the unmeasured , uncontrolled stream of causation . There is no more any supernatural . In destroying himself , man wrecks the whole universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-guiding action ; but a deluge of physical causes , rushing down through the infinity of the past , sweeps over and swallows up all its outposts and battlements . Freedom lost and consistency maintained , there will remain above the flood not a single mountain-top on which the temple or city of our God might rest . If this all-consuming idea of causation is to eat like a worm into the heart of our free philosophy , then we shall find in time or space no position or barrier which we may make good against it . As we travel back along the line of events , searching for some ultimate point , some first fountain from which the phenomenal universe has been poured forth , we shall have everywhere beneath our feet the same conditions that we now have , - force , pressed on and pressing onward . Cause beneath us , cause behind us , cause before us , - every point precisely analogous to every other point in the dreary waste of causa // tion , we shall strive in vain to stop ; our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our journey 's end . To assume a first cause is both an assumption and a misnomer ; - an assumption , because it is the arbitrary suspension of a process which , to be consistent with itself , ought to go on for ever ; the same impulse that compels me to seek a cause for one cause , should compel me to seek a cause for every other cause ; - a misnomer , since , while the term is retained , one half the idea it should cover is cast away . It is not less essential to the complete conception that it be caused , than that it be a cause , - that it receive force , than that it impart it . There is nothing of origination in the idea of causation with which Logic deals . Beginning , creation , is , to her , thin air , out of which she can make nothing , on which she can construct nothing . Pnt the chasm where you will on the last of her veritable causes , she will stand astonished , impotent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we reach and retain the idea of a Creator , is in direct contravention and hostility to all merely logical methods ; and the act of the mind by which we refuse to seek a cause for the one great Creator is precisely analogous to that by which we refuse to run over and destroy our idea of freedom by our idea of force . The same analogy may also be seen in some of the attributes we assign to God . We feel it no absurdity to say of him , He is ubiquitous ; yet a very little explanation may make this attribute seem to the mere understanding both impossible and absurd . The truth is , our reason is able to give us ideas beyond the measurement of merely logical processes . In the work some of whose prominent ideas have now been partially discussed , there are to be found , scattered with a liberal hand , those fresh , vigorous , and suggestive thoughts which open to the mind new fields , quicken its action , and connect and consolidate its fragmentary knowledge . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the synthetical and originating power of the author seems to surpass his analytical capacity . Taken as a complete compend of the science of the mind designed for students , it lacks that clear and careful treatment of the parts which would make // it , not an outline , but an adequate physical chart , of the region surveyed . Thus , Association is confined to three pages , Memory and Conception each to two pages , and Abstraction to one . The works of Dr. Hickok have not everywhere received that candid and cheerful appreciation which would naturally flow from a full insight into their merits . This is owing , we think , in great part , to the style in which they are written . He does not merely employ technical terms , - these belong to all scientific productions , and , when clearly defined and accurately employed , are very far from leading to obscurity , - but his whole form of thought and mode of expression are generally more or less , and at times extremely , technical and artificial . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is placed in such sympathy with the mind of the author , its method of operation and expression , as clearly and readily to apprehend his full idea . This is true of those accustomed to metaphysical research ; much more must it be true of those undisciplined in that direction . This apparent unintelligibleness , which has withheld the meaning from the hasty , the careless , and the lazy reader , has repelled many ; and none but the craving appetite has been quickened and satisfied . The newspaper criticism on the author 's Rational Psychology , that it could be read as well backwards as forwards , has fQund many . willing to shield their indolence by ridicule . In this respect , the work before us deserves , and will encounter , some criticism , especially as designed for a class of persons to whom no unnecessary and fastidious difficulty should he presented . Of the technical method , which pervades not words , but sentences , the following may be given as illustrations . " This identification of the reciprocal modifications ; of both the recipient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is meant by sensation . " Shape is given limit in extent , and tone is given limit in intensity ; and as thus limited , we may apply to both shape and tone a common term expressive of the limitation , and call it form . The living feeling xviii thus always be expressed in some pure form . " // certain quick sympathy with the methods of the author for their ready and perfect apprehension . In no department of composition should style be so simply and solely a medium for thought , as in the productions of philosophy . Its foremost excellence , therefore , must be that transparency which interposes no obstacle , which conceals and alters nothing . Poetry , burdened with no search , exulting in the tread of her imagery as it comes echoing forth in her metre , may seek the mystic light which half gives , half conceals her passion ; but Science must ever walk straight onward with her lamp in her hand . The telescope with which we search out obscure and complicated phenomena should possess that perfect symmetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor converts into shades and colors the pure beam of light along which the revelation comes . All imperfection here is so much added to our labor , - so much subtracted from our success . A definite purpose inspires and quickens our efforts , and that which is not an instrument is an obstacle .
