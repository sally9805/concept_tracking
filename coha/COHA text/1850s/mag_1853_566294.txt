txt ART . 1. - ABBOTT 'S NAPOLEON . Napoleon Bonaparte . By JOHN S. C. ABBOTT . Harper 's New Monthly Magazine . THE scene of Napoleon 's death at St. Helena did not belong to the last act of the French Revolution . The play had scarcely begun . The curtain of time was yet to rise xipon actors as useful for the development of the plot as those who had dashed through their brief parts upon the theatre of Europe , and upon incidents as important for the spectator 's comprehension of the whole drama as those which had taken place . The jealousy of England watching over the body of her implacable enemy as carefully as she had guarded him a living prisoner at Longwood , may pass for an interlude , if not for a part of this historic piece . For another scene , we have a display of French vanity  --  a frigate , commanded by a Prince of the blood royal , steering for the " lone isle , " to receive and hear to France the mortal and adored remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was quite dead , and that he would no more disturb her repose by projects for crossing the British channel , or by coalitions of States in the heart of the continent . Next comes the grand pageant of the reentombment , or rather the reenthronement , of Napoleon the First , under the dome of the Invalides . Next the ghost scene , shade // of Napoleon , in his old costume and old attitudes , pensive as ever , one foot thrown forward , arms folded , now starting at the sound of his own thunder , now rattling his hollow armor at his old enemies the Bourbons , appearing in all the conclaves of revolutionary France , and beckoning on his followers to scenes he loved and gloried in . Period 1848 brings an overturning of heads and diadems . Scene , Palace of the Tuilleries . Enter a messenger . Louis Philippe and wife , late King and Queen of the French , decamp by a private passage for parts unknown . New scenes and characters , with appropriate decorations . Provisional Government ; Lamartine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared . Revolution , marches , alarums , barricades and blood ; General Cavaignac . Enter Louis Napoleon ; coupde etat ; Napoleon III , Emperor of the French , flourish . Distant thunder and lightning ; exeunt omnes-for the present . Napoleon No . I , when he was informed of the resolution of the Council of State that the first Consul for life should have the power of appointing his successor , said to Cambaceres , " A dead man , let him he who he will , is nobody . " If his remark is to be considered anything more than a ruse to gain time , some of the later scenes of this drama could not have passed before his ardent imagination , tinged with the glory which he longed to bequeath to a line of princes . Men now will acknowledge that a dead man may be somebody , especially a dead French Emperor , in the course of human events , since they have seen him ruling his subjects from his coffin , and placing upon the head of a member of his own family-being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for an heir  --  the crown of France , confirmed to him and to his posterity , in the direct line of descent , forever . A true history of this remarkable man , who has founded two French empires , * and who can govern his people as well from a coffin as a throne , ought to be written , if it has not been , were it only to convince many persons of the possibility of such a thing . For no sooner are our " historic doubts " removed by one book , than there comes along another , or a lecturer , to disturb our fond and settled opinions , and to throw us again upon the trembling foothold of conjecture , telling us , " You are too near the colossus to understand him or to take his true dimensions , and surrounded by influences necessarily hurtful to his reputation . Through prejudice , national or social , no historian has fairly represented him . Scott knew but little of Napoleon ; Alison still less . " Generally , however , the sentence ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen , you have an accurate fulllength transparency of the great Emperor , with a memoir which may be relied on . " // When genius and learning are at such a discount ; when the productions of the most gifted minds , given to the world after lives of toil , may be set aside by a flippant remark , or a stroke of criticism-when such a book as Alison 's History of Europe is considered good for nothing , " not worthy of a place in any respectable library " - it is high time to introduce a new series of " popular reading , " burn up our heavy old tomes , scout to the winds the clumsy idea of regarding an accomplished mind , diligence , research , and the labor of a life-time , desirable qualifications in a historian , and go for our knowledge of the past to " light literature . " It will do for writers to decry Alison when they can answer his arguments , show in general the absurdity of his conclusions , the inaccuracy of his statements , the falsity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses and stars , pointing downward to a fact , a date , or a despatch confidential , which reveals the cause of many a bloody campaign , or infamous treaty , and when , content with their own gleanings in the field of history , they cease to pilfer from his storehouse . As to prejudice , what writer is free from that ? Gibbon had his , Hume his , Macaulay his . They wrote , in the main , a true account of men and things , notwithstanding . Alison has his great prejudice against democracy in general , and French democracy in particular . Some judgment may be formed , however , of the accuracy of his work on the whole , by the ordinary rules of criticism . From facts in which reputable writers agree , a satisfactory idea may be obtained of any great man of modern times . If not , if after all that has been written and said and sung of Napoleon Bonaparte , we are still hopelessly in error as to the main incidents of his life and the prin* principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the achievements ascribed to heroes for the last two hundred years , or we may soberly respond to Archbishop Whateley 's opinion , expressed in his Historic Doubts , that there must have been two Napoleon Bonapartes who flourished about the same time . But the tests of truth are not all carried away in the whirl of new and strange opinions . Some of the old landmarks exist , which have guided men in safe paths to sound conclusions , in all ages of the world . Chronicles remain ; records may be compared and certified ; evidence may be weighed ; witnesses may be challenged and examined ; monuments of events may be brought to light . Thus , the facts , the materials of history , are at hand for the molding of the figure of any heroic character . The inferences from these facts are the topics for discussion . These may be drawn through prejudgment , or the soberest af // ter-thought , by Mr. Abbott , the " Berkley Men , " or the New Englander . Mr. Abbott , the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a true history of Napoleon very great at the present time , has undertaken to supply it , being furnished , as he conceives , with some special qualifications for the office . lie seems to think that the tories of England have so far monopolized the business of showing off Napoleon on one side of the British channel , and the anti-repulicans on the other , as to force the great idol of the French , " whose throne , " we are told , " is in the hearts of the people of all nations , " to look to America for a historian to do justice to his fame . Mr. Abbott says , " Americans have derived their views of Napoleon from the tory historians of England . They are not impartial judges ; they are ardent advocates , hungering for the liberal reward which attends their successful defense . In France , the reputation of Napoleon has been exposed to influences almost equally adverse . So potent have these influences and misrepresentations been , that one can hardly find in the United States a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think that Napoleon was almost a demon . The public mind has been so effectually perverted by the misrepresentations of years , that an impartial statement of the real character of the Emperor is , by many , regarded as blind eulogy . An American alone is favorably situated to write an impartial account of that terrific conflict , &amp;c . An American is exposed to no influences to induce him to swerve from historical verity . He has nothing to hope , and nothing to fear , from either England or France . Self-love will induce him to prize his own reputation as an impartial historian , far above any unworthy desire to eulogize one now mould ering in the grave . In America alone can an impartial history of Napoleon be written . " All this is not perfectly clear as it stands by itself , and it is less so in connection with much more of the same sort . Our author , of course , does not speak literally when he says , that " an American is exposed to no influces to induce him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the United States , where " one can hardly find a man who has passed sixty years of age , who does not think that Napoleon was almost a demon . " He really means , then , by " historical verity , " favorable opinions of Bonaparte-opinions contrary to the prevailing sentiments of old people in America , which he undertakes to furnish under the head of " impartial statements . " Thus , by his own announcement , he is to be considered a defender , an apologist . The work which he has set before him to accomplish is to defend the character of Na- // 333 Abbott 's Napoleon . poleon , by correcting the public mind effectually perverted by the " misrepresentations of years . " In this view of our author 's position , let us inquire if no undue influence is likely to bias the minds of American writers who appear as the apologists of Napoleon . Pass by the old folks ; take American citizens under sixty years of age . Are they exposed to no such influence ? Is self-love sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard for the splendid career of Napoleon , though " now mouldering in the grave ? " Has " Young America , " in her sympathy for a renowned military chief- " the child and the champion of popular rights , " as Mr. Abbott calls him  --  the author of a peculiar system of national expansion , which has many advocates in this country  --  the man who announced himself , with a flourish of his peculiar rhetoric , to be the " defender of the brave Hungarian nation's-no praise to bestow upon his eulogist ? Is every American writer indifferent to the applause which may reward a successful defender of the great Emperor , now that the fortunes of his family are in the ascendant ? Is writing for money an unknown thing in America ? Has an author never been found in this country , who brought his principles along with his books to market ? We will not accuse Mr. Abbott , as he has done the historians of England , of swerving from " historical verity , " through hunger for a liberal reward attending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has surrendered to the all-conquering power of Napoleon ; that the spell of " the most fascinating of men " has fallen upon him , exciting his fancy at the expense of his judgment , fixing him in that charmed circle of hero-worshipers , who are ever sounding the praises of their divinity against the sober convictions of men and the voice of concurrent history . Mr. Abbott is so widely known as a compiler of books for youth , as to make it unnecessary for us to enlarge upon his literary qualifications for the task which he has undertaken . We remark , however , in passing , that this work appears to have been written under , pressure of some kind , under the urgency , perhaps , of the printer 's cry for " copy . " Otherwise , we can not explain to our readers why an accomplished and successful teacher of young ladies in the " highest branches of English education , " should have marred his fluent and polished style , not only by much bombastic writing , but by graver rhetorical blemishes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following quotatations : " She encircled in protecting arms the nursing babe , as it fondled a mother 's bosom with those little hands which in after years grasped sceptres , and uphove thrones , and hewed down armies with resistless sword . She taught those infant // lips to lisp papa , ' mama , ' those lips at whose subsequent command all Europe was moved , and whose burning , glowing , marshal-words fell like trumpet-tones upon the world , hurling nation upon nation in the shock of war . " " The cloud grew blacker and blacker with surcharged thunder . " " The whole plain was covered with fugitives swept like an inundation before the multitudinous Austrians . " " The swollen tide of uproar , confusion , and dismay was turned , and rolled in surging billows in the opposite direction . " " The tramp of ten thousand Russians was but a few days ' march before him . " " The enterprise was magnificent in its grandeur . " " In refluent surges rolled back . " " When he appeared among his troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bosom of Alexander with his invincible phalanxes . " " Civil war was raging with bloodhound fury in France , Monarchist and Jacobin grappling each other , infuriate with despair . " This work has some defects of composition , if it is to be viewed in the light of a history . Had it appeared under the familiar title of Sketches of Napoleon , or Scenes in the Life of Napoleon Bonaparte , " with illustrations from drawings by Ddpler , " it would have been less exposed to criticism , on the score of historic demerit . But coming out under a name of more dignity , and undertaking to give the whole life of the great Emperor , which is a history of an age , and to correct all those influences in America which have proved unfavorable to his reputation , it is to be judged of according* to its pretensions . In such a work , the reader expects to see an observance of unity and order , a close connection of the several parts , a continuous narrative , notes at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter . But the frivolous tales , long-drawn and worthless anecdotes , and misplaced incidents , which abound in this book , seriously impair its claims to regard as a regular account of great and connected transactions . The episodes are so numerous , and the transitions so sudden , as to bewilder the reader in his progress upon the current of events . When he is most anxious to press forward , he is apt to be turned aside by an introduction to some strange person , or scene , with the announcement , " A wealthy nobleman had married a young girl of sixteen , " &amp;c. , or , " One evening Napoleon , with his grey surtout buttoned tightly around him , went out , " &amp;c . In a book marking a new era in the revolution of opinion in this country , we expect to find such an enlarged , and such a critical view of the subject , as shows the most extensive reading , and the most laborious and truthful research . When it was announced as a part of the news of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare a life of Napoleon the great , and that for the // 335 favorable prosecution of his business , an " audience particuliere " had been obtained with Louis Napoleon , at the Elys*ie , it was expected that from the archives of the capital , or the portfolios of statesmen , there would appear some valuable contributions to history , sufficient , at least , to warrant the effort to correct the misrepresentations of years . But we look in vain for any new light thrown upon questions in dispute among authors , or any addition to the common fund of general history . His novel opinions are chiefly given on his own authority , without any marginal references , or explanations , or are drawn from doubtful sources of information , or distorted views of reliable historians . He seems to have laid hold of any statement , no matter how questionable , which could be tortured into a defense of Napoleon , or made to enliven the narrative . That more than doubtful incident at the Bridge of Lodi , mentioned and illustrated in every picture-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our author has seized with his usual avidity , to magnify the exploits of his hero . The same may be said of the decisive charge of Kellerman at Marengo , ascribed by Mr. Abbott to the command given by Napoleon just at the nick of time to save his army from destruction . But the stating of doubtful matters of history is more venial than some of the faults of this writer . He often pushes his defense so far as to pervert the meaning of authors by important omissions and jumbled extracts , and sometimes by misquoting their language . An instance of this appears in the following extract : " France still retains the sentiments which characterized the dawn of her revolution ; she was democratic , she is democratic , she declares war against kings , she continues to seek their destruction . " Turning to the speech of Lord Grehville , in Parliament , from which , as we are led to infer , this sentence is taken , we read , " France still retained those sentiments , and showed that constancy which characterized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so still ; she was Jacobin , she is so still ; she declares war against all kings , she continues to seek their destruction . " The reader will hardly recognize in the first extract the original language of the noble Lord . We shall have occasion to say more of such misrepresentations hereafter . For the sake of throwing our remarks into more order than could be secured by following at random such matters as we wish to comment upon in this work , we shall notice the peace policy of Napoleon , said to have been the cause of his foreign wars , the civil administration of the " Republican Emperor , " and his moral and religious character . We hold no dis // pute with any one as to his military greatness , or his capacity for civil affairs . It is not in our way now to be looking at these shining qualities ; we shall try to overlook them so as to shun their fascinating influence in estimating his moral power upon the world , that we may see him rise or fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done good or done evil  --  the more infamous if he has abused his high powers in the pursuit of selfish ends . Was he , then , as he stands upon the page of Mr. Abbott , the great Pacificator , who , hating war and loving peace , spent a life-time in the vain effort to persuade the kings of Europe of his good intentions , and to restrain those ambitious despots within the bounds of order and good government ? Was he the afflicted Prince , who finding all his overtures of accommodation unavailing , in self-defense resorted to arms , and after desolating Europe , and while on his grand errand of mercy to the subjects of the Northern Autocrat upon his frozen throne , is overwhelmed in his own element to his heart 's content , by the peace-making Cossacks , and fixed at last to a rock in the ocean , because Mr. Fox , the friend of peace , was dead , and vengeance swayed the councils of the British Cabinet ? Is this the history of Europe for twenty years , and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts are against such an inquiry . It seems like trifling to attempt to prove that Napoleon was not an apostle of peace , and we would abandon the effort for something harder to be done , but for the duty imposed upon us , as reviewers , to correct , so far as practicable , all misrepresentations which , though in conflict with " patent history , " exert , through the repetition of reputable writers , a bad popular influence . A regular defense of the Pacificator opens in this work with his appearance as First Consul . " Napoleon , " it is said , " loved not war . He wished to build up , not to pull down . He desired the glory of being the benefactor , not the scourge of his fellow men . Every war in which he had thus far been engaged was strictly a war of self-defense . The expedition to Egypt can not be considered an exception-for that war was undertaken as the only means of repelling the assaults of the most determined and powerful enemy France has ever known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ united in him . With unobstructed power he could wield all her resources and guide all her armies . Under these circumstances most signally did he show his love of peace by adopting the very characteristic measure of " writing directly to the King of England and to the Emperor of Austria , proposing reconciliation . " " To the King of England he wrote , " here follows his celebrated letter beginning , " Called , // Sire , by the wishes of the French nation . " To this magnanimous application for peace it is said , " Lord Grenville replied in a letter full of the most bitter recriminations , and all France was exasperated by the insulting declaration that if France really desired peace , the best and most natural pledge of its reality and permanence would be the restoration of that line of princes which , for so many years , maintained the French nation in prosperity at home and respect and consideration abroad . Such an event would at once remove , and will at any time remove , all obstacles in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the impartiality of an American writer , that he should quote the letter of the First Consul in full , the largest part of Talleyrand 's rejoinder to the reply of the British minister , and only two sentences of that important state paper . Upon this garbled extrac.t of Lord Grenville 's dispatch , paraded in italics , is founded the charge against England of continuing an unnecessary war for the avowed purpose of forcing upon France the reign of the Bourbons . In close connection with this extract , however , in the official document , we read " Desirable as such an event must be , both to France and the world , it is not to this mode exclusively that his majesty limits the possibility of secure and solid pacification . His majesty makes no claim to prescribe to France what shall be the form of her government , or in whose hands she shall vest the authority necessary for conducting the affairs of a great and powerful nation . He looks only to the security of his own dominions and those of his allies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner be obtained , his majesty will eagerly embrace the opportunity to concert with her allies the means of a general pacification . " Here is unfolded the meaning of the reply of the British minister to the letter of the First Consul . The ground assumed by Great Britain in this document she always maintained , and always declared in her correspondence with the Continental powers . If she considered the restoration of the Bourbons the " best pledge of the reality and permanence of peace , " she never avowed it as a reason for hostile proceedings against France ; but on the contrary , declared that she made no claim to prescribe to France what should be the form of her government , or to interfere with the internal affairs of the nation . All insinuations of this sort in Parliament were directly repelled by the friends of the government . Mr. Pitt said , " we have been asked in the course of this debate , do you think you can impose monarchy upon France against the will of the // nation ? I never thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lord Grenville said , in reference to former transactions of his government with the Republic , thiit he " disclaimed all alliance and connection with any power or powers whatever for the purpose of overthrowing the government of France . England not only did not mean to interfere with the internal affairs of France , but actually authorized her ministers on the continent to become the mediators between the powers at war . " The charge against England of prolonging the war for the restoration of the Bourbons , and of determining to have no peace with France while a republic is entirely set aside by her having on several occasions entered into negotiations with republican France to secure a general peace . At Paris and at Lisle had their overtures been rejected and in one instance through the agency of the Pacificator , when , as Mr. Canning said , " Bonaparte , whose interest was paramount in his country at that moment , might have obtained his heart 's desire . " The bare fact that such overtures were made , showed the disposition of England to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line of Bourbon princes was not " a sine qua non of immediate treaty . " The real ground of her hostility to France , as seen in the rejection of the proposal of the First Consul , lay in a well founded distrust of his intention to conclude a permanent peace . So atrocious had been his aggressions in Europe and the East upon the liberties of friendly States under the plea of seeking their political welfare , as to warrant the opinion , that he sought by his proffers of amity only a temporary suspension of arms , as the means of making greater encroachments upon neutral powers , or of augmenting his resources for the purpose of crushing his enemies . This line of conduct was happily understood by the leading minds of England from the knowledge of Bonaparte 's career , and was fully exposed in the debate to which we have here alluded . It accords with our design briefly to allude to some of the principal events of this career , in order to detect his political designs and estimate his character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrepancy between his professions and conduct ,  --  the lofty and gracious tones of his proclamations , and the meanness and wickedness of his subsequent actions . His treatment of the people of Italy , during his early campaigns , may well be considered as forming one of the blackest pages of history . But with what ineffable grace does he proclaim his good intentions for their welfare ? Every schoolboy is familiar with his famous speech addressed to his troops // upon the occasion of his grand entry into Milan , in 1796 , beginning- " Soldiers , you have descended like a torrent from the heights of the Appenines . " But every school-boy who takes Mr. Abbott for his guide in European history , does not know how the Italians were made to understand that speech under the training of the conqueror of Italy . What , for example , was the meaning of this declaration " We are the friends of every people , especially of the descendants of Brutus and Scipio ? " The people , favored by the French alliance , soon learned to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political regeneration , which proved as disastrous to his friends as did his novel mode of making war to his enemies . The main principle of this system arose from a boundless compassion for the oppressed and suffering of all nations , which led him to judge of their civil condition as compared with that of the new Republic , and in pity for their benighted state , to assume the right of managing their internal affairs by force or by fraud , whether they desired or abhorred his interference . In the prosecution of this plan , not much unlike a more modern policy , he would offer in profusion good will and amity , in his advances to obtain a lodgment in a state , then stir up rebellion against the regular authorities by his own paid agents , command his troops to give no open countenance to the movement but secretly to favor it , in order that matters might not come to a crisis before he had exhausted the treasures of the government , or while he had a doubtful campaign upon his hands . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the insurrection had broken out , down come his thundering legions to punish the authorities by whose bounty he had been fed and clothed for resisting the movement . Thus Napoleon 's good friends were left to a double stroke of his cruel policy in making peace . The horrors perpetrated by the French , and the excesses of the Italians in revenge , were the natural products of the system ; those of Banasco , Pavia , Verona , and Lido . " Venice fallen " into the arms of her friends is perhaps the most doleful example of this measure . In accordance with it were the views early expressed relative to that republic . In a secret dispatch to the Directory at home , he wrote , " Should it be your plan to extract five or six millions from Venice , I have expressly prepared the sort of reception for you . If your intentions be more decided , I think this ground of quarrel ought to be kept up . Let me know what you mean to do and wait till the favorable moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not have to do with all the world at once . " As her reward // for believing the conqueror and paying tribute for his clemency , she was dismembered of her territories , robbed of her treasures , reft of her revenues , dismantled of her monuments , despoiled of her glorious works of art , partitioned and sold . Mr. Alison has shown , not by his eloquent and persuasive language , but by the stubborn evidence of facts , that the excuses offered by some writers for Napoleon 's conduct in the affairs of Venice are wholly worthless . He has shown by a comparison of dates that the excesses , alleged in justification of his treatment of the Venetian Republic , took place after the arrangement of the preliminary articles of a treaty with Austria , by which a state , not at war with France , was plundered and divided between the contracting powers . Mr. Abbott says , " Napoleon was very desirous of securing republican liberty in Venice ; most illustriously did he exhibit his anxiety for peace in consenting to sacrifice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than renew the horrors of battle . " The strength of this desire to secure republican liberty to Venice may be fairly inferred from the nature of the transaction to which we have alluded . Bonaparte approached that country with this proclamation- " It is to deliver the finest country in Europe from the iron yoke of the proud house of Austria that the French army has braved obstacles the most difficult to surmount . " He excited insurrections , revolutionized the state and established the forms of French democracy . After promising by treaty to secure it upon the payment of an enormous tax in money , naval stores and ships , against further aggressions , he plundered the library , the arsenal and the palace , and imposed additional contributions upon its inhabitants ; then by the treaty of Campo Formio placed it under " the iron yoke of the proud house of Austria , " to deliver it from which he had represented in his proclamation to be the great object of his operations . Mr. Alison has finely said , in referring to this transaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then united with Austria in partitioning the Republic , took possession of one half of its territories for France and the Cisalpine Republic , and handed over the other half with the capital and its burning democrats to the most aristocratic government in Europe . " In this manner Bonaparte evinced his desire to secure " Republican liberty " in a state which he had revolutionized and allied to France . Let us see in the part which he took in the consummation of the treaty of Campo Formio , aside from his management of the conditions , the meaning of his reluctance " to renew the horrors of battle . " We give the account of it which appears on the // page of Mr. Abb6tt , copied essentially from Bourrienne . " Napoleon wished for peace . He could only obtain it by Jisobeying the orders of his government . The middle of October had new arrived . One morning at day , he is informed that the mountains were covered with snow ; leaping from his bed he ran to the window and saw that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What , before the middle of October , he exclaimed ; what a country is this ? Well , we must make peace . He shut himself up in his cabinet for an hour and carefully reviewed the returns of the army . I can not have , said he to Bourrienne , more than sixty thousand men in the field ; even if victorious , I must lose twenty thousand in killed and wounded . And how , with forty thousand , can I withstand the whole force of the Austrian monarchy coming to the relief of Vienna ? The armies of the Rhine could not advance to my succor before the middle of November , and before that time arrives the Alps will be impassable from snow . It is all over , I will sign the peace , and the government and the lawyers may say what they please . This treaty extended France to the Rhine * * # * and allowed the Emperor of Austria to extend his sway over several of the states of Venice , 4. c . " We notice here one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve his statements from the obvious pressure of facts , in his zeal to sustain the ideal character of his hero . Between the words , I will sign the peace , and the government and the lawyers may do as they please , insert , " and Venice shall pay the expenses of the war and of the extension of France to the Rhine , " and we have a comment on Napoleon 's desire to secure republican liberty in Venice . Is not this a singular transaction for which to set up Napoleon as a pacificator , and for his admirers to wreathe civic garlands out of , to hang round their idol , even upon Mr. Abbott 's own showing of only half the truth as to Napoleon 's danger at this time ? He had written the day before the treaty was signed to the Directory at Paris , expressing his fears of the result if hostilities should be renewed , adding , " in the end , we should necessarily be overthrown . " Was it the love of peace and the reluctance to renew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he had secured the lion 's share of the spoils , or was it the doubtful nature of the approaching conflict , his resolution being cfuickened by observing from the windows of his room one morning the peaks of the Alps covered with snow , a sign that he could receive no succor from the armies of the Rhine ? Thiers , who seems to have regarded the early career of Napoleon , before he outraged his professed republican principles by // despotic l*surpations at home , with much favoi* , speaking of the glory bestowed upon the conqueror of Italy upon his return to Paris* remarks , " The peace which Napoleon had signed through selfishness , was vaunted as an act of military disinterestedness . " Napoleon 's plan of conquest , through peaceful overtures , was most signally displayed in Egypt , the theatre upon which he next appears as pacificator and liberator . After the consummation of the treaty of Campo Formio , and in view of the negotiations commenced by Great Britain , he declared , the Republic and England can not exist together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his implacable hatred of England was proclaimed as one of the motives which impelled him to undertake that disastrous expedition , in connection with the desire to gratify his thirst for glory and to maintain his ascendancy over the minds of his countrymen by novel and brilliant exploits . To Bourrienne he said , " If I remain long inactive 1 am undone . Everything in Paris passes away . If I linger here I shall lose myself : my glory has already disappeared . This little Europe does not supply enough of it for me . I must seek it in the East . All great renown comes from that quarter . " The avowed object of this expedition was to establish a French colony on the banks of the Nile , and thence to dispatch an army to ' strike a mortal blow at the English power in India . At the same time he informed the Porte that he had no designs of acquiring territorial possessions in Egypt . He announced to his own troops that he took possession of the country in the name of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the Porte . The barbarities which followed this friendly occupation of Egypt we do not propose to enlarge upon in this place . Mr. Abbott would have us believe that they were perpetrated by the French in self-defense , in pursuance of Bonaparte 's general plan of pacification . One naturally inquires , in view of the statement that the descent upon Egypt was defensive war , what is offensive war ? What epithet is to be given to the resistance made by the inhabitants of a country against a foreign power for the protection of their possessions and homes ? In the midst of peace , without receiving any declaration of hostilities , they are suddenly visited by an army of Frenchmen , headed by a great pacificator called Napoleon Bonaparte . He comes to subdue the country in a friendly manner if they will submit without fighting , but if they resist he applies the bayonet and bomb-shell . They do resist and defend their lives and their castle walls . This is offensive war . Such as was waged by the American armies during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyp // tian expedition *4as defensive , says Mr. Abbott , because it was undertaken as the only means of repelling the most powerful enemy France had ever seen . By what law either of nations or of humanity can he justify the inflicting of more than the ordinary horrors of war upon a friendly power , for the purpose of striking an enemy , when even the quiet passage of an army across a neuteal territory is deemed a ground for the declaration of hostilities by all civilized nations ? As we shall notice more particularly hereafter other phases of the Egyptian invasion , we only advert to it here as coming within the prescribed course of our remarks to give significance to the inquiry ,  --  With such examples of General Bonaparte 's peaceful policy before her , what meaning was Great Britain to attach to the affectionate letter of the First Consul addressed to his dear brother George the Third ? it was fair agreed in Parliament that no lasting terms of accommodation could be maintained with such an unprincipled fighter and negotiator as Bonaparte had shown himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliances only to violate them , and offer conditions of mutual adjustment only " to gain time ; " " who uniformly made peace or truce a stepping stone to farther aggressions , and systematically used perfidy as an allowable weapon for circumventing its enemies ; " who was , moreover , borne upon that current of events which had precipitated France into a war with every nation in Europe except Sweden and Denmark , and brought her " next to a state of active and inveterate war " with her sister Republic in America . True , it was for the interest of Bonaparte to negotiate , but a more doubtful matter whether it was for his interest to maintain peace . " That it is his interest to negotiate I do not deny , " said Mr. Pitt . " It is his advantage above all to engage this country in separate negotiation , in order to loosen and dissolve the whole system of confederacy on the continent , to palsy at once the arms of Russia or of Austria , or of any other country that might look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his separate treaty , or if he should have concluded it , to apply the lesson which is taught in his schoot of policy in Egypt , " as seen in his intercepted letters , " and to revive at his pleasure those claims of indemnification which may have been reserved to some happier period . " One is apt to be misled by the ado made by Mr. Abbott and other writers about the formidable opposition to the measures of government which sprang up at this time in parliament , an opposition headed by Fox , Erskine and others , especially by Fox , whom Mr. Abbott styles " the profound admirer of Napoleon . // It is important to observe the ground upon which the opposers of ministers rested their arguments against the continuance of the war . It was not on the ground of Bonaparte 's goodbehavior , or any claim which he might prefer drawn from his past life to be considered sincere in his peaceful overtures , but on the ground of expediency . They did not , as Mr. Abbott has done , justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad character , argued for a peace , as necessary for the repose of the nation , and no one had so much to say of the atrocious conduct of the French under the lead of Napoleon as his " profound admirer , " Mr. Fox . " The conduct of the French towards foreign nations can not be justified , " he said . Again , " The French seized on Venice . I agree with the Right Hon. gentleman , it was an abominable act . " Speaking of the defense set up for the participation of Austria in that act , and comparing it with reasoning adopted on the subject of the slave-trade , he says , " This , sir , is the defense of Austria , and under such detestable sophistry as this , is the infernal traffic in human flesh , whether in white or black , to be continued and even justified . " This traffic in white flesh , our readers will remember , sealed the treaty of Campo Formio , " all the glory of which , " Mr. Abbott says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the life of the young ruler of France before them , was the government of England to presume on any radical change in him , or in the disposition of a nation whose famous declaration stood on record unrepealed of an intention to attempt the overthrow of every established government in Europe . The rising glory of an unprincipled military chief thirsting for renown , was likely to excit&amp; rather than allay her ardor , and prevent the acceptance of those terms of accommodation which England had in good faith offered to France . One would suppose from the representations of some writers , that Great Britain abhorred peace as a curse , that the word was not known to her language , that it was not English , any more than impossible in the opinion of Napoleon was French . Twice in as many successive years , by ministers plenipotentiary , had this great enemy of man , William Pitt , this " genius of evil , " as Mr. Abbott says it is as certain as destiny he will be considered , taken the first step towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such concessions as led his enemies to say , on this occasion at least , the British Cabinet could not be blamed for the failure of the negotiations . At one time , while the English plenipotentiary was in Paris , Generaf Clark was sent by the Directory to Napoleon , with precise instructions to conclude an armistice for the purpose of // effecting a separate peace with Austria . His opposition to the measure caused it to miscarry . He had recently gained a great battle . On the full tide of conquest he was in no fear of gathering clouds of Austrian levies from Corinthia , or Hungary , or of snow upon the Alps , and his voice was still for war . We look along the page of Mr. Abbott , where this thing should come in , and find an acknowledgment of General Clark 's mission , but not a word of the mission of Lord Malmesbury , or of the opposition of Napoleon to peace . Our sympathies , naturally turning to the victims of the coming battles , are directed to poor General Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and made to write to the Directory-it is indispensable that the General in Chief should conduct the diplomatic operations in Italy . If anything were wanting to convince the people of England that no reliance could be placed upon the asseverations or pledges of the First Consul , it is supplied to us in his recorded declarations . Napoleon avowed at St. Helena , that he had no intentions in his proposals to the English Government to conclude a permanent peace . He said , " I had then need of war . A treaty of peace , which would have derogated from that of Campo Formio and annulled the creations of Italy , would have withered every imagination . " He maintained as the basis of his general policy , that a state of war was indispensable to the glory and supremacy of France . " The Republic , " said he , " should never make but partial accommodations . It should always contrive to have some war on hand , to keep alive the military spirit . My power depends upon my glory , and my glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to support it by new glory and new victories . Conquest has made me what I am ; conquest alone can maintain me . " " This was then , " says Bourrienne , " and probably always continued to be , his predominant idea , and that which prompted him continually to scatter the seeds of war through Europe. ** His most ardent apologists admit that it was his ambition to make France supreme in Europe by the preponderance of her arms . Says Caulincourt , whom Napoleon called his perfect friend , " To what a degree of prosperity would he not have brought France , if instead of directing all his efforts to her aggrandizement , he had confined his attention to her internal government . But his volcanic temperament , which for the space of twenty years made him regard nothing as impossible , could not be satisfied with anything short of conquests and wonders . He could not brook the thought of seeing ardent and // intellectual France without domination over the European equilibrium . " He announced to Fouche his grand plan of subjugating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must finish that which is but as yet sketched . We must have an European code , an European court of cassation , the same coins , the same weights and measures , the same laws ; I must amalgamate all the people of Europe into one , and Paris must be the capital *f the world . Such , my lord duke , is the only termination which suits my ideas . " In the attempt to gain a termination suited to his ideas was found food for the indulgence of Napoleon 's inordinate ambition , which no power could restrain , no treaty bind , and with which no lasting terms of accommodation could be maintained . There is nothing plainer in history than that his thirst for renown through conquest , and the glory of exploits such as no mortal had before achieved , led him to violate the most sacred obligations . He saw only glory to be lost or won in every transaction ; glory in war , and glory in peace . This brilliant star which rose upon his cloudy fortunes while seeking employment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so many battles , never set to his eye till that eye was closed in death at St. Helena . We are compelled to omit for future review an examination , at some length , for which we had prepared ourselves , of the rupture of the peace of Amiens , which is the next grand point in the defense of Napoleon 's pacific character . If the general policy of Napoleon with foreign powers may be considered consistent with humane intentions , his unscrupulous method of conducting war , and the unlawful expedients to which he resorted in an emergency or to take vengeance on his enemies by increasing and provoking the horrors of ordinary warfare , must destroy all his claims to be regarded as a pacificator and benefactor . Such an atrocious act as followed the rupture of the peace of Amiens , the seizing and imprisoning of English travelers scattered throughout France , was as impolitic as it was cruel . " No tongue , " says Mr. Abbott , " can describe the anguish thus caused in thousands of homes . Most of these travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sons , brothers , who were visiting the continent for pleasure . During twelve years these hopeless men lingered in exile . Many died and mouldered to the dust in France . " Le* us add to this description a fact not mentioned by our author , that many of these travelers had remained in Paris upon the assurance of the Minister of Foreign Affairs that they would be *dlowed to quit the kingdom without molestation ; and // then the declaration of Bonaparte , " the more novel the act , the more flagrant the injustice , the more it answered my purpose ; and then the midnight scene , when Junot , who was sent for to execute the cruel mandate , in expostulating with his General , was gruffly repelled by him , saying in a fury , " By God , I will show you that I can make myself obeyed ; " and we have an instance of outrage and cruelty not easily reconciled with humane and peaceful intentions . Even if this measure was provoked by Great Britain , it was an act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their families , which no writer ought to palliate on the page of impartial history , as our author has done , by ascribing it to a system of retaliation which war necessarily engenders , and by passing the guilty perpetrator without rebuke , charging his crime to an innocent man-William Pitt , " whose genius , " it is said , " inspired the strife , and who was an utter stranger to all those kindly sensibilities which add lustre to human nature . " The massacre at Jaffa is another of the infamous acts of Napoleon , committed in the prosecution of his wars for peace . His own defense of this outrage-aside from the lie which he told , namely , that only those who were found in arms in violation of a former capitulation at El Arish , were selected and shot ; an assertion which is contradicted by eye witnesses of this horrid butchery , especially by Bourrienne , who says that no Egyptians were separated from the other prisoners , that they were not with the army at Jaffa-is the necessity of the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense that Mr. Abbott fully endorses , with additions of his own which probably Bonaparte never thought of . " To say , " says our author , " that Napoleon ought not to have shot those men is simply to say that he ought to have relinquished the contest ; to have surrendered himself and his army to the tender mercies of the Turks , and to allow England and Austria and Russia , to force back upon the disenthralled French nation , the detested reign of the Bourbons . England was bombarding the cities of France to compel a proud nation to re*inthrone a discarded and hated king . The French in self-defense were endeavoring to repel their powerful foe , by marching to India , England 's only vulnerable point . Surely the responsibility rests with the assailants , and not with the assailed . " Nothing wag easier , " says Mr. Alison , " than to have disarmed the captves , and sent them away . " The remark is unworthy of the *j*quent and distinguished historian . It is simply affirming that France should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would have been far more in accordance with the // spirit of the events , to have said , nothing was easier than for England to allow France to choose her own form of government . But had this been done , the throne of England 's king , and the castles of her nobles might have been overturned by the earthquake of revolution . Alas for man We have made this quotation not only for future use , but to give our readers an idea of the writer 's logic , and to show how powerfully he can come down upon a cotemporar* historian . Authorities appear to differ as to the number of these poor captives , upon whose death depended the fate of Europe and the Bourbons . Bonaparte said at St. Helena at one time , " I ordered about a thousand to be shot . " At another , " I ordered about two thousand to be shot ; " his statements apparently varying to suit the nature of the defense set up to justify the atrocity . Mr. Abbott , following the great captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , affirm that about four thousand were shot . This is Mr. Alison 's computation . According to all aq.counts , there were enough to make a considerable heap of bones . " Their bodies , " says Scott , " were heaped together , and formed a pyramid which still exists , consisting now of bones , as formerly of bloody corpses ; " not so tall perhaps as the column in the place Vendome at Paris , surmounted by a statue of the hero pacificator , but a more befitting monument of his exploits in the East , especially in this his second " battle of the Pyramids . " It has been said that " it is vain to raise statues to Mr. Pitt 's memory-he has raised up an indestructible monument to himself in the national debt . " With more truth it may be said , it is useless to rear memorials to the fame of Napoleon , he has erected his own in the bones of his victims . It is vain to attempt , as Mr. Abbott has done , to excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If war is right , this is right , " is his standing apology for all such abominable transactions . Does this writer then intend to deny the excusableness of war in extreme cases ? By no means , for he considers all the campaigns of Napoleon defensible , and exclaims at the commencement of his dreadful career , there can be no republican who will not pray God speed the Eagles of France . After the battle of Marengo , he is in such a transport in view of the success of the French arms as to raise an anthem of praise . " Drawing the sword in self-defense , " he says , " Napoleon fought and conquered ; Te Deum Laudamus ! ' " To draw the sword , then , in behalf of republicanism , and for the discomfiture of the Bourbons and their allies , is allowable . Are all modes of warfare therefore justifiable , and all the horrible things // which may be perpetrated by soldiers , or their commanders , in an enemy 's country ? We have supposed that some restraints were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a power wielding arms , even in self-defense . If those restraints , called the laws of nations , and founded upon principles of humanity , may be violated with impunity , through individual cj*iprice , or a supposed necessity , every outrage which has provoked the indignation of mankind may be excused , or charged over to the account of the presumed authors of a general war for the acquital of the perpetrators . Who does not know that all the excesses of the French revolution in foreign and domestic conflicts were justified on such grounds-that the Reign of Terror multiplied its victims through such pretenses ? Robespierre would darken the windows of his room when the carts rolled hy to the guillotine , and lament the necessities of the revolution . The story of " Achmet the Butcher , " Pacha of Acre , sitting in the courtyard of his palace , and paying a price for the heads of the French laid at his feet , our author has rung the changes upon with a considerable sound . Let him show , if he can , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " Napoleon the Pacificator " shooting and bayoneting those prisoners at Jaffa who had laid down their arms upon the promise that their lives should be spared , which is not in favor of the barbarian . Achmet could plead the exigency of war  --  the necessity of ridding himself of the incumbrance of wounded enemies in a beleagued city , those , too , who had not been admitted to mercy , and of offering such a reward for heads as would stimulate the ardor of his troops to prevent a recurrence of the massacre of Jaffa . " Alas for man ! " Mr. Abbott has a commendable pity for sufferers in the cause of extending the conquests of France , but with what a cold glazed eye does he look upon the bleeding victims of French cruelty ? Absorbed in concern for the political fate of the Bourbons , or lost in admiration of their redoubtable foe , he passes every dreadful passage of his history with a ready apology upon his lips . In view of the carnage of Marengo , the flames of Banasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo , and the hid*ous massacre of 3 affa , he exclaims , " if war is right , this is right . " And considering all the wars of the Great Pacificator right , he celebrates their honors by a " Te Deum . " To affirm that the affair of Jaffa did not arise from any inborn love of cruelty in the heart of Napoleon , does not mitigate his crime . If , being naturally merciful , he did violence in this instance to the impulses of humanity , he was th' more wicked . For this outrage must be // considered one of a class which betrays the ruling principle of this man 's whole life- '  --  the one avowed while he was a schoolboy at Brienne-that of sacrificing all considerations of duty and all promptings of pity , for the accomplishment of a given object ; the principle of making the end justify the means . This led him to excuse as necessary crimes the most flagrant in the common judgment of men , to confound in his own mind all moral distinctions , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did himself , and to say , " I not only never committed a crime , but I never thought of doing so . " " His feelings , " Bourrienne informs us , " were overcome by what he considered to be political necessity . He was never known to say I have done wrong ; his usual observation was , I begin to think there is something wrong . ' " This is the explanation of more than one black page in his history ; worse , far worse , considered as an exhibition of a depraved heart , than as a single instance of crime . This , too , is the reason why kings and their subjects had no faith in him . They saw him advancing with unmeasured strides to the highest thrones of power , throwing aside all the restraints of moral laws and bursting through the barriers of social order for the attainment of his purposes . They saw him , when it was for his advantage , proffer peace with the intention to make war , sign a treaty only to violate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the territory of a friendly pow*r to reach an enemy , bombard a city and give it up to the horrors of a sack for an attempt to throw off the galling yoke of his authority , execute an innocent prince in order to strike terror to the hearts of his foes and then glory in the act , sacrifice twenty-five thousand men for the honor of sleeping on the field of victory , slay two millions of his own countrymen to extend the boundary of France , and murder prisoners admitted to mercy  --  and they said , " With such a ruthless conqueror we can hold no lasting terms of accommodation . We can not trust his promises-nothing is sacred in his eyes-his ambition is wonderful ! unmerciful ! boundless ! We must wage war against him till he is humbled or subdued . " And this is the explanation of his ruin , and of the unusual gloom and suffering with which ft was attended . Without discussing the justice or injustice of ' the decree which confined Napoleon at St. Helena , we hazard nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquest so extraordinary as his , and enforced in so extraordinary a manner , brought in the end an extraordinary punishment . The greatness of the catastrophe explains its cause . No mortal gifted with wonderful power , who strove to be the benefactor of his race , and to pursue his end with kind intentions , regardful // 351 of the best interests of humanity ,  --  no pacificator who had evinced an ardent desire to maintain the peace of the world for its inestimable blessings , but who under the dire necessity of occasional war , like our ownWashington , " wounded to heal , " could in the nineteenth century have been shut up like Bajazet in his cage to be worried by his keepers , without the expression of more sympathy than followed Bonaparte to exile , or the expression of something stronger than sympathy in the force of arms . But the same measures which carried the eagles of Napoleon victorious over the nations by injustice and cruelty , wrought out his punishment , arresting him midway in his career and fixing him with all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ungratified ambition ; a king without subjects , without obedience , without majesty , craving the slight alleviation of mock homage ; a suffering prince exciting no pity , left to the tender mercies of his enemies to be consumed by bitter thoughts . Thus , while this proud man was dashing on in bold defiance of human and divine laws , a kind providence was preparing in the veiled place of his desigjis the elements of his doom , to be developed according to the deep counsels of retributive justice in due time , that , before mankind should be beguiled into hopeless impiety by the success of Napoleon 's splendid but brief career , they might study the lesson of its catastrophe . " Te Deum Laudamus . " We shall omit in its place for future review , the civil administration of the " Republican Emperor , " and pass to consider his moral and religious character . Touching his morality , we shall say but little ; we would say nothing were it not for the serious attempt of his biographer to exhibit Napoleon as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reformer in this way , in the midst of an adulterous generation . We have about the same admiration of the Emperor 's private as of his public career . What is commonly retailed concerning his magnanimity , his generosity , his placability , his virtues , his affection , is all spoiled b his baseness , his meanness , his revenge , his profligacy , y his jealousy . We see in him impulses to good , transient gleams of a noble nature , but checked and obscured by the indulgence of supreme selfishness . His habitual deceitfulness made him such a pliant performer that his best attitudes are to be viewed with suspicion , even in private life . His friends admit this . Lord Holland , his special friend ) has recorded as a kind of epitaph for Napoleon 's tomb , that " there was no truth in him . " Mr. Abbott speaking of Napoleon 's spotless character , as it respects chastity , in Italy , says , " He was a Samson whom no // Delilah could seduce , and this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the extreme , and he had no religious scruples to interfere with his indulgences . " To the instructions of a pious mother Mr. Abbott ascribes the virtue of this young Samson in this wise . " She instilled into the bosom of her son those elevated principles of honor and self-respect which , when " he was " surrounded by every temptation earth could present , preserved him from the degrading doom of the inebriate , of the voluptuary , and the gamester ; and which made the court of Napoleon , when the most brilliant court this world has ever known , also the most illustrious for the purity of its morals and the decorum of its observances . " A French court " the most illustrious this world has ever known for the purity of its morals and the decorum of its observances , " will strike our readers as a discovery . And if his domestic character is to be judged of by the test which he applied to others , namely , " that a man is known by his treatment of his wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do not speak of " the divorce " - it speaks for itself . We speak of Napoleon 's jealousy of his wife leadipg to household bickerings and matrimonial separations , or in French parlance , " freedom from the restraints of common place domesticity . " We mention his baseness in defaming the memory of Josephine , by ascribing to her a proposition which came from Lucien Bonaparte , that she should violate her marriage vows to procure an heir to the throne of France . We adduce his frequent violation , without scruple or apology , of his part of the nuptial contract . We might easily produce testimony abundant and detailed to substantiate this last allegation , but we will not stain our pages or shock the delicacy of our readers with it . Such testimony can readily be found by those who desire to see it , given too by the warm admirers of Napoleon , such as Fouche , Las Cases , Bourrienne , the Duchess D. Abrantes , and Bausset . It proves most fully , not indeed that Napoleon was given to vague or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have more clearly won this prerogative of kings , but that he was an unfaithful husband , to whom a Christian minister should never have ascribed the virtue of chastity , and who if he was , as Mr. Abbott thinks , a Samson in virtue , was by no means a Joseph . Mr. Abbott makes a novel effort in his work to excite some interest for his hero as a religious character . He says , " the religious element predominated in the bosom of Napoleon , " and that " he was always a serious man religiously inclined . " He is represented as having more than an ordinary regard // not only for religion in general , but for its modifications in the forms of belief and duty . Laying hold of some of Napoleon 's lofty expressions about God , the universe and the moral sublimity of the New Testament , our author has woven them into a kind of system which , though strange enough in its antagonistic points and bearings , is rather imposing . One article of the creed of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , we presume , will not be considered remarkable even in the creed of Napoleon , since the devils believe it . But as he has uttered some " profound thoughts " on the subject , in the opinion of his biographer , it is fair to repeat them . " We believe in the existence of God , because every thing around us proclaims his being . The greatest minds have cherished this conviction- Bossuet , Newton , Leibnitz . The heart craves faith as the body food ; and without doubt most frequently without exercising our reason . Faith wavers as soon as we begin to argue . But even then our hearts say , perhaps I shall again believe instinctively . God grant it . For we feel that the belief in a protecting Deity must be a great happiness ; an immense consolation in adversity and a powerful safeguard when tempted to immorality . " A question might be started here as to the truth and logical coherence of some of these " profound thoughts ; " but we are not disposed to quarrel with Bonaparte 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , that for the " uncertain deductions of mental philosophy " he had no respect , and that he took snuff powerfully and said " Bah ! " when he was introduced to a class engaged in the study of that science at the University of Pavia . It is sufficient for our purpose to know that he was not an Atheist in opinion ,  --  that with other great minds he believed in the existence of a Supreme Being . It is only to be regretted that his belief in God was not influential with him , " affording consolation in adversity " sufficient to have kept him from attempting to take his own life by poison , and so " powerful a safeguard when tempted to immorality , " as to have prevented the commission of some of his great crimes . In connection with this belief may be considered his views of Christianity , as expounded by Mr. Abbott . " Napoleon , " he says , " was always a serious man , religiously inclined . In his youthful days he kept himself entirely aloof not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . In his maturer life the soldiers gave him the name of Father Thought ful . Though not established in the belief that Christianity Was of divine origin , he ever cherished a profound reverence for the religion of the Bible . Amidst the scenes of infidel Europe , he , with unvarying constancy , affirmed that religion was essential // to the well-being of society , not merely as a police regulation , but as a necessity of the human soul . " It is difficult to see how " Father Thoughtful " could cherish a " profound reverence " for a system of religion which he believed to be a lie . His talk on that subject at St. Helena , as recorded by Las Cases , was very full . " The Emperor , after having spoken for some time with warmth and animation , said , Every thing proclaims the existence of a God ; but all our religions are evidently the work of men . Why are there so many ? " &amp;c . On another occasion he discourses in this style- " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of London nor of Berlin ? * * * * Why is the religion of ancient times different from that of our days ? * * * * Then reason is sadly staggered , it exclaims , 0 religions , 0 religions ! the children of man . " Much more of the same sort might be quoted . " On the subject of religion , " Bourrienne informs us , " Bonaparte 's ideas were very vague . He readily yielded up all that was proved against religion as the work of men . The perpetuity of a name in the memory of man was to him the immortality of the soul " Having the least acquaintance with Christianity , Napoleon must have discovered in the affirmation of its divine origin the ground of all faith in its teachings , and have seen that if it was not from Heaven , it was from deceivers who had proclaimed their imposture on every page . How could he revere such a system ? He might have been forced to acknowledge the moral purity of its teachings and the sublimity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverence for the religion of the Bible , " considered in the light of a story-book or fable , was impossible . Neither could he have regarded such a religion " as a necessity of the soul " any more than Paganism or Mohammedanism . This is exactly the idea which he did entertain of the Christian system , according to the showing of our author in another part of his work . " It was an interesting peculiarity in the character of Napoleon , " we learn , " that he respected all religions as necessities of the human mind . He never allowed himself to speak in contemptuous terms of even the grossest absurdities of religious fanaticism . Christianity was presented to him only as exhibited in the Papal Church . He professed the most profound admiration of the doctrines and moral precepts of the Gospel , and often expressed the wish that he could be a devout believer . But he could not receive as from God all that Popes , Cardinals , Bishops and Priests claimed as divine . In the spiritual power of the Pope he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sincerely respected it , treated it with deference and sought its alliance . So of the Moharnmedans , he regarded their religion as an element of majestic power and wished to avail himself of it . While the philosophers and generals around Napoleon regarded all forms of religion with contempt , he , influenced by a higher philosophy , regarded all with veneration . " This necessity of the human soul , then , according to the higher philosophy of Napoleon , was an agent of tremendous efficiency to be used for the accomplishment of his purposes , whether it was Paganism , Mohammedanism , or Christianity . In this view we hardly know which should be most despised , the scepticism of those philosophers and generals who regarded all forms of religion with contempt , or the higher philosophy of Napoleon who regarded all with veneration . We are inclined to think most favorably of the first . Both are impious ; but the last betrays hypocrisy . It is infidelity in both cases ; in one in disguise , in the other in avowal . Marshal Lannes trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notre Dame to hear mass is a consistent character . The First Consul attending mass and proclaiming his reverence for this mummery is a hypocrite . In this view of religion applied to the purposes of government , what is it after all but a police regulationan instrument of power wielded by a despotic ruler for " state reasons ? " So understanding it , Napoleon undertook to establish in France the Catholic religion as the most available child of the " children of man . " " It is absolutely indispensable , " he declares , " to have a religion for the people and not less so that religion should be directed by the government . We must declare the Catholic the established religion of France , as being that of the majority of the people . The Pope will confirm the sale of the national domains . He will consecrate the Revolution ; the people will sing God save the Gallican Church . They will say I am a Papist ; I am no such thing . I was a Mohammedan in Egypt ; I will become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This affair , " be said , " was only a political matter . " lie explained afterwards at St. Helena , why he proclaimed the Catholic faith rather than Protestantism . " By the help of Catholicism I attained much more effectually all the grand results I had in view . In the interior , at home , the small number was swallowed up by the greater , and I relied upon treating the former with such an equality that there would be shortly no motive for marking the difference . Abroad , the Pope was bound to me by Catholicism ; and with my influence , and our forces in Italy , I did not despair , sooner or later , by some means or other , of // obtaining for myself the direction of the Pope , and from that time what an influence , what a lever of opinion on the rest of the world . " Nothing , perhaps , better illustrates Napoleon 's notions of religion than the selection of the camp library which Bourrienne was directed to purchase for him just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find- " The Bible ; The New Testament ; The Koran ; The Vedan ; Mythology , " &amp;c . This may have been the collection to which Mr. Abbott refers when he says , " He had collected for himself a religious library of well chosen books . " The idea of making religion an instrument of power for the accomplishment of his purposes , led to his infamous conduct in Egypt , where he " professed a profound reverence " for the faith of Mohammed . He assumed there the costume of the Moslems , repeated their prayers , joining in the worship of the mosques . He declared , " The French are true Musslemen . I am the man of destiny . Make the people to understand that from the beginning of time , it was declared , that having destroyed the enemies of Islamisrn and vanquished the cross , I should come from the distant parts of the West . Show them that in twenty passages of the Koran my coming is foretold . I could demand a reckoning from each of you of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing is known . But the day shall come when all shall know from whom I derive my commission , and that human efforts can not prevail against me . In all this we see only the impious use of an agent of tremendous efficiency for the purpose of conciliating the Egyptians , just as we have seen the use of a similar instrument of power in the restoration of the Catholic religion to France . Napoleon could employ one or the other , as it suited his plans of government or conquest . He thought with Henry the Fourth , that " Paris was well worth a Mass . " " Vill it be said , " he exclaimed , " that the dominion of the East , and perhaps the subjugation of all Asia , was not worth a turban and a pair of trowsers ? We should have lost only our small clothes and hats . " The reader of the work before us may be prepared to pass over forgivingly Napoleon 's religious tergiversations in the East , by the narrative of a kind of conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on his return voyage to France . After a description of General Bonaparte preaching to the Atheists by moonlight , with an illustration by Dopk*r , there follows this account : " In these intense studies , " in which , comparing the Bible and the Koran , he arrived at this conclusion , " the religion of Jesus is a threat , that of Moham* // 357 med a promise , " " Napoleon first began to appreciate the beauty and the sublimity of Christianity . Previously to this , his own sense had taught him the principles of a noble toleration ; and Jew , Christian and Moslem , stood equally regarded before him . Now he began to apprehend the surpassing excellence of Christianity . And though the cares of the busiest life through which a mortal has ever passed , soon engrossed his energies , this appreciation and admiration of the Gospel of Christ visibly increased with each succeeding year . " At the time of the invasion of Egypt , we are informed on the same page , Napoleon considered Christianity superior in " intellectuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After this event , he first began to " appreciate the beauty and the sublimity of Christianity , " and to " apprehend its surpassing excellence . " The difference , then , in the mental exercises of this young convert before and after the invasion , and while he was an infidel , amounts to the difference between considering Christianity superior to all other forms of worship in " intellectuality and refinement , " and beginning to appreciate its beauty and sublimity , and to apprehend its surpassing excellence ! " It is indeed to be regretted that " the cares of the busiest life " should have prevented his spiritual progress to the belief of the divine origin of the Christian religion . But Napoleon was not only a believer in God and in the beauty and sublimity of the New Testament , and in its intellectuality and refinement , he was also a Calvinist . We read , " This sentiment which inspired Napoleon as a philosopher , animated Calvin as a Christian . " Again : " The doctrine called destiny by Napoleon , and philosophical necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each mind characteristic modifications indicated by the name which each assigned to it , is a doctrine which often nerves to the most heroic and virtuous endeavors , and which is also capable of the most awful perversions . " We had supposed before the appearance of Abbott 's Napoleon , that " divine decrees , " as taught by Calvin , would be so essentially changed by " characteristic modifications " under the name of " philosophical necessity " as held by Priestly , and " destiny " or fatalism as held by Bonaparte and the Turks , that in fair speech it could hardly be called the same doctrine and recognized as such by an orthodox New England divine ; just as we had supposed that the popular belief in the existence of God would be so changed by the statement of Pantheism , as not to be recognized as the same doctrine both by Paul and Hegel ; but as Mr. Abbott is to be presumed to know the bearings of his own creed , we refrain from contro* versy . Respecting one of the divine decrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite sure Napoleon was not orthodox . His chief attendant , Baussuett , informs us that he stoutly maintained in a dispute with an ecclesiastic , that there was no hell ; and said afterwards " that he fodght like a devil against the notion of a hell " - though one would think from the tenor of his talk , that he thought there ought to be one for such sinners as Pitt , Wellington , and the Cossacks . His disbelief in future punishment he more elegantly expressed to Montholon at St. Helena . " I should , " he said , " escape from you more easily by suicide , since my religious principles do not at all trouble me . I am one of those who believe that the punishments of the other world have only been imagined as an addition to the insufficient attractions we are promised . " The theological opinions of Napoleon are connected by his biographer with some interesting exhibitions of a devout spirit . Mr. Abbott informs us , though , that he " was not a Christian " - that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he says , " Our Saviour was entirely regardless of self in his endeavors to bless mankind . Even Washington , who , though one of the best of mortals , must be contemplated at an infinite distance from the Son of God , seems to have lost himself in his love of country . That absence of regard to self , can not be so distinctly seen in Napoleon . " *E. * Indeed ! " Had Christian motives impelled him he might have been a saint , now he is but a hero . " But we learn that " he was always a serious man religiously inclined , " and that " the religious element by nature predominated in the bosom of Napoleon ; " and some anecdotes are so related as to pass for instances of real devotion . For example : " When but twentyfour years of age he encouraged his brother Louis , who was then a lad but about fifteen years old , but conscientious and devout , to partake of the Sacrament of the Lord 's Supper . Says Louis , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his advice and care that I partook of my first communion . He selected a worthy ecclesiastic to give me the necessary instructions and preparations . ' " Again . When the schedule of Madame Campan 's female school was presented him , he found as one regulation*the young ladies shall attend prayers twice a week . He immediataly erased with his pen , the words twice a week , and substituted every day . Though Napoleon is not represented as being led by his religious feelings to pray at his bivouac as Washington did , we are furnished under the auspices of the prescriber of prayers for Madame Campan 's school with a prayer-meeting-almost . " When at St. Helena one evening , he called for the New Testament and read to his friends the address of Jesus to his disci // pies on the Mount , and expressed himself as having been ever struck with the highest admiration in view of the purity , the sublimity , and the beauty of the morality which it contained . " It is also told that on ship-board , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he read again and again Christ 's Sermon on the Mount , and called his companions from their card-tables to read it to them , that they might also appreciate its moral beauty and eloquence . " It would have been in keeping with the incongruous scene , had it been added , that Napoleon called upon one of those hopeful warriors , Murat or Lannes , " to lead in prayer . " We mean to be serious with serious things ; but really when a writer has exposed himself to the charge of such folly as is evinced by a grave attempt to throw a religious interest around such a character as Napoleon Bonaparte , to make him out to have been , if not almost a Christian , only by a small mistake a hero instead of a saint , he should be answered according to his folly . The real opinions of remarkable men on all subjects are proper matters of history as characteristics , or , when they accord with religion , as testimonials in its favor ; if those opinions are fairly recorded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these transient conceits and parade thoughts , . thrown out for effect to excite wonder or conceal baseness , especially when presented in interesting phases and false lights , with mirrored magnificence and perspective glare , against the whole dark background of a man s life and character . In the present instance they are of no account in themselves , being for the most part , so far as we have been able to trace them to their source , scattered expressions of their author , taken from those adjuncts which often either confound their meaning or destroy their force , and wrought into paragraphs to eke out connected statements . Coming from such a lofty tumbler on every stags , as it is conceded Napoleon was , they are ridiculous . And thus represented , they lead to extravagant and false views of the most sacred subjects . By and by we shall have a book on the religious experience of Napoleon Bonaparte , as compared with that of St. Paul . By no great stretch of our author 's fancy , he who was by turns a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might be compared to the Apostle who became all things to all men , that he might win some . With what grace can mock sentiments be made to palliate the habitual impiety of Napoleon , or his Heaven-daring course ? What is his belief in the sublimity of the New Testament , or in its intellectuality , or what is his recommendation of prayers and the saorament , in contrast with his unholy ambition , // 360 Abbott 's Napoleon . *August , his selfishness , his profaneness , his impurity , his unbridled passions , his dark deeds of perfidy and revenge and contempt of God 's word ? Shall the mere freaks of a great mind be mentioned to relieve the deformity of such a character ? To do this , is to do violence to our religious associations and historic truth . It is to force the most depraved characters into unlawful communion with the excellent men who have shone in all ages of the world to bless mankind . The ground which these men occupy in history is chosen ground . Into this sacred enclosure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let them hold their orgies apart-without the pale of consecrated places . Above all , let them not be forced into the company of just men made perfect in Heaven , where our author , in the following remarkable paragraph , supposes they may be now . " On the same day and at nearly the same hour in which the fatal bullet pierced the heart of Desaix , an assassin plunged a dagger into the bosom of Kleber . The spirits of these illustrious men , these blood-stained warriors , thus unexpectedly met in the spirit-land . There they wander now . How impenetrable the veil which shuts their destiny from our view ! The soul longs for clerirer visions of that far-distant world , peopled by the innumerable hosts of the mighty dead . There Napoleon now dwells . Does he retain his intellectual supremacy ? Does his generals gather around him in love and homage ? Has his pensive spirit sunk down into gloom and despair , or has itsoared into cloudless regions of purity and peace ? The mystery of death ! Death alone can solve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight upon the world of departed spirits . " This revelation of what may be the companionship of the future life is to be considered a befitting continuation of the history of that afflicted prince who suffered greatly in this world for his devotion to the cause of bleeding humanity . These apocryphal scenes-Napoleon now in a group of his marshals , who gather around him with " love and homage , " and now soaring away into cloudless regions of purity and peace , are necessary for the preservation of the writers s consistency and for the completion of his story , since every tale should have a moral . They accord , too , with the dying testimofly of the saint himself . Antommarchi , his physician , relates that Napoleon said , when he felt that his end was approaching* " I shall join my brave companions in Elysian Fields . Yes , " added he , raising his voice , " Kleber , Desaix , Bessiers , Duroc , Ney , Murat , Massena , Berthier , will come to meet me : they will speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will relate to them the last events of my life .. On seeing me again , they will all become once more mad with enthusiasm // and glory , and we will talk of our wars with the Scipios , Hannibal , C*sar , Frederick . There will be pleasure in that , unless , " added he , laughing , " it should create an alarm in the next world to see so many warriors together . " Such scenes , whether portrayed by Napoleon or his biographer , shock the religious feelings and faith of those who do not believe that the veil is wholly " impenetrable " which " shuts from our view " the " destiny " of wicked men . If Christianity " sheds but dim twilight upon the world of departed spirits , " it is sufficient to reveal the nature of those " cloudless regions of purity and peace , " and the character and employments of their inhabitants . It has spoken of the holiness of heaven , resplendent with the glory of God , and of the holy temple and holy worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lamb , " with love and homage . " " Its lofty revealings " will afford but little consolation to the good , if these celestial abodes are not separated by a great gulf fixed from the dwelling place of those who expect to " talk of their wars " and to " become mad with enthusiasm and glory . " True , there is forgiveness of sins with God and plenteous redemption in the blood of his Son for the chief of sinners ; but granted only on conditions-upon signs of an humble and repenting spirit , such as never marked the experience of that high criminal , one of whose last acts was to grant by his will ten thousand francs to the wretch who had attempted to assassinate the Duke of Wellington , and who , in the same instrument , justified his share of the murder of the Duc d'Enghien , and who said in his last instructions to Antomarchi , that he bequeathed with his dying breath to all the reigning families in Europe the horror and opprobrium of his last moments . His last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise , no triumph of a good fight . " Head - army , " break from his lips , his thoughts following in death , not the army of martyrs rejoicing to meet him , but the charging columns of the grand army of France . After the utterance of these last words , we have upon the testimony of his physician some significant signs . " There were heard deep sighs , piteous moans , convulsive movements which ended by a loud and dismal shriek . " Soon after the spirit of Napoleon passed the barriers of time-to cloudless regions of purity and peace " or to " gloom and despair ? "
