AMERICAN REVIEW . No . LXXXVI . FOR FEBRUARY , 1852 . LIFE AND TIMES OF WILLIAM H. CRAWFORD . CONTINUED YROM THE JUNE NUEBER , ian . WE are glad to be able to announce the return to our p ages of Colonel J. B. Cobb , of Mississippi , the author of able articles on Jefferson , Macaulay , Irving , &amp;c. &amp;c. , which have appeared in the Review . The following paper will be read with no common interest , not only as probably the best extant narration of one of the most exciting chapters in our political history , but as throwing new light upon Wing principles and their great champions . And especially in view of the presidential struggle which this year will witness , and which may present many features analogous to the one here related , we commend it to the attention of the party . The father of our valued contributor , it will be seen , was a warm participator in the scenes described . The name , indeed , seems to be synonymous with high principle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return from France , Crawford was appointed by President Madison , Secretary of the War Department . His distingu*hed services abroad had justly increased his popularity with the people of his own country , and his reputation as a statesman rose to its zenith . He had been , for many years anterior to his departure for France , pruliniinently the leading member of the Senate , and his opinions and influence , as we have already seen , had not only given tone to the politics of a large portion of the country , but had actually opened the way to the formation of a new party organization , that seemed likely to absorb all the better elements of both the Federal and Democratic parties , as also to reconstruct , in all it original purity , the true Republican party of 1 ' 790-92 , of which Washington had been the leader . The government was then in its chrysalis state , and this last-named party had been formed on the basis laid down by the writers of the Federalist . The advocates VOL . IX . i*ro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest form of government , with Hamilton at their head , had so far surrendered their original opinions as to fall into its ranks , determined to test fairly and fully the present Constitution . The Virginia politicians , represented by Madison and John Marshall , and the conservatives of New-York , represented by John Jay , formed its main pillar . The ultra and radical Democrats had not then been gathered into that fierce and impracticable phalanx which was marshaled and controled , a few years afterwards , by Thomas Jefferson , though they had already organized upon the basis of opposition to the Constitution . This instrument was adjudged by them to be too centralizing and latitudinons in its main features , to harmonize with their crude notions of State sovereignty and independence . There were many who desired to be free from all national government , but a large majority decided that there must be some permanent confederation of the States . The 7 // discussion , in convention and in the public papers , on the powers to be given and the powers to be reserved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two great parties , which were designated as Federalists and Anti-Federalists . The first favored a strong government , and the last insisted upon a weak government , or rather , no government at all . The general sentiment of the country settled upon a compromise of these extreme opinions . Hamilton and Madison united in support of the present constitution , and the Democrats of the ultra school were left in a hopeless and deserved minority . This union between these two great men , with Washington as their common head , formed the foundation on which was erected the National Republican party . The high-toned governmental theories of the Federalists were so attenuated and modified as to harmonize with the conservatives of the Virginia school , although the latter yielded many of the ascetic and refined tenets of their sect . It was under the guidance of this party that the Constitution was framed , and that the government went into operation . But its compactness was soon invaded . The dark and dangerous principles of the French revolution began to sow and scatter dissensions in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was declared to exist between England and France , and intense sympathy was excited for the latter , who had so recently been our ally and faithful benefactress in the war against the former , which resulted in An ! erican independence . The proclamation of President Washington , under date of the 18th of April , asserting neutrality to be the settled policy of the United States , encountered violent opposition , and soon led to a partial disruption and reorganization of parties . Under the auspices of Thomas Jefferson , a strong French party was formed in this country , and Philadelphia , then the residence of the general government , was scandalized by the organization of Jacobin clubs , or Democratic societies , which promulged doctrines subversive of the trVe principles of the Federal Constitution , and destructive to healthy political sentiment . About the same time Hamilton published his numbers of Pacificus , defending the executive proclamation . Madison , now thoroughly 4etached from his late associations by the infiuet*e of Jefferson , answered him under the signature of Helvidius . This controversy between the chiefs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the composition of parties which originated at that date , and Madison continued steadfastly to co√∂perate with the Jeffersonians until the era of 1816 . It is not for us now to inquire minutely into the history of the rival factions which soon sprang up after this disruption between the adherents of Jefferson and the elder Adams . The former , however , carried off with them the designation of republicanism ; and through the prestige of this name , Jeffersonian democracy acquired an influence with the nation , which has , for much the largest portion of the time , controled its destiny from that day to the present . But the inherent , vital energies of the government , combined with every natural element of greatness , as also with the strong collateral influence exerted by a conservative national party , have saved the institutions of the country from a contamination of Jacobinism , which otherwise might have been fatal to their health and existence . It was to this original republican party , formed at a time when patriotism could not be questioned , and when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken , that Crawford evidently looked in his efforts to direct the current and composition of party organizations , during his senatorial career . On his return from France , he clearly perceived that such a party had again assumed shape , and , under the lead of master minds , was rapidly advancing to influence and popularity . The Hartford Convention had drawn down upon the factious remnant of the old Federal party a weight of infamy and obloquy from which it could not recover , and the lapse of a few years witnessed its final extinction . The Democrats had been seriously confused and disjointed by the events of a war which , although begun and carried on under their immediate auspices , had evidently demonstrated the inefficiency and impracticability of their political theories and experiments . They had been forced to abandon their absurd and silly preference for the gun-boat system of Jefferson , and to build up and rely upon an efficient naval system , such as , years before , had been recommended and advocated by Hamilton and John Adams . They were now forced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to the es // tablishment of a National Bank , and even to yield their constitutional opinions . Their leading champion of 1811 , Henry Clay , who had then done more to defeat Crawford 's Bank bill than any other senator , had openly changed his opinions , and was now in favor of the immediate charter of such an institution . Calhoun reported a bill to that effect early in the year 1816 , and declared that a bank only was adapted to meet the financial exigency , although he had been raised in the strictest sect of Jeffersonism . Madison himself surrendered a long-continued opposition , signed the charter , and made Crawford , its principal advocate , his Secretary of the Treasury . In addition to this , they were driven to incorporate high protective features in the adjustment of the tariff of 1816 , and that , too , not incidentally , but directly , and in so many words , if the speeches of Calhoun , and others of its advocates can be admitted as proof of the fact . The war had depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called too loudly for aid and protection at its close , to allow politicians to take shelter behind mere fastidious constitutional scruples , or selfish partisan policy . The emergency required enlarged and liberal legislation , such as was adapted to the growing importance of a great nation , and would prove the beneficence and practicability of our system of government . The statesmen of that day met the crisis boldly , and the crude theories of the Jeffersonian school ( ever more taught than pra*ised , even by their founder ) received a decided check and rebuke at the very moment that the ancient monster of Federalism was finally beaten down and smothered . It was just the time to indoctrinate public sentiment with the safer , more reliable , and more vigorous constitutional theories which had been already foreshadowed and indicated by Crawford 's great speech , in 1811 . It was just the time , too , to erect a purer and more efficient party . There was a sufficiency of conservative material to be found in both the Democratic and Federal ranks , to form such party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbing the rancorous elements which distinguished the last . The fruit of these events was the construction of the National Whig party , which , having thus taken root , gradually emerged into activity and compactness ; and for the twelve succeeding years , its healthful and invigorating influence imparted a tone and befieficence to the administrative policy of the country , which induced unparalleled prosperity , and which placed the United States in the class of the world 's greatest nations . Nor was this influence entirely effaced even by the whirlwind of radical democracy , which tore through the land during the administration of Jackson ; although the lustre of a military fame , too dazzlingly illustrated in the achievements of that victorious hero , not to win popularity among a grateful and chivalrous people , at any hazard to national interests , had well nigh totally obscured its milder radiance , while it did for ever eclipse and mar the political fortunes of the prominent Whig leaders . As the Presidential term of Mr. Madison was now drawing to its close , the eye of the nation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading politicians of the party to which both Monro9 and Crawford belonged , did not pretend to disguise their preference for the latter . Crawford peremptorily declined ; but when the Congressional caucus assembled , and proceeded to ballot for a nominee , Monroe obtained only a few more votes than Crawford , notwithstanding this prompt declination . This result was exactly what it should have been . Crawford possessed and showed more discernment as well as more disinterestedness than his friends . The pertinacity of these was both impolitic and untasteful . Monroe was much the more experienced , both as a man and a statesman , had served with credit in the Revolutionary War , and was evidently the choice , as also the favorite of the nation . It may be true , as Mr. Dudley says in the sketeh before us , that " it has often been confidently asserted by a great number of experienced politicians of that day , that if Crawford had permitted his name to have been put in nomination at that time , he might have been elected with perfect ease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have heard , that Crawford might have been of such opinion himself . Still , we can not agree that such hypothesis will quite bear out Mr. Dudley 's inference , when he says , that " the event showed the influence of such a nomination , as it resulted in the election of Mr. Monroe . " It is our opinion that the nomination would not have resulted in the ele*tiou of Qr*wfQrd ; for the ree*Qn // that we do not believe , under the circumstances , that the people would have been satisfied with such nomination . There is abundant reason to believe , in view of what we have stated , that electoral tickets would have been formed for Monroe , despite the caucus nomination of Crawford . Besides his long experience and revolutionary claims , Monroe had lately won upon the affectk*ns of the people by superadding to the arduous duties of the State Department those of the Department of War , and through this had directed the latter operations of our arms to a brilliant and triumphant close . There would have been great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation whose first impulse has always been to reward with civic honors those who have gained even a moiety of military fame . The superior qualifications of Crawford as a statesman would not have weighed in the balance with Monroe 's military prestige , inconsiderable as it was , when compared with the dignity of the award which he was about to receive from the popular voice . Nor has the " event " always showed that a caucus nomination " resulted in the election " of the nominee . Eight years later than this , Crawford did receive the caucus nomination for President , and yet he barely obtained a sufficiency of electoral votes to find his way to the House of Representatives with Jackson and John Quincy Adams . On the fourth day of March , 1817 , James Monroe succeeded James Madison as President * the United States . He immediately tendered the office of Secretary of the Treasury to Crawford , and the tender was accepted . For many years afterward , we lose sight of him as an active politician . The labors of a ministerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is removed from the sphere of political attraction , and is measurably overshadowed . Consequently , we are wholly unable to trace our distinguished subject in connectioia with the numerous important and startling questions which arose during Monroe 's administration , nor do we find suchconnection even so much as hinted at in the sketch of Mr. Dudley . We do not think that it is unreasonable to find some fault with such omission . Nobody can doubt that Mr. Dudley i s possessed of all such information ; and , view of the national character of his illus4rious xelative , we can see no good reason why he should halve withheld such from the public . The public have a right to know all that can be known of the political connections of such men as Crawford . It is the duty of those who do know to make all such known , especially when , in response to a public call , they essay a biographical sketeh . But there is a cogent and special reason why we regret that Mr. Dudley should not have been more explicit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the policy of the United States respecting foreign nations was so elaborately discussed . It was then that the doctrine of intervention was so seriously mooted among American statesmen , and measured by precedent and by the terms of the federal Constitution . The struggle of the Greeks and of the South American republics elicited then deep interest in this country . Hungary and other European nations form now the basis of much political sentiment among the people of the United States , and there is an evident tendency to depart from the safe maxims of tbe early fathers of the republic , and to change the policy of the government . The opinions of such men as Crawford on such questions , and in times like the present , would doubtless exert efficient and salutary influence on a great portion of the public mind . We can not doubt that these opinions were in accordance with the policyof Washington 's proclamation in 1793 , though there existed considerable differences in the Monroe Cabinet on this subject . We know that John Quincy Adams was quite latitudinous , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled opinion , if we may judge either by his language , his policy , or the conflicting testimony of Adams and Calhoun . Each member of his Cabinet , it would seem , puts a different construction on his language , and holds a different interpretation of his motives and his policy ; whilst Hayne , of South Carolina , did not hesitate , in after years , to charge the language of Monroe as being non-committal , and as having been employed merely in the nature of a ruse de guerre . But history , of whatever description , is silent as concerns the opinions of Crawford . The only clue to these is to be vaguely gathered from the acts and movements of his prominent friends in Congress . Taking , of these , Macon , Randolph , Van Buren , and Cobb of Georgia , and such test would easily unfold his sentiments and views , // Crawford served as Secretary of the Treasury during the entire period of Monroe 's presidency . We can add nothing to what Mr. Dudley has so well said of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the subject by quoting that gentleman 's language " Much of the period during which Mr. Crawford acted as Secretary of the Treasury , " says Mr. Dudley , " times were very doubtful ; our domestic relations embarrassed , pecuniary difficulties pressing upon the people , home and foreign commerce fluctuating commercial capital deranged , a public debt to be managed , and , above all , a miserably depreciated and ruined currency had to be dealt with . The political essayists of those days agreed that it required ceaseless vigilance and profound ability to preserve the national estate from bankruptcy . But the public credit was never better at any period of the republic than during his administration of the affairs of the Treasury . The national debt was faithfully discharged , and the burdens of governmeLt upon the people were light and inconsiderable . At the time of the greatest difficulty the estimated and actual receipts of the Treasury only varied ten per cent , while the estimates of his distinguished predecessors had varied from seventeen to twenty-four per cent . But the best evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer in this department , was the length of time he served ; the unbounded confidence reposed in him by Mr. Madison and Mr. Monroe , during the whole period of his service ; the great interest manifested for his retention in that office by Mr. Gallatin , and Mr. J. Q. Adams ' opinion of his merit , as evinced in his tendering him that office during his administration . Such men are rarely deceived in their estimate of character and qualifications . " An *most unnatural lull in political strife followed on the election of Monroe , and party dissensions and animosities ceased to disturb the course of legislation for many years . The President himself owned no distinctive party creed . A majority of his Cabinet were Republicans , though not allied with the Jeffersonian or Democratic school , further than by association . The Secretary of the Navy rather inclined to the Federal tenets , while Mr. Calhoun inclined to the Democratic , though his course of action in Congress had been widely variant from the ascetic teachings of that sect . In botlf houses of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in is decided majority , controlled the legislation of the country , and were under the lead of Henry Clay . They were not then , nor for many years afterward , known by the name or appellation of Whigs . The absence of all acri monious party strife , consequent on the extinction of the Fed*ral party , and the dismemberment of the original Democratic party , rendered it unnecessary to assume any distinctive appellation . Still they acted steadily together , in opposition alike to the extremes of Federalism and of Democracy , respectively represented on the floor of Congress by Rufus King and John Randolph ; and the great American system progressed gradually to a happy consummation . There was a vitality and an energy then discernible in the legislation of Congress , which diffused life and spirit into all departments of business . The nation looked to its government for proper encouragement and relief under the yet depressing influences of the war , and soon the whole country smiled with prosperity , and gave token of speedy release from the thraldom of cramped legislation . The spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Executive halted and wavered , the majority of Congress came off victorious from every trial of strength between them . The black clouds arising from the Missouri question , in 1820 , shed a passing gloom over the bright prospect ; but patriotism triumphed over fanaticism , though not without an unwary sacrifice . The internal health of the country otherwise was never so great ; and it is a fact worthy of notice , that this very period , when genuine Whig policy and principles were decidedly in the ascendent , is now looked back to by all parties as the age of good feeling and of golden times . But the elements of strife were not long wanting . The great Presidential contest of 1824 afforded ample material with which to reconstruct a system of party warfare , although it is remarkable that no solitary political principle was involved in the contest . There was no attempt to keep up , but every effort to keep down , old party organizations . The Federal party , as we have already remarked , had been extinguished . The Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfashionable to couple the name of Federalist with - that of any gentleman . A Democrat was considered no better than a Jacobin . The words were never heard in political circles . It was almost impossible to dr4w a line of distinction between the aspiring politicians , or to set up any distinctive party standard by which to judge their opinions . Old incasures // and the divisions they had occasioned had passed away . New measures , under entirely new and variant circumstances , had been brought forward ; yet nothing is more true , as we have already intimated , than that all the leading measures of Congress were of the genuine Whig stamp , that they involved the same principles of interpretation , and required the same course of argument in their defense , that Whigs have used for the past twenty years . It will readily suggest itself to every mind that a contest for the Presidency under such circumstances would be resolved wholly into a contest of mere personal preference among the people . The original candidates were John Quincy Adams , William H. Crawford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being no party differences between them , the strife became one of a peculiarly fierce and acrimonious character . It was soon exasperated and rendered more furious by the unexpected and unwelcome appearance of a fifth competitor , in the person of an illustrious military chieftain , whose hot temperament and passionate energies were not likely to soften the asperity of the contest . This was Andrew Jackson . His appearance on the field was at once productive of two most important events . It caused the prompt withdrawal of Calhoun , who became the candidate for Vice-President on the Jackson ticket , and materially weakened the prospects of Henry Clay , nottaken even a respectable stand as a politician . It was quite common to ridicule his aspirations for the Presidency as being mere mockery . His nomination was generally considered too absurd to have been made in good faith . It would not at first be credited that a man notoriously deficient in education , so uninformed as to the duties of a civilian as to have resigned several offices with the frank admission of incompetency , fonder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly in the camp or on the fronti** , would be seriously urged for the first office in the Republic , on the single merit of one fortunate battle . Those great qualities of mind , or rather of will , which afterwards made him the most popular and powerful ruler that ever wore the executive mantle , which commanded the worship of his friends and the admiration of his opponents , and which identified the American name and nation with his own strong and heroic character , were not then known to the nation . His only claim to office was based upon the victory of New-Orleans ; and this alone made him formidable , and gave him a decided advantage over his three competitors . With such fearful odds against them , the friends of the other candidates sought now to make favor with the people , by endeavoring to prove each that their candidate was , par excellence , the true Republican candidate . Crawford 's partisans did not stop at this . They sought to obtain a more thorough advantage by procuring for him a regular caucus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is to be remarked , in this connection , that Crawford numbered in the ranks of his followers a greater proportion of the old Jeffersonian Democrats than either Adams or Clay , notwithstanding his known liberal opinions . These , considering themselves as the true standards of genuine Republican orthodoxy , insisted on assembling a caucus , although they were seriously opposed . They would not listen , when reminded that , Federalism having long ceased an organized opposition , such a course was not now necessary to secure the ascendency of the Republican party . They grew intolerant when told that such a resort to party machinery , in the absence of all the higher motives for combination , was the evidence of an endeavor only to subserve the purposes of faction , and to give an undue advantage where none was really deserved . They persisted in their resolve , and called together their caucus , on the 14th of February . The movement resulted in an entire failure . Out of two hundred and sixty-one members of Congress , only sixty-four attended the meeting in person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , received the nomination . Sixty-four out of the sixty-six votes were cast for his name ; but more than half of these were from Virginia , Georgia , and New-York . No one will contend that such a nomination was entitled to any great authority or weight . It could scarcely make pretension to even full and fair party organization , much less to nationality . But its contrivers claimed for it all these , proclaimed it as the regular nomination , and invoked all true Republicans to respect and sustain it as such . The responses , however , were far from equaling // their expectations ; and we think that it will now be readily conceded that the movement rather injured than benefited Crawford 's prospects for the Presidency . It is certain that many of his devoted and confidential friends inclined to such opinion , and among others , one whose letters now lie before us , written at the time of which they speak . This was Thomas W. Cobb , then one of the senators from Georgia . He was recognized as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound to him by every tie of admiration and gratitude . He was attached to Crawford 's party not only from principle , but from affection for its head . From the time of Crawford 's nomination to the day when defeat and disease consigned him to premature retirement , Cobb embarked in his cause with a zeal that never flagged or abated , and pressed his claims with almost frantic fervor . He mourned his overthrow with a grief more akin to personal devotion than political attachment ; and imbibing , doubtless from this cause , a settled distaste for public life , soon afterwards threw up his senatorial commission , and retired with his friend to the quiet of private life . It is clear , from the tenor of this gentleman 's letters , that the Crawford caucus had not been followed by such auspicious demonstrations as hope had flattered his friends to expect . He now writes to one of his friends , Dr. Meriwether , that the caucus had not beer* productive of very favorable manifestations . In fact , this movement seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterness of both the Clay and Calhoun factions , while it gained them no additional strength among the partisans of Adams . Notwithstanding that Calhoun had openly declined for the Presidency , the newspapers favorable to his election still kept his name up in connection with that office , with the evident intention , as Cobb writes , to prevent his supporters from going over to Crawford ere the coalition with Jackson had been definitely effected . The caucus movement was received with approbation only in the States of Virginia and Georgia . North Carolina was not so decided , though Macon 's influence in that State was considered sufficient to secure its vote . There had never been , even before the caucus , any doubts as to the preference of Georgia for Crawford . In Virginia he was equally popular . , . But in New-York the result was very different , and the caucus met with decided opposition , notwithstanding the efforts and influence of Martin Van Buren . Van Buren was considered one of the most dexterous party managers of that day and time . His success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deep interest by the various candidates for the Presidency . He was at first understood to own some preference for Adams , but his final decision was in favor of Crawford . There was much and varied conjecture in connection with this decision at the time , even among the political friends of the parties . Crawford had a comprehensive and sagacious eye , and could read men with as much accuracy as most other politicians . Being at the head of a dominant and powerful party in Georgia , he resolved upon a stroke of policy which , unseemly as it might and did appear even to his own friends , it was hoped might win to his support the great State of New-York . This was none other than the nomination of Van Buren for the Vice-Presidency by the State of Georgia . The project was no sooner made known than carried out , for Crawford 's wish was law to his party in that State . The nomination was made reluctantly by the Crawford party , and was received with laughter and ridicule by his old enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared so ill-timed and so barefaced , in view of Van Buren 's then obscure pretensions , that the term " Vice-President Van " was jocosely bandied at every corner , and soon became a bye-word and slang expression . Long and cruelly did the Clarkites use it as such against the Crawford party . As an amusing illustration of this , when the next General Assembly of the State convened , the Clarkites , being in a decided minority , kept Van Buren as their standing candidate for all the lower order of appointments , with no other design than , by thus showing their contempt for the nomination , to annoy their sensitive opponents . There are many now living who may remember with a smile the description of tickets that were exhibited and read out on such occasions . They had Van Buren caricatured on them in every possible form . Sometimes it was a half man joined to a half cat , then half fox and half monkey , or half snake and half mink-all bearing some resemblance to the object of ungener // ous and indecent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whisky Van , " " Little Van , " " Vice-President Van , " and many other nicknames , far more disgraceful to the perpetrators than disparaging to Van Buren . It proved to be the more disgraceful to them from the fact that , in a few years subsequently , the caricaturists and satirists turned to be the cringing partisans of him they had thus assaulted . But the policy ( whether intended as mere policy or a legitimate party manomvre ) did not succeed . The nomination of Georgia for the Vice-Presidency met with no response . New-York proved obdurate and refractory , and showed signs of wavering between Adams and Clay . The Crawford party grew desperate , and began bitterly to accuse and denounce Henry Clay . Macon , Cobb , and others laid to his charge all the injuries and reverses they had sustained in NewYork . But Van Buren did not despair of carrying the State so soon as his party friends . He was not one to give up without first using serious and zealous efforts to effect the object in view . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we shall then be sure of Connecticut , New-Jersey , and Rhode Island . Without New-York , we are lost . " This opinion was known to Van Buren , and tending , of course , to confirm him in the like view , he went to work to secure the desired object with an earnestness and adroitness that had seldom failed of success before . There is no question but that personal attachment to Cra* ? ford , as well as the usual allowance of political ambition , influenced Van Buren on this oceasion . He had long admired Crawford , and now , in the hour of trial , when his enemies were about to triumph over his defeat , the noble exertions and eminent ability he brought to bear in the endeavor to save and secure the election of his favorite , must ever excite a kind remembrance in the bosoms of Crawford 's family and friends . His efforts , at one time , had come very near the point of success . He had now found out that Crawford was clearly not the choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electors for President in New-York had been nominated by the Legislature ; and it was in the Legislature that Van Buren and his party , certain of defeat before the people , now determined to take refuge . The majority of the House of Representatives was against Crawford . His friends carried a majority to the Senate , and a fierce contest now ensued . The people were clamorous to take into their own hands the election of President . Consequently , a bill to that effect passed the lower house , with only a few dissenting voices . The Senate promptly rejected it , when sent up for its concurrence . Scenes of the most intense and rabid excitement followed , in the midst of which the Legislature adjourned . Popular resentment rose to a resistless height , and the Governor reconvoked the Legislature , with a view that the will of the people might be expressed and executed . But the same scene was reenacted with the same result . The Senate again defeated the bill , and before any thing was done to meet the popular demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the people carried their point . The manifestations against Crawford had been too decided ; and when the nominations were made by the Legislature , he sustained a signal and crushing overthrow . This result abundantly foreshadowed the grand finale , so far as Crawford was concerned , especially when taken in connection with another untoward event which occurred during the canvass , and which put a final extinguisher on his chances for election . This event was a sudden and violent attack of paralysis , which deprived , him for a time of his speech , his sight , and the use of some of his limbs , and which so shocked his whole nervous system as seriously to impair his memory and to obscure his intellect . This sad news effectually depressed the spirits of his friends , whilst it raised the hopes of his enemies . He was forced , in consequence of this affliction , to give up the business of his office , ceased to appear in public or to receive any but select company , and was removed to a delightful cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond hope that the quiet of rural life and the purer breath of the country air might induce a speedy convalescence . But that hope was never fully gratified . After a struggle of many months , his speech , to a great extent , was restored ; he regained the use of his limbs , and his vision was slightly improved . But the great intellect which had once controlled the opinions of a nation , and had made his name famous wherever that nation was known , had been blighted to a degree which human skill could not reach , and was never // again to return with its original strength and lustre . The extreme illness of Crawford was not generally known , and the canvass was carried on with unabated warmth . There being four candidates in the field , it was soon ascertained that there could be no election by the people . Adams and Jackson ran ahead , but for a considerable time it seemed to be uncertain whether , under the constitutional provision , Clay or Crawford would get to be the third candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the die , and the friends of Clay confidently expected that it would be thrown in his favor . But their calculations were not verified . Jackson and New-Orleans were associated by a common glorious link , and the memory of his great victory turned fortune in his favor , at the very moment that the die was cast . He obtained a majority of her electoral vote , and Clay was thus thrown out of the contest . This left a small balance in favor of Crawford , who now went into the House of Representatives with an electoral vote nearly two thirds less than that of Jackson , and not quite one half that of Adams . In December , 1824 , Congress met . Washington was the scene of an intense excitement , growing out of the pending election for President , and scarcely a day passed that some new phase of the contest did not occur , or that a new political trump was not turned up . But the excitement was of a strictly legitimate character . No threats of violence by force of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar contest between Burr and Jefferson , when it was proclaimed , on the authority of Jefferson himself , that , in case the House should defeat his election , " the . Aliddle States would arm . " Such seditious , jacobinal sentiments would not have been tolerated at the time in question . But there was not less of anxiety or of interest . The friends of all three candidates were alike energetic , and the movements of each party were watched and sifted with sleepless jealousy . Not a step could be taken , nor a proposal made by one , that was not immediately traced and rebutted by the others . Nor was the excitement confined to the members of Congress . Every citizen of Washington was an electioneerer for the one party or the other in some shape , and every visitor within its walls was an active , working partisan . The hotels were only so many caucus or club-rooms , in which t*. plan and direct the various schemes of party procedure . The drawing-rooms were thronged alike with the votaries of fashion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to the sterner sex . The theatre was monopolized by one particular set of partisans in regular turn , as the most proper place for a public demonstration ; but the artificial representations of the stage flagged and faded before the real exhibitions of the political drama . The legislative business of Congress received little or no attention . The members thought about nothing , talked about nothing , and wrote home about nothing but the Presidential election . Calculations were tortured by each party into results suited to their own prospects of success . A letter written by Cobb about the middle of January , to a friend in Georgia , affords a striking illustration of these illusory calculations ; and being a legitimate link in the history of its time , we shall quote from it at some length , for the reader 's satis-faction " Doubtless , in common with others , you feel the greatest anxiety about the Presidential election Recently , few changes have been manifested on that subject . Every thing has depended , and does depend , on the course which the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join us , even to the number of two , the game is not desperate . It is impossible to decide with certainty whether they will do so . Their conduct has been extremely mysterious and doubtful . At one time , they led us to believe they would unite with us . At another , they are anti podal . Two days ago we received the news that the Kentucky Legislature had instructed their representatives to vote for Jackson . This information has brought out five of them , who wiU do so ; the others ( seven ) have not yet declared . Ohio is divided , but this morning I have the positive declaration of one of their most honest and intelligent members , that they have determined not to vote for Jackson . But it is not settled how they will go between Crawford and Adams . The objections made by those friendly to us in both Kentucky and Ohio have their root in the state of Crawford 's health ; and as an honest man I am bound to admit that , although daily improving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his speech and vision are imperfect , and the paralysis of his hand continues . His speech improves slowly . His right eye is so improved that he sees well enough to play whist as well as an old man without spectacles . His hand also gets stronger . Yet defect in all these members is but too evident . My brotherin-law , Mr. Scott , has not positively promised to support him , but I think he has madeup his mind to do so . So also do I think of Mr. Rankin . If , however , I am deceived in all these calculations , // ( in which I think I am not , ) General Jackson will be elected on the first ballot . It is true , Maryland and Louisiana are now said to be divided , but I doubt not they will unite on Jackson , which , with the Western States , secures his success , inasmuch as he would have New-Jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , South Carolina , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , Tennessee , Kentucky , Indiana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one . We count sixteen , certain . We want two to make a majority , and these we shall get , as I am told by an intelligent member , Mr. Clarke , upon whose judgment I would sooner rely than on Van iBuren a " Should one or two Western States withhold their vote from Jackson , Crawford 's election is probable . The New-England States are in excessive alarm . We have told them that Mr. Adams has no right to calculate on any support from us . This is in some measure true . Jackson 's strength is such that Adams can gain nothing from him . The Yankees are determined that a President shall be made . " New-Jersey is willing to join us , if success becomes probable , and I am assured that five out of six of New-England will do so too , when Adams s prospects are blasted . Should Crawford be elected , it will be by a combination of Maine , NewHampshire , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , Connecticut , New-Jersey , Delaware , Virginia , North Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware , Virginia , North Carolina , and Georgia have nailed their flag , and will sink with the ship . New-England , if they wish to prevent the election of Jackson , ( and they say they do , ) must come to us , for we will not go to them . Colonel Benton is active in our cause , and is likely to do us good . Could we hit upon a few great principles , and unite their support with that of Crawford , we should succeed beyond doubt . But the fact is , we are as much divided as any other people . On the whole , I do not feel alarmed , though I a%* not confident . Here they call me croaker . I say I will not express a confidence which I do not feel . " This letter speaks for iLseif , and unfolds much that is interesting in connection with the history of that memorable contest . Congress had now been more than six weeks in session , and yet there had been no developments which could point the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , much to cause Cobb 's expression of " mysterious and doubtful , " because , so nicely balanced was the apparent strength of Adams and Crawford , that the Clay party were unable to decide which would prove the most available to defeat , b* a united movement , the election of Andrew Jackson . Thus much , it would seem , the majority had resolved to do from the beginning of the strife ; but that majority was scattered among three distinct and unfriendly parties , and Clay held the powel ' of fixing the desired union . On him , therefore , as is well known , all eyes were eagerly fastened . It was known that he viewed Jackson with unfeigned distrust , that he had held him amenable to the censure of Congress for lawless and unconstitutional conduct as an officer of the army , that he ' never hesitated to pronounce him to be unfit for civil office , and that he had already expressed a determination not to vote for him . Jackson never expected him to do so , and with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote by Clay " would be an act of duplicity . " But the Legislature of Kentucky had instructed him to sustain Jackson , and the Jackson party , therefdre , built up high hopes . But they little knew the man with whom they were dealing , if they ever supposed that such instructions would guide him any further than they might comport with his own judgment . He took , and has ever maintained the ground that the Legislature had no right to instruct him , and that he felt no more respect for such instructions coming from the Legislature , than from any other assemblage of his fellow-citizens . Under these circumstances , therefore , he was forced to make a choice between Crawford and Adams . Still , the friends of Jackson did not cease to importune him with their efforts to obtain his support and influence for their favorite . It has even been shown that some of them advised and recommended an arrangement by which Clay should be tempted into his support by the allurements of high office , in case Jackson was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited the least shadow of proof that the friends of Adams or Crawford made overtures of any character to Clay or to any of his friends . That both of these were anxious to secure his cooperation by all legitimate means , there can be no doubt . There is some reason to think that Clay 's inclination , as well from their personal as political associations , rather impelled him to a preference for Crawford . But his stern temperament has never been warped by private preference contrary to his sense of public duty . His disposition is marked rathei- with the severe attributes of Roman character , than with the flexile impulses of the softer tempered Greek . We have seen already that Crawford 's health was extremely precarious , and that // Western members had been urging this as a reason why they ought not to support him in preference to Adams . His illness , and the serious afflictions with which he had been visited , were well known to Clay . He spoke of them often , and always with unfeigned kindness and sympathy . Anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad through the country very exaggerated accounts of his convalescence and improving state of health , but in Washington the whole truth was known . But his immediate friends attempted no concealment , although they were sincere in the belief that he was rapidly growing better , and would soon be sufficiently restored to enter profitably into the discharge of any official duty to which he might be called . Under this illusory impression , in order as well to confute the malicious as to convince and persuade the doubtful , they resolved upon a course which , though corroborative of their sincerity , resulted fatally to their hopes and expectations . It had been now a long time since Crawford had mingled with the public . He had not been present at any of the numerous festive and social meetings for which this season is famous . To drawing-rooms and soirees he was an utter stranger . Only a select and intimate few were in the habit of visiting him , even at his home . A few days previous to the time of election , however , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the , Capitol , and kept him there in company for several hours . The old man looked much better than was generally expected , and deported himself with accustomed amenity and dignity . Many who saw him only from a distance , were most agreeably disappointed . Those with whom he shook hands and spoke , however , were observed to leave him with grave faces , and with all the signs and tokens of a melancholy interview . Among these last was Clay himself ; and it was afterwards remarked by one of Crawford 's friends , who was present , that his manner on that oc*asion told plainly enough that their hopes of his cooperation and support were at an end . " Defects were but too evident , " as Cobb had written to his friends , and these sounded the funeral knell to his chances for the Presidency . The contest was at length narrowed down to the issue between Adams and Jackson , as nearly every one had , from the first , predicted it would be .. Parties still continued immovable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , or where either had gained . Calhoun had been elected Vice-President by a large majority , and refused to take part or mingle in the election either way . He was known , however , to be bitterly opposed to Crawford , and he afterwards declared that he had no preference as between Adams and Jackson , though his friends were already zealous for the latter . Clay maintained a steady and decorous reserve , which many whose anxieties were zealously excited , characterized as mysterious and politic . The Crawford party no longer expected his coi*peration , and the Adams party , relying on his well-known distrust of Jackson , and fully informed of Crawford 's wretched health , confined their electioneering efforts to an intercourse marked only by cordiality and respect . There is not on record the least particle of evidence that they ever made any overtures to Clay 's friends , or approached himself improperly . But the partisans of Jackson pursued a different policy altogether . It is in proof , on their own testimony , that prominent members of their party consulted frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support Jackson by an intimation that , in the event of the latter 's election , the " second office of the government " would be tendered to Clay . They even went so far , in guarding against the rumor that Jackson had declared his intention of continuing Adams in the State Department in case of election , to persuade Jackson to allow them to announce publicly and by his authority , that he had made no such declaration , that he had not decided as to any official appointments , and that , if elected President , he should be free to fill the offices of government as he chose . While doing this much , however , Jackson took very especial pains to denounce all attempts at intrigue or improper collusions , and expressed himself with characteristic emphasis and honesty of purpose . We must candidly say that we believe Jackson himself was intent on running the race with Adams for the Presidency fairly and independently ; although we must further say that his subsequent conduct showed a vindictiveness that is wholly irreconcilable with the general frankness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether these declarations were ever formally communicated to the friends of Clay . But when the Jackson party found that Clay 's resolution was still fixed not to sustain the pretensions of their favorite ; that neither persuasion , nor flattering intimations , nor attempts to intimidate could move him from his purpose ; that the star of the hated Adams was rising to ascendency ; that Clay and his friends would certainly make Adams the President , their rage seemed to know no bounds . Their execrations were uttered without regard to decency or propriety . Then it was that the first hoarse whispers of the " bargain and intrigue " were heard . They were hissed serpent-like through the political circles of Washington , though the venom was first discharged within the bosom of a quiet and obscure rural district in a neighboring State . No one doubted then , no one doubts now , the source from whence those charges sprang . It is one of the infirmities of our nature to judge others by ourselves . They who had so cautiously discussed the policy of illicit overtures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their defeat upon any other than the ground that they had been outbidden by their wittier adversaries . But they directed their attack behind a masked battery , and attempted to resolve the controversy into a personal issue between Clay and an old , simple-minded Pennsylvania Dutchman , by the name of Kremer . Kremer was a memb* of Congress , and from his character , habits , and standing , was evidently selected with special reference to all these , as the instrument to fire the train of this infernal machine . It seems that he was notorious for ignorance , insignificance , and vulgarity . In his address to the House , Clay alludes to him with a species of kind contempt , implying less of malevolence than scornful indifference ; and afterwards he tells his constituents that to have held such a man responsible would have subjected him to universal ridicule . Nobody believed that Kremer composed either his oAginal letter charging Clay with corruption and bribery , or the subsequent elaborate letter which was sent to the committee raised to act on those charges . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive contradiction of his original charge , was seized and pocketed by one of his friends , who at the same time admonished him to do nothing without advice . That he was a mere tool of others , is seen by his original letter , in which he makes charges that he afterwards denied were charges of either bargain or bribery , and about which he evidently understood nothing at all . That he was a vain-glorious blusterer , is proven by his vaunting reply to Clay 's card denouncing the charges of his letter as false . That he was a driveler , if not a fool , is evidenced by his whole subsequent conduct . His cringing denials , his bolstered reaffirmations in the face of those denials , his verbal confessions to Clay 's friends , his written statements given to Clay 's enemies , his challenge before the committee , and his subsequent disgraceful retreat , at one time boasting , at another time begging , and always blindly obedient to his dictators , all these show clearly that he was much better fitted to mould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or discuss state affairs . His only redeeming quality is to be found in Clay 's own admission , that " he may have possessed native honesty . " Such was the man and the instrument which was thrust forward by the contrivers of this atrocious plot to confront and accuse Henry Clay . Having failed to flatter or to frighten him into the support of Jackson , they now assailed him through the more trying medium of his sensibilities . They endeavored to compel his support by leaving to him only a choice between compliance and the chances of political destruction . Their scheme failed as to the first , as every body knows . Clay was not shaken for an instant , bat challenged investigation and defied conviction . At the same time he caused his friends to assert publicly and positively , that he had resolved not to sustain Jackson under any circumstances short of the most extreme and improbable necessity . But the conspiracy , especially in view of its subsequent identification with Jackson himself , who endorsed the accusations in the very zenith of his gigantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chances for the Presidency . The strongest armament of proof that was ever before arrayed in a similar case , ( and that , too , the proof of a negative , ) has not been sufficient to clear him , before the masses , of these groundless charges . Every effort to make him President , from that day to this , has failed , solely in consequence of the unwelcome fact , that // his friends have been met at every corner with these deathless charges of the bargain and intrigue of 1825 . It was in vain that they were disproved ; that all proof was invited and challenged ; that it was shown no proof existed , or ever had existed . One letter of five lines from the Hermitage , containing the mere declaration that the opinions of its revered and idolized master had " undergone no change " on the subject , was enough to confute a world of substantial evidence , and to stamp the baseless charge with the seal of divinity . It is a significant and an instructive fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unworthy attempt to destroy the character of a high-minded opponent , with the view to force him to a course which his judgment and inclination both condemned , accorded to Clay their generous and steadfast support in all attempts which were made to obtain the action of the House on the charges contained in the Kremer letter . Forsyth came zealously to his aid , and put forth in his cause the splendid parliamentary accomplishments and abilities which made him the ornament of Congress . Crawford himself turned his face against the conspiracy , with feelings that appeared to have partaken of both horror and disgust , and afterwards wrote to Clay a letter expressive of surprise that he should ever have been thought capable of believing such charges , and assuring him that he " should have voted just as he did , as between Jackson and Adams . " At the same*ime , the Crawford party , warmly devoted to their chief , never pretended to disguise their hostility to Clay , in consequence of his preference for Adams over their own candidate . They were mostly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day , and considered Adams as being more obdurate and unreliable on such score than Crawford . At length the day of election arrived . It was a cold , stormy day of February . The hail was beset and crowded at an early hour by every class of spectator . Ev*ry member was at his post , and the area was jammed with privileged dignitaries , senators , ex-members of Congress , members *of State Legislatures , judges , and foreign ambassadors . Doubt was portrayed in every countenance , anxiety throbbed in every bosom . The galleries and lobbies , filled to an excess that almost stifled the eager multitude , presented a solid sea of uncovered heads ; nor was there , perhaps , a solitary individual of that vast number who had not made a choice and a preference between the three opposing candidates for President . It was the second time in the history of the government , and within a quarter of a century , that such a high duty and responsibility had devolved on the H*ouse of Representatives . Most of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson came as contestants before the same assembly , and some had been actors in that memorable scene . They now recalled with misgiving the frightful recollections of those seven days ' ballotings , which had been carried on amidst threats of rebellion and of armed interference . It was now to be tested whether the lapse of twentyfive years , years allied with glory , with greatness , and with unparalleled prosperity , had imparted the salutary influences necessary to dispel and subdue seditious resorts , and to substitute a spirit of allegiance for a spirit of anarchy . The foreign ministers present , observing the immense concourse , and the absence of soldiers and guards , seemed by their looks to have agreed that the occasion would fully confirm or disprove the republican theory of our political system . But there were no indications of a character that seemed likely to lead to any untoward development . At the usual hour , the Speaker ascended to his chair , and the rap of his hammer brought the House to order . The roll was called ; and the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conformity with the terms of the Constitution , tables were duly arranged , and tellers appointed . John Randolph presided at the table on the Speaker 's left , and Daniel Webster at that on his right hand . The vote was to be taken by States , and amidst breathless stillness and the most painful suspense , the balloting commenced . When all the votes had been deposited and counted out , Webster rose , and with deep , sonorous tones , announced that , at his table , Adams had received thirteen votes , Jackson seven , and Crawford four . Scarcely had he again taken his seat , when the wild , shrill voice of Randolph was heard ringing high above the buzz which followed Webster 's announcement , as he proclaimed a similar result at his own table , but so varying Webster 's phraseology as to say that the respective candidates had received the votes of so many bS'tates , instead // of so many votes . There being at that time but twenty-four States of the Union , and a majority only required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complement , and was , of course , duly and constitutionally elected President of the United States . So soon as this result had been officially made known , there was heard some alight demonstration of applause in one of the galleries . McDuffie , a member from South Carolina , and a fierce partisan of the Jackson faction , sprang to his feet ere scarcely the first sounds were distinctly heard , and in a manner that indicated every symptom of anger and keen mortification , moved that the galleries be instantly cleared . This motion , and the corresponding order which was immediately given by the Speaker , seemed to produce great surprise among the foreigners present , in view of the immense and excited crowd which filled the hall . It seemed to them incredible that such an order at such a time could be carried out , and that , too , by an invisible force . But their surprise was lulled , and their incredulity satisfied completely , when the Sergeant-at-arms proceeded quietly to motion the crowd to the doors , and when that crowd quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been entertained , as to the binding influence of law in the absence of physical force , must instantly have vanished , when , in a few moments , those spacious seats , which were so recently teeming with conscious , anxious spectators , pr.sented nothing to the eye but the magnificent colonnade , and the long rows of empty benches . The House now soon adjourned , and every body quitted the Capitol , some filled with joy , and others struggling to conceal the defeat of expectations which had been more fed by hope than by reason . The important question had been irretrievably decided by a first vote , notwithstanding that many had anticipated that a struggle similar to that of 1801 was about to occur again . On the evening of the same day , the drawing-rooms of the Presidential mi ? nsion were thrown open , and all Washington flocked to witness the scene . The ga*thering was brilliant beyond parallel or precedent ; and amid the universal exhibition of good feeling and apparent vivacity , it was difficult for a stranger to distinguish the victors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there , but the same frigid and callous deportment wfAch always belonged to him , was not exchanged for a manner of even seeming warmth . The bright and piercing eye alone gave token that deep feeling , and stormy passions , and acerbities of temper that partook of stern Jesuitism , dwelt within a bosom to all appearance so impervious and phlegmatic . The polished amenity and winning suavity of Jackson shone in marked contrast with the less engaging manner of his successful rival . There was not the slightest symptom of even a lurking disappointment observable in his mild , dignified deportment . He shook hands with and congratulated Adams with a cordiality that seemed to defy scrutiny or question . No one could have ventured to predict that the frank and friendly courtesies of that evening would so soon be exchanged for a personal warfare , vindictive beyond what has ever occurred in the history of the republic . Yet no one will now question but that Jackson 's behavior on that occasion was forced and insincere , and that his bosom was even then burning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterwards wreaked against both Adams and Clay , history has told with a particularity of detail more truthful than welcome . Crawford was not present ; disposition and tastes would have withheld him from going , even had his state of health allowed . Besides , the result of the morning 's contest had both astonished and disappointed him . He had never , perhaps , shared the sanguineness of his friends , but we are told by one who had long stood in a very confidential relation to him , that he was evidently not prepared for so early and abrupt a termination of the struggle before the House . His friends were prepared no better for a decision on the first ballot . They had hoped and wrought for a protracted contest , conscious that Crawford 's only chance lay in some sudden turn of the game which might spring from the animosity of the stronger factions , and finally benefit him as a compromise candidate . Consequently , they were astounded when the vote was announced , though they betrayed no outward sign of chagrin or mortification . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crawford 's dwelling shortly after the adjournment , and among these were Macon , Lowry , and Cobb . The first two of these went immediately into the // room where Crawford was calmly reclining return home , and we must do the best we can in his easy-chair , while one of his family read with him . Should he and our friends wish that he to him from a newspaper . Macon saluted should againgo into the Senate , the way shall be open for him . I am sick and tired of every thing qwq the old man himself submitted without a battle , change* He very seldom showed quarter in countenance . Mr. Crawford 's friends nor himelf chan qwq man-worship on both sides . The highest public interests were subordinate considerations , and the support of a favorite chieftain became the primary object in the political struggles which followed . It will be allowed by all , we think , that this state of things was most inauspicious to a regular and constitutional operation of the government , and to a wise and stable policy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the nation has prospered in every branch of industry , and our territorial limits have been vastly increased within the last twenty years , though we doubt whether this last will eventuate in good or evil to the public interests . For nearly the whole period intervening since Jackson 's election , the Democratic party has held the reins of government , and partiality or ignorance of political history might beget an inference in favor of Democratic policy , at first sight , in view of the increased national importance during its sway . Nothing , however , could be more fallacious . No government ever withstood such violent assaults on its integrity and strength as this government has withstood , during the period of Democratic , . ascendency , against the wild spirit and radical tendencies of Democracy . Its domestic peace has been twice seriously threatened in consequence ; and the government owes its rescue , on both occasions , mainly to the conservative influence of the Whig party . The commercial and mercantile interests of the country were visited with a blow that had well nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about by a resort to Whig measures . In fact , the Whigs have been routed and overthrown only because the Democrats have adopted and acted on their principles , while repudiating their name . The only Whig measure which has gone down entirely beneath Democratic furor , is that of a national bank . That is obsolete and dead , beyond recovery or resurrection . On the other hand , the two cardinal principles of the Whig party have been permanently impressed on the country by Democratic men : viz. , those of protection to national industry , and a moderate system of internal improvements .
