PRESENTATION . TO THE READER OF MY FORMER WRITINGS , AND THE PRESENT VOLUME . With the odor of joys that are past ,  --  In the light of bright moments to be ,  --  This fresh-woven wreath on the altar I cast To Remembrance , to Hope , and to Thee . H. F. G. Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : THE PILGRIM LAND . AN ODE . from New poems ( 1850 ) The pilgrim land for ever , O , The pilgrim land for ever ! Beneath her skies no bondman sighs ,  --  She hath no chains to sever ! From civil right , and Gospel light , Her glory round her gathers ; Nor lord nor slave treads near a grave Where sleep our Pilgrim Fathers . The pilgrim land for ever , O , Her beauty fadeth never ! Her heart is right , her paths are light ; No chain hath she to sever . Self-exiled from their native land , In unrestrained devotion To worship God , the Pilgrims braved A wild and stormy ocean . O'er briny caves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Till on the rock , his faithful flock ! Their holy Shepherd fed them . Patuxet Footnote : 1Kb rock for ever , O , Patuxet rock for ever ! The Pilgrim 's foot in thee hath put A worth to perish never . The Church , amid the wilderness , Had space and freedom granted , To flourish as a goodly vine The Lord 's right hand had planted . The solemn wood , her temple , stood , With wintry skies for ceiling ; A desert shore lay frosted o'er  --  Her altar-place , for kneeling . The pilgrim faith for ever , O , The pilgrim faith for ever ! Be this our might , through every fight , Though flesh and spirit sever ! And may the children , as the sire , To man 's last generation , Preserve its sacred altar-flame ;  --  It burneth to Salvation !  --  Nor priest nor king prescribe the ring The soul must not pass over , Whom Gospel freedom maketh free To serve the Lord Jehovah ! The pilgrim hope for ever , O , The pilgrim hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Him who changeth never . Let memory of the May-Flower bloom , When we in dust are sleeping ! She bore the Word of God , to spread In fields for angels ' reaping . And , ' mid our days of joy and praise , Let every heart remember The grateful love we owe above , On Twenty-two , December ! The pilgrim land for ever , O , Until the life-string sever ! Then , be we found on Canaan 's ground ,  --  The pilgrim 's Home for ever ! Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : THE POET AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES . from New poems ( 1850 ) ' T is the tree my father planted ,  --  Cut not down that goodly tree ! Let its precious life be granted To his memory , and to me . Close he placed it by our dwelling , His green keepsake long to bide , Just before he braved the swelling Of the Jordan 's gloomy tide . Full of years , his form was bending , Crowned with locks of silvery hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set the sapling there . Still , methinks , his presence lingers Round it , with mysterious power , Watching , and , with spirit fingers , Counting every leaf and flower . Thou mayst feel the green it weareth Shield thee from the sultry heat ; Thine may be the bloom it beareth ,  --  Thine , the fruitage ripe and sweet . Yet , O , mar it not , nor fell it ; See it bear no wound from thee ; Lest in heaven the angels tell it , Thou hast killed my Father 's Tree ! I asked the ruling Spirit of the Times To be my theme ; with music , feet , and rhymes : I prayed the master-Spirit of the Age To make my numbers full , sublime , and sage ;  --  To win for me the envied laurel crown , And let my name to future days go down ! With vehemence , and seeming half-aside , Impatient and sarcastic , he replied :  --  " Think'st thou that I can pause to be the theme , Or form the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my flying , fiery train can stay , To crown a minstrel piping by the way ; Or my swift agencies restrain , to know What merit is , or where its laurels grow ; When WE forego all measure  --  concord  --  feet ,  --  We move by shooting , and subsist by heat ? " Why , my prime minister derives his life , His being , from two elements at strife ; And is the worthy son of such a sire As his impetuous , daring father , Fire ! We nod at forests , and they hide their heads ; We rouse the rivers , and they quit their beds ; We touch the mountain , and its heart is broke ;  --  The ocean , sea , and lake , and lo ! they smoke . " And we propose , on our grand march of mind , To leave no sweet , green , flowery thing behind ! Whilst those proved good , for balsam , shade , or fruit , ' T is our high pleasure rudely to uproot . The father-home  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . We build no bowers , for idle bards to dream ; We plan , frame , rear , and finish off , by steam . " The coolest spirits soon shall own it true , That our hot vapors all sang-froid subdue . Let quiet musing , sage reflection , cease ! We spare no nook , where they may bide in peace ;  --  No calm retreat ,  --  no holy , silent cell , Where Meditation with her God may dwell ; While we profess the gods of our devotion Are Innovation , Whirl , and Locomotion . " We call steam-doctors , when the nation 's sick , To fume its nostrils till the pulse is quick ,  --  To heal it of the fearful vertigo ,  --  The megrim , that may give a fatal blow . Its body politic , kept up and going , Will keep the vital current warm and flowing ; Its members , therefore , spar , harangue , and reason By steam !  --  do honor , perfidy , and treason . " By steam we legislate  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but reflect ;  --  We draw men on to crime and scarlet sin , And let them there plunge one another in . While faith , hope , wisdom , knowledge , we outstrip , And puff devotion 's prayer from off her lip ; By steam we torture  --  we bereave  --  we slay ;  --  Break by high-pressure , rob , and run away ! " By fiery engines we convince  --  reform ;  --  Take understanding , reason , heart , by storm ! We hem one 's mental citadel between Big boilers and a battering machine ; And , from their eyes who can not see with us , To crack the scales , we use a blunderbuss , Whose dull and heavy bullets , as they fly , Might give a mortal an immortal 's eye ! " We leave philosophy behind , to sink With all who have the gravity to think , With sober forecast looking to the end ,  --  Whereto our whirling , rapid motions tend . We drop the parable of Holy Writ , To know if our new lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our blazing air , produces Such wholesome nonchalance for empty cruises . " And we 've bent up the ancient Golden Rule , That used to square the stiff old-fashioned school , And coined it into tiny bits , to sow In our new fields , to make whole harvests grow !  --  With few reserved , to be applied as charms , To soothe an owner , where we 've pinched his arms , Or pared his foot , or made his spirit bow , With Discontent , to brand him in the brow . " We now are aiming for the golden fleece , Which we intend by thousands to increase : And see our modern Argos proudly ride The foaming deep , opposing wind and tide ! We must win gold , though we have ears as long As Midas had ! Gold-wise , the brain is strong ; And , to its chambers should the ear admit Sublimer lore , ' t would only cumber it ! " Yet , not for gold to keep  --  to hoard  --  we go , Now up and down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks ,  --  earth 's gaping caverns fill , And make the dingle swallow up the hill ! We view it as the transient , yellow flower , Whose large , round fruit we recognize in power , However creeping , winding , coarse , and low The hollow vine , whereon such fruit may grow . " No ,  --  ' t is not to enshrine it in the coffer , That peace , rest , virtue , all , for gold we offer ; ' T is not the dazzling thing to deify ;  --  ' T is but to grasp it  --  wing it  --  make it fly ;  --  To keep our heels , heads , wheels , or spindles whirling , Our fuel wasting , and our vapor curling ; And this vast human tide still high and flowing , Like river-waves that to the falls are going . " Man moves not now in units , but en masse ; And one smooth train will make a city pass . Where once jogged nag , with husband , spouse , and pillion , See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain of lightning coursing down Its iron road , so town goes forth to town , In form corporeal ,  --  county visits county ,  --  To honor ME by festival and bounty ! " What busy mortal now is heard to say , Like the dull ancient , ' I have lost a day ' ? Here , to be missing every day ' s too great ; And great occasions lacking , we create ! When lacking due capacity of walls , We turn street , field , and forest into halls ; And find the grand arcana of felicity In roofless , rural , Eden-like simplicity . " For , ' t is so little to create the fare , Where'er the Day is , all the world are there ;  --  That is , from distant sections of the Union They gather close , in out-of-doors communion . Though rain may pour , or scorching sunbeams shine , All crowds are joyous , every Day is fine , To whirling , light competitors in bliss , Like US , content with such a heaven as this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go , light your lantern ,  --  find him , if you can ! We want no share of his lean mental feast , Who are our own high-priestess and high-priest ! A calm , retiring , home-devoted woman ,  --  When she is found in all the genus human ,  --  Go , rear to her your modern Parthenon : We 'll raze it to the earth it stands upon ! " Wake ! Archimedes , from the sleep of eras , At our stupendous facts ,  --  sublime chimeras ! Look up from dust , to witness our improvement , And own our power of universal movement ! Awake ! Bucephalus , and see the forces For which we now proscribe curb , hoof , and horses ! Then , back to shades , plunge down with Alexander ; I am the world 's superior great commander ! " We burn the air , we burn the solid earth , While each new heat gives new adventure birth ; And haply we may run a steamer soon From your antipodes to reach the moon ;  --  To hold conventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnics ; Among the moony mountains to encamp , When night grows chill  --  its atmosphere is damp . " Then , catching clouds of rain as we aspire , And with our lens condensing solar fire , We may grow light , and so economize As soon to run a rail across the skies ; And making depots on from star to star , With sideral natives freight our empty car , And speed them down to our great mundane sphere , To learn our arts , and stare at wonders here ! " Their foreign notions , foreign modes and airs , May then be caught ;  --  perhaps , too , foreign prayers . And if by power magnetic we can keep And charm them , like mere animals , to sleep , The beaming creatures we may tame ; and win Celestial immigrants to glory in , Whose glittering badges prove their birth and state Above earth 's highest , wisest potentate . " Matches Luciferous may kindle then ' Twixt sons of heaven , and daughters but of men . Yet , O , if fickle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ye cast down !  --  Your glory gone , your high-born nature changed , Your worshippers apostate or estranged , Your little semi-Star-lings creeping seen On earth 's dark face , like fire-bugs on a green ! " O , ' t is an age of wonders and of speed ! Man makes more books than man has time to read : And well for him , if all be true that ' s hinted ,  --  That souls sometimes take poison that is printed , From heads and hearts , whose black and baleful vapors , Blown through the pen , go forth in tomes and papers ;  --  By the deep-drinkers swallowed by the volume ; By those more temperate , by the page or column ! " Our travellers ,  --  express for observation ,  --  To libel , puff , or scandalize a nation ;  --  Society 's excrescences , that spread ,  --  Of truth and justice while they go ahead , Will read a people  --  take a wide survey , And pen their notes of all upon the way ;  --  Smile as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Parthian-like , hurl venomed darts behind . " Time was , when man must study man but slow , And search himself with care , himself to know ; Then rose a school of sages , who defined The hollows , heights , and narrows of the mind ,  --  Of head and heart could ransack every closet ,  --  Could weigh and measure every choice deposit , And to their poverty or riches come , By sapient fingers , and a feeling thumb . " By practice , now , less physical , we thread The hills and valleys of the human head ; And through the bosses of the cranium pry , By the bright rays of our phrenetic eye ! And , still refining on the finest art , In light and shade we sketch the moral part ;  --  Give stamps of spirit  --  figure forms of air ; Outdoing even thee , thou great Daguerre ! " And yet , the greatest sketch is still undone ; Not one faint outline of it is begun . The subject 's vastness  --  strangeness  --  shall defy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiance , die ! Its form shall baffle all the light and shade ,  --  The lines and hues , that art has ever laid ! For who ' s the wondrous artist ,  --  where is he , Who can produce the portraiture of Me ? " " Of thee ? "  --  But lo ! I spake to whiffling wind ! I looked ,  --  no other listener could I find . A thing without a shadow seemed to flee ,  --  A nondescript  --  an awful entity , That with a sweeping , strong , and burning blast , Sirocco-like , had twirled me as it passed ; And left me there , astounded and alone , To ask if I might deem my soul my own . I asked if I might still possess my heart ; Or must , like myriads , cast my better part , A pearl , to be dissolved in this world 's cup Of heated acids , and be swallowed up ;  --  If I must hang my sacred peace upon The tempest pinion of Euroclydon ; Or let its ark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , its centre ! These alkalis and acids of mankind , By action so fortuitous combined ,  --  Will they so rectify or neutralize Each other 's temper , that the spume shall rise , Be blown away , and let the stream appear , With placid surface , flowing sweet and clear ? Will settled , righteous principle again Be found the basis of the works of men ? Speak , O thou God of order , justice , peace ! Command this human deluge-storm to cease . The unsealed fountains of this troubled deep Stay with thy hand , and smooth the surge to sleep . Avert thy lightning arrows ; and thy Bow , A shining sceptre , to the nations show ! Let thy mild Dove , with snowy wings unfurled , Bring one green branch , and crown a Sober World ! Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : THE IGNIS FATUUS. from New poems ( 1850 ) Come , traveller , come ! the lady moon Has veiled her changing face ; The blinking stars that blazed aboon Are quenched , or in disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , and vale , and lea ; And I will serve thee as a lamp ,  --  Come , follow , follow me ! O'er caverns deep , and crumbling banks , Dark stream , and dank lagune , We play our jack-o ' - lantern pranks , And dance to whimsy 's tune . And where we hold our merry rout , Through bramble , brake , and fen , I to the dance will lead thee out , But never back again ! For men , we know , though none knows why , Do love to be deceived ; And , with the true before their eye , The false is first believed ! For swamp and pool they quit their way ; Or thorny paths pursue , In chase , or dance , with feux-follts , Life 's hurried journey through . On airy heights they reel and waltz , Or , dazzled , speed them on : Their heads are whirled ,  --  their ground is false ,  --  They plunge ,  --  they ' re gone  --  they 're gone ! They ' re in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , They bide the truth : we know no more ,  --  They ' re never back again !

It mounts , it spreads , it parts , and plays In thousand forms , a thousand ways . The moon , to hide her silver crown , Behind the hills is sinking down ; The silent stars more fixed appear , To watch the blazing o'er their sphere . The north ! the north ! ah ! who can tell What fires in thy cold bosom dwell , Or e'er the grand arcana know , Such scenery o'er the heavens to throw ? It fades ! it shifts ! and now appears An army , bright with shields and spears , That , winding on in proud array , Up the blue heights pursue their way . With waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaved the air , In serried ranks they ' re seen awhile ; Then , twining off , in thin defile . Battalioned , now again they march Beneath the high triumphal arch . And while the vast pavilion spreads , Gold-fringed and tasselled , o'er their heads , A zenith-loop superbly holds Its emerald , rose , and purple folds . ' T is changed ! a city looms to sight , With towers and temples shining white ! Behind it snowy mountains rise ; Before , a foaming ocean lies . And eager throngs impetuous sweep Fast downward to that yawning deep ; Then , pressing on the crumbling shore , Drop off , and all are seen no more ! Their mansions melt in waning fire , While fast the mount and sea retire . The north , O , who can view aright , But He who said " Let there be light , "  --  Himself a glorious mystery , Throned in his calm eternity ?

Full is her scale of ups and downs ; Fickle her smile as the air . Never look glum , when the skies look black ! Terrors dissolve in the day . Clouds have the sun just at their back ; He 'll scatter them all away . Never sit down in the blues or dumps ! Troubles insure a variety . Would not life 's path , but for humps and bumps , Prove but a smooth satiety ? Never feel sad , if friends grow cold , When you ' ve the breakers to weather ! Summer and flies , from the days of old , But come and depart together . When your old cloak grows tender and thin , Ague and tempest may shake you :  --  Keep a bright spirit still warm within ; Never let patience forsake you ! Never give up , though bitter your cup ! Life is a quick-told story :  --  Home is not far , where yonder bright Star Points you to rest , and to glory ! Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote : 1Kb Wake , thou sluggard !  --  see the morning Through the window peeping ! Time and nature do their work , Whilst you lie idly sleeping . The bramble climbs your garden-wall ; Within it grows the thistle tall , The weed ,  --  the nettle , sting and all ! A harvest for your reaping . Awake ,  --  behold the lovely morning Through the world diffusing Light and beauty , health and joy , Which you ' re in torpor losing . Up ! from heaven the golden glory Over earth is streaming ; Hill and vale are wide awake , With life and music teeming : The bee comes laden to the hive ; But when , or how , are you to thrive , Who thus lie smouldering , half alive , In leaden slumber dreaming ? Arise !  --  your heavy clay bestirring , Use your eyes for seeing ;  --  Quick ! put off the stolid sloth , And prove your nobler being . Make the little ant your teacher ,  --  From her wisdom borrow : She for future want provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ve naught for time to crave , O , have you not a soul to save , Whilst every step is toward the grave , That may be yours to-morrow ? Awake , if in you dwells a spirit Born to live for ever ; Lest the stealthy spoiler come , Your dull life-string to sever ! Haste !  --  the precious , rosy moments Flee beyond o'ertaking ;  --  Each , a swift-winged witness , goes Where your account is making . And what if this sweet flower and dew Of life and time , allowed to you , Be found perverted , in review , When you ' re for ever waking ? Arise !  --  dig up your buried talent ; Learn for what you ' re sowing , Ere the Great Reveill sound , When Time has done his mowing ! Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : LOVE OF MONEY . from New poems ( 1850 ) " The love of money is the root of all evil ; which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God , flee these things . "  --  1 Timothy , VI . 10 , 11 . Alas ! she is a tyrant queen ,  --  She fills the world with care and sorrow ! To-day , the gold and silver sheen Her slaves pursue , for tears , to-morrow . A bitter vine embowers her throne , Full-clustered with the fruit of evil ; And man to man , for her , hath shown , At heart , the vulture  --  serpent  --  weevil . For her , the traitor Jew of old Betrayed his Friend to foes who sought him ; And many a Judas since hath sold , And pierced afresh , " the Lord that bought him . " In vain before her Mercy pleads ; And tender Pity , weeping , flies her ; When Truth is stabbed , when Justice bleeds , We find her priest the sacrificer . By day , she robs the mind of ease ; By night , with thorns she plants the pillow ; She casts our peace to stormy seas ,  --  To whiffling wind , and breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The voice of conscience in him stifles ; Then , of the Pearl he ' d place on high , And peace below , his bosom rifles . The mind , beneath her iron rod And earthy load , deformed and shrinking , Bows down before a mine-sprung god , Whose form was ore ,  --  whose voice is chinking ! The spirit , born the higher things Of life and light to seek and cherish , For her will even sell its wings , And crawl in caverns here , and perish . She sometimes lays a silken snare , With aspect bland , and accents wooing , On fields of prospect wide and fair , With buds of hope , but fruits of ruing ! She then takes up a Siren song ; And those who lend an ear , and follow Her dulcet notes , are lured along For whirlpools of the gulf to swallow . But still the giddy world are bent On paying court and tribute to her ; Her vassals far and wide are sent , The playthings of an evil-doer . From youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , with temples hoary , Her pleased and willing dupes pursue The phantom of a golden glory ! Alas for thine unchecked control , Thou Love-of-Money , cold and cruel ! That man for thee should pawn his soul , And rob his Maker of the jewel ! Ye subjects , dupes , and slaves to her , Compute the wages she can pay you ; Nor till your sun is set defer To learn how far she could betray you ! Ye simple , when will ye be wise , And from your ruthless tyrant sever , Nor feed on vanity and lies The part that lives , or dies , for ever ? Gird up your minds to rise in power , And break the heavy chains that bind you ! Be free , before that evil hour , When all you sought must stay behind you ! Be rich , but not in worldly gear ,  --  Rich , as the children of a Father Who stints you not with portions here , Of dust and earth , your hands may gather .

" Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : DESERT FOUNTAIN . from New poems ( 1850 ) Footnote : 1Kb Desert fountain , from the mountain Frowning o'er thee , old and gray , Toward the valley dost thou sally , Like a joyous child to play . Ever , thy glad solo singing , ' Mid the wild of Araby , Dost thou nurse the sweet flower , springing To unfold its heart to thee . Never darkling ,  --  ever sparkling , Wears thy breast , by day , or night , Golden sunbeams ,  --  silver moon-gleams , And the diamond starry light ! What ' s thy story ?  --  what ' s thy glory ? Whom art thou ordained to bless , When they hear thee , and draw near thee , In this lonely wilderness ?

Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : WE ARE SPIRITS . from New poems ( 1850 ) We are spirits , wildered spirits , Errant from our native sphere ; Busy now , but with to-morrow Who of us will still be here ? We ' re amid time 's dust and vapor , Chasing shadowy shapes about , Each with life 's uncertain taper , Which a moment 's wing puts out . We are spirits , burdened spirits , Masked , and wearing cloaks of clay ; Grieved , and careworn ,  --  wrung , and stricken , Robbed , and wounded , where we stray . Yet , on earth , the common mother Of the forms that veil us here , Do we fain to one another Use the smile to hide the tear . We are spirits , restless spirits , Eager still for something more ,  --  Something we shall ne'er determine Till our mortal search is o'er . Grasping , losing , self-deluding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hearts are fondly brooding , Is but fledged to fly away ! We are spirits , light-winged spirits ; And our pinions , never furled , Waft us on , we know not whither , Till we ' ve passed a passing world . With an heirship to recover In the country of our birth , Vainly do we hang and hover O'er our little heaps of earth . We are spirits , fearful spirits , Having powers we do not know , Which , with use of talents lent us , Light eternal is to show . Time is ever , ever hasting : Endless life , or endless death , While our moments fast are wasting , Hangs upon a transient breath ! We are spirits , born of Spirit ; God our Father ; heaven the home He would have us seek , as children Never , never more to roam . Yet , like one with bawbles playing On the way , at fall of night , We may perish by delaying , With our Father 's House in sight . Gould , Hannah Flagg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New poems ( 1850 ) Footnote : 1Kb Down the swift stream of Time we float , And each with the freight in our life 's frail boat . Roses or thorns  --  with song or sigh  --  We snatch from the banks we ' re speeding by . None do we meet ; one way we ride , And all on a never-returning tide . Whether our sky may lower , or beam , The waters will show , for it paints the stream ! Yet , if its face be wild , or black , No haven is near ; and we ca n't go back !  --  Though we put off more high ,  --  more low , We all to the mouth of the stream must go . Then from our skiff and lading we Shall hasten , to launch on a shoreless sea . Each in his breast a Pearl must bear , To enter the ark of Mercy there . They who are found without the gem ,  --  O , dark is the plunge to be made by them ! Ever adown the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none we meet . Who is insured , when time shall fail , An ocean of bliss serene to sail ? He who in time with all could part , To purchase the Pearl of a Holy Heart ! Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : THE BROOK . from New poems ( 1850 ) The pleasant little meadow brook , That runneth bright and free , With what a kind of spirit look It smileth up to me ! With sunny sprinkles from the skies Its countless ripples shine ; Like thousand living , starry eyes , All speaking into mine . They flash upon my heart , and bring A spell beyond control ; They twinkle on the finest string That vibrates in the soul ! For I was once a child beside A brook as clear and bright , Ere life 's first meadow-violets died , Or waned its morning light ;  --  When whole was every kindred tie , And I had never dreamed I e'er should miss a single eye Of all that round me beamed . But those we love and cherish here To bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when most near ! How vision-like are they ! They now are here ,  --  they ' re past anon , Like wavelets of the brook , Where each we do but glance upon Returns a parting look ! And may there not be spirit-eyes ,  --  As unto me they seem ,  --  That give , while watching from the skies , Their reflex on the stream ? We can not tell the ways of love Our angel watchers know , To turn our thoughts to light above From passing shades below . O , how like dimpled infancy , That not a trouble knows , In gladness and to nature free , This merry streamlet goes ! Like childhood in its rosy hours , Before a hope has died , It sparkles forward , while the flowers Spring up at either side . Whene'er a sudden fall it makes , As every child has done , It gathers strength , and thence betakes Itself to swifter run . Does aught oppose its chosen route , The check is ever brief ; Its little arms it stretches out , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cress , That creeps upon its edge ; And there it combs the silken tress Of over-reaching sedge . It steals along beneath the bower , And takes , in mimic theft , Upon its mirror-breast , the flower That growing still is left . It hides amid the alder-shade ; Then out it darts to run , As if at child 's bopeep it played , In frolic with the sun . And now it takes a deeper place ,  --  A graver look it wears , And has a less transparent face , Like one of growing cares . ' T is here it hides the speckled trout Its jutting bank below , While silvery minnows gleam about , Like toys in baby-show . It feeds the water-flag and rush , That haunt it for their drink ,  --  Meanders where , in brake and brush , Sing thrush and bobolink . Then , oozing from the shadowy nook , It takes another freak ; And on the mead behold the brook , A shimmering silver streak ! For every basking butterfly It rears a buttercup ; And flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It laughs to see the quaking-grass At every zephyr shake , And if a snapping insect pass , A sign of terror make . Would mouse-ear , near its margin , list The sound of bees that come , ' T is then a mock-ventriloquist , And , gurgling , drowns their hum . Then , off among the pebble-stones , It gives a rapid glee ,  --  It sings in ever-varied tones  --  It plays on every key . Now , soft it glides through velvet green , With violets blue bestrown ; Its bosom clear , its face serene , The hue of heaven its own ! Thus , curling here , and twining there , Its varied banks between , While speeding down , it knows not where , This living tide is seen . Yet , ever forward , on the run It goes , and can not stay ; Like human life , that , once begun , Unceasing fleets away . An aged man , with temples hoar , I saw approach the brook Alone , as if to ponder o'er His life 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree , His grassy seat he made ; With staff , awhile from service free , At rest beside him laid . Upon the stream intent his eye , His locks dispersed to air ; While spake his breast , by deep-drawn sigh , Of spirit-sadness there . ' T was here , in childhood light and fair , He ' d sported by the stream , When present life was all parterre , The future  --  golden dream ! His feet , that , threescore years and ten , Had traced life 's weary way , Were in the native scenes again , Where first they ran to play . In all the changeful years between The child and pilgrim lorn , That trembling lone one had not seen The spot where he was born . And , faint from age , he now had come , With life so near its close , As in review to cast the sum Of all that earth bestows . As busy Memory numbered up The honey-drops and gall , He in the waters dashed her cup To wash it free of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , Beneath his weight of years , And to the placid crystal tide Poured forth his soul in tears .

With tablet and pencils , and small drinking-cup , To bring for his thirst the cool spring-water up , The young devotee hill and dale rambled o'er , To sketch from the ceiling  --  the hangings  --  the floor Of that lofty temple in beauty that stands To man 's wond'ring vision , not reared by his hands .

There seemed seraph bands from the skies on their way , To join with the earth in an anthem of May ; Their path opened back , traced with light and with flowers , From their blissful world , while they sang thus to ours :  --  Earth , in thy lowliness , Strong was thy trust : Power ,  --  glory ,  --  holiness , Light now thy dust !

He calmly reclined on the damp forest knoll , A form dropped to earth by the transport of soul . A high , branching pine threw its arms o'er his rest ; The wild-wood aroma fell sweet on his breast ; His hushed lips were passed by the life 's fleeting breath , And chill on his brow came the night-dew of death ; Whilst none but the convoy who bore him on high Beheld when the cold angel sealed up his eye .

To yon old churchyard late I flew , And from its gate looked round , Where marble stood , and willows grew , Within the silent ground . The branches drooped ,  --  the graven stone Gazed on the grassy barrow ; But all was hush , and there was none Awake to hear the Sparrow . In simple suit of russet-brown I thus am daily dressed , Whilst other birds on me look down ; Yet I 've a peaceful breast .

Now , lady , lest around thy door The bird that comes to-day , A crumb to ask , may come no more , At heart my message lay . For I 'm our Maker 's carrier-bird , Though seems my sphere but narrow ; And ' t is a kindly Spirit-word He sendeth by the Sparrow !

Gould , Hannah Flagg , 1789-1865 : THE LILY OF THE VALLEY . from New poems ( 1850 ) Tender Lily of the vale , Lovely , modest , sweet , and pale , While a tear the night hath shed , Weeping o'er thy beauteous head , Forms the trembling diadem Weighing down thy slender stem , How in meekness art thou seen Like the lowly Nazarene ! Stooping o'er the dust beneath , From the leaf that rose to sheathe Thine unsullied snowy bells , Art thou pouring from their cells , As from pensile vials there , Odors , rising like the prayer , When in solemn , midnight scene Kneeled the lonely Nazerene .

And those who to gaze on it came Averred to the flower should be given A fitter and holier name :  --  They christened it Earnest-of-Heaven .

And he , to whom a falling fruit Mysterious Nature 's problem solved , Unerring , up through space could shoot , And span the spheres as they revolved .

And , measuring those proud realms afar , With angel speed and prophet 's sight , He set his foot from star to star ,  --  His way-marks were the orbs of light !

And thus , thy high discoveries made  --  The science , so attained by thee , Have made thy memory ne'er to fade , Thy glory for eternity !

And Lucy had tenderly watched them while growing ,  --  Had carefully led up their stems from the earth ; Her eye had beamed o'er the soft bud in its blowing , Her voice hailed with music the flower at its birth . Her delicate fingers had gathered and formed them So gracefully into the winter bouquet ; To save them from chill , at her heart she had warmed them , While bearing them through the cold air of the day .

Then why did she come , like an angel appearing To drop me a blessing , and hasten along ,  --  To pass in a moment from sight and from hearing ? Come back ! my dear Lucy , and sing me a song . Return ! and I 'll tell thee how fondly I cherish The flowers thou hast brought me , the best of the year ! That others may see them before they can perish , A tender memento , I fasten them here .

The scenes on its margin grew dearer , and brightened ; Each object shone forth in its loveliest hue ; Field , garden , and wood , yea , all nature , seemed lightened , All joy , but this heart , when it bade them adieu . Imbosomed in blossoms , the redbreast was singing , With music the morn in its glory to hail ; The swallow went down where the dew-drops were clinging , And sipped from the grass , as she skimmed o'er the vale . The hanging-bird 's hammock was still in vibration , To show its light tenant that moment had fled ; The iris-plumed humming-bird sought the carnation , And whirred o'er the cup where the honey-bee fed . The wild rose , and elder , and sweet-brier invited The insect to sip from their new-opened bloom ; The fern , fir , and cedar their odors united , And formed a sweet incense the breeze to perfume . Unmarred by the woodman , the old oak was standing , Alone and majestic , the pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green leaves expanding , For flock , herd , and husbandman shelter and shade . The slight mountain-ash , with the yellow-bird bending , Waved high in the air , like a warrior 's tall crest ; The pine 's verdant head , to her proud sphere ascending , The white eagle fanned , as she soared from her nest . But , down the blue stream as the fleet vessel bore me , Receding , the shores mocked my eye with their flight ; And when the broad ocean lay open before me , I turned , and the landscape had faded from sight . Like visions that fly , as time 's current is bearing Its passenger on through life 's pleasure and care ; It vanished from view , as my bark was preparing To launch on the flood that awaited me there . Roll on , noble River , with bright , curling waters ! And oft on thy sides may the stranger repose ; While blest is the land in its sons and its daughters , That bloom on the banks where the Kennebec flows ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . from New poems ( 1850 ) Footnote : 1Kb Look above , little Flower !

In the dust thou art bowed ; So I 'm sent from the cloud ; And I 'll fall , fresh and soft , on thy bed . Of my pearls , coming down , I will form thee a crown , To encircle thy brow young and fair ; Every leaf on thy stem Shall be tipped with a gem , Every bud sparkling diamonds shall wear .

" But why is she out , with a prospect so drear , Beneath the cold , lowering sky ? " Methinks is the question which many appear To ask , by a look , or a sigh .

Her mind is unsettled , and roving her eye ; And oft will she harmlessly roam , To watch the light figures in clouds on the sky , Or , round the sea-rocks , in the foam .

In autumn , or spring , in her mantle and hood , When clouds are portending a storm , She gathers light fagots , and fragments of wood , Her mother 's poor hearthstone to warm . For small is their cabin , hard down by the sea , And far less convenient than small ; The rain and the wind , in the storms , making free To pour through the roof and the wall .

Gould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New poems ( 1850 ) Flowers that bloom to wither fast ,  --  Light whose beams are soon o'ercast ,  --  Friendship , warm , but not to last ,  --  Such by Earth are given . Seek the flowers that ne'er shall fade ; Find the light no cloud can shade ; Win the Friend who ne'er betrayed ;  --  These are found in Heaven .
