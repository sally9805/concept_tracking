GOING TO MOUNT KATARDIN . LAST night I dreamed of Katahdin . Masculine tyranny had kept me , as a woman , in the house all day , on pretense of storms , which looked really worse from inside than outside . It was a wild , cold night , and the little comfortable lire , that smouldered on the hearth , was dying away as I went to sleep . The rail-roads were choked with snow ; but in five minutes I had traveled the three hundred miles , and was in those happy woods again . It was September once more , and we were in our camp by the lake . Breezes from the monarch of eastern mountains stirred the tall tree-tops above our heads ; the soft plash of the water came faintly through the white birch trees ; and was it a moose 's slender feet upon the twigs , or some crackling artillery among the green bushes on the fire ? I felt the softness of the hemlock couch beneath me-freshest and most fragrant of beds , where I never sought sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning against the tent stakes , as I had done so often . There was the little cleared circle amid the woods , lighted and limited by the smouldering fire . One great log , that hissed with a soothing sound of slow burning , sent sometimes a shower of sparks into the night air , and sometimes dropped its tribute of brilliants into the pit of intenser light beneath it . The embers before the tent of our masculine companions were low and dim , and , from the woods beyond , came the smothered stroke of an axe , wielded by the strong arm of guide or friends , risen at midnight to replenish them . But our domestic flames flickered on the scattered traces of our daily employments : pots , kettles , and birchbark platters ; three partridges hanging upon one , branch , a string of fish upon another ; a pile of tin dippers against a mossy root ; Fanny 's shoes drying on the ashes , and Rachel 's immaculate little white sun-bonnet on a projecting branch of the tent-pole . Above , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , the circle of trees stood , illuminated sentinels ; black , fliekering shadows were blotted in behind them ; end behind these lay the interminable forests of Maine . Suddenly the wind seemed to blow more wildly . What woodland bird or beast was it , pray , that gave that strange sound , like a combination of shivered window-glass and a crashing blind ? Instantly the light vanished , as I started up , broad awake , exclaiming : " Girls ! Kate , Fanny , the camp-fire is out ! " when a blast such as I never felt in the forest blew through the broken pane ; and I knew that it was January , not September  --  and a chamber , not a camp . The next day I went to Fanny 's house . Fanny was at home . " Friends , " said I , " we have been basely deceived . H. , who was to have been historiographer of our feminine expedition , has fled to foreign parts , and is probably at this moment standing on the Pico d'Azores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , that history is to be written , if I write it myself . " So here it follows : For more than a year , we had clearly resolved to go to the top of Katahdin , which , as everybody knows , is deep in the forests of Maine , and is the highest ground in New England , except Mount Washington . During the whole summer , L. , at Bangor , and H. , at home , had corresponded with the voluminousness which gentlemen always think necessary when anything entertaining is to be done . H. , also , in well-meant but rather superfluous precaution , was constantly calling at our houses during the last month , on various pretexts , but always happening to close with the inquiry whether our Bloomer dresses were ready for the woods , and an additional hint as to the importance of wearing our new calf-skin boots a good deal beforehand , so as to accustom the feet to pedestrian labors , etc. , etc . Of course , we needed no such suggestions . Accordingly , the boots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours before departing ; and the last stitches were put to the wardrobe of at least one , at a much later period . My impression is , that that stitch in time did not save nine subsequently . What could the staid conductor on the Eastern Railroad have thought of our state of spirits that night ? What the dignified statesman thought-our opposite neighbor in the car-was painted in his countenance . But if he had been a signer of the Declaration of Independ // ence , it woula not have sobered us . We had signed one ourselves . Anxious mothers and doubting papas were behind us ( it might be for weeks , but we knew it could not be forever ) , and we had before us the radiant days of early September , and a fortnight of freedom in the woods . Ingenuity itself could not discover anything to be anxious about . So many little things might have interfered , and none did . There was not even a cold among us , and nobody had forgotten her carpet-bag . On board the steamer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , we went to bed with the moon , and rose with the sun . It was lovely , up the Penobscot , passing somewhere that singular , stony mountain of which Theo . declared , that if it were struck by lightning , the lightning would get the worst of it . At last appeared the wharf ; there was Bangor , but there was not L. We needed a check to our triumph , and we had one . We went to the Bangor House , and felt for a moment a little blank , as L. alone was to make our arrangements . However , we packed our cares on H. 's shoulders , and sent him off to explore , while Alice and I took our own way to dispel our griefs , by going shopping , for shoes , veils , and gloves , additional , at the last moment . Presently , L. and sunshine came into tke room together ; they always hunt in couples . After him came Ben , our future driver , philosopher , and friend , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plenty of that ; slim , straight , and keen-eyed , with long black locks , and also two ends of blue ribbon , four times longer , depending from his hat ; probably a triumphal decoration for the ladies ' trip to Katahdin . I remember nothing more till we found ourselves Wehind Ben 's three horses , at four and a half p . M. , on the road from Bangor to Orono , riding among river views which I believe are good in reality , and which certainly are quite celestial in my memory . Ten precious souls , with their bodies ; and dear sturdy L. had plenty of both . Projector , patron , and purveyor of our expedition , he never looked so happy when preaching his best sermon , or bringing home his largest moose , as when he had thus his adopted children fairly within his reach , on their way to the wonders he had promised them How little he expected our first pause would bring him ( at Orono ) the tele graphic news of dear little Annie 's sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy heart , at the very entrance of our promised land . How we ever got over his departure , we never clearly understood . It shows what a state of spirits we were is . Indeed , at first , it hung upon a breath whether we should go on , or turn back . Happily the breath was L. 's , and we went on . But fancy a pleasure-party in a boat , with only one sailor among them , and he stepping on shore as they leave the wharf . Yet who had ever dreamed of a boat as longingly as we had dreamed of Katahdin ? When I say we ivent on without L. , therefore , I say something wonderful . Happily , we took in Mr. C. , himself a sturdy prop , and especially charged by L. with our support . Mr. B. had joined us at Bangor , so we were still ten precious souls , though we felt a trifle less precious than before . How that cool , rich evening air wiped out our sorrows ! Yes , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were , in an open wagon , on a cloudless night , and we were on the way to Katahdin ; and there was the low and winding Penobscot , and the early stars above its meadows ; and these cottages were Maine farm-houses , and so all was delightful ; and we talked , and laughed , and made acquaintance with our new recruits , and sang the songs for the first time , which we were never to hear the last of . And we rode through Oldtown , with its mills and looms ; and Sunkhaze , where we could not find that anything was ever sunk , except a horse and his rider in the mud , about whom the usual story is told . And there is a still better story , viz. , that a certain spirit , conversing through his medium in Bangor , and declaring his position to be in the unmentionable region of perpetual warmth , stated ( on being asked for minuter details ) , that the said place was far , far worse than Oldtown , and almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twenty-two miles from Bangor . It wits a good beginning . Theo . was confident that he had heard the cry of a wolf , and we had everything comfortable about us . In the evening we called in experts to testify as to routes and guides . rhese gentlemen , tipped back thpir chairs and gave familiar lectures wits great gusto ; slashing into our preju // dices without mercy , objecting to our favorite plan of approach ( though wo took it after all ) , and setting down our expected guide with " Law ! he s an old hen ! " ( N. B. We did n't take taI*e him , but he is n't ! ) In the morning , some of us were amused by the comments of our advisers and others on our expedition . " Do n't yer suppose , now , them gals will have a better time than if they 'd gone to Saratogue or them places ? " " Think likely ! " ejaculated another . " Git to the top of Katahdin , will they , think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " but they think they 're goin ' to , and they 'll have just as good fun as if they did ! " The gentlemen began to shed civilization at Greenbush , and showed a tendency to brilliant shirts , while we postponed our October hues for two days longer . But the change gave us a little the air of a circus company as we rode along , and contributed to the excitement of the Penobscot valley . Our wagon had three seats , holding three each , besides room for three more passengers , viz. , two on the great iron guards to the wheels , and one on the barrel of hard bread that was made fast behind . These places being extremely uncomfortable , were of course the favorites with the gentlemen of the party . These scarlet outriders gnve'breadth as well as color to the equipage ; and it was quite impressive to walk on before the wagon and look back , as our three stout horses toiled up long hills in Ben 's energetic hands , or Kate 's , sometimes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Katahdin ; in fact it called forth the first of those triplets of rather shrill hurras which afterwards marked all important eras of our expedition , and some unimportant ones . There stood the great , bare , lonely , steep , blue magnificence , as marked in outline as Monadnock , but more absolutely isolated , more precipitous , more sublime ; its square top , not yet broken by nearness into volcano-like jags , but the whiteness of its many broad slides gleaming afar off , and rather fearfully . All day we kept his majesty in sight , and he seemed to withdraw or bring near his august form , as the vapors gathered or dissolved around him-delicate vapors , never a cloud . We were surprised all along here , first at the openness of the country , and Sept. , then at the size of the villages ; indeed8 we afterwards heard expressions of astonishment that we had been willing to go through the cities in such costume . The cities were Lincoln and Mettawamkeag . There anxieties about guides began . We could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . * ' but were happy in securing the aid of " Alick McClane , " a vigorous specimen of resolute manhood , who looked as if ho could go anywhere , and accomplish anything , unless turning back made a part of the duty . His measure was easily given to us , in the lumberer 's scale- " Can charge his six dollars a day , in spring , as head of a drive , ' and get it , too . " Our horses were tired , hut we were bound to reach " Hunt 's , " the last house on our route , by the morrow night . So we must push on seven miles further , after dark , walking much of the way . The road changed , and led through deep woods . How wild it was , to press on before the rest , with a single companion , lighted by stars , glowworms , and a lantern ; no house , endless woods full of possible bears , and no sound but the lumbering of the wagon behind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near midnight , was the light of the South Moluncas Hotel , at the foot of the Aroostook road . We had already heard of a dance , this night , at this very hotel , and that was one of our reasons for resolving to get there , though Ben , our driver , had promised us a sleepless night in consequence . To be sure , he admitted , these balls were nothing to the times in spring , when the lumbermen came out of the woods , to these rural inns . " Lively doings then 7 " asked we . " I tell you , " quoth Ben , energetically , " the things they do n't say and do , ai n't worth thinking of ! " After this preparation , we were astonished at the quietness of the establishment ; but the ball had turned out rather a failure , and the youths and maidens were as well dressed and as tame as in Boston . They were just going to supper , and we were too tired to sit up for the renewal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them that our party would have made their dance " enough sight livelier . " He had already learned to appreciate us , that was evident . We waked fresh and bright , and so did the morning ; in the little parlor // we found a spirited damsel who had been in the second party of women to the mountains ( Mrs. E. 0 . Smith 's being the first , and ours the third ) . Her account was slightly fearful ; they spent eight days in the woods , and when they got back from " Hunt 's , " she had to be lifted out of the wagon . We looked at ours , and inwardly vowed we would not sink to that degradation , even if we had to roll over the bread-barrel in the rear . But we now knew what was before ustwenty-five miles of forest walking , each way , not more than we expected ; but first we must get to the terminusTo relieve Ben 's horses , four of us got into a stage wagon that passed , and rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our fame had traveled before us , and the driver eagerly asked which of the ladies was Lucy Stone ? We thought of assuming her laurels , as there was no great danger of being called on for a speech , and we could safely crow when going into the woods ; but we told the truth at last , that she was not of our party . It seemed that there had been in Bangor a rumor of her coming with us . That was surely a delicious ride , along the Aroostook road ; genuine Maine , at length ; woods not very ancient , indeed , but unbroken ; up sudden hills , and down into perilous valleys w1. *ere the wheels were braked ; on , on , among bright leaves and tall dead stems draperied with lichens and mosses ; scarcely a clearing in the distance , but constant glimpses of the great lonely Katabdin , pale blue against the sky , square and stem , his sides scarred whiter than ever , and opening his vast crater more and more upon a nearer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Township , No. 1 ( in the fifth range ) , has four families . No. 2 is or was owned by the Roman Catholic bishop of Boston , and is settled by Irish wholly . It is sometimes called Benedicta . No. 3 is a very little settlement ; yet the tavern at which we dined had been occupied sixteen years ; it is supported wholly by the lumber business , and a kind old lady looked up from her knitting to inform us that eighteen or twenty horses stopped there every night , and in winter , thirty or forty . The human statistics seemed less important . At this place , as everywhere else , our party called forth much wonder , more compliments than wonder , and more good advice thai ; i compliments . On this occasion , we were warned , among other things , rtr*t to expect to get to Hunt 's that night . It was hard to bear this , as much of our plans depended on that point . It was only ten miles , by the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ride turned out a walk . for most of us , and the first five miles took nearly three hours . And the lumber road made Pinkham Notch look smooth , and the North Conway paths appear English lawns . Yet , how lovely it was to walk through those endless woods into the dying day , the long rank under-growth filling up the intervals of the trees , and , at every step , some splendor amid the greenery , or dark blue dracoena berries , or the gorgeous scarlet seeds of the arum . Lovely , until some sudden plunge of a gentleman into a bog ( for the ladies were more carefully guided ) , or of a wagonwheel into some gap in the " corduroy road , " brought the procession to a precipitate halt , amid unfailing and joyous laughter . Thus early were the strength and spirits of the party testeda thing most important ; for it is precisely the same mishaps and misadventures which bring dismay to the timid traveler , *nd make up half the enjoy . ment of the journey to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we reached , not Hunt 's farm-house , but Stacy 's , the only previous one , and half the distance . Here we held a council , abandoned at once our cherished hope , and in ten minutes had formed our usual line from wagon to entry , passed in shawls , cloaks , valises ( one apiece ) , and all smaller commodities , while Ben had unbarnessed his horses , and MeClane and Mr. C. started on foot for Hunt 's , to make arrangements for the morrow . The little house swelled to receive us ; two prompt and ladylike maidens moved quietly about to make preparations ; a delightful farmer 's supper was soon ready ( and such appetites ! ) and we settled down for the night , pleased and surprised at our most unexpected quarters . This detention was the one great success of our journey . We stopped for a night 's lodging , and found a treasure . The fact was , we still had felt rather anxious about our guides . MeClane // was admirable ; but we needed twobesides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we knew the inconvenience which the slightest mistake in our course might produce . Our one desideratum was , a guide in whose knowledge of the route we might feel implicit confidence , and we found him here . John Stacy - the fine looking youth in a red shirt , who went in and out occasionally as we sat at table-not only turned out to be ( as we afterwards discovered ) the best woodsman in that region , but had actually been one of the party which spotted , as it is termed , the only path through the woods to Katahdin , on this side . No wonder we eagerly clutched at such a prize ; but we evidently had a reciprocal attraction , for though he had to leave his grain Unshorn ( as in the Scotch ballad ) , he , at last , forsook it and followed . Yes , we had reason to be grateful for our delay at that pleasant farm-house , with the original log-cabin beside it , in which this really refined and agreeable family had been born and bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by , which , tired as we were , we must go out and see before light failed us . Nay , the house seemed a half-way house to Katahdin ; for the memory of Mrs. E. 0 . Smith 's visit was still a fruitful subject of conversation ; and we found , on referring to the journal pf a certain friend ( which we had brought with us ) , that he also had stopped here , ten years before , and had praised the same household attributes which we admired . We slept that night in large rooms , unfinished , so that our neighbors ' lights glimmered through the laths , and every voice in the house sounded close to our ears . It was easy to wake each other up next day ; indeed , peals of laughter did that unconsciously . For a great transformation took place that morning ; and we , who left the parlor at night , robed in the bedrabbled skirts of civilisation , reappeared at breakfast , metamorphosed into free and happy " Bloomers . " Be it known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short dress , " as itis more mildly termed by its friends , and had delayed assuming it as long as possible . But yesterday 's mud had settled that question , so down we came , in our very melo-dramatic costume . The gentlemen tried to spare our feelings ; but it must be confessed , that our feet Sept. , trod uneasily in the unaccustomed daylight . Shall I describe the dresses ? First , Fanny and Kate came shyly in , attired alike in slate-colored suits , trimmed with an almost invisible blue cord ; there was , also , a glimpse of not quite invisible blue stockings , just above the substantial shoes  --  the sombreness of their dresses being relieved by little jaunty felt hats and colored ribbons . They were declared to resemble stage-struck nuns , or Quaker opera-dancers . Next , Alice tried to escape observation , by hiding her face beneath a broad straw hat ; but her scarlet trimmings , on a plain dark skirt and jacket , made her both conspicuous and picturesque . The two remaining damsels put on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be looked at . Mistress Mary wore a chocolate-colored suit , corded with scarlet , and a white felt hat ; a pair of boots hung at her belt ( the only genuine pair in the party ) , and she carried a long staff , like little Bo-peep in the picture . Finally , came Rachel , whose costume was at once admitted , without envy , to be the crowning triumph . Her dress was blue and drab , with broad blue trimmings , and the trowsers gathered in at the ankle , were very becoming to the little booted feet . She wore a white sun-bonnet ( which staid white to the last ) , lined with blue ; and the tin cup at her belt completed her resemblance to La Fille du Regiment , with her canteen . The five gentlemen 's costumes I must be excused from describing ; they looked sturdy and comfortable in various combinations of blue and red shirts and frocks , with black belts for knives and cups . In some cases they even looked picturesque , especially Theo . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and decorated with large white stars and white spread-eagles , upside down . Beside these , we had our two guides and our trusty driver , Ben ; all three having served their time in a lumber-camp , and knowing on which side of a pine tree to look for the north . A few hours of the morning brought us to that desire of our hearts , Hunt 's farm-house ; and it proved as delightful a spot as we had fancied . It is the end of inhabited Maine in this direction , and an important place to the lumberers in the logging season . Here is a little Going te Mount Katakdin. // green clearing on the high bank of the lovely " East Branch " ( Penobseot ) , which here makes a bend round a point of forest ; wooded mountains rise behind , hiding King Katahdin . The farm-house was defined by Then . as being " very small outside , and very large inside  --  the proper way to build a house ; " it is of logs , squared and boarded over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the cheeriest of hostesses . Their last previous visitor was Church , the artist , who had just been spending some time there . None of us had ever seen him , but we wished that he had staid long enough to accompany and illustrate our march ; and we wished , also , for jovial John P. Hale , whom we heard of down below , at South Moluncas , idling away his time in making stump speeches , instead of going beyond the stumps into the forest with us . Meanwhile , the gentlemen proceeded to " make up their packs " in the most scientific manner , on the grass before the house . Packs are made thus : a square blanket or coarse shawl is spread on the ground , and the contents placed on one corner ; then rolled over and over , till the other corner is reached , which is securelyopinned with a wooden peg . The two ends of this long roll are then brought together and also pinned ; and the whole slung over the , victim 's shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimissimum , for six days . But add nearly a barrelful of hard bread , fifteen pounds of sugar , thirty pounds of pork , twenty pounds of tea , beside two tents , cooking utensils , gun , axe , and sundries , and you will perceive that the sinews of our masculine friends were likely to be pretty well tested . After a good dinner , we left Hunt 's , with three cheers . Crossing the river in a bateau , we struck at once into a forest-path , that led  --  to Katahdin ! Fifty miles of forest and mountain were before us , including the return walk ; but we had a cloudless sky , happy hearts , trustworthy companions , and comfortable shoes . Thanks to the practice of the two preceding days , we were somewhat inured to walking ; and to this , and our moderate speed at the outset , was attributed our entire freedom from blistered feet , the most common discomfort of pedestrians . Mr. Hunt was to go with us a few miles , to convey our load as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " jumper ; " but the jumper soon jumped once too often , over a stone , and broke down , and the packs had to be shouldered . The fresh delight of that first afternoon 's walk , with the world behind us , and the woods before , can neither be described noS forgotten . It was too delicious to be real , and too genuine to be ideal . We walked along a grassy path , cut to carry provisions to the lumber camps in winter , as we saw by a few scattered traces-here a sled among the bushes , there a vast empty cask . These were all but concealed by the luxuriant undergrowth . We walked among great golden rods , and coarse white asters , higher than our heads , ane. were never far from the shallo*v , rippling river . Here and there some tree had fallen across the road , or some rude bridge been swept away from a water*course : if there had been no difficulties to surmount , we should not have known the luxury of our new costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , that H. imparted : " never step on anything which you can step over ; " for he little knew what a novelty it was to us , to be able to step over anything . We could scarcely believe that we had walked six leisurely miles , when we reached our first camping-ground , at sunset . " Already ! " was the universal cry , as , two by two , we came down with delighted surprise into the little forest dingle , where the blue smoke already curled up through the stately trees , and we could see McClane spreading tents , while Stacy unrolled packs , and old Mirch ( an assistant brought with us from Hunt 's , for this day only ) busied himself among his scanty kettles and pans . We women-folk were soon a picturesque group of semi-fatigue , beneath the trees ; but presently hastened to join in the feminine avocation of bedmaking . In this case , the bedstead was a spot of earth , from which all stubs and stumps had been smoothed away by the axe ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of hemlock boughs , laid regularly , in shingle fashion , over the whole surface . This being thoroughly done , and a thickness or two of blanket laid over it , the result is luxury . Pillows we had none , or only the ancient Egyptian style , namely , a log of wood . // After awhile , Fanny , Rachel , and I , wandered off to the river side , first crossing a brook , by a fallen tree , in the fading light . We had left the East Branch behind us , and sat now watching the pretty whirling ripples of the wild Wissatacook , swiftest of the Penobscot 's tributaries . At last , then , we had entered on our gipsy life . Would all be happy as now , or would rains and disasters follow ? Would the joyous thoughts and refreshing exsistence of the woods only come and go away useless , like those water-drops down the river , or lead our aspirations , like the blue smoke , upward ? Suddenly the smoke suggested other thoughts* and we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our lives , tasted fried pork and crackers . Well , it was not quite unsuccessful , and we hoped for something better to-morrow , and had it . Tea without milk was not intolerable either , only so great were the demand* upon the sugar , that Mr. B. became its guardian , at once , and kept close the string of the sack . We sat up awhile ; for it did not take long to " clear away the things ; " we looked at the stars , and the fire , and the trees , and each other , and the picturesque red-shirted figures passing to and fro with great logs , or with waterpails ; we were very happy ; we sung songs and hymns ; and did not like it overmuch , when H. , beginning thus promptly his tyranny , sent us to bed very early , and then sat up himself . How inconceivably strange it was , to lie on the ground , wrapped in our blankets , with only a tent above our heads , and a camp*fire before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that side . The air seemed cool , if we popped our heads out into it ; but the tent was full of warmth-sometimes too much warmthand occasionally , though rarely , a trifle of smoke . For me , I lay awake an hour , and then slept , I may say , enthusiastically . One or two were less fortunate ; but they declared it was worth lying awake for . No sound but the wind in the trees , and the crackling flames-think of it ! Besides early bed-time , H. established a rule that we should rise every day at five , and the ladies should have exclusive possession of the forest and river for half an hour , the gentlemen taking their turn afterwards . To these delightful morning ablu tions , we owed , no doubt , much of the health and comfort of the journey . At six we breakfasted-fried pork and crackers for the second and last time . We had brought no other provisions ( except tea and sugar ) , relying on the woods to furnish our supplies , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were glad to have to come down to the sunplest fare at the outset , so as to know that we could do it . Indeed , in respect to fried pork and crackers , one finds after a day 's tramp , that  --  but perhaps I had better stop . At any rate , the gentlemen wore pleased to compliment our freshness of appearance in the morning , nor was Stacy , our guide , content with this partial encomium . ( I intend to write the whole truth , the whole , or none . ) Said H. , who had observed his scrutinizing eye dwelling on one or another of the party , " Mr. Stacy , will these ladies get through to the top ? " " That 's what they wilt do , " responded he , energetically . " I tell you , there 's no better grit to be scared up anywhere than those women have ! " If we had quniled for one moment during the excursion , these words would have inspired us again . While the final preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering regret the smouldering reremains of our fire , dying away into blank daylight . At seven we left , with packs somewhat diminished in weight , the gentlemen remarked at first . I believe that after a mile or two they changed their opinion . Our way at first led along a high bank , above the river , through the same rank growth of aster and golden-rod ; we went strolling on , with our long staves of black birch , beneath trees higher than before ; still no scrambling or real difficulty yet . Sometimes we stopped to rest ; once at a deserted lumberers ' camp , built of logs , with fire-place in the middle , " deaconseat " on each side , and sleeping-places still littered with decayed fir-boughs , behind . Close by , stood the stable-a more imposing edifice than the house . During these halts , Alfred would make impetuous efforts to catch fish , while Ben strolled before us with a gun , haying about equal success , that is , none at all . At last we must leave our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper woods . The transit was effected by aid of our strong guides , who grasped // hands , and thus gave us a seat between them . H. , however , having had some experience in carrying invalid ladies , was moved to transport Alice alone . The water was not more than knee deep , but very rapid , and the bottom consisted of large , round , slippery stones ; we were , therefore , not surprised , before he reached the opposite shore , to see him sink suddenly as one knee , where he quietly remained , afraid to attempt to recover himself , and holding Alice aloft , until help came in the shape of Stacy . She escaped with only a wet foot , but we all had that soon ; for we presently plunged into the most inexplicable bog which we anywhere encountered . Evidently some mountain stream had hurried through there in the spring , carrying a lapful of logs to play with , and had never taken the trouble to clear them away afterwards ; so we played puss-in-the-corner with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-jumping from clump to clump of grass , amid black mud , in which our boots sank full fathoms five , and our feet became mere cork-screws to pull them out again ; then chancing on little dells of lovely Linn*a , still in bloom , and stopping to decorate our hats with its long sprays of soft leaves and nodding flowers , soon to be torn off , perhaps , by overhanging boughs . The great white berries of the delicate creeping snowberry were also beneath our feet , and we refreshed ourselves with these ; Stacy first pronouncing them innocent . We saw al5o berries of tril lium , Solomon 's seal , dwarf cornel , and draccena ? Then we took our * course upward , having to skirt a smallar eminence before coming in sight of Kat ahdin . There was only the vestige of a path , which we soon became expert in tracing ; as also in detecting the " spots " on trees , where previous ex plorers had struck off a chip with an axe , for guidance . Sometimes , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till his cheery voice rang through the woods . Often , too , we halted with no such good reason . For we varied in speed , of course , and it was very pleasant , at some place where a clear spring oozed from the rich black earth , to halt and drink from our tin cups , and look back on red and blue flgwres winding through the woods , while each of our brethren , as he came up , unslung the weary pack from his shoulders , and some companion damsel , perhaps , seated herself at once upon it , or lay reclined upon the moss , gazing up at the heaven between the tree-tops . No wild beasts , nor wild men , only a partridge whirred away when the gun was in the wrong place . To be sure , an advance party once saw a bear , but he quickly retreated ; however , we all saw bear tracks , and fresh deer tracks everywhere . As for men , we found the names of two youths of our acquaintance recorded on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appended our own beneath them . We elsewhere found one of their night-camps , skillfully built of boughs and hemlock bark . There were few flowers , and the trees were not so large as we had expected ; though sometimes a magnificent pine towered amid the second growth , memorial of a time when maidens , duskier and more agile than we , chanted their murmuring songs beneath its boughs . At such times , also , we could compare notes of experience , and have leisure for Theo . ' s jokes , and the woodland lore of the guides . It was wonderful how many different themes the pine woods led to . It is said that western roads often dwindle to a squirrel track , and run up a tree , but our talk ran up the trees first , and then far away . Who would think , for instance , of any connection between Katahdin and the Crimea ? But we learned that the war had raised the value of bearskins , in these forests , to fourteen dollars . Then we broached the Darien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor Strain he commended in terms brief indeed , but as strong as New England lips can pronounce . " That Strain , " he said , " was a plaguy smart fellow . " This was a compliment not to be gainsayed , considering the man it came from . He criticised Strain 's course a little , however . " It was unfortunate that he had sailors with him instead of woodsmen . He ought to have left the stream and trusted to his compass ; " which is hereby recorded for the benefit of future Darien explorers . So , walking and halting , we made our pleasant way along , with only the discomfort that no good place presented itself for our noonday rest , until , at two o'clock , we suddenly came out of the thick woods , and the mountain rose before us , " so blue and so far , " as Browning says . Another step , and beneath 18561 249 // us lay a little lake , as large as Jamaica Pond ( near Boston ) , rippling almost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray , wooden dam , roughly built years ago by the first lumberers , to flood the brook below at the proper time . Katahdin lake is the source of the South Branch of the swift Wissaticook , while the North Branch almost encircles Katahdin . Look iu Colton 's atlas , and you will find precisely where we were , though the names are not given . The little waves rippled pleasantly on the yellow beach as we came down upon it , and the sun shone so warmly that we were glad to clamber down into the shade of the old dam , which looked so quiet and gray , * that nature seemed to have adopted it as willingly as if beavers had made it , and it did not seem to interfere with that loneliness we loved . The brook slipped through it , and went dashing on , among great rounded rocks , with deep , dark , whirling pools , offering suggestions of superb trout , which it proved hard to fulfill . Among these rocks we perched ourselves , and I afterwards pilfered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake , 2 P.M.-Stacy , delighting himself by catching fish in the lake ; and McClane delighting us by making a fire to cook them ; Alfred , rather dissatisfied with hooks and brooks ; Ben , eyeing Katahdin through a spyglass , who eyes him back , quite undisturbed ; the rest of the company seeking shade . B. rather sleepy on one side of the dam ; C. and Rachel wide awake on the other ; Fanny below , letting down her hair over the water , like a bloomerized mermaid ; Mary and Theo . trying to balance themselves , in great discomfort , upon a sharp , smooth rock , amid peals of laughter ; Kate climbing over similar rocks , in a restless manner , as if she had been cheated of her usual exercise to-day , and meant to make up for it somehow ; finally , Alice and H. pledging each other in copious tin cups of cold biscuit and water . " How delighted we were , when it was decided to remain for the night at this pleasant place , catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk next day . We were not at all tired , and could easily have gone further ; for we had only walked seven miles , though those were forest miles , to be sure . But Sept , we all felt stronger and better than when we left home . It only seemed absurd that strong and active women should go anywhere else . I can scarcely look back upon a more blissful memory than that sunny afternoon by the lake ; soul and body seemed alike satisfied ; trout and tranquillity ruled the hour . ( N. B. They caught a hundred fish and then stopped . ) The freedom of the woods descended deeper and deeper into us , all obstacles seemed removed , and everything looked easier than we had expected . As for the mountain , nobody can ever imagine how glorious it was that afternoon , changing with the waning sunlight , that sank and faded behind it . The summit was four miles from us in an air-line , and twelve by our track . It was the most personal mountain I had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from its isolation , than any of the large family of White Mountains-as , indeed , the abrupt height is much greater  --  the surrounding country being lower . Alfred compared it to Vesuvius , which he had seen , and we were always impressed with its volcanic appearance . It stood out magnificent and lonely in a sea of woods-square , and jagged at the top ; while * projecting shoulder on one side gave us a glimpse of its terrible basin , or crater , whose bare cliffs , one thousand feet high , we could see without a glass . The white " slides " were barer and nearer , and at the foot of one of them , half way up the mountain , Stacy pointed out our next night 's camping-ground . But , after all we had heard of the perpetual clouds and storms , in which this mystic mountain-home of the Indian Pomola was encircled , it seemed strange that it should be so clear and unforbidding now . There was no gorgeous sunset that night , however ; but over the wholo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peak retired further and further away , as if following the light over the western horizon . A few small and placid clouds just lingered round its brow , - reddish , brown , and golden-while the lake below began to be gently ruffled by the evening breeze . But I think it is time to draw upon a certain epic , which was made by thc company on our return , being a veritable history of our progress . Most of it was written in the steamboat , Rachel acting as scribe , while the other passen t // gers , drawing round , looked on with wonder , and one asked me confidentially . " if that was the young lady who wrote verses for the newspapers . " Here is a specimen : " But now we 'll bid our lyre awake , To sing the glories of the lake . Beyond it King Katabdin towered , With sunset glories richly dowered . The horizon was shrouded with silvery haze , That ethereal veil of our autumn days ; The travelers wander here and there , To camp-ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some sketch the view ; Workers there are , and idlers , too ; Beneath the dam the latter rest , Reading aloud , with eager zest , Those words of our great Emerson , Which from the winds and waves have won That harmony of rhyme and rune , Which chimes with changing naturestune ; And then the autumn evening long Was passed in merry games and song . In the night the loon 's laugh , clear and shrill , Sounded from every echoing hill , And we heard , above the wild wind 's roar , The tramp ef the moose on the foresttloor . " That last line means something ; it brings me to an adventure , with a preliminary to it . That night as we sat singing , and Kate 's rich voice was mounting up in the fine chorus of the " Old Kentucky Home , " suddenly , " Hush  --  a footstep ! " cried Fanny , melodramatically , and hush it was . And a footstep it was , too ; for , listening intently , we heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushes . " Moose , " said M*Clane , briefly , and explained that our fires were made in a moose path , where they came down to drink . Out went our guide , into the darkness , with a rifle , but came back unsuccessful , though we had heard the rifle crack ; and next day we found that the pretty creature had made its way to the water , and refreshed itself , in spite of us . We were glad enough that they did not shoot it , and , as I timidly remarked to C. , " Suppose it had been a man , he might have been killed . " " Certainly , " he coolly replied , " for we knew there was nothing outside but what ought to be killed , " - a rather startling view , and , perhaps , a little exclusive , we thought . Now for the adventure . " Wake up , boys , Billy Kirby is going to die , " as the Howadji has it . Just as we had got our birch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each meal , and burned them afterwards , the most thorough housekeeping we had ever known ) , we heard , close to us , bang ! bang ! two rifle shots in quick succession . We looked round , and there lay our private arsenal , against a tree ! Who could it be ? We had felt as far from men as if we were in the middle of the ocean . Some cried , " L. has followed us after all , " and we all rushed out . H. and I ran to the lake side , and there lay the gun , and there stood such a figure-clothes ragged and torn from the woods , face haggard , wild eyes like blue fire , hair dripping from a hasty ablution ; he looked intoxicated , or insane , and turned out only sleepless and hungry ; a wandering hunter , who had come through on our track from Hunt 's , since 2 P. M. the day before , lost his way in the " fathoms five " bog , and had no sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him to their hearts at once-we took him to our breakfast . He had partridges for our larder , having had better luck than we , and , moreover , kept us supplied from that moment . He was a Lowell man , but had been to California , and everywhere else ; he wore a gay Mexican poncho , and half the time went bareheaded , with elf leeks , and keen , metallic blue eyes ; and Ben christened him " Mr. Wildfire . " It had rained the night previous , and we feared a wet day ; b ut the morning was only cold and raw . This showed the mountain in a new aspect of wonder . Instead of that radiant outline of filmy brightness , there was now a vast castle of chill gray cloud , with dark towers of precipice frowning here and there , between . It was no longer our summer friend , but the gloomy and awful abode of Pomola . We remembered what storms others had suffered on that height ; and what Thoreau said , that it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and we shuddered to think that our next night 's camp would be within that circle of white , soft , cold , vaporous mystery . Should we dare it ? But , moment by moment , clouds went and came , and always more went than came1 and at last the sunlight once more shone brightly on the woodfringed lakes , and we went up to breakfast as aforesaid . That morning we walked four miles to Roaring Brook , and it was exciting enough to know that now we were at the real base of the mountain ; here we talked an hour , and while Stacy fried the fish , we sat upon a sturdy pine // qwq less , and shone rosy with answering light . All smiled benignant , and we shivered acquiescent . Our teeth , indeed , chattered , but our hearts bounded ; and we went back to our partridges in bliss . That day was such a day as one dreams of for the great days of history . What had we done to deserve such love from Pomola , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But now it seemed as if every cloud that lingered on the earth 's surface was cleared away to the antipodes , and this one bright epoch allotted to Katahdin and to us . We ran rather than walked , a quarter of a mile through the woods , and came out at the foot of the great slide . Oh ! what a place . One broad gray furrow up the mountain side ; that was the slide . Fancy a dozen gray walls of crumbling stone , each steeple-high , piled one on the other , up into the sky ; that was the mountain . We felt like standing off a little , lest the peak itself should totter over upon our heads . We sat down to meditate . Then we got up , to climb . All I can say is that we did climb , and got to the top somehow . I have an indistinct recollection that the summit looked about half a mile off , vertically , from the bottom  --  a mile when half way up  --  and two miles afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the summit , looked from above close to the base ; that the people above us seemed to be hung on pegs , and the people below us to be balanced upon the tops of trees ; that sometimes we were tugged along by gentlemen , and sometimes offered to help gentlemen along ; that it was very pleasant to stop and roll stones down , but not quite so pleasant to start again , and drag ourselves up ; that finally when we got near the top among the blueberry and cranberry beds , it seemed an absolute embargo on further progress ; at least , till we had eaten over the whole berry garden , covering perhaps an acre and a half . But how delicious that long repose was , to cling to the side of the mountain by the bushes ( for it really amounted to that ) , nibble the minute morsels of aromatic nourishment , which the bears had left for us , facing round sometimes , from the berries , to look at the universe . Among this vegetation , grew low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have been trees further down ; but we did not need to clamber over the tops of these , as other explorers had done on a different side of the mountain . On this side it was bare enough , and there was no obstacle but the trifling one of perpendicularity . In our weakness we found that sufficient ; but nevertheless , I have an impression , that the first on top was a woman . At any rate , the ascent took three hours . trhe top of the mountain can be depicted at a single stroke , to any well instructed woman . Merely fancy the rim of a teacup , five miles round , with a piece broken out of one side . Beside this , the whole is jagged and uneven ; nibbled , in truth , by a thousand or two of hungry winters . So that after we had once reached the edge on the southeast , we spent an hour more in climbing a mile further along , higher , and still higher , up one dark , sharp cliff , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often at liberty to tumble off either way , at our pleasure . Dark , bare , inhospitable , impenetrable granite ; if there is anything solid in the material globe , we thought we had found it at last . It was more impressive than the vast pile of broken fragments , which forms the sum2ilit of Mount Wash . ington ; and it is singular , that though not volcanic , it closely resembles in size , shape , and proportions the only volcanic crater I ever saw . How strange it was to be lifted , at a gigantic height , with a narrow pedestal beneath one 's feet , sheer up into the blue dome of heaven ; but very kindly that bhie dome received us , so simple in coloring , so sublime ; one soft white bar of cloud encircling the whole heavens near the horizon , and nothing else to mar the absolute and perfect hue . Such simplicity of coloring , blue sky , white cloud , and beneath , one sea of green ; only , here and there lay noble lakes-scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the crystal Ambijejis , " Chesancook , and the rest . To the southeast , Lake Katahdin lay delicately couched amid its long , evergreen branches , and we thought that had we wings as eagles we could make one dip into its pale soft waters , and then swoop homeward . The forest trees had not the lsok of vast size that we expected ; but the dens- // G*iag to Mount Katahdin. ity was beyond expression . " It did not look as if a solitary traveler had cut so much as a walking-stick there . " Only we were startled to see , below us , two faint dimples in the woods at the very base of the mountain . One , Stacy assured us , was where the young trees had been cleared for our last night 's camp-another marked a spot where he himself had camped for a longer time . So unconsciously do we leave our mark in the universe . Afterwards they showed us " the farm "  --  a dot of brighter green in the remote distance-and something white , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basin , or crater , lay on our right , encircled by the vast rim along which we picked our way . It was exciting to hear , that descent into it was absolutely impossible , and it could only be approached by the gap aforesaid on the eastern side . It was exciting to roll stones over precipices , whither even our agile guides could not fellow ; and hear the sharp rattle and crash from depth to depth . Yet it did not look bare in that great basin ; for its area of two hundred acres is mostly overgrown with bushes , among which , however , great slides track themselves in heaps of desolation , and great square blocks of granite suggest shuddering fancies of the time when , in the dead of winter , perhaps , those giant m'asses crashed and rebounded from above . On the south side of this basin , there is a deep , narrow indentation , through which the winds rush fearfully , it is said , when Pomola 's cloud factory within is in active operation . This must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we would go still further , and we saw there was one point of rock , some two miles distant , that was somewhat higher than that on which we stood ; but we had done enough , fortune had favored us , and why should we tempt her more ? We had done it ; we had ascended Katahdin , and the reality was more than our dreams . Only Fanny was dissatisfied ; she and Mr. Wildfire wished to go further yet . The latter had heard of a spring of good water two miles ahead , and he wanted " just to step along and try a taste of it . " We were quite in a condition to appreciate good spring water , but MeClane , with gallant labor , had just brought us a small pailful from nearly that distance in a different direction , and we thought that " just to step along " over two miles of rugged granite cliffs , at a height of six thousand feet , was a step too far . However , there was more reason in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taste of mountain springs ; and when we saw Mr. W. clamber on before us , through the aforesaid gully , bareheaded , his long hair and poncho waving in the fierce wind , which even then blew there , his gun slung over his shoulderclimbing straight up cliffs where a civilized cat would have lost eight of her lives , and gazing round at us half way , with *vild , triumphant eyes , we really felt ashamed not to go where he did , though , I dare say , we should all have been at the north pole by this time , if we had once undertaken to follow . We resisted , , brought Fanny back , wrote our names on a paper , and put it in a phial , which Stacy hid somewhere in this corner-stone of the globe ; and then resolutely went down . First , however , we came suddenly upon the one inhabitant of the regionPomola 's sole incarnation ; but here I must draw upon the epic again : " Bristling , bouncing , black and big , There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain*e , And a thousand more were stuck in his side . Stacy drove him fl-em rock to rock , With sometimes a poke , and sometimes a knockStirring him up with good-will hearty For the benefit of the stranger party . " One or two halts among the cranberry bushes , on which his bedgehogship ( quill-pig is the vernacular ) was browsing , and , with a large supply of this valuable addition to our cuisine , we stepped over the edgo of Katahdin . That descent was a good deal quicker than the ascent , a little easier , a : *d far more amusing . There is a picture in Punch 's " Tour of Brown , Jones , and Robinson , " which always recalls it to us . Ben had previously described the place to us , as one " where the shortest jacket would trail on the ground . " Down we slid , two and two , supported on canes if we had them , over the steep surface of decomposed granite , often dislodging larg. stones , which would have damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped them by its friction . In an hour and a half we accomplished what had cost us 4 254 Sept. , // three in the morning ; and it was pleasant to pause where Avalanche Brook distilled itself  --  a series of tiny dropsfrom the shelter of a rock-fragment , in the very middle of the great slide . We could see also the tracks of other brooks in wooded ravines along the mountain , and the scars of other , but smaller , slides . Before sunset , we had reached our camp of the preceding night . We damsels were allowed to render some aid in stewing the delicious cranberries , of a more sweet and spirited flavor than their lowland cousins , which made a sumptuous sauce for our toejours perdrix . Our supply of spoons being limited , we * had little wooden ones , clean and pure as our birch-bark platters . It was observed that the " tin cup aristocracy " ( which was the obnoxious epithet given to the possessors of those conveniences , all aristocracy , however , being , as Theo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminished in number ; even the precious cup on which Fanny 's initials had been engraved with a jack-knife , disappearing at last in Avalanche Brook . Many , indeed , were the jokes made around that evening 's fire ( though they were never a rare commodity with us ) ; the glorious weather , the day 's enjoyment , the success , the absence of discomfort or accident-all raised our glee to the highest point , and it found vent in words and acts of harmless merriment , which the cold world shall never , never know from me . But poor H. never had such hard work to send us to bed , as that night , though we had a teat over our heads , and no more smoke in our faces than was good for us . At last , however , we all had our eyes shut , and we five slept like the " seven . " Off we plunged , down the brookside , next morning , after the gentlemen had fired at a mark a little , while loiterers were getting ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same merry chase of pure water-drops . As Cceur de Lion , in the Talisman , would have given the best year of his life for that one half hour beside the desert spring , so do I now look back upon that foaming water . I remember foreseeing this , as I sat once that morning , all alone , waiting for the others to overtake me-sitting between great masses of rock , rounded smoothly by the crystal stream which poured from one aquamarine basin into another , and looking through a gap of trees upon fair Katahdin Lake , and a soft blue hillbeyond it . And yet , I thought , people travel to Scotland and to Switzerland who have never been here , and who have no more personal experience of a hemlock bed than of the bed of the Atlantic . We crossed Roaring Brook once more , and dined that day by a nameless woodland pond ; and at night , our beloved " Lake-camp " received us again after our ten-mile walk , and we called it home . We loved it all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be our last night in the woods ; and so it proved . As Stacy predicted , we easily accomplished , next day , the thirteen forest miles that had been two days ' work before , and did it , warm as the day was , in a style that delighted him . " In fact , " he added , " I 've been in the woods with a good many young gentle-. men , who would have given out before they got to Hunt 's to-day , warm as the weather was , too . " Even the taciturn MeClane expressed his decided satisfaction ; and as for Ben , he said : " I 've got a little memorandum book ; I do n't often put anything down in it ; but I shall put this day down , sure . " So we crossed the Wissaticook again , this time without accident , and so we once more divided with our feet the great golden-rods and asters , strolling leisurely , staff in hand , through the sunny wood-path , that September afternoon ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the open clearing , opposite Hunt 's ; and there lay the solid farm-house upon the bank , and there were the whole family out to see ; and there was the batteau beached upon the sand , and McClane waiting to paddle us over . In we sprang , the batteau was pushed from the shore , it traversed the swift black current , we were landed opposite , and our life in the woods was over . I shall make short work of the remainder ; how delighted good Mrs. Hunt was that we had done the jaunt more quickly than women had done it before ; how strange it seemed to us to sit on chairs again , and use cups and saucers ; how delicious were the breadcakes , and the potatoes , and the milk ; how gay we all were , till we had to dance at least ; how our only minstrel was a wild Irishman , who played and sang " The girl I left behind me , " // thrumming with his fingers a clattering accompaniment on a dust-pan ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired each other down with the wildest of Virginia reels before the great kitchen-hearth . This I never can describe , though it was certainly the wildest scene I ever witnessed , and seemed more like a highland bothie than anything in New England . Happily , in this case , the excitement was all teetotal , and came pure from the happiest of happy hcarts . That night we slept as well as we could be expected to do , in real beds , and the next day we all went down the Penobscot in two batteaux , and were almost happier than on any previous day , paddled steadily along the smooth swift canal between drooping trees , seeing no human being except a silent man in a birch canoe , and two girls paddling across to their father 's clearing . Sometimes , however , coming to rapids where we passengers had to get out , while two in each batteau guided it magically among greatrocks and through narrow passages where it seemed no floating thing could pass without shipwreck . Having only three regular voyageurs , H. went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing he ever did , and like standing on the back of the most spirited horse , and he said , also , that it was perfectly superb to see the consummate skill with which MeClane , in the bow of the boat , would guide it among white , whirling torrents , and round sharp angles of threatening rock , where it seemed madness to venture . We got , with difficulty , some dinner at a queer little settlement called Nickatow , and the last part of the way was almost dangerous . It grew late , and there were bad shoals and rapids , or " rips " to pass , and both our comrades and our guides were weary ; so we rowed races for a stimulus , and composed saucy verses , and hurled them at each other , and at last , when it was quite dark , we glided out upon the deeper waters of the main Penobscot , and soon after were landed beneath overhanging alders , and walked up through a hushed and star-lit lane , mysteriously , into the little village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There we took leave , not without very genuine signs of true regard on both sides , of our friendly and inardy guides . There some of our own party , also , must leave us , and hasten on at midnight . We had one last gay evening in our woodland-dress ; and there the history of those bright days must close . After the story comes the moral . We proved the truth of the prediction we overheard , that it would give us " better fun than a tripto Saratogue , " and our moral is , that there is more real peril to bodily health in a week of ball-room than in a month of bivouacs . Our health and strength improved from beginning to end , nor did any ill consequence follow .
