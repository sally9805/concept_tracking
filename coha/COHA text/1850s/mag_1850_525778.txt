The power to trade in commodities must , therefore , diminish with diminution in the power freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , are the inevitable consequences of increase in wealth and population . With a population steadily increasing , accompanied by a constantly diminishing produetiveness of labor , and a constantly increasing power on the part of the landlord to demand rent , the laborer must daily become more and more a slave to the landowner , and a slave to his necessities , with a daily approach to the state of things anticipated by Mr. Mill , when " wages will be reduced so low that a portion of the population will regularly die from the consequences of want.7** The " natural inclinations of man " lead him to association , and especially to the formation of that intimate association which leads to increase of population ; and the object of the Wealth of Nations is that of proving that the more perfectly he is permitted to act in accordance with those " inclinations " the greater will be the power to produce and the power to trade . The object of the modern school is that of showing that indulgence of his " natural inclinations " leads to diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wretchedness , and death . By one of the recent writers of this schoolt marriage is held to be " a luxury " in which the poor have no right to indulge . By another we are told that it is " an enjoyment , " and that the poor " have no right to marry till they have made provision for the maintenance of the expected family . " * Restraints on that species of commerce which follows from that earliest of God 's commands , be fruitful and multiply ,  - -  that command , to obey which man is most * Mill 's Political Economy , p. 16. t Thornton on Over-Population. * Edinburgh Review , October , 1849. prompted by his " natural inclinations , " - that command , obedience to which tends most to bring into activity the best feelings of his nature ,  --  lie at the base of modern English Political Economy , which professes to follow in the footsteps of Adam Smith , and to belong to his free-trade school . To what extent the views of late writers on this subject are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of man in the indulgence of those " natural inclinations " implanted in him by the Deity , and for the wisest and best of purposes , may be seen by the following passage " Every one has a right to live . We will suppose this granted , " says Mr. Mill , ( Pol . Econ. i. 428 . ) " But no one has a right to bring creatures into life to be supported by other people . Whoever means to stand upon the first of these rights must renounce all the pretensions to the last . If a man can not support even himself unless others help him , those others are entitled to say that they do not also undertake the support of all the offspring which it is physically possible for him to summon into the world . Yet there are abundance of writers and public speakers , including many of most ostentatious pretensions to high feelings , whose views of life are so truly brutish , that they see hardship in preventing paupers from breeding hereditary paupers in the very workhouse itself ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of people it could be among whom such preachers could find proselytes . " It is conceivable that the State might guarantee employment at ample wages to all who are born . But if it does this , it is bound , in self-protection , and for the sake of every purpose for which government exists , to provide that no person shall be born without its consent . If the ordinary and natural motives to self-restraint are removed , others must be substituted . Restrictions on marriage , at least equivalent to those existing in some of the German states , or severe penalties on those who have children when unable to support them , would then be indispensable . Society may feed the necessitous , if it takes their multiplication under its control ; or it may leave the last to their discretion , if it abandons the first to their own care . But it can not take half of the one course and half of the other . Let it choose that which circumstances // or the public sentiment render most expedient . But it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the multiplying free . " It is thus denied that provision should be made for the support of the poor , because the belief that his family will be supported tends to lead the poor laborer to seek companionship in his misfortune by obtaining a wife , and such conduct is held to be " a sin , " the correction of which is to be found in permitting parent and child to pay " the penalty " by allowing them to starve . That the reader may fully understand how far the system tends towards the enfranchisement of man , and the growth of power to follow the bent of his natural and laudable inclination towards association , the following passage from the latest writer on the subject is submitted for his perusal , and he is requested particularly to note , first , that the italics are the author 's own ; and , second , that while he disclaims any intention of advising that the poor should be permitted to starve to death , he does not disclaim his belief that true policy would teach that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " positive death " " The second class is by far the most numerous ; and it is in dealing with this class that the radical error of our social philosophy is most apparent and most injurious . The idle , the dissolute , the dawdling ; - the Irish peasant , who will beg for a penny rather than work for a shilling ;  --  the Irish fisherman , who burns his boats for firewood , and pawns his nets , instead of using them to fish with ;  --  the agricultural laborer , who waits listlessly in his hovel till work finds him out , instead of diligently setting out to seek it , in every direction , for himself ,  --  and who remains a burden on his parish , when manufacturing enterprise in the next town is hampered and delayed for want of hands ;  --  the Sheffield grinder , who being able to earn a guinea a day , will only work two days in the week , and drinks the other five ;  --  the spinners and weavers in manufacturing towns , who waste hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which always end in the impoverishment of both themselves and their employers , and in leaving numbers of them permanently unprovided ;  --  the unionists , who , like the weavers of Norwich , the ship-builders and sawyers of Dublin , and the lace-makers of Nottingham , have , by violence and unreasonable demands , driven away trade from their respective localities ; - and , finally , the thousands who , in spite of exhortation , in spite of the bitter warnings of experience , persist in spending every week the last farthing of their earnings , as if prosperity , and youth , and health could always last : - all these are the laborious architects of their own ill-fortune ,  --  - all these are destitute by their own act , their own folly , their own guilt . Those parents , again , who marry with no means of bringing up a family , with no provision for the future , no sure and ample support even for the present ; - those who ( like a hand-loom weaver whom we knew ) bring up eleven children to an overstocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords only insufficient earnings and unsteady employment ; and those who spend in wastefulness and drinking wages which , carefully husbanded , might secure a future maintenance for their offspring ; - these all bring into the world paupers , who are destitute by their parents ' culpability ,  - -  and the sins of the father are visited upon the children . " Now , with regard to these classes , whatever aid the sentiments of Christian charity may prompt us , as individuals , and in each individual case , to administer , or however it may be occasionally necessary for the State to interpose for the actual salvation of life , it is important to pronounce distinctly that , on no principle of social right or justice , have they any claim to share the earnings or the savings of their more prudent , more energetic , more self-denying fellowcitizens . They have made for themselves the hard bed they lie on . They have sinned against the plainest laws of nature , and must be left to the corrective which nature has in that case made and provided ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , if only we do not step in to counteract it by regulations dictated by plausible and pardonable , but shallow and short-sighted humanity . But let us not lose sight of the indubitable truth , that if we stand between the error and its conseq*ten*e , we stand between the evil and its cure ,  --  if we intercept the penalty ( where it does not amount to positive death ) we perpetuate the sin . " Such are the doctrines of the " free-trade " school of England , and they follow naturally from those of Mr. Ricardo , and of Mr. // M'Culloch , the latter of whom teaches in opposition to Dr. Smith , that so far is labor applied to agriculture from beino ' the most S productive , we should err little in saying that it was that in which nature least aided his efforts , because land was becoming daily more and more sterile , while steam engines and ships could now be built at least equal in capacity with any that had preceded them. * Were the author of " The Wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with a school which taught that freedom of commerce was to be found in making of the indulgence of man 's most " natural inclination " a crime , " the penalty " for which was to be any species of bodily and mental torture and exhaustion , short of " positive death . " He could hold no fellowship with such men . Every act of association has , as we have already said , commerce for its object . The husband gives his care , his labors and their products , for the maintenance of his wife and for the improvement of her condition , and the wife does the same by him . The father aids the child in his youth , and the child does the same by him in his age . The people of the village associate for the making of roads and the maintenance of churches and schools , and the blacksmith , the carpenter , the mason , and the laborer associate for the building of the houses , the schools , the churches , and the market-houses ; and the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of association , the more productive the labor , and the greater the power to maintain commerce . Mr. M'Culloch teaches the reverse of all this . He holds that to render labor productive , men must abstain from the commerce of the sexes , and that the more widely they separate from each other , the more advantageously will labor be employed , and the larger will be the power to trade . The ship and the wagon are in his estimation as productive as the plough and the harrow , because with him dispersion is the road to wealth ; whereas Dr. Smith looked to concentration as the means of dispensing with both ship and wagon , and thus rendering more productive the labors of those who followed the plough and drove the harrow . Which of the two systems it is that tends most to facilitate the power to exchange labor for labor the reader may now decide . Should he on full consideration arrive at the conclusion that men who are far distant from each other can combine their exertions more readily than men who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enroll himself as a member of the modern " free-trade " school* Should he , on the contrary , believe that men who are near each other combine their exertions more readily than those who are distant , he will find himself fitted to enroll himself among the disciples of Adam Smith , who taughtfreedorn of co mnrnerce among men . We may now look to see how the modern British system tends to affect the trade in the second great instrument of production , land . The great machine of production is the land , and if the whole be monopolized by a single individual , or by a government , it is obvious that in this there can be no trade whatever . If owned by a few individuals there can be little trade . If divided among a large number of people , there will be frequent exchanges , and consequently much trade . The system of Adam Smith looked to the division of land , and consequently to the increase of trade in land . That of Mr. M'Culloch is opposed to its division , and consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of it . With every increase of population , labor is , according to his theory , less advantageously applied , and the landholder obtains as rent a large proportion of the product7 enabling him , of course , not only to retain his old possessions , but to add to them by enclosing , or by purchasing , new ones . The laborer obtains a smaller proportion of the diminished quantity , and becomes , therefore from day to day less able to obtain food1 and consequently less and less able to purchase land , or to retain the little patch that he may have enclosed and cultivated . The tendency of the system is therefore to diminution in the amount of commerce in laud . Such being the theory , we find Mr. M'Culloch , as might naturally be expected1 an advocate of the system which tends to tie up land by means of laws of primogeniture , entails , and settlements , in regard to which he says " It has long been customary in this , as well as in many other countries , when estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the eldest son , and to give to the younger sons and daughters smaller portions in money . Many objections have been made to this custom , but mostly , as it appears to me , without due consider*tion. // That it has its inconveniences there is no doubt , but they seem to be trifling compared with the advantages which it exclusi*e1y possesses It forces the younger sons to quit the home of their father , and makes them depend for success in life vn the fair exercise of their talents ; it helps to prevent the splitting of landed property Into too Small portions and stimulates the holders of estates to endeavor to save a monied fortune adequate for the outfit of the younger children , without rendering them a burden on their senior . Its influence in these and other respects is equally powerful and salutary . The sense of inferiority as compared with others is , next to the pressure of want , one of the most powerful incentives to exertion . It is not always because a man is poor that he is perseveringly industrious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already wealthy , and is merely wishing to place himself in the same rank as others who have still larger fortunes . The younger sons of our great landed proprietors are particularly sensible to this stimu1us . Their relative inferiority in point of wealth , and their desire to escape from this lower situation , and to attain to the same level as their elder brothers , inspires them with an energy and vigor they would not otherwise feel . But the advantage of preserving large estates from being frittered down by a scheme of equal division , is not limited to its effects on the younger children of their owners . It raises universally the standard of competence , and gives new force to the springs which set industry in motion . The manner of living in great landlords is that in which every one is ambitious of being able to indulge ; and their habits of expense , though somewhat injurious to themselves , act as powerful incentives to the ingenuity and enterprise of other classes , who never think their fortunes sufficiently ample , unless they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so that the custom of primogeniture seems to render all classes more industrious , and to augment at the same time the mass of wealth and the scale of enjoyment . ' ( Principles , p 259 . ) It seems scarcely to have occurred to Mr. M'Culloch that if the accumulation of land in the hands of a few persons tended to produce , in so great a degree , all these advantageous effects , the accumulation of the whole in the hands of one person would tend to produce them in a much gTeater degree ; and that , therefore , the perfection of his system of ownership of landed property would be found in India , where the governInent is sole proprietor . Leaving , however , for the present , the consideration of this subject , we may now look to see how far the system tends to extend or to diminish the power to exchange the products of land for labor expended on the land itself , in regard to which we are told that " the father can not do many things advantageous to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the son , and the son can not make a settlement on his marriage without the consent of the father , " and that " cases do sometimes occur of father and son driving hard bargains with each other. *** It is obvious from this that the system tends to shut out from land the employment of much labor that might beneficially be ap* plied to its improvement , and that would be so a p plied , were that system non-exist* ent . Throughout Scotland an entailed estate can be distinguished , we are told , by the fact of its greatly inferior cultivation.f The system tends , therefore , to diminish the power of voluntary combination between the laborer and the landowner , and to diminish the amount of trade in both labor and land . To carry it out , there exists a necessity for incumbering estates with settlements in favor of wives , widows , younger sons , and daughters , and the reader needs not to be told that such incumbrances operate always as a bar to the division , and most generally to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " There is a point of great and immediate importance on which we must say a few words . We have seen that in settlements successive tenants for life have powers given them to jointure wives , and to provide for younger children , the latter being effected by means of charges upon the inheritance* The result , broadly stated , is , that the pres* ent possessor has to bear the burdens im* posed by his predecessors ; and this goes on from generation to generation . The fee* simple is , consequently , never entirely free from debt ; and there is a sort of running partition of it between its possessors and those in whose favor family provisions are made . We are far from objecting to this , if the proper relative proportion be mamn* tamed . The great aim ought to be not to permit the inheritance to be too much incumbered ; and on the whole this object h s , in England , been steadily kept in view We must say with regret , however , that we have detected a*tendeney recently to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which the inheritance is laden with larger family provisions than it can properly bear . The result is already manifest in much uneasiness and embarrass* Quarteily Review , July , 1848 . Art . Entails of Lands . // Inent . It is tinle to convey a Warning to landowners . This practice may not be a general one as yet , but its extension can not be too energetically protested against . We venture to think that it had its origin from the following circumstance : - that - -  - whereas the jointures for widows , of course , expire with their lives  --  the provisions for younger children are made substantial charges on the inheritance , and are not regarded in the same light as are other incumbranees . Proprietors do not , consequently , sufficiently exert themselves to free their estates from them ; and not only are they permitted to remain undischarged , but are frequently made the subject of separate settlements . Now such of our readers as attend to these matters at all are aware that an Act was passed in 1 840 , empowering the owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid them in the drainage of land . The land to be benefited is charged under the Act with payment to the Crown , for twenty-two years , of a rent-charge of 01. lOs . a year for 1001. advanced . The ealeulation was , that at the end of the term the advances would be fully repaid , principal and interest . This Act has been extensively acted upon , and we must ask whether some , if not all , of the burdens which are usually imposed on the inheritance in English settlements , might not , with advantage , be thrown into the shape of similar tenantable rent-charges ? Mr. M'Culloch suggests this with reference to Scotland  --  but why not apply it also to England ? Our machinery of trustees is complete-ready to our hand : they might receive the rent-charges as they arose , and invest them in proper security , and they might be armed with the usual powers for compelling payment . The advantages of such a plan appear obvious . The present possessors would be made to feel more sensibly the necessity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to liquidate either the whole or a portion of the principal as well as the interest , in place of throwing the weight of such incumbranees on posterityand the inheritance would from time to time be freed from preceding burdens while it assumed others . " We have here , in addition to all the old modes of fettering land , a system of trusts for its improvement , the necessary consequence of which must be still greater diffi culty in every operal ; ion connected with commerce in the great instrument of pro- ' duction , land . In the days of Adam Smith about one fifth of the surface of Scotland was supposeci to be entailed , and he saw the disadvantages of the system to be so great that he de- ' nounced the system as king " founded upon the most absurd of all suppositions , the supposition that every successive generation of men have not an equal right to the earth and all that it possesses ; but that the prop- ' erty of the present generation should be retained and regulated according to the fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . " Instead of changing the system , and doing that which might tend to the establishment of greater freedom of ' trade in land , the movement has been in a contrary direction , and to such an extent that one half of Scotland is now supposed to be entailed ; and yet this is the system advocated by Mr. M'Culloch , the follower in the steps of Adam Smith , as being the one calculated " to render all classes more indus- ' trious , and to augment at the same time the mass of wealth and the scale of enjoyment . ' 1 If it could do this , it would be by facilP tating combination of action between the laborer and the landowner f@r the improve- ' ment of the land . how far it does so may ' be judged from the following passage from another of the disciples of the schools of Messrs . 1*icardo and Malthus , Mr. J. Stuart Mill : - " In Great Britain , the landed proprietor is not unfrequently an improver . But it can not be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases he grants the liberty of cultivation on such terms , as to prevent improvements from being made by any one else . In the southern parts of the island , as there are usually no leases , permanent improvements can scarcely be made except by the landlord 's capital ; accordingly the South , compared with the North of England , and with the Lowlands of Scotland , is extremely backward in agricultural improvement . The truth is , that any very general improvement of land by the landlords , is hardly compatible with a law or custom of primogeniture . When the land goes wholly to the heir , it generally goes to him severed from the pecuniaiy resources which would enable him to improve it , the personal property being absorbed by the provisi9n for younger children , and the land itself oft en heavily burthened for the same purpose . There is therefore but a small proportion of landlords who have the means of making expensive improvements , unless they do it with borrowed money , and by adding to the mortgages with which in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But the position of the owner of a deeply mortgaged estate is so precarious ; economy is so unwelcome to one whose apparent fortune greatly exceeds his real means , and the vicissitudes of rent and price which only trench upon the margin of his income , are so formidable to one who can call little more than that margin his own ; that it is no wonder if few landlords find themselves in a condition to make immediate sacrifices for the sake of future profit . Were they ever so much inclined , those alone can prudently do it , who have seriously studied the principles of scientific agriculture ; and great landlords have seldom seriously studied anything . They might at least hold out inducements to the farmers to do what they will not or can not do themselves ; but even in granting leases , it is in England a general complaint that they tie up their tenants by covenants grounded on the practices of an obsolete and exploded agriculture ; while most of them , by withholding leases altogether , and giving the farmer no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land on a footing little more favorable to improvement than in the time of our barbarous ancestors , - immetata quibus jugera liberas Fruges et Cererem rerani , Nec cultura placet longior aunna . " Landed property in England is thus very far from completely fulfilling the conditions which render its existence economically justifiahle . But if insufficiently realized even in England , in Ireland those conditions are not complied with at all . With individual exceptions , ( some of them very honorable ones , ) the owners of Irish estates do nothing for the land but drain it of its produce . What has been epigrammatically said in the discussions on peculiar burthens , ' is literally true when applied to them ; that the greatest burthen on land ' is the landlords . Returning nothing to the soil , they consume its whole produce , minus the potatoes strictly necessary to keep the inhabitants from dying of famine ; arid when they have any notion of improvement , it consists in not leaving even this pittance , but turnin0 out the people , to beg* , ary if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this footing , it ceases to be defensible , and the time has come fur making some new arrangement of the matter . " So great does Mr. Mill believe to be the disadvantages of the system , that he holds that the people have a right to discard the landowners ; the claim of the latter to the land being altogether " subordinate to the general policy of the State . " Widely different is all this from the teachings of Adam Smith , who saw that improvement in the condition of man , and perfect respect for all the rights of property , went hand in hand with each other . Security of property is essential to the growth of commerce , and yet the modern system of " free trade " is based upon the doctrines of Mr. Ricardo , which constitute the best defence of the modern French ideas on the subject of the right to property . The best text book in the world for Red-republicanism , and for communism1 is that gentleman 's " Principles of Political Economy . " Being favorable to a continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether prevents , commerce in land , by means of purchase and sale , Mr. M'Culloch , as might naturally be expected , favors *lso that mode of tenancy which tends most to prevent combination of action between the landowner and his smaller neighbor , who would desire to cultivate his land , paying rent for its use . He , therefore , informs us that " the opinions of the great majority of those who , from their acquaintance with agriculture , are best enabled to decide on such matters , are exceedingly hostile to the small farming system . " He thinks that the occupants of small farms can not " accumulate capital , " and therefore that it is not " superfluous to enforce the propriety of letting land in preference to large farmers , even although small tenants are willing to pay higher rents than could be obtained from the larger one . " The more middle-men the better . He prefers the ship and the wagon to the plough and the loom  --  the merchant and the sailor to the farmer and the planter  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes in distant villages , to the small occupants of a dozen acres each , who deal directly with the great landowner , eveii although they obtain from the land so much more that they can afford to pay a higher rent . His views and those of the school he represents , in regard to the exchanges of labor and land , the great instruinents of all production , are diametrically opposed to those of the author of the Wealth of Nations , and therefore it is that they find the ideas upon which his system rests to be " fundamentally erroneous . " Dr. Smith looked to the division of land , the diversification of employment , and the combination of action among men . His successors look to the centralization of land , the territorial divisioii of labor , and the dispersion of men The former is based on the plough and the loom , working in connection with each other . The latter , on the ship and the wagon passing between the plough arid the loom . The steam-engine that grinds the grain is deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because , while the // soil is becoming daily more sterile , each successive engine may be equal to the last ; and , for the same reason , the wagon which carries the grain to market , and the ship which transports the cotton , are deemed to be entitled to a preference over the earth which produces both . If , however , the supply of grain be not maintained , we do not need more engines , and if that of cotton be diminished , we need fewer ships . To maintain the power of the land for the production of either , it is necessary to return to the land the refuse of its products ; and if the policy of England tends to prevent such return , the necessary consequence must be that the farmers and planters of the world must produce less grain and less cotton , and that thus the effort to make the cultivation of the land " merely subsidiary to foreign commerce " by augmenting the number of steam-engines and ships , must be that of diminishing the power of foreign countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great domestic trade which is thus abandoned . A steam-engine produces nothing . It diminishes the labor required for converting wool into cloth , or grain into flour ; for freeing mines from water ; or for transporting wool , or grain , or coal . The gain from its use is the wages of that labor , minUS the loss by deterioration of the machine . Labor applied to fashioning the earth produces wages , plus the gain by improvement of the machine . The more an engine can be made to yield the worse it will become . The more the earth can be made to yield the better will it become . The man who neglects his farm to employ himself and his engine in the work of fashioning or exchanging the products of other farms , obtains wages , minus loss of capital . He who employs himself on his own farm obtains wages , plus profits resulting from the improvement of the farm , to the extent that that improvement exceeds the loss from the deterioration of the spades , ploughs , engines , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this view , we submit two cases to the consideration of the reader . A and B have each a horse and tart , and a farm from which they can have hree hundred bushels of wheat , or its equivalent . An offer is made to give them each hat quantity , but the distance is so great hat the hauling will occupy precisely the same time as the raising would do . A accepts , and B does not . A spends his time , and that of his horse and cart , on the road . B stays at home . When it rains , A stops in the road-side tavern . B spends the same day at home , repairing his house . When A 's horse feeds and rests , his master has nothing to do . B grubs up an old root , or repairs a fence . A 's horse deposits his manure in the road . That of B goes on his farm . A 's horse hauls every day , and the service performed , nothing remains . B opens a marl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three years . At the end of the year A 's horse and cart are worn out , while B 's are almost as good as new . The farm of A has deteriorated , while that of B has greatly improved . Both have done the same number of days ' work , and both have received the same compensation , yet A is poorer and B richer than at first . Every diminution in the quantity required of the machinery of exchange tends to increase the quantity of labor , both of body and mind , that may be applied directly to production , and labor so applied is rewarded not on1y with an increased return , but with an increase in the powers of the machine itself . Such has been the case in all time past , and such must it ever continue to be . It is by this almost insensible contribution of labor that land acquires value . The first object of the poor cultivator of the thin soils is to obtain food and clothing for himself and his family . His leisure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cuts a little drain , and at another he roots out a stump . At one moment he cuts fuel for his family , and thus clears his land ; and at and other digs a well to facilitate the watering of his cattle , and thus keep his manure in the stable yard . He knows that the machine will feed him better the more perfectly he fashions it , and that there is always place for his time and his labor to be expended with advantage to himself . A piece of land that yields ? 100 per annum will sell for ? 3,000 . A steam-engine that will produce the same , will scarcely command ? 1,000 . Why should this difference exist ? It is because the buyer of the first knows that it will pay him wages and interest , plus the increase of its value by use . The buyer of the other knows that it will give him wages and interest , minus the diminution in its value b*r use . The one // 464 What Constitutes Real Preeclom of Trade 9 takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the other ten , minus the difference . The one buys a machine that improves by use . The other , one that deteriorates with use . The one is buying a machine produced by the labor of past times , and to the creation of which has been applied all the spare time of a series of generations ; and he gWes for it one third or one half of the labor that would be now required to produce it ili its present state , were it reduced to its original one . That of the other is bought at the actual price of the labor that it has cost . The one is a machine upon which new capital and labor may be expended with constantly increasing return ; while upon the other no such expenditure can be made . We have now before us an account of recent operations at Knowsley , where an expenditure of V/ lOs . per acre for draining , was rewarded by an increase of 20s. in rent , or more than thirteen per cent . In another case , where land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of 40s. per acre was attended with a gain of lOs . per acre to the owner , and 1 Os. to the tenant , making fifty per cent . per annum : without taking into consideration the gain to the laborer in the increased facility of procuring the necessaries of life . Lord Stanley , who furnished this statement , said , and we are sure most truly , that although he and his father had for several years laid a million of tiles per annum , they felt that as yet they had only made a beginning. * We believe that they have , even yet , scarcely begun to think upon the subject . They are only beginning to wake up . We have also before us an account of a field so completely worn out that it produced , with manure , but five hundred weight of turnips , but which , by being treated with sulphuric acid and bones , was made to yield two hundred and eightyfive hundred weight ; and another , which gave to coal ashes and coal dust but eightyeight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty-one hundred weight . Such profits are not to be found in any other pursuit ; and yet England has been wasting her energies on ships , colonies , and commerce , having at her feet an inexhaustible magazine asking only to be worked . The improvement above described is re . ' markable , only because concentrated within a short space of time . Had the land described by Lord Stanley been cultivated by the owner , and had he felt that agriculture waS a science worthy of his attention , the drain . ' age would have taken place gradually , and the improvement would have been marked by a gradual growth in the power to pay better wages and more rent . We have be fore us a notice of land rented for nine hundred pounds , at the close of a long lease at one hundred and thirty pounds . During all this time , its owner has had interest on his capital , and at the close of the lease , his capital has increased seven times . His investment was better than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because his engineer paid him for the privilege of building up his machine , whereas the steam . ' engineer would have required to be paid while wearing the machine out . Every . ' body is content with small interest , and sometimes with no interest , from land , where population and wealth are rapidly growing , because there capital is steadily augmenting without effort . Such is the experience of all men who own landed property where population and wealth are permitted to in. ' crease : for they will always increase if not prevented by interferences like those which have existed in England , and to a still greater extent in France . The great pursuit of man is agriculture . There is none " in which so many of the laws of nature must be consult . ' ed and understood as in the cultivation of the earth . Every change of . the season , every change even of the wind , every fall of rain , must affect some of the manifold operations of the farmer . In the im. ' provement of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles of physiology must be consulted . Is it to be supposed that men thus called upon to study , or to observe the laws of nature , and labor in conjunction with its powers , require less of the light of the highest science than the merchant or the manufacturer l " It is not . It is the science that recpiires the greatest knowledge , and the one that pays best for it ; and yet England has driven man , and wealth , and mind , into the less profitable pursuits of fashioning and exchanging the products of other lands ; and has expended thousands of millions on fleets and armies to enable her to drive with * Thirty years since , all the tiles laid in the United Kingdom amounted tobut seventy-one millionsper annum. // 465 foreign nations the poor trade , when her own soil offered her the richer one that tends to produce that increase of wealth and con*entration of population which have in all times and in all ages given the self-protective power that requires neither fleets , nor armies , nor tax-gatherers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven the people of the United States to extend themselves over vast tracts of inferior land when they might more advantageously have concentrated themselves on rich ones ; and she has thus delayed the progress of civilization abroad and at home . She has made it necessary for the people of grain-growing countries to rejoice in the deficiencies of her harvests , as affording them the outlet for surplus food that they could not consume , and that was sometimes abandoned on the field , as not worth the cost of harvesting ; instead of being enabled to rejoice in the knowledge that others were likely to be fed as abundantly as themselves : and such is the necessary result of the policy advocated by the modern free-trade school of England , which teaches the dispersion of man in opposition to the concentration of man , advocated by the founder of the real free-trade school , whose system has been long repudiated by those who profess to hold him in reverence as the founder of the school in which they have constituted themselves professors . They have yet to learn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity for ships and wagons tends to diminish the freedom of man , the freedom of trade , and the power to maintain trade . Their views are precisely those described by him in the following paragraph : " The inland or home trade , the most important of all , the trade in which an equal capital affords the greatest profit and creates the greatest employment to the people of the country , was considered as subsidiary only to foreign trade . It neither brought money into the country , it was said , nor carried any out of it . The country , therefore , could never become richer or poorer by means of it , except so far as its prosperity or decay might indirectly influence the state of foreign trade . " * * How perfectly the views of some of the American disciples of the modern English school correspond with those denounced by Dr. Smith , may be seen from the following passage which , we take from the Patent Office Report , for 1848 . The commerce of the family is nothing , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then existing system as tending " to produce an improper and dangerous distribution of population at home , with diminution in the wages of British labor and the profits of British capital , and as tending at the same time to prevent the proper , necessary , and natural distribution of employments abroad , and therefore as a " manifest violation of the most sacred rights of mankind . " He saw that the ship , the wagon , the spindie and the loom  --  the machinery of exchange and of conversion-were useful to the extent that they enabled man to employ more labor in the work of production , and no further , and that their substitution for machines of production tended to diminish both the power to produce and the power to maintain trade . The steam-engine economizes the labor required for converting the wheat into flour , and if that labor can be applied to producing more wheat , or grass , or wool , or of any other of the commodities useful to man , the substitution is advantageous ; but if , by reason of restraints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so applied , the engine is not only not useful , but positively injurious . If it dispenses with the labor of a hundred men , they are discharged to seek other employment , and if it can not be obtained , they must nevertheless eat food , wear clothes , and have shelter-even if it be the poor-house . Instead of receiving these things in return for labor , they must now receive the neighborhood anything . It is the trivial amount which enters into the general commerce of the world that is to be alone regarded " When we revert to first principles in political economy , we think it must be admitted that the surplus of an11 crop or commodity which is sold by the producer , and eaters into the general commerce of the world , is the only part of it which has , in truth , so far as the accumulation of wealth by the nation is concerned , any value . That portion of his own production which the farmer consumes in his family or on his farm is of no account or value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , in fact , no price . It is the surplus which enters into commerce only that has price ; and that only , strictly speaking , it is of importance to estimate . Therefore , to be precisely correct , the true rule would be to call the amount of wheat consumed by the prod er nothimsq , and estimate onlq the amount which he has to sell . " The most important portion of the domestic trade adds nothing to the accumulation of wealth I The object of Dr. Smith 's work was the denunciation of the idea that " England 's Treasure " was to be found in " Foreign Trade , " and yet we have it here repeated by one of his disciples . // them out of taxes paid for their support , and at the hands of the parish beadle . Their habits of industry and their self-respect are thereby destroyed , while the condition of the remainder of the community is in no way improved , because the quantity of commodities to be consumed is not increased , nor is the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . While productive , under these circumstances , of no single advantage , it is the cause of many and serious evils . The discharge of this hundred men tends to render labor surplus , the consequence of which is a reduction of wages all around , which enables the engine proprietor to make larger profits than before . The general productiveness of labor is lessened  --  the state of morals is deteriorated  --  the proportion of the capitalist is increased , and the laborer obtains a diminished proportion of a diminished product , and with each and every step in this direction there is diminished power to maintain trade , as we shall have occasion to show when we come to examine the actual working of the system advocated by these followers in the steps of Adam Smith , who differ from him in every single idea . Were he now here , he would unite with us in saying that labor-saving machinery is an unmixed good when the labor saved can be applied to increasing the amount of production , because it then tends towards the improvement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when it can not be so applied , it is an unmixed evil , because it tends to promote deterioration and inequality in the condition of both , enabling the one to monopolize land and live in splendor , while driving the other to seek a refuge in the tavern and the poor-house . The great machine is that of productionthe Earth . The small machines are those of conversion and exchange , spindles , looms , engines , and ships . In a natural state of things , the savings of labor effected by the latter are useful , because they increase the quantity that may be given to the former ; but when the former is monopolized to such an extent that labor can not find employment upon it , then the only effect of the latter is to give to individuals another monopoly , by aid of which the monopoly of the earth may be increased and extended . The thousand small machines scattered throughout the country , by aid of which their thousand owners and a thousand laborers were ena bled to obtain moderate wages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by eight or ten steam-engines and a hundred and fifty men , women , and children , occupying the lanes and the cellars of Manchester , and aiding to swell the possessions of men who amass fortunes , purchase land , and perhaps obtain titles . With each step in this direction , land accumulates in fewer hands voluntary combination diminishes , and with it there is a diminution in the power of production , diminished power on the p rt of the laborer to control his own actions , and diminished power to maintain trade . The system is that of centralization , and produces great activity near the heart , with diminution of activity near the extremities ; and this effect gradually extends itself throughout the whole system , as will be seen on an examination of the various parts of the British Empire : the result of which will be to show , that colony after colony has been exhausted , whilst at home the little occupant has been gradually sinking into the daylaborer , and passing from that to the condition of a pauper , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the disposal of his own labor or its products . With each step in his descent he becomes more and more reckless . Hope leaves him* The whip of the tax-gatherer is deemed necessary to animate him to exertion. * His former habits of sobriety , care and economy disappear , to be replaced by those of drunkenness and waste ; and thus it is that , with the diminished productiveness of labor that is necessarily consequent upon the adoption of the modern " free-trade " system , there is a steady deterioration of the moral as well as the physical condition of man . The habit of voluntary association before existing now passes away , and day by day the productive power still further diminishes , with further diminution in the power to maintain trade . We see , thus , that it is in the direction of centralization-in the direction indicated to us by the modern system which leads to the separation of the producer from * " To the desire of risinr in the w orld , implanted in the breast of every individual , an increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower station , of being deprived of conveniences and gratiflcations which habit has rendered all but indispensable ; and the combined influence of the two principles produces results that could not be produced by the unassisted agency of either . " - MUalloch. // the consumer of his products-in that which tends to substitute the territorial for the local division of labor-that we must look for diminution in the freedom of man , and in the power to maintain that commerce with his fellow-man to which Adam Smith referred , and for increased power over their fellow-men on the part of those whose only idea of commerce is expressed in the sentence , " Buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest market . " With diminution in the habit of association , and with increase in the tendency towards dispersion , there is increased difficulty in obtaining education , and deterioration of intellectual condition follows in the train of moral and physical deterioration , with further diminution in the productive power , and increased inequality among the various portions of society . The love of peace passes away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tendency to combination for the commission of acts of violence , increasing with every step of diminution in the power of self-protection , and in the feeling of independence and self-respect . Production still further diminishes , and the difficulty of accumulating capital to be used in aid of further production increases , while the proportion taken by the capitalist steadily increases as its productiveness diminishes , and that claimed by the%government as steadily increases , while the productiveness of taxes diminishes , with increased difficulty in obtaining revenue . Increasing weakness on the part of the laborer is followed by weakness *n that of the owners of capital , whether 2mployed in land or in trade , and that in urn is followed by weakness on the part of be nation , until at length the whole is inolved in one common ruin , the natural esult of the adoption of the system of the odern politico-economical school of Eng*nd which teaches freedom of trade and ; ads to the total destruction of the power c maintain trade . Such is now the tenden cy , daily increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of things that is opposed to " the natural inclination of man . " It is the creation of those purely " human institutions* ' denounced by Smith as the causes of the existence of the great cities of the earth , built up out of the spoils of the cultivators of the soil , and therefore it is that other nations have been driven to measures of resistance with a view to its annihilation and the establishment of real freedom of trade . The system described by Adam Smith , and which he fondly desired to see established among men , looked to the concentration of man and the extension of commerce among men , resulting from the growth of the power and the habit of voluntary association , whether for the purpose of peopling the earth , increasing its products , or facilitating the application of labor to the increase of those products , their conversion into forms that fit them for the use of man , or their exchange among men . The nearer men could live to their neighbor men , the greater , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the greater the power to maintain commerce with distant men . The system reprobated by Adam Smith , and which his successors fondly desire to see established among men , looks to the dispersion of man , and the diminution of commerce among men and women-land-owners and laborers-producers and consumers - in the vain hope of building up a great trade with distant men while destroying the power to produce commodities in which to trade . The one looked to an increased amount of trade , resulting from an increased power to trade : the other desires to obtain the same result by increasing the necessity for trade . With the one the best form of society was a true pyramid . With the other it is an inverted one .
