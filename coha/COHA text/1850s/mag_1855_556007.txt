txt ART . XI . - Works of FISHER AMES , with a Selection from his Speeches and Correspondence . Edited by his Son , SETH AMES . Boston : Little , Brown , &amp; Co. 1854. 2 vols. 8vo. pp. 406 , 442 . MORE than a generation - nearly fifty years - has passed since the eminent orator , scholar , and patriot , whose name gives the title to these volumes , was gathered to his fathers in the quiet village of Dedham , amid the tears of friends and the unfeigned sorrow of all . Soon after his death , a single volume of essays and speeches was published , with an elegant and discriminating biographical sketch by President Kirkland. // We have always , however , felt the need of something to give us a more familiar knowledge of the man , and also of the undercurrent of feeling which accompanied and stimulated the measures of that great political party to which Mr. Ames was attached . This want is in a good measure supplied by the present publication , and we welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undcrstanding of the errors and the virtues of that day . They are written with entire freedom , without reserve or constraint , and reflect with beautiful distinctness the varying moods of the writer , - his hopes and fears , his humor and his earnestness , his convictions and his motives . We might have read them with increased interest , and have been spared some pains of research , had the editor ( to use his own words ) " connected these letters together by a thread of biographical narrative . " Yet , while we are disposed to regret somewhat the delicate reserve that withheld this labor , we are far more inclined to be grateful for the valuable addition which he has contributed to the permanent literature of the country . The time is approaching , though it may not yet have fully come , for a candid judgment of the public men and political events in the administrations of Washington and his immediate successors . Since that day party issues and party names have frequently changed . Old distinctions have become obsolete , and men this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with those whom a twelvemonth ago they were as ready to condemn as heretics and traitors . Even the charge of " Federalist , " occasionally still flung out by some fierce partisan to atone for a failure of wit and argument , has ceased to be thought very severe or damaging ; and , on the other hand , " Republican , " once a concentrated expression of the progressmve and uncontrollable elements of the body politic , looks quite conservative beside its brother " Democrat " ( a word born of the French Revolution , and which Mr. Jefferson is said not to have used , though his followers have gloried in it somewhat overmuch ) , and seems absolutely to lean back and assume a position of offended dignity in presence of the impudent , intrusive , and , let us hope , short-lived " Fillibuster . " From the compact biography by Dr. Kirkland we learn the 18 // few facts of Mr. Ames 's life to which it is necessary now to refer . He was born in Dedham , April 9 , 1758 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , in moderate circumstances , who died when his son was but six years of age . Through the labor and care of his mother , the boy was enabled to enter Harvard College , at the early age of twelve years . Notwithstanding his youth , he bore well the temptations and trials of college life , distinguished himself by his scholarship , and was graduated with honor in 1774 . " His spotless youth , " says Pr . Kirkland , " brought blessings to the whole remainder of his life . It gave him the entire use of his faculties , and all the fruit of his literary education . Its effects appeared in that fine edge of moral feeling which he always preserved , in his strict and often austere temperance , in his love of occupation , that made activity delight , in his distaste for public diversions , and his preference of simple pleasures . Beginning well , he advanced with unremitted steps in the race of virtue , and arrived at the end of life with peace and honor . " His youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after leaving Cambridge , to engage for a time in teaching , that great and perennial resource of the New England student . While instructing others , however , he was careful thoroughly to discipline himself . With a maturity beyond his years , he began to gather materials for future use . He made himself familiar with the classics and English poetry , besides enriching his mind with general reading . Subsequently , having studied law under William Tudor , Esq. , of Boston , he commenced the practice of it in his native village , in the year 1781 . His mind , like that of almost every distinguished person of his time , was early turned to public affairs . He must have watched the course of the Revolutionary war with the closest interest , although too young to engage in it personally . His earliest public efforts showed the direction of his thoughts . Shays 's rebellion , rising so suddenly , and assuming at once a formidable character from the number of those engaged in it , not only surprised the unthinkiug , but far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes and possible results . It led Mr. Ames , then twenty-eight years of age , to // publish several essays in the Independent Chronicle at Boston , under the signatures of Brutus and Camillus , intended to enconrage the minds of his countrymen , and foreshadowing , in no doubtful language , the necessity of a stronger federal government . " It is time , " he says , " to make the federal head supreme in the United States . " " If we make a wise use of the advantages which , with innumerable mischiefs , the rebellion has afforded , our government may last . This is the tide in our affairs , which , if taken at the flood , will lead to glory . If we neglect it , ruin will be inevitable . It is vain to expect security in the future , merely from the general conviction that government is necessary , and that treason is crime . It is vain to depend upon that virtue which is said to sustain a commonwealth . This is the high-flown nonsense of philosophy , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to prevent commotions by conforming the law to popular humors , so that faction shall have nothing to complain of , and folly nothing to ask for . " " Anarchy and government are both before us , and in our choice . If we fall , we fall by our folly , not our fate : and we shall evince to the astonished world of how small influence to produce national happiness are the fairest gifts of Heaven , - a healthful climate , a fruitful soil , and inestimable laws , - when they are conferred upon a frivolous , perverse , and ungrateful generation . " In what century and year , we almost pause to ask , were these concluding words written ? Does not their eloquent warning apply to our times as forcibly as to his ? to the middle of the nineteenth century , as well as to the later years of the eighteenth ? Yet in every government , especially in a free government , the dangers of each age are in a measure peculiar to itself . The question of that age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government at all ; for the confederation had existed long enough to demonstrate its incompetency . Yet it was with fear often predominating over hope , that the most profound and thoughtful patriots - civilians , scholars , soldiers-concentrated their energies in the forming of a new constitution , which should combine freedom with stability ; which might stretch its authority to every corner of the land , yet invalidate no right of the humblest citizen ; which // might prove sufficient for the complex relations of a people whose rapid growth the prophetic eye foresaw , while it left every State government unharmed in its original authority . For two centuries no body of men had assembled on a more momentous errand , than the Convention which met at Philadelphia , May 14 , 1787 . It required , perhaps , more conrage to adopt the Declaration of Independence , but not so much wisdom , and the emergency was even less hazardous . " The peace of America hung by a thread , " said Mr. Ames , " and factions were already sharpening their weapons to ent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to be broached , and the progress of licentiousness would have soon rendered her citizens unfit for liberty in either of them . " It was now to be determined whether that Declaration was the act of sagacious , energetic , far-sighted statesmen , or of inconsiderate and reckless demagogues and rebels . To sever the bond through which the sapling had drawn life from the parent tree was easy , but whether the offshoot had struck its roots deep enough to hold the trunk safe against the storm was yet to be tested . The men on whom this devolved proved themselves equal to the emergency . The published journals show how carefully , how considerately , with what thoroughness and with what jealousy , every important point was discussed . Unanimity was impossible ; it was a wonder that the agreement was so general . " In all our deliberations , " say they in ever-memorable words , " we kept steadily in our view that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true American , the consolidation of our Union , - in which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national existence . This important consideration , seriously and deeply impressed on our minds , led each State in the Convention to be less rigid on points of inferior magnitude than might have been otherwise expected ; and thus the Constitution which we now present is the result of a spirit of amity , and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation rendered indispensable . " // The Convention finished their labors on the 17th of September , and transmitted the Constitution , as agreed upon , to the United States in Congress assembled . But the work was not yet accomplished . It was still doubtful whether the requisite number of States would ratify the new Constitution . The opposition was able and strenuous in nearly every State ; in some it was sustained by persons of eminent abilities and undeniable patriotism . In Virginia , Patrick Henry brought the vast weight of his popularity , his great Revolutionary services , and his splendid and overwhelming eloquence , to bear against it , through a protracted debate of twenty days . Yates , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . In Massachusetts , Hancock and Samuel Adams , on whose influence much depended , were considered doubtful . Gerry had already refused to sign it . The grounds of hostility were various , and often contradictory . Some were dissatisfied because too much power was concentrated in the general government ; others , because too much was still left to the States and the people . A possible and probable tyranny was the great danger in the eyes of one class ; anarchy and dissolution , in the view of another . In the mean time the friends of the Constitution Were not idle ; for if the present effort failed , when could they hope to succeed ? They lost no opportunity , therefore , of appealing to the sound judgment and patriotism of the people , and of enforcing their views by the calmest and strongest reasoning . The newspapers were crowded with articles , some of them of great ability . Hamilton and Madison , slightly assisted by Jay , mainly with the view of influencing New York , wrote the " Federalist , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as massive ) as enduring , as that great work itself . The little State of Delaware did herself the honor of taking the lead in ratification , on the 7th of December , 1787 . Pennsylvania , NeW Jersey , Georgia , and Connecticut rapidly followed in order . The Convention in Massachusetts met early in 1788 . Mr. Ames spoke on several topics , but none of his speeches were fully reported , and only one , that on biennial elections , has been so preserved as to give a tolerable idea of his ability and general method . In its present imper // fect form , it still exhibits abundant elements of the power for which he was afterwards distinguished , - the same terseness and vigor , the same condensed thought , the same independence , manliness , and originality . The more public life of Mr. Ames covered a very important period . The first Congress met at New York in 1789 . Mr. Ames was chosen a representative of the Suffolk district , over a distinguished competitor , Samuel Adams , and by successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administrations of Washington . One of his earliest letters from New York is specially interesting , as giving an account of the first appearance of the President . It is addressed " To George Richards Minot , ( Confidential , ) " and bears date May 3 , 1789 . " Dear George , - I would very cheerfully comply with the wishes expressed in your last , and pursue my sour commentary upon great folks and public bodies , but haste will not permit . I was present in the pew with the President , and must assure you that , after making all deductions for the delusion of one 's fancy in regard to characters , I still think of him with more veneration than for any other person . Time has made havoc upon his face . That , and many other circumstances not to be reasoned about , conspire to keep up the axve which I brought with me . He addressed the two Houses in the Senate-chamber ; it was a very touching scene , and quite of the solemn kind . his aspect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking ; his voice , deep , a little tremulous , and so low as to call for close attention ; added to the series of objects presented to the mind , and overwhelming it , - produced emotions of the most affecting kind upon the members . I , Pilgarlic , sat entranced . It seemed to me an allegory in which Virtue was personified , and addressing those whom she would make her votaries . Her power over the heart was never greater , and the illustration of her doctrine by her own exnmple was never more perfect . " - Vol . I. p. 34 . A postscript describes Madison : it is the more striking from the contrast . " I made two speeches , the latter in reply to Madison , who is a man of sense , reading , address , and integrity , as t is allowed . Very much Frenchifled in his polities . He speaks low , his person is little and ordinary . He speaks decently , as to manner , and no more . His language is very pure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I add , that I think him a little too much of a book politician , and too timid in his // politics , for prudence and caution are opposites of timidity . He is not a little of a Virginian , and thinks that State the land of promise , but is afraid of their State politics , and of his popularity there , more than I think he should be . His manner is something like John Choate's. * He is our first man . " - pp. 3* , 36 . Washington assumed the Presidency under circumstances in some respects favorable , but in others of great difficulty . Had he not been actuated by a large-minded and far-sighted patriotism , had he not been so strongly intrenched in the affections of his countrymen that neither insidious efforts nor open attacks could dislodge him , the office would have been to him what Jefferson was pleased afterwards to call it , " a splendid misery " ; and not only so , but the first years of the Union would probably enough have been the last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great chief of the Revolution gave to the people that confidence in the government which was necessary for its success . But for this , the experiment , even the Union , might have failed , for lack of patience among the States . As it was , the road along which the government was to move was new and untried . Precedents were to be established ; the construction of powers given by the Constitution to be settled ; a system of revenue to be provided ; debts to be paid ; relations with foreign governments to be arranged . It was most difficult to avoid being drawn into the vortex of European politics . England was hostile , though nominally at peace with us . France , once our friend , was on the eve of its Revolution . Forebodings of war darkened every foreign horizon . Within our own borders brooded anxiety and fear . An honest dissatisfaction with the Constitution was widely felt . A deeper hostility to the government was nursing itself in secret , and gathering strength for future violence . The friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were called Federalists . Those opposed to it , under the secret or open lead of Mr. Jefferson , at first called Anti-Federalists , subsequently took the name of Republicans . Mr. Ames was firmly attached // to the former party , and took a prominent part in the most important discussions during the eight years that he sat as representative . That in which his eloquence was most striking , and in which his political life seemed to culminate , was the memorable debate on the British Treaty , in 1796 . Early in 1794 , Mr. Madison introduced his famous resolutions in harmony with the principles of a report which Mr. Jefferson had recently made to Congress on " the privileges and restrictions on the commerce of the United States in foreign countries . " These resolutions , though ostensibly relating to commerce , had the effect , if they were not so intended , of stirring up , and giving form and coherence to the floating hostility against England . They were discussed at intervals during several months , and elicited strong feeling on both sides . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lost in the Senate only by the casting vote of the Vice-President , to cut off all intercourse with Great Britain . A considerable portion of the nation was strongly attached to France , and any criticism on her policy met with indignant rebukes . When Mr. Ames denounced the resolutions in the House as " having French stamped on their face , " Mr. Parker warmly answered , that " he wished everybody had a stamp on his forehead , to show whether he was for France or Great Britain . " This reply , and the subsequent eulogium upon France , drew applause from the gallery . Many insisted on wearing the French cockade , and urged a declaration of open war with England . Nor were they destitute of arguments to influence the popular mind . The military posts on Lake Erie and in the vicinity were still held by British soldiers , who were suspected of exciting the hostility of the Indians . American commerce was harassed ; American vessels were seized ; American seamen impressed . " My dear Friend , " - wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more pride in the comparison of our merchants and people with those of the South . You praise the former , very justly , for their coolness and steadiness . It is a time when the indulgence of passion is peculiarly pleasant , and no less costly ; for it will perhaps cost our peace , our wealth , and our safety . It is our intemperate passion that aggravates our embarrassments . Some persons think it had no little // influence to produce them . I would not justify the insolence and injustice of the English : they are not to be justified ; but our fury for the French , and against the English , is more natural than salutary . France has stopped more than an hundred sail of our vessels at Bordeaux . We sit still ; we say nothing ; we affect to depend on their justice ; we make excuses . England stops our vessels with a provoking insolence ; we are in a rage . This marked discrimination is not merited by the French . They may rob us ; they may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paine 's head , vote out the Trinity , kill their priests , rob the merchants , and burn their Bibles ; - we stand ready to approve all they do , and to approve more than they can do . This French mania is the bane of our politics , the mortal poison that makes our peace so sickly . It is incurable by any other remedy than time . I wish we may be able to bear the malady till the remedy shall overcome it . The English are absolutely madmen . Order in this country is endangered by their hostility , no less than by the French friendship . They act , on almost every point , against their interests and their real wishes . I hope and believe such extreme absurdity of conduct will be exposed with success . Should a special minister be sent from this country to demand reparation , much will depend on his character and address . Who but Hamilton would perfectly satisfy all our wishes ? This idea , a very crude and unwarranted one to suggest , should be locked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing will happen ; I incline to wish it may . He is ipse agmen . Should it be carried into effect , the English merchants ought to rouse their London friends , and to exert their pen and ink powers , to explain the true situation of things in this country . In a word , I think you ought to help the two gentlemen mentioned in your letter to state the political mischiefs worked here by the facobin system the English pursue ; that they Frenchify us ; they do everything they should not do ; that they ought to raise their policy from the ground , where it now grovels , to the height from whence the statesman can see clearly and very far . I am full of a book on this subject . I wish I could make John Bull read it ; such ideas , fully dilated , repeated , pressed , and diffused , would aid the extra messenger , and would help the cause of peace . " If John Bull is a blockhead , and puts himself on his pride to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will , I think , be war . " - Vol . I. pp. 139 , 140 . In this state of things , Washington , who , in the midst of the excitement , was unwilling to lose any chance of presetving the neutrality which he regarded as so important , and VOL . Lxxx. - NO. 166. 19 // which had been determined on as the settled policy of the government , decided to send a special ambassador to England , in order if possible to arrange the difficulties by treaty . His first choice was Hamilton ; but in consequence of the fierce opposition raised against him , he finally committed the matter to Chief Justice Jay , whose great Revolutionary services and thorough integrity commanded universal confidence . Mr. Jay went to England in April , 1794 . The treaty was signed in November , and immediately transmitted to the United State* . After some delay , and notwithstanding a strong opposition out of Congress as well as within , it was ratified by the Senate , in June , 1793 , and signed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely satisfactory , it was the best that could be obtained . No sooner , however , were its provisions fully known , than it was assailed , not less after the ratification than before , with surprising virulence , by the party presses , and by the opposition in the House . There was no stint to the opprobrium heaped upon it and its author . The citizens of Boston passed resolutions , which they sent to the President . In New York and Philadelphia the treaty was burnt by turbulent crowds . In Charleston , John Rutledge , Chief Justice of the State , and even then , though he knew it not , under appointment as Chief Justice of the United States , denounced it as disgraceful , and spoke of Jay himself as either corrupt or stupid to have signed it . Petitions against it , couched in similar language , were circulated through all the States . These were addressed to the House of Representatives , solemnly protesting against the absorption of the powers of the government by the President and Senate , and praying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures , touching the said treaty , as should most effectually secure from encroachment the constitutional delegated powers of Congress , and the rights of the people , and preserve to the country an uninterrupted continuance of the blessings of peace . " Enmity against England , artfully encouraged by the leaders , still rankled in the bosoms of many , who for that reason , if for no other , warmly protested their love for France , now somewhat peremptorily challenging the sympathy of all the world . On the 1st of March , 1796 , the treaty was sent to the // House by President Washington , as duly ratified . The next day , Mr. Livingston of New York offered a resolution calling on the President for his instructions to Mr. Jay , and the correspondence and documents relating to the treaty . The main ground for this call , as stated by Livingston , was , that the House had a discretionary power to carry the treaty into execution or not . The resolution was supported by Mr. Gallatin , already rising to a general fame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution was thought to attach great weight to his opinion . They contended that the general power of making treaties might be either expressly limited by positive clauses in the Constitution , or checked by powers vested in other branches of the government ; that the power of granting money reposed in Congress would be a check upon the President and Senate ; that a contrary doctrine would virtually vest all power in the Executive and Senate . It was also contended , that treaties were the supreme law of the land only with reference to the legislation of the individual States , not with reference to the laws of the United States ; and still further , that , " if the treaty power alone could perform any one act for which the authority of Congress is required by the Constitution , it may perform any act for which the authority of that part of the government is required . " Hence , the President , with the Senate , according to this construction , might regulate trade , raise troops and borrow money to pay them , declare war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken to Europe , Asia , or Africa . This was one of the arguments of Madison , who , xvhile he professed that he would leave the power of making treaties with the President and Senate , contended that a legislative sanction and co-operation were still required where it was necessary for the House to pass laws to carry a treaty into effect . The other party relied upon the plain meaning of the clause in the Constitution which confined the power of making treaties to the President and Senate ; the difference between treaties and laws was pointed out , and although the ultimate right of the House to defeat an unjust or ruinous treaty was allowed , it was placed on the same ground with the right of revolution or insurrection. // The debate was unusually protracted , lasting three weeks , but the resolution was finally passed . The President , considering the case as an unfounded claim of power , contrary to the express provisions of the Constitution , and important as establishing a precedent , in a message of great dignity , declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these words : " As , therefore , it is perfectly clear to my understanding , that the assent of the House of Representatives is not necessary to the validity of a treaty ; as the treaty with Great Britain exhibits in itself all the objects requiring legislative provision , and on these the papers called for can throw no light ; and as it is essential to the due administration of the government , that the boundaries fixed by the Constitution between the different departments should be preserved , - a just regard to the Constitution and to the duty of my office , under all the circumstances of this case , forbids a compliance with your request . " Soon after this , the House , dissatisfied with the message , passed resolutions reasserting its power in relation to treaties . Such was its temper , with a general and undefined hostility to the government , when a resolution was introduced , that provision ought to be made by law for carrying into effect the treaty with Great Britain . This was at first joined with a resolution respecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was finally considered separately , and on its own merits . The opposition was strong and fierce . Madison led the attack , followed by Nicholas , Giles , Gallatin , and others . On the side of the administration the resolution was sustained with an earnestness and vigor commensurate with the results which were at stake . The friends of the government felt that on the decision of the question depended not only peace or war , not only the danger of drawing the country into active participancy in the wars of Europe , just then commencing with such a menacing portent for the future , but the whole course of the American people , and the very stability of the government itself . Mr. Ames had taken his seat in Congress late in the session , under a strict injunction of silence from his physician and friends . He had been so much indisposed as to take very // little part in the business of the House . His letters during this period , while they abound with the playfulness which he never restrained with his intimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the serious concern with which he regarded the proceedings of Congress . Hamilton had defended the treaty in a series of articles of great ability , signed Camillus , which made a strong impression , and greatly alarmed Mr. Jefferson . Of these papers , Mr. Ames wrote , January 18 , 1796 : " I have read two Camilluses on the constitutionality of the treaty ; so much answer to so little weight of objection is odds . He holds up the tegis against a wooden sword . Jove 's eagle holds his bolts in his talons , and hurls them , not at the Titans , but at sparrows and mice . I despise those objections in which blockheads only are sincere . " The following letter to Jeremiah Smith gives a lively picture of the man and the circumstances in which he was placed . " Mamaroneck , at Mrs. Horton 's , 27 miles east from New York , February 3 , 1796. - Wednesday Morning . " My dear Friend , - Here I am , per varios casus , through thick and thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground ; vi superum , and then there was great wear and tear of horseflesh ; tant*ne anirnis ire , such is my patriotic zeal to be useless in Congress .

I left Springfield Saturday morning , and came on to Hartford , very sick all the way . But I assure you , solemnly , I survived it , and was well the next morning . Lodged at New Haven Sunday night , at Norwalk Monday night . The snow grew thin at New Haven , and was nearly gone in the cartway at Stam* ford .

I intend to pass two days there , and three more will , I trust , set me down in Philadelphia . Do not let me go down to the pit of the Indian Queen . It is Hades , and Tartarus , and Periphlegethon , Cocytus , and Styx , where it would be a pity to bring all the piety and learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names . Pray leave word at the said Queen , or , if need be , at any other Queen 's , where I may unpack my weary household gods . I am the better for the journey , although I have , at least three times , been so ill as to come near fainting . My country 's good alone could draw a man so sick from home , - saving that I am not sick , and shall do my country no good . That , however , is not allowed by counsel , to impair the obligation to pay me six dollars per day . Forbearing to be mischievous is said to be a valid consideration . I shall not prove a troublesome lodger , nor call for little messes ; a sli ' *e of dry bread at noon , wine-whey frequently at bed-time , will be all the addenda to the common attendance .

Within a month from this , he writes to Thomas Dwight - " Philadelphia , February 16 , 1 796 . " Dear Friend , - I see , by the Centinel , your name is on the list of the majority , on the question of amendments . Still I think it prudent to address this to Springfield . " My health is the better for the journey . I doubt whether I could have effected it on wheels , as with all the accommodation of a sleigh , and all the precautions I could use , and although sixteen days on the road , I was several times near a full stop , being so unwell as to unfit me to travel . I am here , however , and as the weather is mild , and is usually very fine from this date for three months , I believe my chance of recovery is mended by the situation I am in . " I rejoice with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to desperate innovation as the yeas and nays indicate . I hope , however , that many of the minority are opposed to the Virginia amendments , but voted as they did on other grounds , for I conceive it demonstrable on the most approved principles , vouched by experience , that the said amendments are not merely unfriendly to , but utterly subversive of a free republican government . " Disorganizers never sung a more lamentable dirge . France is robing // herself in costume , the uniforms of her three branches . Is not that worse than titles ? The United States behold the failure of the schemes of foreign corruption and domestic faction ; the States , one after another , fulminating contempt on Virginia and Co. ; as , for example , the ironical and sarcastic resolves of Pennsylvania . Every such proceeding chills the Catilines here , like the touch of the torpedo . Whether the antitreaty resolutions will be moved in Congress is doubted by some . I believe they will be moved , and I fear will be carried . Others think they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of sophistry for men of sense to maintain . A direct vote that it is bad , disgraceful , and ruinous , is said to be resolved on by the party . " *The whisperers of secret history say that the flag of France was presented to the President , after a design and an attempt to get it received by the House of Representatives , thus to throw the President into the background ; but finding it would not do , the mode adopted was the only one . " A majority of wrong heads is said to be in the House . If so , and good laws are impeded , as usual , let the blame fall on those who hold the power of acting or stopping action . " - pp. 186 , 187 . And , again , March 11 , he says in a letter to Christopher Gore - " Mr. Giles has just finished a great speech , and our friend Sedgwick is now making another . Nothing will be decided till the next week . The manifest force of argument is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five constructions of the Constitution , and proceeded to suggest the difficulties in each , but was strangely wary in giving his opinion . Conscience made him a coward . He flinched from an explicit and bold creed of anarchy . Giles has no scruples , and certainly less sense . Pray attend to the debate . I am not able to stay in the House all the time ; expect therefore a broken history from my pen . The party abhors being drawn into the argument on the construction of the Constitution , on this question for a call of papers . " - p. 189 . The debate on the resolution in favor of the treaty was commenced on the 15th of April , and was protracted day after day , with great spirit and energy . The friends of the treaty were quite willing that the decision should not be hastened , for every day brought tidings from the country in their favor . Petitions came in from Boston , New York , and other important cities . Public sentiment was strong enough to encourage the Federalists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give many members a sufficient motive for voting in favor of the resolution , though their opinions had been expressed against the treaty . Mr. Ames did not take the floor till near the close of the debate . He then rose , impelled apparently by the strength of feelings which he could not resist ; and he who a month before had spoken of his political life as ended , and of himself as " an old gun , spiked , trunlions knocked off , and about to be carted off the field , " now closed the discussion with a speech , most varied in its tone , ranging from pathos to satire , most vigorous and masterly both in attack and defence , and not only ranking first in that memorable and important debate , but by universal testimony and undisputed tradition taking place among the most powerful productions of our country 's eloquence . Eloquence demands an occasion as well as an orator . Neither was wanting here . Acuteness , wit , knowledge , feeling , wisdom , depth and freedom of thought , mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the springs of human feeling and action , were remarkably combined in the orator , and in the occasion was almost everything which could deeply move the statesman , the patriot , and the man . A great measure of public policy was to be instituted . The union and prosperity of the States were to be cemented and established by insuring continued peace . The domineering influence of the French Republic , just then fresh and fierce in its notions of universal democracy , was to be checked by men who remembered the insolence of Genet and the follies of Fauchet , and who were not ignorant of the atrocities committed in the name of liberty . There was a call to defend the justice , wisdom , and patriotism of Jay , which had been aspersed or denied by men who had given small evidence of similar qualities ; and even of Washington , whose great dignity , prudence , weight of character , solid judgment , and immense services , could not avert or temper the ? charge of weakness and pusillanimity from men whose only chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily and savagely brooding over a defenceless frontier , or ready at one fell swoop to desolate a thousand miles of sea-coast with hardly a single ship or gun-boat or respectable fort to defend it all , // or to shelter a commerce just beginning to recover from long depression . Safety , success , national honor , the prosperity and permanence of free government , seemed to demand the amity and alliance which the treaty secured . Deeply moved by the charges recklessly brought against his political friends , and even more excited by the great dangers of the crisis , which it seemed almost impossible to avert , Mr. Ames rose to conclude the debate . He was at first so feeble as to be obliged to support himself by leaning upon his desk ; but as he proceeded , the fervor of his feelings gave him strength , and he poured forth his sentiments with an earnestness and energy corresponding to the magnitude of the subject and the occasion . " I entertain the hope , " he began with great simplicity , - " I entertain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will hold me out to speak a few minutes . " In my judgment , a right decision will depend more on the temper and manner with which we may prevail upon ourselves to contemplate the subject , than upon the development of any profound political principles , or any remarkable skill in the application o4* them . If we could succeed to neutralize our inclinations , we should find less difficulty than we have to apprehend in surmounting all our objections . " - Vol . II . pp. 37 , 38 . He then proceeds to bespeak the candid judgment of the House , and to indicate some of the errors resulting from the warmth of feeling necessarily elicited by the discussion . Having then stated the only alternative at the option of the House , to observe the treaty or to break it , he discusses at considerable length the simple question , " Shall we break the treaty ? " The arguments against breaking it are arrayed with great skill ; no point is taken which is not tenable ; weak positions are yielded ; the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown to be not against this treaty in particular , but against any treaty . Of such he says - " Why do they complain that the West Indies are not laid open ? Why do they lament that any restriction is stipulated on the commerce of the East Indies ? Why do they pretend that if they reject this and insist upon more , more will be accomplished ? Let us be explicit - more would not satisfy . If all was granted , would not a treaty of amity // with Britain still be obnoxious ? Have we not this instant heard it urged against our envoy , that he was not ardent enough in his hatred of Great Britain ? A treaty of amity is condemned because it was not made by a foe , and in the spirit of one . The same gentleman , at the same instant , repeats a very prevailing objection , that no treaty should be made with the enemy of France . No treaty , exclaim others , should be made with a monarch or a despot ; there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean ; their den must be destroyed ; that nation must be extirpated . " I like this , sir , because it is sincerity . With feelings such as these we do not pant for treaties ; such passions seek nothing , and will be content with nothing but the destruction of their object . If a treaty left King George his island , it would not answer , not if he stipulated to pay rent for it . It has been said the world ought to rejoice if Britain was sunk in the sea ; if where there are now men , and wealth , and laws , and liberty , there was no more than a sand-bank for the sea monsters to fatten on , a space for the storms of the oepan to mingle in conflict . " I object nothing to the good sense or humanity of all this . I yield the point , that this is a proof that the age of reason is in progress . Let it be philanthropy , let it be patriotism , if you will ; but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty is not to overcome the objections to the terms ; it is to restrain the repugnance to any stipulations of amity with the party . " - pp. 50 , 51 . After alluding more at length to Great Britain and France in their relation to America , he proceeds to the more important consideration of the consequences of rejecting the treaty . These , lie says , arc not all to be foreseen . " By rejecting , vast interests are committed to the sport of the winds ; chance becomes the arbiter of events , and it is forbidden to human foresight to count their number or measure their extent . Before we resolve to leap into this abyss , so dark and so profound , it becomes us to pause , and reflect upon such of the dangers as are obvious and inevitable . If this assembly should be wrought into a temper to defy these consequences , it is vain , it is deceptive to pretend , that we can escape them . It is worse than weakness to say , that , as to public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another tribunal than our own is already erected . The public opinion , not merely of our own country , but of the enlightened world , will pronounce a judgment that we can not resist , that we dare not even affect to despise . " - p. 53. // tains that , if the treaty does not bind us , it certainly does not bind Great Britain , and that if any part of the country , or any public body , is bound by it , the House is ; and shows how the national reputation and hornzr are at stake . " This , sir , is a cause that would be dishonored and betrayed , if I contented myself with appealing only to the understanding . It is too cold , and its processes are too slow for the occasion . I desire to thank God , that , since he has given me an intellect so fallible , he has impressed upon me an instinct that is sure . On a question of shame and honor , reasoning is sometimes useless , and w6rse . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no light upon the brain , it kindles a fire at the heart . " - p. 56 . " It is painful , I hope it is superfluous , " he proceeds after a little while , " to make even the supposition , that America should furnish the occasion of this opprobrium . No , let me not even imagine , that arepublican government , sprung as our own is , from a people enlightened and uncorrupted , a government whose origin is right , and whose daily discipline is duty , can , upon solemn debate , make its option to be faithless ; can dare to act what despots dare not avow , what our own example evinces the States of Barbary are unsuspected of . No , let me rather make the supposition , that Great Britain refuses to execute the treaty , after we have done everything to carry it into effect . Is there any language of reproach pungent enough to express your commentary on the fact ? What would you say , or rather , what would you not say ? Would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame would stick to him ; he would disown his country ? You would exclaim , England , proud of your wealth , and arrogant in the possession of power , blush for these distinctions , which become the vehicles of your dishonor ! Such a nation might truly say to corruption , Thou art my father , and to the worm , Thou art my mother and my sister . We should say of such a race of men , their name is a heavier burden than their debt . " - pp. 61 , 62 . From this he naturally advances to show briefly the commercial risks and losses consequent on breaking the treaty , and then , in that impetuous outburst of impassioned feeling once familiar to every school-boy , he pictures the desolations of the Indian wars , so certain to be let loose upon the exposed frontier . " If any , against all these proofs , should maintain , that the peace with the Indians will be stable without the posts , to them I will urge another // reply . From arguments calculated to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who hear me , and ask whether it is not already planted there ? I resort especially to the convictions of the Western gentlemen , whether , supposing no posts and no treaty , the settlers will remain in security ? Can they take it upon them to say , that an Indian peace , under these circumstances , will prove firm ? No , sir , it will not be peace , but a sword ; it will be no better than a lure to draw victims within the reach of the tomahawk . " On this theme , my emotions are unutterable . If I could find words for them , if my powers bore any proportion to my zeal , I would swell my voice to such a note of remonstrance , it should reach every loghouse beyond the mountains . I would say to the inhabitants , Wake from your false security ; your cruel dangers , your more cruel apprehensions are soon to be renewed ; the wounds , yet unhealed , are to be torn open again ; in the daytime , your path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight will glitter with the blaze of your dwellings . You are a father - the blood of your sons shall fatten your corn-field . You are a mother - the war-whoop shall wake the sleep of the cradle . " - p. 64 . " By rejecting the posts , we light the savage fires , we bind the victims . This day we undertake to render account to the widows and orphans whom our decision will make ; to the wretches that will be roasted at the stake ; to our country ; and I do not deem it too serious to say , to conscience and to God . We are answerable ; and if duty be anything more than a word of imposture , if conscience be not a bugbear , we are preparing to make ourselves as wretched as our country . " There is no mistake in this case , there can be none ; experience has already been the prophet of events , and the cries of our future victims have already reached us . The Western inhabitants are not a silent and uncomplaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wilderness ; it exclaims , that while one hand is held up to reject this treaty , the other grasps a tomahawk . It summons our imagination to the scenes that will open . It is no great effort of the imagination to conceive that events so near are already begun . I can fancy that I listen to the yells of savage vengeance and the shrieks of torture ; already they seem to sigh in the western wind ; already they mingle with every echo from the mountains . " - pp. 65 , 66 . " Look again at this state of things , " he continues in a general summing up of results . " On the sea-coast , vast losses uncompensated ; on the frontier , Indian war , and actual encroachment on our territory ; everywhere discontent ; resentments tenfold more fierce , because they will be impotent and humbled ; national discord and abasement . The dis // putes of the old treaty of 1783 , being left to rankle , will revive the almost extinguished animosities of that period . Wars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are free , arise from the impetuosity of the public feelings . The despotism of Turkey is often obliged by clamor to unsheathe the sword . War might perhaps be delayed , but could not be prevented ; the causes of it would remain , would be aggravated , would be multiplied , and soon become intolerable . More captures , more impressments would swell the list of our wrongs , and the current of our rage . I make no calculation of the arts of those whose employment it has been , on former occasions , to fan the fire ; I say nothing of the foreign money and emissaries that might foment the spirit of hostility , because the state of things will naturally run to violence ; with less than their former exertion , they would be successful . " Will our government be able to temper and restrain the turbulence of such a crisis ? The government , alas ! will be in no capacity to govern . A divided people , and divided counsels ! Shall we cherish the spirit of peace , or show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our strength , or dispose him , by the measures of resentment and broken faith , to respect our rights ? Do gentlemen rely on the state of peace , because both nations will be worse disposed to keep it ? because injuries , and insults still harder to endure , will be mutually offered ? " - pp. 67 , 68 . He then , after a few more words , closes in a manner as natural and beautiful as the body of the speech had been vigorous and earnest . " I rose to speak under impressions that I would have resisted if I could . Those who see me will believe , that the reduced state of my health has unfitted me , almost equally , for much exertion of body or mind . Unprepared for debate by careful reflection in my retirement , or by long attention here , I thought the resolution I had taken , to sit silent , was imposed by necessity , and would cost me no effort to maintain . With a mind thus vacant of ideas , and sinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I imagined the very desire of speaking was extinguished by the persuasion that I had nothing to say . Yet when I come to the moment of deciding the vote , I start back with dread from the edge of the pit into which we are plunging . In my view , even the minutes I have spent in expostulation have their value , because they protract the crisis , and the short period in which alone we may resolve to escape it . " I have thus been led by my feelings to speak more at length than I had intended . Yet I have perhaps as little personal interest in the // event as any one here . There is , I believe , no member , who will not think his chance to be a witness of the consequences greater than mine . If , however , the vote should pass to reject , and a spirit should rise , as it will , with the public disorders , to make confusion worse confounded , ' even I , slender and almost broken as my hold upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my country . " - pp. 70 , 71 . We have dwelt longer on this great speech , perhaps , than the familiarity with which it is known would seem to require ; yet as an effort of eloquence it can not be too often recalled , and its effect was so worthy of remembrance that it should never be forgotten . For the most part it proceeds with such succinctness , such classical severity of diction , as to make a fair quotation a matter of difficulty ; but its power when delivered was acknowledged by foe as well as friend . " Tears enough were shed , " said John Adams , who heard it ; " not a dry eye , I believe , in the House , except some of the jackasses who had occasioned the necessity of the oratory . " " My friend Ames , " said Judge Smith , " gave us , on Thursday , the most eloquent speech I ever heard . The impression was great ; probably much increased by the bodily weakness of the speaker . His introduction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the notes of the dying swan , were sweet and melodious . I tell him that he ought to have died in the fifth act ; that he never will have an occasion so glorious ; having lost this , he will now be obliged to make his exit like other men . If he had taken my advice , he would have outdone Lord Chatham . " * It had been intended to take the vote immediately after the conclusion of Mr. Ames 's speech , but the effect of it was so strongly marked , that the vote was postponed , in order that the members might recover their calmness . Considering the nature of the assembly and the strength of party predilections , we know not that a stronger testimony to its eloquence could have been given . * The biographer of Judge Smith says : " The speech , I am told , was written out from memory hy Mr. Dexter and Mr. Smith , and to their labors , corrected by Mr. Ames , we are indehted for the copy we now have , greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was delivered , hut with enough of its original fire and lofty enthusiasm , to he still recited and read with feelings produced by no other American speech of the last century , except two or three before the Revolution . " - Lffe of Jeremiah Smith , p. 97. // The letters of Mr. Ames contain no account of his feelings at the result of this great effort . He merely writes to Dwight Foster on the following day : " Mrs. Ames will have too lively apprehensions for my safety , when she finds ( as she will by the Gazettes ) that I have been speaking in public . " At the termination of this Congress , Mr. Ames declined a re-election , and retired to his home at Dedham , intending to renew his practice of the law , and to give himself more entirely to his private affairs . His letters show , however , a continued and deep interest in politics , and in 1799 he published in the Boston Gazette the essays signed Laoco*5n , as his biographer says , " to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security , and shake the presumption of the Federalists . " We regret that our limits forbid us to make extracts from these and other essays , which are models of brilliant popular discussion . They are brief , pointed , ingenious , fearless . The attention is seized by the first sentence ; it is held to the last . With a solid basis of fact , the argument is educed with admirable clearness , and applied with a pungency that leaves a sting behind . The style is not formal and stately , but curt and crisp . The subject is seized with the grasp of a vice , and held steadily aloft , while the lights of the author 's mind are playfully or satirically flashed upon it to illuminate its every phasis , whether attractive or repulsive . Early in 1800 , Mr. Ames , yielding somewhat reluctantly to the request of the legislature of Massachusetts , delivered before them a eulogy upon Washington . Compared with his speeches , it seems to lack enthusiasm ; but when we class it with the sketch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to see how his mind was tempered and its fervor restrained by a remembrance of the great statesmen whom he commemorated . Every expression seems in both to be carefully weighed . Indeed , we can not recall in any writer a delineation of character more full , more condensed , more sharply drawn - each sentence bearing its separate burden of thought - than that of Hamilton . It is as if we were reading from Plutarch or Tacitus . Mr. Ames 's mind and pen were seldom idle . He looked at // political subjects from the high ground of history and philosophy . Success was not with him a criterion of truth , nor defeat of error . There was something , to his mind , higher and more permanent than the will of the majority . Though he saw the Federal party , at the election of Jefferson , cast into a hopeless minority , he did not cease to predict the evil influences of false principles , nor to lift his warnings against the danger of the times . Though fearing calamity , and reckoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young and growing people , he never despaired of the republic . That he was more apprehensive than many , more intensely watchful of the progress of European warfare , more jealous of French influence , may be because , in the language of his biographer , " he was awake while many others slept . What they saw obscurely , he saw clearly . What to them was distant , affected him as near . " In 1804 Mr. Ames was chosen to succeed Rev. Dr. Willard as President of Harvard College . This honor he declined . His age , his habits , and , above all , the state of his health , seemed to him imperatively to demand this decision . He subsequently writes to Thomas Dwight , in a playful strain - " Sir , I was elected President - not of the United States ; and do you know why I did not accept ? I had no inclination for it . The health I have , would have been used up at Cambridge in a year . My old habits are my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much I was in a scrape in consequence of the offer , and with what three weeks ' mystery and address I extricated myself , are themes for conversation when we meet . I have extricated myself , and feel like a truck or stage horse , who is once more allowed to roll in the dirt without his harness . Everybody has heard of Mrs. A. 's proposing that I should take Hannah Adams , if I went to Cambridge , as she would neither go nor learn Greek . " - Vol . I. p. 3t6 . He wrote thus in 1806 . The result showed the wisdom of his decision . His health , which for ten years had been very precarious , gradually sank , till he died , July 4 , 1808 . " When the intelligence reached Boston , " says Dr. Kirkland , " a meeting of citizens was held with a view to testify their respect for his character and services . In compliance with their request , his remains were brought to the capital for interment , // at which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every mark of respectful notice was paid He was followed to the grave by a longer procession than has perhaps appeared on any similar occasion . It was a great assemblage , drawn by gratitude and admiration around the bier of one exalted in their esteem by his pre-eminent gifts , and endeared to their hearts by the surpassing loveliness of his disposition . " We need not attempt a more formal delineation of the character of Mr. Ames . His writings sufficiently exhibit him as a most cheerful and fascinating friend , a brilliant political essayist , an eloquent and fearless orator , and a patriot without reproach or suspicion . His life stretches across the most critical periods of our history , when principles were to be established , and a line of policy assumed , on which depended , not only the welfare , but the very existence of the State . Experience offered little aid , for no similar republic had existed . The opinion of the world was largely adverse to the success of the experiment . Everything depended on the sagacity , forbearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and controlling minds . The capacious and unwearied genius of Hamilton , the lofty rectitude of Jay , the magnanimity of Washington , were no more than sufficient for the occasion . Mr. Ames belonged to a high-minded party , which has since been vilified with unscrupulous rancor , but whose history is yet to be fully written , and whose fame will stand higher with the future than it has stood with the past . Of that party , in New England , he was one of the leaders , controlling the opinions of many , and enjoying the confidence of all . How upright and noble-minded he was , how zealous for the best welfare of the State , how unselfish and thoroughly true at heart , his familiar letters are a sufficient proof . In all his private relations , in his friendships , his pursuits , his successes , Mr. Ames had the good fortune which a happy temper , sound judgment , and fidelity are very apt to secure . The friends he had ( and of what character they were his letters sufficiently show ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The honors which he won abroad were made thrice 20 // dear by the sympathy of a chosen circle at home . Of the law he had a noble conception , yet , on account of his health , he seems to have given himself to the practice of it as a matter of necessity , and with a divided love . Yet he had no reason to be dissatisfied with the results of his labors . His fortune was never ample , yet he became independent , and when he was no longer compelled to labor for his daily bread , his mind instinctively turned to those broad and varied studies whence he could draw the most important lessons for his country . He did not blindly follow his party , nor make his sympathies and antipathies the guide of his life . In the full flush of success , he neither concealed from himself nor from others the just grounds of fear . In the plenitude of hope , he was still aware that civil liberty had been the privilege of few nations , bought with a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nation having safely passed through one protracted war , and just beginning to recover from its exhaustion , he was most averse to plunging it into another . Having escaped from unrighteous and illiberal exactions on one side , he saw too plainly the opposite dangers of license and anarchy . He was grateful to France for her assistance in the distressing days of the Revolution , but even that would hardly palliate , much less excuse , the impudence of citizens Genet and Adet . The liberty he had fought to obtain from an enemy , he would not barter for a mere chimera , even with a friend . Hence , although it was unpalatable to many , he strennously resisted that course of things whose tendencies were strongly , as he thought , towards " licentiousness , that inbred malady of democracies , that deforms their infancy with gray hair and decrepitude . " In the political essays which occupied his later years it was his object , not to flatter so much as to warn ; not to sing preans to liberty , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " only six months before Octavius totally subverted the commonwealth , to say : It is not possible for the people of Rome to be slaves , whom the gods have destined to the command of all nations ; other nations may endure slavcry , but the proper end and business of the Roman people is liberty , ' " - but to gather up the lessons of history and philos // ophy and apply them with freedom and fearlessness . He brought the power of exuberant wit and satire to bear on the follies of the state . Nor has time antiquated the lessons he taught , or rendered useless the cautions upon which he insisted . During his latter years , his exertions were constantly interrupted or repressed by precarious health . Yet nothing can be more cheerful than the temper with which he receives the allotments of life . With profound sincerity and earnestness of feeling , there is no moroseness . His letters , indeed , are written with so much playfulness , that one , judging from them alone , might form a false notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and a longer life , he might have taken a more commanding position ; he could hardly have gained more entirely the affection of friends or the respect of opponents . His fame is the property , not of Massachusetts alone , nor of New England , but of the whole country , and his name will be spoken with honor , along with those of the great men of an earlier and a later generation , by every historian who portrays the early progress and t4als of the Republic . It has been far from our purpose to analyze minutely , or to *praise indiscriminately , the Federal party , to which Mr. Ames belonged , or to claim for him , or the distinguished men with whom he acted , exemption from the errors and mistakes to which all are liable . Their judgment of measures , like that of other men , might have changed with the change of times . But history has yet to record the names of statesmen whose principles were more sound , whose policy was more just and sagacious , who better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounds of freedom , who more wisely united the conservative with the progressive elements of character , whose political conduct was more high-minded , magnanimous , and pure , whose ends were more entirely " their country 's , their God 's , and truth 's . " The results of that change in the tone of national politics which followed the election of Mr. Jefferson are not yet spent . A secret idea , dimly smouldering in the heart of the nation , found freer air under his administration than before . But we can not say that we hope more for // Jan. our future prosperity because his principles have been predominant for the greater part of the last half-century , or because the authority of his name is so much oftener invoked than that of Washington 's . The Federalists were fond of law and order and stability , and under the changes consequent upon a new regime had possibly too many apprehensions , and too little hope . They were scrupulous of justice and national honor . They had a higher esteem for the English character than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hearts ' blood in opposing England . They did not forget the origin of our language , literature , religion , and laws , though intent on establishing an independent American policy , to be developed by a united people under a consolidated government . However they have been assailed , it can never be forgotten that of them were Washington , Adams , Hamilton , Jay , Wolcott , and others like them , names illustrious and venerable all over the world , that to them , in large part , belongs the honor of framing the Constitution , and of securing its acceptance , and that their legitimate successors have been its ablest expounders , and its most eloquent defenders .
