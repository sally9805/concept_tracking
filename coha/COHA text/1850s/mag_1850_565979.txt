ART . IV. - PERFECT LOVE ATTAINED . Riches of Grace , or the Blessing of Perfect Love , as experienced , enjoyed and recorded by Living Witnesses . Edited by Rev. D. S. KING . Hartford : E. Hunt . 1849 . THE editor of this volume deprecates all criticism in behalf of a portion of its contents , and defies it in behalf of the rest . A medium between the deprecation and the defiance would seem to be a simple request that it might be judged as a whole upon its own merits , and that the influence which it is fitted to exert might be estimated by the impression which it actually produces upon the mind of its reader . We shall endeavor to present such an estimate of the book in the present article . It purports to give , in its four hundred and fifty well printed pages , the recorded experience of sixty-two " Living Witnesses , " on a subject of the most momentous interest to the Christian world , and indeed to all mankind . It is but a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this volume has sought to decide it by an array of testimony thirty-fold stronger than that required by the Mosaic code . And no valid objection can be urged against the general competency of the witnesses to testify on such subjects as are capable of being decided by the mere force of human testimony . We have the assurance of the editor , that " from personal acquaintance and from good vouchers , " he knows them to be " persons of respectability , and of established Christian character . " Though the names , " for reasons which , " it is presumed , " the reader can fully appreciate , are not given , " yet , incidental expressions , and in many instances the whole substance of their several records , sufficiently show that there must be a great diversity among them , in character , condition and attainments , in every other respect save the common conviction of having alike attained to the experience of " perfect love . " In order , as it would seem , to give greater weight to their united testimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distant , and from stations of obscurity and notoriety , the most diverse , from the widely known and respected President of the Institution at Oberlin , down to the humble and devout woman who conscientiously triumphs over the becoming modesty of her sex so far as to lift up her voice in loud acclamations of " glory " in the public sanctuary or the more retired " class meeting . " These witnesses do indeed exhibit much of the spirit of rebuke and controversy in their depositions . They make many formal statements of doctrine , and they bring forward , what undoubtedly seems to them , both a necessary and formidable array // of arguments , to prove that God desires his people to be holy ; that Christ died to save them from their sins , all and individually , now and forever ; that he constantly offers them grace sufficient , if rightly improved , thus to save them ; that they ought to avail themselves of the offered grace ; and that what they ought to do , they can do . But these doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain theoretically . And if they were denied , any amount of merely human testimony , could not change the fact in the least ; for that depends upon the word , not of man , but of God , and upon the necessary conditions of human obligation . It is riot therefore for the purpose of argument or controversy that these " Witnesses " appear . J'he worth of their testimony , is to be judged by the strictness with which they confine themselves to the statement of fact , or rather of what they believe to be fact . And however far they may wander from the real question at issue , however extravagant , indefinite or meaningless their language may often be , they are unanimous iii declaring one thing ; that is , that they have fully complied with the universally admitted obligation ; that their moral attainments have been carried to the utmost possible degree of rectitude . they all affirm in some form again arid again and in the most solemn manner , , that they are perfectly holy ; that they love the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ; that their whole being is absorbed in the desire to obey his commands ; that they have no volition , no thought , no emotion which is in the least degree at variance with the divine will ; that they as completely fulfill the end of their being as the angels of God do theirs ; that they in their place as men , are as perfect , as complete , as holy , as the infinite God is in his . So they declare , repeatedly and with every variety of the most solemn asseveration . And they challenge the world to receive without doubt or question their simple verbal testimony that they have attained to such a state , on pain of being denounced by their pure minds as tempters and co-workers with Satan to pull them down from their heights of holiness and of love . We have been accustomed to regard it a very diffictilt qtiestion for any one to decide , whether he has employed his powers or his opportunities iii any respect , for any purpose , to the full extent of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given time he has learned the utmost that it was possible for him to learn ? Can an individual , in any station , however public or private , be positively certain , that he is at all times exerting the utmost degree of influence for good that is possible for him to exert ? Can the artisan , the day laborer , declare upon oath that he has in any case employed his strength , or his skill , to the utmost ? Is the fact in any such case so clear that one can believe it as fully as // he " believes his own existence ! " But these writers dechire themselves so to believe a fact upon which it is incalculably more difficult to decide . And many of those who make such professions are persons who would not be expected to speak rashly , or ignorantly , but with a correct understanding of the things whereof they affirm . A large proportion of them are ministers of the gospel , and teachers or students in literary and theological institutions . And most , if not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the standard of holiness to accommodate their own imperfections . The language which we have used to express the general tenor of their professions , does not at all exaggerate the attainments which they claim to have made . Notwithstanding all that they know of the ten thousand contingencies which must be taken into the account , in truly estimating the precise moral condition of any one human heart , they claim to have perfectly ascertained that of their own . They say they " know , " that they are as sure as they are of their existence , that they can not have erred in the least in their judgment of themselves . And that judgment is , that they are already " wholly sanctified in spirit and soul and body . " They never for a moment voluntarily employ their minds , their hearts , their hands , in any other than the best possible manner . And in order so to employ their faculties , they have all the requisite knowledge of their bodily and mental constitution , and of the outward world , which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best judgment which , with the aid of such knowledge , they can form , they never speak or keep silence , they never indulge or deny appetite , they never labor or repose , to the least degree of excess , or at any other times than the best . They are just as prompt , faithful and industrious , as they ought to be , in the fulfillment of all their engagements , in the discharge of all their public and private duties , in the employment of all possible means for attaining still more perfect knowledge , as rapidly as providence gives them the opportunity . They know at each successive moment all that they ought to know , that is , all they can know , about the purposes for which they should employ their powers , their opportunities and their possessions ; and they never fail so to employ them as they judge in the light of such utmost attainable knowledge shall be most for God 's glory and man 's happiness . They never lie down to sleep at night , without the conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they possibly could do , for the honor of Christ and for the salvation of souls . They have no sins to confess save those that were " done in their days of nature ; " and they have the " perfect assurance , " they believe " as much as they believe their own existence , " that those sins are already pardoned . At home and abroad ; in the field , the workshop and the sanctuary ; when // they go out , and when they come in ; when they rise up and when they sit down ; the whole current of their thoughts , every volition and every emotion of their minds , is in perfect , intelligent and active conformity to the divine xviii . All their professed and admitted attainments in the various departments of human knowledge , all that they know of the human mind , of human motives , and of the complex and endlessly diversified details of human duty , fail to remind them of any such deficiency in moral character , as that they can sincerely confess themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they profess , so much they must profess in claiming to have attained moral perfection . So they understand it themselves ; so teaches the authority to which they refer with the greatest deference . Some of them do indeed insist upon a distinction between angelic and human perfection . But most of them seem to be well axvare of the fact that moral perfection must be in all creatures essentially the same . In man , not less than in angel , perfect holiness must consist in the full consecration of himself to the service of his Maker . And although as his *owe rs , his intelligence and his opportunities enlarge , he may make a greater sacrifice in proportion to the amount of previous offerings , yet it can never be greater in proportion to his obligation . He can never give more than himself , his all . The angel does 1 ) 0 more than give himself and he is l ) erfect . Man , if he xvould be , must give nothing less than himself And when that is done , no higher degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of action , is possible . And so most of these writers understand it . And whether so understanding it or not , all claim to have attained a degree of moral perfection , which is thus as high in proportion to their responsibilities as that of the angels is in proportion to theirs . To show that such is the fact , these recorded " experiences " are presented to the world . The question then arises at once , are the experiences to be trusted ? Is the testimony to be received ? If it is , then we must conclude , not simply that there are sixty of the children of Adam who do good and sin not . If there are so many , there not only may be , and should be , there must be , there are , many more . For it surely is not to be presumed , that these sixty are righteous above all the children of God who dwell on the face of all the earth , even if others do not assert their perfect righteousi*ess , but leave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not intend to question the sincerity of these witriesses , nor the fact that they have actually made great attainments in piety . The volume which they have unitedly written , is sufficient evidence , that with them , religion is the great subject of thought and of interest . While the intelligent and candid // reader will find much in these narratives that is objectioiable , they must yet increase his desire for a more perfect conformity to the xviii of God . But when we come to the question , whether these writers , from their own experience as disclosed in this volume , have a peculiar fitness to declare " the grand secret of holy living , " we must confess ourselves unable to see wherein they are better guides than many others , who say much less about themselves , and who make nothing like such high professions of personal sanctity . Still more , when it comes to the question whether we are to regard their assertion alone as sufficient evidence that they keep the whole law of God , a careful examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some degree of abatement . And in stating the grounds for such a conclusion , we shall confine ourselves to such as may be drawn from these " experiences " themselves as they stand recorded before us , leaving the question of fact whether these persons are entirely sanctified , and also the doctrine of the Scriptures on the subject , untouched . All we say is this ; we shall have much hesitancy in believing that all these witnesses are " entirely sanctified , " until we receive more evidence of the fact than is presented in this volume of their testimony . Some of the reasons for that hesitancy are the following . 1 . These " experiences " or expressions , are not characterized by such a degree of candor and simplicity as might justly be expected were the hearts of the writers in a state of " perfect love , " unstained by a shadow of a shade of sin . There is , to say the least , an appearance of artifice , in working up the narrative of mental conflict to an ambitious and dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity of the beloved disciple . Many of the descriptions of internal struggles , while abounding in the most extravagant language , have so little genuine pathos or reality , so little definiteness of meaning , as to awaken the suspicion that they were written under the influence of hypothetical or unnatural emotion . Thus , one speaks of the " chills of death running lengthwise of his soul , leaving a wake of sorrows behind . " We have heard of a reformed drunkard , who described the effects of a single glass , which he was induced to drink after long abstinence , by saying " he felt as if he was sitting astride the ridge of the old meeting house and every shingle was a Jews harp . " He used such language , not because he thought there was any truth or meaning in it , but because he was speaking in a public meeting , and must say something that would make an impression . Is there any more truth or reality in this nautical description , in which the " perfect witness " makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and desperation of his conflict with sin , again he says , his " extremities grew cold " - his // " blood stopped " - his " breath grew short . " Is it probable , is it natural , that one , whose whole soul is absorbed in a purely mental conflict , would thus as it were at the same time , stand aside from himself , and observe and note down in his memory , the effects of the struggle upon his bodily constitution ? His " memory kindled like a furnace " - his " reason developed by hard study reached into eternity " - " the deep agony of " his " soul increased in proportion to " his " vision of " his " state of guilt and " his " certain doom . " And yet he was at the same time deliberately exploring his pulse , counting his respirations , testing the temperature of his extremities ! Is a person , whose " blood has stopped " in " seeming " or actual death , sensible of the coldness of his " extremities , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life blood is still moving , to discover the fact ? But this person describes himself as being entirely alone . And similar evidences might be collected from almost any portion of the volume , showing that instead of the perfect candor and simplicity most to be desired in such narratives , we have something that looks altogether too much like ambitious and overwrought representations of unreal emotion . Some of the writers quote from their professed diaries , written out years before making the communication to the editor of the present volume , and exhibiting the record which they made of their own feelings , at a time long before they came to the experience of " perfect love , " or knew the " way " by which it was to be attained . And yet expressions and sentiments occur in those extracts , such as could hardly have found a place there , had the writers at the date , been as ignorant as they labor to show themselves to have been , tI en , of the perfect knowledge , and the ineffable experience alledged to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear as if they had been altered from their original form , or had been written off at once for a specific purpose . At any rate the composition as it stands in the extracts , written when and how they may have been , could not easily have been made what it is , had not the mind of the writer in recording it been occupied with the idea of publicity in the class meeting , or the newspaper , or the printed volume , quite as much as with a private dissection and demonstration of the anatomy of his own heart . The narratives , and even the diaries themselves , not unfrequently assume the form of discussions and disputatious ; and thus the person who offers himself as a witness , instead of bearing simple and direct testimony to a fact , passes within the bar to argue the whole question , and then closes with taking his seat upon the bench to pronounce judgment . And he confirms his right to do so , and the rectitude of his decisions , by appealing to the " witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in a // state of " perfect love , " and " can not sin . " Thus instead of giving actual information on the great subject of inquiry , they too often occupy the pages with reproving others , especially Christians in the church at large , and their own individual churches in particular , for not receiving their assertions as equivalent to divine testimony . We should hardly expect such things from persons who come forward in the spirit of meekness , of holiness , and of perfect love , to testify what God has done for their souls . 2 . Another reason for hesitating to receive these as narratives of perfect , that is to say , of the highest possible Christian experience , is , they are in several particulars inconsistent with themselves and contradictory . The writers claim to be perfectly holy , yet , they say " conscience reproves " them . But does conscience reprove for any thing else than sin ? They speak of having " fallen through want of proper watchfulness , " of " having been decoyed into old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " and yet in the same breath they declare that their state of C* perfect love " has not been for an hour interrupted since they " found the Lord . " They speak of being " kept in perfect peace , " being " cleansed from all sin , " and yet believing that their " unavoidable defects are constantly pardoned . " But what need of pardon for unavoidable defects ? Surely it is nothing but intelligent , voluntary disobedience that can be the subject of pardon . Have the angels , and the perfected spirits of the just , any need to be " continually pardoned ? " Does conscience reprove them ? To be sure , as we have already stated , these " witnesses " sometimes insist very much upon a distinction between angelic and human perfection . But we say again that their urgency on that point is entirely gratuitous . For no one pretends that man , in order to become perfect , must cease to be man . It is his depravity , not his humanity , that is in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to have entirely overcome . And besides , moral perfection from its very nature must be in all beings essentially the same . And thus these witnesses , while they claim to be as holy as the angels , admit that conscience reproves , and that they " continually " need pardon . These writers uniformly declare that they enjoy " l ) erfect peace , " " perfect happiness , " and yet at the same time they dwell much upon their " trials , " " burdens , " " griefs , " " sorrows , " " persecutions . " One speaks of being in " great heaviness " from various temptations , yet " never for once yielding to them ; " never experiencing the least degree of " doubt , " or fear of death , or hell , or " falling from grace ; " never enjoying any thing less than " perfect peace ; " " sometimes weeping , sorrowing , grieving , " yet " just as happy with sorrow and grief as with joyous // emotions . " Another bewails his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as " opposed , tempted , neglected , abused , impoverished . " Many have much to say of the " persecutions " to which they are subjected , and then urge it as decisive evidence of the " grace that is in their inmost soul , " that they can bear such tribulation for righteousness ' sake . But has the work of persecution been going on in this land of civil and religious liberty where all these witnesses have their home ? Has any body been deprived of life , or liberty , or property , or reputation , or been hindered in the pursuit of happiness , on account of obeying the gospel , in that portion of our land , and within the period covered by these narratives ? Has there been suffered for the sake of the truth , any thing so cruel , so terrible , as that those whose souls are filled to repletion with the disposition " to bear all things , to hope all things , to endure all things , ' ' are compelled to proclaim themselves to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and in our time , those who are most meek , humble , faithful , holy , harmless , nudefiled in their lives , are , of all others , least exposed to annoyance , abuse or injustice from their fellow men . And if these " witnesses " possess all such Christian graces in perfection , how is it that they can have suffered any thing that , even by an extravagant figure of speech , can be called persecution ? Here are ministers of the gospel , who complain that they are " abused " and " neglected . " But are not ministers as a class , more sure than any others of being respected to the full extent of their desert ? Is any class of persons in any thing like as much danger of actually suffering in their spiritual interest , from the excessive deference paid by others to their supposed sanctity and selfdenial , rather than from " neglect , " or " abuse ? " And shall those who claim to have left their brethren in the ministry and in the church at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of inviting and cheering the lingerers onward to overtake them , send back continually a piteous and discouraging wail over the abuse and poverty and persecution which they are suffering ? We should suppose , that while in the possession of " perfect peace , " " perfect love , " " perfect joy , " it would not once occur to them to speak of the petty trials and difficulties which are inseparable from this earthly lot . These persons claim to live entirely by faith , to be guided in all things by the Spirit ; and yet many of their most cherished views are exceedingly sensuous , material and mercenary . They speak of " going to the Lord , " as men speak of going to call upon a friend at a distance . they speak of " telling the Lord , " in terms gross enough to imply that he has need of information from them . They speak of having made contracts and bargains with their Maker-they , with diplomatic coolness , taking the mitiative // by proposing conditions to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him certain services . One speaks of " language communicated to his senses by the Holy Ghost clear as if written in letters of gold . " Another " feels the Spirit poured out almost as sensibly as water . " Another " jumps with all his might , " " turns a somerset , " and " is caught by the Savior . " Another " takes a long leap out of himself into the cleft side of Jesus . " Another , describing the views which he had of heaven in one of his most holy raptures , says that it appeared to him , " that it was about as high as the steeple of the church , and that if he prayed aloud , the angels would hear him in heaven . " And it is by such language , whatever may be its meaning , that the writers would describe their experience of perfect love , and would instruct others in the way of attaining the utmost possible degree of faith and spiritual joy . The earnest seeker after holiness is left to infer that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " so long as he has not the same " abundance of visions , " hears no voices of the spirit " speaking to the senses , " has no convulsions of body or raptures of mind , ' no experience of any kind , save such as he can describe in quiet , unaf. fected , intelligible language . These writers present themselves to the world as model Christians , reproving and admonishing all others for falling behind them in excellence of character and fullness of spiritual knowledge ; yet so far as they give any intelligible account of themselves , it does not appear that they are able to disclose , in respect either to Christian knowledge , or experience , any thing more than what Christians have always practically known and believed and acted upon . They state , as extraordinary discoveries , certain views of the fullness of the atonement , of the means and of the possibility of sanctification , of the grace offered to the believer adequate to his every want . Yet these views are already , and have been for ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers of Christ . They speak of their " first " and " second conversion ; " and while they are positive in asserting and believing the genuineness of the " first , " they labor industriously to deny all evidence of its reality , in order to reflect the more glory upon the " second . " And yet they give no evidence of having consecrated themselves any more fully to Christ in their " second conversion , " than is necessarily involved in the very first act of faith in Him as the only Redeemer . We should have supposed that those whose " whole soul and body and spirit " have been already wholly sanctified , would have preserved a greater degree of consistency with themselves in detailing the various aspects of their own experience , and a greater degree of consistency with truth itself when attempting to enforce it upon the minds of others . // 3 . The self-confidence of these writers is so excessive as to lead us , in some degree , to distrust the justness , as well as the permanency of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , and a degree of moral attainment , in the perfect rectitude of which , they as much believe as they do in their own existence . And yet , in many instances , they acknowledge that they have been at other times just as sincere in adopting certain other views and courses of conduct , and that they afterwards found that they had been wrong . They then " supposed themselves to have been divinely led , " and afterward believed quite the contrary . What has rendered it impossible for them to be misled in their present convictions ? The wisest and best men that have ever lived , have ever been more ready to acknowledge their liability to err in their opinions and in their conduct , than the ignorant and foolhardy , who usually do err in both . But these persons believe themselves to be " led by the Spirit , " and therefore enabled to solve difficulties which were otherwise beyond their power . And how do they conceive that the Spirit makes known his guidance to them ? One opens the Bible at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye to a passage " that will answer the question with which his mind is embarrassed . And the passage which first arrests his attention , he receives as the one by which the Spirit answers his request . Another engages to do some specified act , or binds himself to believe the truth of some proposition , on condition that some desired impression shall be made upon his mind within a given time . That impression he conceives to be made confortnably to the conditions which he has proposed , and he receives it as the " witness of the Spirit , " that the proposition is true , or that the course of conduct is binding . The memory of another brings up vividly before his mind a particular passage of Scripture , and he receives that as the suggestion of the Spirit , deciding for him a question , the decision of which would otherwise have cost him much deliberate reflection and inquiry . Another dreams a dream , and thus receives what he regards as intimations of divine will . And all firmly believe that the Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " witness " of the entire rectitude of their conduct . And they have full confidence in their ability to distinguish between the teachings of the Spirit and the suggestioris of their own minds . Did ever prophets , evangelists , or apostles , believe themselves to be more essentially inspired ? And indeed the very words of the Savior which have always been received as satisfactory evidence that the apostles were inspired , are quoted by these writers to prove that they are . And while cherishing such unhesitating assurance that they are guided by the Spirit in their opinions as well as their con // duct , they , very naturally , regard all Christians , who do not ceive their professions with full credence , as having fallen into very grievous error . While they consider themselves " tempted " and " persecuted , " because churches do not think as favorably of them as they do of themselves , they never seem to suspect that they are retaliating the same treatment upon others , by continually representing them to be a great deal more corrupt and heretical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons count themselves persecuted , if , xvhile we admit in general their sincerity and the genuineness of their piety , we suggest , rather positively , that they may over-estimate their spiritual attainments . What would they say , if we should raise the cry of persecution against them , because they unanimously charge on us error in belief and in practice , of which we do not feel ourselves to be guilty ? To be consistent with themselves , they must say , " we have the witness of the Spirit in our souls that we are perfect , and therefore must be right ; you have nothing but your unsanctified reason to guide you , and therefore must be constantly in error . " A very summary and easy method of an-swering ! 4 . A large proportion of these " experiences " are based upon the assumption , that " professing Christ before men " consists primarily and chiefly in a verbal declaration of perfect love to him , rather than in leading such a life as will be itself credible evidence , in the judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Many of the writers confess themselves to have been not a little vexed and disappointed , because , when they declared themselves before their brethren to have attained to the experience of " perfect love , " the brethren , instead of breaking out in rapturous congratulation at the mere assertion of the fact , seemed disposed to *vait and see what evidence of its reality would be exhibited in the subsequent life of the " witnesses . " Whatever else these " perfect " Souls can bear without murmuring , they seem to have no patience with their brethren , who are so unbelieving as to demand anything else than their mere verbal testimQny as evidence that they fulfill the whole law . One of them , for example , ( we thus state , substantially , the " experience " of many , ) goes to the minister , or the elder members of his church , and states to them that he has just attained to complete sanctification , that he has the " witness of the Spirit " in his heart that he is perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we are glad if it is so . We shall be delighted to see full evidence of the fact , in your life . hereafter . You , of course , will desire to be carefully observed , for it is only when the evidence of your perfect holiness is seen by others , that they can be excited to imitate your example . And as it can be of no advantage to men to know the fact of // your perfection any farther than they see evidence of it in your life , we think it would be better for them to declare your excellencies when they become convinced of their reality , than for you to proclaim them with your own mouth . Not that we by any means deny your perfect sanctification . We only wish to see it confirmed by its appropriate fruits . For , so long as it is not thus confirmed , your assertion can never prove it , and when it is thus confirmed , your assertion will be unnecessary . " Now even if such treatment and counsel were not perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would seem that it I ) eed not provoke the charge of " persecution " from one who has already reached the state of " perfect love . " It surely ought to take something more to disturb , discourage and utterly cast down one who had attained to the possession of " perfect peace ; " yet these witnesses , who complain of being persecuted , by their own confession , have suffered nothing worse . And when so received and advised , they invariably blame their counselors , and charge them with taking from them the " witness " of entire sanctification . For they " lose the witness , " as soon as they cease to proclaim aloud that they possess it . And consequently , whoever persuades them to declare their perfect holiness by their conduct , rather than by their assertions , is guilty of taking it from them . In perfect keeping with this insatiable desire to proclaim before others their own attainments in grace , and to have their word alone received as satisfactory evidence of the fact , is their correspondingly moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the salvation of men . They seldom express any fear lest they shall not do enough in that work . One , on the contrary , blames himself for having " labored for the salvation of others to the neglect of his own soul . " We had supposed that Christians exhibit most of the spirit of their divine Master , when they do most completely forget themselves , in the fullness of their devotion to the work for which he gave his life . But these " witnesses , " while they talk much about their own peace , joy , high attainment , ineffable raptures , heavenly visions , say very little about the plain , matter of fact duties , in the discharge of which the Christian must spend his life . When they do allude to such " earthly " things , they rather characterize them as hindrances to their spiritual joy , their perfect peace . Some of these " holy " women , who appear to he heads of families , assign the cares of their households as the cause of their losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . rPhe attention , fidelity , and industry which they need , in order to secure the order , happiness and improvement of their families , draw them away from their duty ! As if what they owe to their families , instead of being a hindrance to the // discharge of duty , were not itself one of the first duties which they owe to God , themselves , and the world ! If that ineffable revel of emotion , for which they are sighing and struggling , can not be maintained while discharging , faithfully and industriously , all the duties of daily and domestic life , then that is satisfactory evidence that the exhausting struggle for the much coveted emotion is the hindrance to duty , and the source of temptation , against which they have to guard . With such views of duty as some of these writers exhibit , we should not be surprised if they should profess entire sanctification , and pray longest and loudest , in the conference meeting , yet , the very same evening , fail to fulfill an engagement to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to be at a given place at a stipulated time . They would call fidelity in fulfilling such promises " worldly mindedness . " Or they would charge the breaking of such positive engagements , and the neglec tof many other known and pressing duties , upon " unavoidable human infirmity , " and yet flatter themselves that they retained the " witness of the Spirit " to their entire sanctification in their own souls , so long as their emotions lost none of their intensity . And , however commendable may have been the motives , which led the several writers to contribute to this voli*me , its general influence upon the minds of many readers , must be to make their religion consist mainly in factitious emotions , and internal experiences , al ) d the loud proclamation of them before others , while they , at the same time , cultivate a sanctimonious and self-commended indifference , if not positive aversion , to the most essential aud practical duties of every day life . 5 . The work which these writers declare to have been wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to such an exalted height above the great body of believers , has the appearance , as it is described by themselves , of being only theoretic or nominal . Frequently , by his own showing , the person does not appear to have been made a more useful , practical or exemplary Christian , by the great change supposed to have been wrought in him . He has only adopted a new terminology for the description of his Christian experience , and a new estimate of the progress which he has already made , while the man himself retnains very much the same that he was before . The instructions which these writers give for the attainment of entire sanctification , are based upon the assumption , which many of them declare again and again in so many words , that the man is not to do any thing , in order to become holy , any more than he is in order to purchase or to deserve forgiveness . He is to " cease from all efforts of his own . " He is only to " believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is but to " believe that the work is done , and it // will be done . " Believe that a thing is , when it is not , and that belief will cause it to be ! Inquirers are exhorted to throw entirely out of the account , the plain question of fact , whether they are entirely holy or not . They must believe they are while yet they are not , and thus they will be . And , accordingly , the " witness " often appears , declaring that the work was accomplished in him , the moment he brought himself to say , " I can , I may , I will , I do believe . " And they describe the belief which they thus entertained , not as an undoubting trust in the sufficiency of divine grace , but simply as a firm conviction , a full perstiasion of the reality of a fact , which they at the same time knew had no existence . But that fact , their entire holiness , became a reality , the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . The virtue of the man was not strengthened ; his mind was not enlightened ; his heart was not suddenly purified ; no moral change took place . He only adopted a different estimate of his moral condition , while he remained the same . Before , he regarded himself morally imperfect . At his " second conversion , " he believed himself to be perfectly holy , and , as a consequence , ever since , he has enjoyed " perfect peace . " And it would be very strange if perfect peace were not enjoyed , by the man who believes , " as much as he believes his own existence , " that he is perfectly blameless before God , wheth*r he is so or not . As long as he can maintain that conviction , irrespective of the fact of his real imperfection , conscience can no more reprove him , than it can reprove an angel in heaven . But the question as to the degree of spiritual attainment which he has at any time made , is a simple question of fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctified , and no conviction or belief of his as to the fact , can affect it in the least . Belief , faith , in the sense of confidence in the fullness and sufficiency of divine grace , will undoubtedly prove a most efficient means of carrying forward the work of sanctification in the soul . But how belief in the sense of firm persuasion that the work is already done , will cause its instantaneous completion , must be left for those to explain , who can bring themselves to believe things that they know are not , as though they were . Such are some of the reasons which have compelled us to receive the testimony of these " witnesses " to their entire sanctification , with some degree of abatement . The subject itself is of so sacred a character , and the narratives in general exhibit so much of a Christian spirit , that we have been withheld from presenting the objections against the book in as strong a light as the truth would warrant . If any of the authors of these narratives should read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with undue severity , they should be the last to complain , for out of their own mouths have they been judged . Our estimate of // the book as a whole , is simply , that it is a fair transcript of the minds and hearts of its authors , exhibiting mingled defects and excellencies . We believe that it , like them , will do both good and evil . We should never have subjected it even to so lenient a criticism , had we not feared that the evil which it will do to some of its readers will be great , and very much to be deplored . For , if they are led , as many will be , to conform their highest standard of piety to the models which are here presented for imitation , they must be very far from the simple , unpretending , yet earnest , energetic and self-denying standard of the gospel . Whether these writers so designed it or not , their book will be sure to lead many to strive after fervors , and ecstasies of emotion , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietness , reflection and a faithful observance of common duties . It will lead them to proclaim aloud their own attainments in holiness , when there is much more need that they should give evidence of such attainments in their daily life and conduct . It will lead them unjustly to censure , and even to despise , their brethren and sisters in the churches , from whose counsel and example they have much need to learn wisdom . It will lead them to adopt impressions , and visions , and emotions , and a supposed witness of the Spirit , for the infallible guide of their religious life , and thus shut their minds and hearts against instructions and admonitions , to which they should give earnest heed . And if a book is circulated by " thousands " which is fitted to produce such consequences , its editor has no right to plead , as an exemption from criticism , the sincerity and the good intentions of its authors .                    @
