THE USURY LAWS . THE writer of the following pages would not have attempted thus publicly to treat a subject which , from its importance and complex nature , might give employment to a more able pen , but for the appearance and extensive circulation of a pamphlet entitled , " Importance of Usury Laws , " and the complimentary notices it has received from respectable sources , as containing a triumphant vindication of the justice and policy of those laws . This pamphlet contains the argument of Hon. John Whipple , of Providence , Rhode Island , first published in 1836 , with introductory remarks by the editor of the Bankers ' Magazine . The subject discussed is one upon which the opinions of mankind seem never to have been fully at ease , at least within the memory of the historian , and for several years past , it has been attracting increased attention amongst American statesmen and economists . The spirit of liberty , ever restive under conscious and unnecessary restraint , is beginning to demand , in tones which brook no evasion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to the terms upon which he may obtain the use of another man 's capital in the form of money , that he has in obtaining it in any other form . These reasons are not , as all must confess , entirely obvious ; and yet , such is the inquisitive spirit of the age , and especially of American freemen , that they must be clearly presented and firmly established , or the distinction must be laid aside . To punish such reasons is the task which Mr. Whipple has reluctantly imposed upon himself in the pamphlet alluded to-we say reluctantly-for he more than intimates an opinion , that time-honored usage upon this subject should so excite our vencration , as to render reasons unnecessary ; and to inquire into the soundncss of the reasons he has offered , is the object of the prcsent essay . Mr. Whipple begins by giving a tolerably fair synopsis of the positions and arguments of Mr. Jeremy Bentham , in his little work , entitled , " A Defence of Usury , " published in 1787 . He quotes Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe years and sound mind , acting frecly , and with his eyes open , ought to be hindered , with a view to his advantage , from making such a bargain in the way of obtaining money , as he thinks fit ; nor ( what is a necessary consequencc ) anybody hindered from supplying him upon any terms he thinks propcr to accede to . " That contracts in general ought to be observcd , is a rule , the propriety of which no man was ever yet found wrong-hcaded cnough to deny . If this case is one of the exceptions ( for some , doubtless there are ) which the welfare and safety of society require should be taken out of the general rule , in this case , as in all others , it lies upen him who alleges the necessity of the exception , to produce a reason for it . " " This , " says our author , " would have been a fair statement of the question , had the exception contended for been a new one . " But claiming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he proceeds to upbraid // Mr. Bentham for his presumption in demanding an affirmative reason , " until he establishes the contrary . " Supposing the exception to be as old as Mr. Whipple imagines , still there was a time when it was new , and when , by his own admissioii , it was incumbent on those who alleged its necessity , to produce a reason for it . Have they ever done it ? If so , when ? and where is it recorded ? If it is on record , they have only to refer to it . If it is not on record , they are the delinquents , and the demand still rests on them with unabated force . Whether the exception is as old as the general rule or not , it is certain that its correctness has not been as universally admitted . Diversity of opinion as to its necessity , is as old as the exception , and in every stage of its existence , a reason for it has been demanded , and it never will be too late to repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the distinction abandoned . But Mr. Bentham , in the absence of any alleged reasons in favor of Usury Laws , proceeds to state such grounds of argument as his imagination could suggest , and Mr. Whipple quotes them as follows : " In favor of the restraints opposed to the species of libei*ty I contend for , I can imagine but five arguments . " 1 . Prevention of usury . " 2 . Prevention of prodigality. " 3 . Protection of indigence against extortion . " 4 . Repression of the temerity of projectors. " 5 . Protection of simplicity against imposition . " He proceeds to give the outlines of Mr. Bentham 's arguments against these five propositions , and also a very meagre and cautious epitome of the positive evils resulting from Usury Laws , which he has enumerated . Upon a common-sense view of the question , most men would be inclined to agree with Mr. Bentham , that his five propositions embraced every rational ground of argument upon the affirmative side , and that his argument upon those points , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to serious consideration , and hence the reader is naturally led to anticipate a close and searching argument in reply to Mr. Bentham , upon those plain and definite propositions , and also that 8orne disposition will be made of the positive evils he has pointed out ; and he can not but be surprised at the summary manner in which the author disposes of Mr. Bentham and all his propositions and arguments . It is on this wise , " Had Mr. Bentham taken the pains to understand and state the reasons upon which these laws really are founded , and to overthrow those reasons as successfully as he has the cob-house of his own imagination , he might have been indulged in a little sentiment of this sort . But to steer clear from the beginning to the end of his book , of the sole questions upon 1 watch the policy or expediency of such restraints depend , and then to end with a poetical triumph of this sort , is a liberty which , perhaps , no other man but Jeremy Bentham would have indulged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we proceed , that Mr. Whip*le does not attempt to depend the Usury Laws upon any one of the hypothesis instituted by Mr. Bentham . All these he regards as the cob-houses of Mr. Bentharn 's imagination , and admits that he has successfully demolished them . What , then , are the reasons upon which these laws really are founded ? // Mr. Whipple answers the question thus : " The policy and expediency of Usury Laws must depend mainly , if not entirely , upon two questions : " 1 st . Supposing the parties to stand on equal terms , and the bargains which they make to be , in general , perfectly fair as between themselves , is it , or is it not for the interest of the public to allow money to he converted into merchandize , and bought and sold at any price the parties may chose to stipulate ? " 2d . Do the parties , in general , meet on equal terms , and are the bargains , in the absence of Usury Laws , as fair as bargains usually are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says the author , " involve , substantially , all the other questions that relate to Usury Laws . " Had the writer stated his questions a little more intelligibly , and confined himself ; for a single page at a time , to the discussion of either one of them , the task of the reviewer would have been comparatively easy . As it is , both the meaning of his questions , and to which of the two many of his arguments are intended to apply , must be a matter of conjecture . As he maintains the negative of both questions , we may consider the first as equivalent to the assertion , that the repeal of the Usury Laws would be injurious to the public , and the second , that it would be injurious to individual borrowers . I. The author maintains that it is not for the interest of the public " to allow money to be converted into merchandize , and bought and sold at any price the parties may choose to stipulate ; " and he frankly admits , that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then one of the reasons which have been supposed to exist , is removed . " How money could be converted into merchandize , in the common acceptation of the term , except by exchanging it for merehandize , or in what manner the repeal of the Usury Laws would bring about such a result , the author does not attempt to show . If his meaning is that , by allowing money to be bought and sold , like any other thing , it would thereby become a sort of merchandize , it is time he were informed that , independently of Usury Laws , money is and always was , and will always continue to be , just that sort of merchandize which he supposes it will become if the Usury Laws are abolished . A man at all acquainted with the nature of money , and the laws which control its operations , would need no further evidence that the author 's ideas of currency were anything but clear and definite . Commodities in general may be bought and sold for a time , but their ultimate destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that its ultimate destiny is to be 6ought and sold . This is the sole object of its creation , and , as money , it is the only use that can be made of it . As good a definition , perhaps , as can be given of money is , that it is that commodity ( whatever may be its material ) which is permanently devoted to being bought and sold in exchange for other things . Whether it should be " bought and sold at any price the parties may choose to stipulate , " or not , it is certain that it always has been , ( with rare exceptions , ) from the day that Abraham and Ephraim agreed upon the price of a certain field , to the present time , and probably will continue to be . The price of money is the value of whatever it is sold for . For governments to fix the value of everything for which money is sold , would be impossible , and to attempt it would be absurd . I condude , // therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow money to become the subject of unrestrained traffic like any other article , " and , consequently , according to the author 's own terms , " one of the reasons which have been supposed to exist " is removed . But , peradventure , Mr. Whipple may tell us that by " buying and selling " money , he means borrowing and lending , and that by the " price " of money , he means the interest or rent paid for its use . If this were his meaning , he should have said so , and not obscured his subject and misled his readers , by speaking of one class of transactions in terms which apply exclusively to another and an entirely different class of transactions . If a man had hired a horse to ride ten miles , and paid one dollar for his use , it would be a singular method of stating the fact , to say that he had bought a horse for one dollar . With this understanding of the author s meaning , the plain statement of his first question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be loaned upon any terms the parties may choose to stipulate ? The decision of this question he thinks must depend upon the following contingencies " If such a freedom from restraint would inevitably increase the average rates of interest , it would be a serious evil to the community . If its tendency should be to reduce the rates below what they formerly were when the Usury Laws remained in force , it would be a blessing . " He seems to regard these as little short of self-evident propositions ,  - -  at least he does not attempt to prove them . Before proceeding to a discussion of these propositions , the reader should be apprised of the kind of reasoning with which Mr. Whipple desires to be met . He says " Let them , however , convince us by facts and experience . I object to the whole mass of their theories . Scarcely any two of them agree in those theories . The writers denominate these artificial rules , the science of political , that is , national economy . Why not furnish us with a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite as useful as the other . The science of prudence , I suppose , would come next , a subject quite as reducible to rules as economy . The truth is , that literary men of all ages have had some predominant hobby . At one time the science of Astrology ruled mankind . Next comes Metaphysics , which employed the pens of the ablest men of its age . This science is now agreed to deal pretty much in moonshine , and has gone , with its fellow-science , Astrology , to the tomb of the Capulets . Next comes Political Economy , which had its day , though a brief one . We now find it low down in the western horizon , Phrenology over our heads , and Animal Magnetism about an hour high in the east . What will come next , no one can guess . Come what will , for one , I shall not abandon the wisdom and experience of mankind very hastily , especially in relation to a question so nearly touching the safety of property in general as the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents thus explicitly not to approach his arguments with truths , and demanded that they should be tested by facts , we should have some hope of convincing him , that in making the assumptions he has in regard to high and low rates of interest , he has not quite reached the bottom of his subject . Facts may be valuable auxiliaries to an argument , if we can establish their connection with their alleged causes , and not otherwise ; and this connection can // only be established by an intelligent perception of truths and princ*ples . I shall not , therefore , regard very scrupulously the foregoing injunction , but endeavor to bring the questions at issue to the test of truths , as well as facts . Political economy , which the author not only scouts from the circle of the sciences , but from the sphere of useful knowledge , would , if it had been consulted , have helped him somewhat in maintaining his assumption , that whatever tends to lower the rates of interest is advantageous to the public , and it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of interest was the result of natural causes , and noP*of legal restraint . It does teach that the downward tendency of the average net profits on capital is indicative of increasing wealth in the country where the phenomenon may occur , because that downward tendency is the effect of increasing competition of capital with capital , which could not take place without an increase of capital . But it does not teach that the public is benefited by whatever tends to reduce the profits of capital employed in any one pursuit , below the average rate of profits or capital otherwise employed . Mr. Whipple inquires whether there can be any doubt that high rates of interest are injurious to the public ! The correct answer to this question must depend upon what he considers high rates . If he alludes only to relative rates , the question is too indefinite to admit of a categorical answer ; for , of two supposed rates , the higher one may or may not be a public evil . If we admit the assumption , that of any two supposable rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil , we must admit that any rate of interest , however low , is a public evil , for we can not imagine a rate of interest so low but it might be still lower . If there is any justice in receiving any interest whatever for the use of money , it is as easy to conceive of a rate which would be too low , as of one which would be too high . If it is just to receive interest or rent for money at all , there must be some reason why it is just , and the rate of interest must be limited , in both directions , by the reason in which it is founded , and we must search for that reason . That the productive agent has a permanent and exclusive right to the avails of his industry , is a truth which but few will be bold enough to deny . The surplus products of individual industry constitute individual capital , and this capital is capable of aiding the industry of its owner , and contributing to further production . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute a right as he has to the capital itself and if he relinquishes those advantages for the benefit of another , he is entitled to a compensation corresponding to the additional profit he might have derived from employing that capital himself . This furnishes a clue to an equitable average rate of interest , which is the average net profit on capital employed in the various departments of industry . By net profits should be understood , the profits which remain after paying for the labor , skill and talent , whether of the owner of the capital , or those employed by him , engaged in aiding and directing , and all other expenses incident to its productive operations . He who loans his capital to another , is justly entitled to the same income from it , that he might have derived from employing it himself after paying himself for his own agency connected with it such compensatiou as similar services would command ; or , to vary the example , he is entitled to the same // income in the form of interest , which he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had placed it in a joint-stock association engaged in manufacture or any other pursuit ,  --  his own agency , in either case , being little more than to make the investment and receive the income . This profit he will have , as a general rule , or he will not loan his capital . Anything , therefore , which tends to raise the ordinary rate of interest above the ordinary rate of net profits in capital , is a public evil , because it abstracts a portion of the reward naturally due to industry , and adds it to that which is naturally due to capital , and so discourages industry . So , on the other hand , whatever tends to depress the ordinary rate of interest below the ordinary net profit on capital , is a public evil , because it abstracts so much from the reward naturally due to th' capital , and adds it to the reward naturally due to industry , and so , to the extent of its influence , discourages the production of capital , and especially the employing of it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cripples the productive energies of both capital and labor by keeping them apart , and not only so , but tends to a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few , by preventing the enterprising poor from becoming wealthy , as in numerous instances they do , by the use , in the start , of borrowed capital . There is , then , such a thing as an equitable average rate of interest , dependent upon the average rate of net profits ; and any average rate of interest , either above or below that , is a public evil . Had Mr. Whipple been on speaking terms with the principles of political economy , he might have derived from the foregoing considerations a much better argument in support of Usury Laws than any he has produced ; for that same science which he ranks with astrology and mesmerism , demonstrates that there is a constant and strong tendency among the various branches of industry to an equilibrium of profits , and that average profits are not subject to very frequent nor extensive fluctuations ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausibility , the propriety of fixing the rate of interest at the average net profit on capital , as nearly as that could be ascertained . If it is granted that a uniform rate should be established by law for all times , places , and circumstances in which the law is to take effect , all , upon due reflection , will agree that it should be fixed at the average net profit on capital within the same limits . The necessity of a uniform rate , in the absence of an agreement between the parties , is generally conceded . But the legislator is liable to commit egregious errors in carrying the restriction even thus far . New states are always settled by emigrants from the older ones , who are naturally prejudiced in favor of the laws and institutions to which they have been accustomed , and they frequently adopt the laws of their native country or state , with too little regard to their adaptation to the new circumstances and influences with which they are to stand connected ; and the migrations of interest laws furnishes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest laws from England as they did their weights and measures , and they have been carried from state to state , with but slight modifications , throughout the republic ; and generally without reference to any rule except that such was the per cent . in their native states . The legitimate results of these blunders have been felt in a greater or less degree by the earlier settlers of all the states ; but most // severely in those which possessed the greatest internal resources , and which have settled the most rapidly , in the extreme difficulty with which money could be obtained evea upon the best security . This difficulty has usually been attributed to a scarcity of capital . This is doubtless one cause of the trouble ; but another plain and obvious cause has been , that the ordinary net profit on capital has been so far above the legal rates of interest , that those who had capital could do better than to loan it at all at those rates . Another ill effect of fixing the legal rate of interest below the net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no agreement has been made between the parties , is , that if one man gets into another 's debt by ordinary deal , it furnishes an inducement to the debtor to be slack concerning his promise  --  to avoid payment as long as possible-because he is paying less interest than he is receiving in profits on the amount due . Business men in the West have seen this principle operate , not always to their satisfaction ; and eastern merchants may have suffered some delay , occasionally , from the operation of the same principle , without ever finding out the precise nature of the " mislbrtune . " Instances have occurred in which men have paid seven per cent , on their debts , and the costs of a law-suit besides , and made money at that . We shall be better prepared to appreciate the impropriety of fixing an uniform rate of interest , ( except for cases in which no agreement has been made , ) even at the average net profit on capital , if we consider the variations to which those profits are subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profits between the different pursuits in which capital is employed , yet they are , by no means , absolutely equal . 1st . At the same place the profits on capital will be greater when it is scarce , than when it is abundant , just as labor will be higher when laborers are few , ceteris pari6us , than when they are many . That competition has a tendency to reduce profits , is so far within the scope of observation , and so generally admitted , that the mere statement of the proposition is sufficient . 2nd . They are different at different places , at the same time . This follows in part , from the fi*st proposition , as capital may be more abundant , at the same time , in one place than another , but not from that circumstance alone . The resources of our country , or a particular section of the same country , may offer a larger reward , both to labor and capital , than another , while the hardships , privations and risks to be encountered in reaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , if not permanently , a sufficient competition , either in labor or capital , to reduce the profits of either to the common level . The rapid settlement of the new western states , and the cultivation of their millions of acres of rich soil , and the consequent rapid growth of towns and cities , and the prodigious strides by which the value of real estate , both in town and country , has advanced towards maturity , have afforded returns , and , in some of the more recently settled states , still afford returns to both labor and capital , which could not be realized in a country which had acquired a greater degree of maturity . Certain latitudes also afford greater remunerating profits , both to industry and capital , than others . The great productiveness of the lower latitudes , and the high estimation in which the products of those regions are held , afford greater natural inducements to both labor and capital , // than are usually found in the higher latitudes ; and yet such is the risk of life and health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor flows to them in sufficient abundance to reduce profits to the common level in more healthful climes . 3rd . The profits on capital differ , under different circumstances , at the same time and place . Investments which afford but temporary employment for capital , must offer larger profits than those which give permanent employment , or capital will not be diverted to them . The reason for this is found in the inconveniences and loss of time incident to frequent changes in the modes of employing capital , or repeated acts of investment . Employments which call for capital in small amounts must , in general , offer larger inducements , per centum , than those which call for it in larger quantities . The reason of this is , that he who has any considerable amount of capital will be content with a somewhat smaller income from it if he can keep it together , than he will if it is to be divided and scattered . The various employments which occupy capital must , in order to attract it equally , afford profits proportioned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , must afford extraordinary profits , or it will be abandoned . So potent is this principle , that an attentive observer will find it , in nice gradations , pervading all the business affairs of men . The foregoing are among the most prominent and permanent influences which vary the net profits of capital . When all the influences which tend to raise profits combine , they produce the maximum rate ; and when those combine which tend to reduce profits , the minimum rate is the result . We find , then , that the rule or criterion by which alone the equitable rate of interest can be determined , varies widely , at different places , at different times , and under different circumstances . If the net profit on capital is the only criterion by which we can determine what is and what is not an equitable rate of interest , and those profits are subject to the variations which have been pointed out , it would seem to be a logical conclusion that the equitable rate of interest must be as variable as the criterion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that an equitable uniform rate of interest is impossible . The same influences which have been enumerated operate equally upon capital in the loan market , as upon capital seeking an investment in any other way . If the peculiarities of a particular section of country , or a particular period of time , afford extraordinary net profits , they will as certainly demand extraordinary rates of interest . And there is no injustice in the demand ; for the net profit , whatever it may be , is the reward naturally due to capital for the agency it exerts in production . Labor and capital are partners in the production of wealth . The proportion of the product which belongs to labor is determined by the operation of principles which can not be elucidated in the present essay . It is sufficient for the present argument to arrive at a clear perception of the truth ; whatever that proportion may be , or however it may fluctuate , it is just as equitable in the case of capital loaned , as it is in any other case ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or capital will leave the loan market and seek investment elsewhere . The legislature might as well enact that one man should not labor for a certain man for more than fifty cents per day , and leave him at liberty to work for a hundred other men at any price he and they could agree upon , any one of whom would give him a dollar a day , as to enact that capital // loaned shall receive a profit of only six per cent. , while there are a hundred other ways in which it may be employed at a net profit of twelve per cent . The effect of every such attempt , if it has any effect at all , must inevitably be to drive capital from the loan market . It will have the same profit then , legally or illegally , that it can get elsewhere , or elsewhere it will go . What then shall we think of Mr. Whipple , when in reply to Mr. Bentham , he says : - " I believe it was never before pretended that Usury Laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from borrowing ! " The author seems to suppose that there is just so much money which must be loaned , or lie idle ! He does not seem to comprehend the simple truth , that it is capital which is loaned , and that in being loaned it only assumes , for the moment , the form of money , in order that the borrower may , by a single act of exchange , get the borrowed capital in the precise form in which he wants it , and that the ordinary quantity of money in circulation has really nothing to do with determining the quantity of capital in the loan market . The intelligent reader must by this time be convinced , that of two supposable average rates of interest , the higher one is not necessarily injurious to the public , and that an uniform rate of interest , however nicely adjusted to average net profits , can not be equitable in all cases . But the law of supply and demand , acting on the loan market , determines the actual average rate of interest , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even under the varying influences I have pointed out , and a little attention to this law , may enable us the better to estimate the validity of those objections to the flee principles which are drawn from the extreme highest rate . The general operation of this law is concisely stated by Mr. Mill as follows : " The rate of interest will be such as to equalize the demand for loans with the supply of them . It will be such , that exactly as much as some people are desirous to borrow at that rate , others shall be willing to lend . If there is more offered than demanded , interest will fall ; if more is demanded than offered , interest will rise ; and in both cases , to the point at which the equation of supply and demand is established . " - ( Mill 's Pol . , Economy , vol. ii. , chap . 23* ) The average rate of interest thus established can not vary very widely from an average equitable rate , because both the motive which prompts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are regulated by the actual net profit on capital . The borrower can not afi*rd to pay more than the net profit , and will not , except in extreme cases of necessity arising out of embarrassed circumstances , which cases are rare , and constitute but a small portion of the demand ; and the lender can not afford to take less than the ordinary net profit , and will not , except in extreme cases of indolence or inability to employ his own capital , which cases are also rare , and furnish but a small portion of the supply . Still these extremes do exist , and affect in some degree the average rate of interest , and to prevent the higher extreme , is one of the main objects of Usury Laws , which will be examined in reply to Mr. Whipple 's second inquiry . The limits I have assigned to this essay will not permit me to follow Mr. Whipple through all the errors and absurdities he has evolved under this head . I will only quote his own summary of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He says // " I have attempted to show that it ( money ) is unlike merchandise in the following essential features : " 1st . That money is the creation of government-merchandise of individual industry . Its origin is therefore different . " Money , I must be permitted to say , is not the creation of government in any sense which should or can exempt it from the operation of the same laws of trade which affect other commodities . Gold and silver are dug out of the earth by the labor of individuals , just like iron and copper , and for many ages they were used by common consent , as money , and passed by weight . Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver as damages for detaining his wife . In payment for a certain field , " Abraham weighed to Ephron four hundred shekels of silver , current money with the merchant , " at a time when governments did not exist , except in the patriarchal form . The coinage of money was of comparative late date among the Persians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the reign of Darius , the son of Hystaspes ; nor had the Greeks ( whom the Romans most probably imitated ) any before the time of Alexander . We have no certain vestiges of the existence of coined money among the Egyptians , before the Ptolemies ; nor had the Hebrews any coinage until the government of Judas Maccabeus , to whom Antiochus Sidetes , King of Syria , granted the privilege of coining his own money in Judea . Before these respective times , all payments were made by weight . " - (Horne 's mt. , vol. iii. , part 4 , chap . 7 . ) Yet money existed long before these periods , as the product of private industry , and by the spontaneous laws of trade . In coining money , the government has created nothing . It has only taken the currency as it was , and reduced it to a more convenient form ; and the only advantage in having even this done by the government instead of private individuals , is , that every one may have the faith of the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in weight and purity , what it purports to be . Bullion possesses all the essential qualities of money , and possesses about the same value by weight , and is subject to the same laws of trade as coin , and no sane man will pretend that the owner has not as absolute a right over the one as the other ; for with the slight difference of the expense of coining , they are alike the product of individual industry , as much so as iron or anything else . " 2nd . That the object of the government in creating money was a currency for the convenience of all ; whereas the object of the product of individual industry is the advantage of the individual alone . " It has already been shown that gold and silver are as really the product of individual industry as iron or wheat . As value is the essential property of money , and as that exists in the metal before the government touches it , it is unnecessary to discuss the object of government in doing what it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That the title of an individual to merchandise is absolute , the public having no interest in it . But that his title to a portion of the currency is qualified , he having no legal , at least no moral right to prevent the object of its creation . "
