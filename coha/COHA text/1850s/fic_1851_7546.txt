Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : TO SARAH , ON HER BIRTHDAY . from To Sarah 1851 1 So light with airy grace your form , 2 So wildly bright your eye , 3 And oh ! so eloquently warm 4 Your young cheek 's changing dye ! 5 I guess a fairy godmother 6 Watched o'er your cradle bed , 7 And round your pillow charmed gifts 8 Of grace and beauty shed . 9 For Time , that aye from other cheeks 10 Their glowing bloom is stealing , 11 On yours still blends the flower of youth 12 With the rare rose of feeling .
