Higginson , Thomas Wentworth , 1823-1911 : THE LOVERS . from The lovers ( 1853 ) I I watch their mien of trembling joy , Their glance , with timid secrets laden : He is a rosy village boy , And she a graceful village maiden . His proud look hints , her blushes tell , What bliss begins when school-time closes ; He shielded her when snowflakes fell , And now ' t is almost time for roses . Have lips yet given voice to heart ? I know not  --  but each day shows clearer How conscious blushes draw apart The steps resistless Love draws nearer . Their world is changed ; historic names For her are shrunk to merest zero ; And poet-loves and novel-fames Are poor beside the living hero . For him  --  all sweets of earth and air , The softest breath of soft May morning , Too coarse , too harsh , too common are To match that girlish beauty 's dawning . The walk upon enchanted ground ; The school , the street , are lands elysian ; A song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision . O Teacher , sage ! in vain you pore O'er black-boards wide , with science laden ; The blindfold boy lends deeper lore To village youth and village maiden . O Time ! secure these children 's dreams From ills that darken and destroy us , And make life all that now it seems , As full , as fresh , as pure , as joyous . II . How soft the May-time hours steal on ; The merry school girls laugh and call ; Sweet sing the birds ; elm-blossoms fall ; The violets come ; but he is gone . Those steps that each to each did cling , Are parted by a wider space ; And long from that slight girlish face Has autumn dried the tears of spring . How calmly flows the tide of time O'er all the wealth of smiles and dreams , And its forgotten beauty seems To live but in my careless rhyme . Yet not in grief the end is told , Death closed the tale and left it pure , With no dark chances to endure Of withered joys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died When those clear eyes were closed to earth , And what now dreams and deeds had birth When the new mystery opened wide ! And in her heart may yet be room . Where one dim memory has remained , The thought of one brief love unstained , To tinge an aimless life with bloom . O Time ! thou followest close upon The prayers of our presumptuous hours ; ' T is well thou gatherest in thy flowers Ere the frail bloom grows sick and wan .
