ART . VJ. - L*fe and Character of the REV . SYLVESTER JUDD . Boston : Crosby , Nichols , &amp; Co. 18*4. l2mo. pp. *31 . UNDER the date of November 4 , 1844 , is the following note by Mr. Judd : " I finished my book last Friday . I have written on it till my hand is stiff , my eyes are sore , and my back aches . It has taken every leisure moment . I have not written a line to father , mother , brother , or sister , these months . I was resolved to finish that before I did anything else . " In regard to the design of this work he says : " It would give body and soul to the divine elements of Christianity . It aims to subject bigotry , cant , pharisaisin , and all intolerance . Its basis is Christ ; him it would restore to the Church , him it would develop in the soul , him it would enthrone in the world . " In the book itself is the following passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying prostrate under the Butternut . His Cross , too , had fallen , and the flowers were withered . I am weary , ' said he ; I have no place to lay my head . I am a stranger in the world , and no one takes me in ; I am sick and no one visits me. lIy heart aches , Margaret . My locks are wet with the dews of the night . I was bruised for their iniquities , but they are iniqnitous still . From Calvary I have xvandered over the earth . From age to age I have been an outcast . ' Explain to me , Anna , what do these things mean ? Have Christians treated Christ so badly * Tell me , what is the significance of this distress * The Gospels are the Word of Christ , as he was the Word of God . Before the Gospels Christ was . He shines through them . They stand in him , like the Apocalyptic angel in the sun . " Such was the central idea and feeling pervading the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its accessories . " In its retrospective aspect , " said the author to a friend , " it seeks to preserve some reminiscences of the age of our immediate fathers , thereby describing a period of which we have no enduring monuments , and one the traces of which are fast evanescing . The book makes a large account of nature , the birds and flowers , for the sake of giv // ing greater individuality to , and bringing into stronger relief , that which the religious mind passes over too loosely and vaguely . It is a New England book , and is designed to embody the features and improve the character of our own favored region . " The book thus referred to and described was " Margaret , a Tale of the Real and the Ideal , " first published about ten years ago , and received with impressions almost as various as were the minds of those who perused it . The prevailing sentiment , however , was , that it was the work of a man of genius , but of one so whimsical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not utterly to destroy , his influence for good . His affectations , conceits , and occasional coarseness of conception and expression , were thought entirely to conceal any deep and settled purpose , if indeed the author really had any such purpose at heart . In due time , from the same source , and marked by the same family features , there appeared a poem , called " Philo , an Evangeliad , " and " Richard Edney and the Governor 's Family , a Rus-urban Tale . " In January , 1853 , the Rev. Sylvester Judd , the author of these works , died in Augusta , Maine , where , for more than twelve years , with remarkable fidelity and success , he had been filling the office and performing the duties which he loved beyond all others , those of a Christian minister . He was born in Westhampton , Massachusetts ; spent his earliest years amid the wild and beautiful scenery there ; in Northampton received while yet a child strong religious impressions which never left him ; worked his way up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; went through mental struggles infinitely more severe , which resulted in a radical change of theological views ; entered the Divinity School at Cambridge , where he completed his preparatory theological education ; and in October , 1840 , was settled in the ministry at Augusta , where he continued till his death . Soon after entering college he drew up a remarkable paper , called " Consecration , " for his own private use , to be read " considerately and prayerfully , at least once a week . " " This act of consecration , " he said , " is to be in force to-day , to-morrow , next 36 // year , while I live , in death , and after death ,  --  to all eternity . " And few are they who in youth have set before themselves so high a standard , or who through life have been more faithful to the vows of their youth . He had , as both his biography and his writings prove , marked peculiarities of mind and character . But they who through the memoir are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how childlike in its simplicity his life was , how lofty and how single were his aims , and how thoroughly devoted he was to the highest interests of man and the advaticement of Christ 's kingdom on earth . When we have once seen him as he was in his family , and in his relations to the religious society with which he was connected , we know better how to appreciate and enjoy his writings , which we can not but regard as in their department among the richest , most original , and most valuable contributions that have been made to our peculiarly American literature . For peculiarly American they are . Our American woods and fields , our New England social institutions and habits , our religious antecedents , and , growing out of them , the present condition of religious thought and feeling among us , alone could have formed such writings , and given them their peculiar coloring and flavor . In a letter from Northampton he exclaims : " What beauty there is in this valley of the Connecticut , and particularly in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so magnificent , a beauty , I never beheld . It seems more like our ideas of the tropical regions . When I walk out , I seem not to be walking , but wading , in the midst of beauty , with seas of it about me , and waves of it rising above me . The shrubbery here , the gardens , the shade-trees , the walks , are unsurpassed . I am amidst the scenes of my youth ; and there are many changes . The change is great in the material world : it is greater in the human world . My early friends are all gone , elderly people that I used to know are dead , and those whom I meet know not Joseph . ' " I have been into the graveyard . There are the old familiar names ; there are recalled the old familiar faces ; there , in that silence , is clustered much of what was once life to me . Amidst the beauty of which I speak , and under the shadows of those grand old elms , seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pervaded with the recollection of a past generation . " - p. 219 . Here we see how the finer influences of nature associated themselves with all that was dearest to him . From New York he writes : " It the city is not agreeable to me . It is a dreadful impersonation of human life ; nothing real , nothing common , but a vast , hungry shadow of things . To meet so many people whom you never saw , between whom and yourself is such a chasm , - t is horrible . " But among his own people he moved with the easy familiarity of a child , the purity and zeal of a saint , and the dignity of a priest . His eccentricities sometimes found their way even into the pulpit . During the Mexican war , in 1847 , when the annual Thanksgiving occurred , so fully was his mind impressed with the horrors of the war and its attendant train of evils , - " that he could not summon his feelings to utter the voice of joy and thanksgiving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaffected contrition in behalf of the nation fell from his lips , and dcprccations of justly-merited national punishment found an earnest voice . On rising at the usual time for sermon , he opened the Bible at the Lamentations of Jeremiah ; and then , with paleness of face and trembling voice , he uttered with deep pathos the moanings of the old prophet over the sins and desolations of his beloved country , and then dismissed the congregation . " - p. 211 . In his public ministrations there was a rare intensity of feeling , and such a readiness to sacrifice himself to the cause of religion , that , when on one occasion he said , " I would willingly lay myself in the grave , if , by so doing , I could accomplish this , " every one knew that he was thoroughly in earnest in what he said . " He often became so pale and trembling from his own emotion , as scarcely to be able to utter the afflictive thoughts that pressed upon his heart . " Nothing could be more touching or impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; have I followed them onward in youth ; have I been throwing , so to say , my parental arms about them , and shedding my parental heart over them ; and are they imagining they have nothing to do with religion , or the Church , or God , in whose name I have // acted , and whose spirit has ever been , or ought to have been , working through me ? " " I have been here long enough to see changes ; and among them have been the removal of our youths , by marriage , for business , or whatever the cause may have been . Others still are going off . Will the young man who leaves us , who goes to distant countries , whose home shall be on the wide sea , - will that young man remember us , and the hearts that love him , and the Church that prays for him ? " " Standing on the eminence I now do , I seem to see the narrow horizon of our mortality extending away , and merging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling up this steep of the Divine Unity , myriads of the human race , on their way to the seats of eternal blessedness , growing out of this unity of heaven and earth ; I seem to see heaven encompassing earth , and seeking to irradiate our pilgrimage , and to breathe into our imperfect life some of its own loveliness and beauty . " Mr. Judd was very deeply interested in the subject of baptism . " He talked about it with individuals personally , and alluded to it often from the pulpit . He was successful in moving the hearts of parents in this matter , and of many adults who had not received baptism ; and the Sabbath of June 11 he nppointed for the administration of the ordinance to all such in the congregation as were willing to come forward for the purpose . On this day he made a strong appeal upon the subject to his hearers ; and then , with fearful heart , lest many of his beloved ones should still withhold themselves or their children , he invited all who had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of families , one after another , stepping into the aisle , and drawing near the altar with their groups of children , and some adults coining forth alone , his heart was almost too deeply moved to utter its burden of joy and thanks , and implore appropriate blessings on those about to receive the seal of oneness with the visible Church , and , as lie hoped , with the great Church , invisible and catholic , throughout heaven and earth . And , when he descended from the pulpit to the baptismal basin , and proceeded to baptize in the name of the Father , . and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , ' - in some instances , first a parent and then the children , and , last of all , his own little ones , the weight of his emotions almost overpowered him , and his voice wellnigh failed in proflouncing the many-times repeated formula . Mr. Judd felt that a good // work was begun , and rejoiced in this evidence that his labors had not been in vain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a new house which he had been building . " His first thought , after getting well settled , was to have a consecration of its freshness to his people . A. general invitation was publicly given to every member of his congregation to visit him on Thanksgiving evening . The verandas and every window of the cottage being illuminated , a beautifully attractive and welcome aspect was presented to his people as they approached . On entering , they found the study - which was the largest apartment , and the room of rcception - adorned with evergreens , and , in the midst , their loving pastor , with deep and tender emotion beaming from his countenance . In another room was spread a sumptuous repast , furnished by the guests themselves . " In the latter part of the evening , Mr. Judd gathered all to the study , and tiure , with a trembling voice , and feelings almost too strong for control , spoke to his people in a most familiar and heart-felt manner . He acknowledged that his cares in the erection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He begged their pardon for any neglect , but at the same time assured them , that the labor had been in part for them ; that that study was for the better preparation of spiritual food for them ; that theirs it was for familiar resort to their pastor at any time ; that the verandas were for them to sit under , the walks to promenade in at their pleasure , and the arbors for their children to sport in . He told them he felt that all these comforts would tend to make him more entirely theirs . And , in conclusion , he baptized his new domicile , as concecrated to them , under the name of Christ Church Parsonage , and then closed the evening with fervent prayer for himself and them in their mutual relations . " - pp. 208 , 209 . And this brings us to his domestic relations . Few young men , on going into the world , cherish so long and so fervently the feelings which bind them to their paternal home . Long after he had left it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter he got from home , and hardly dared to break the seal . " " In a Thanksgiving sermon , of which the subject is Home , ' this passage occurs - We can be free there . We can throw off the dress of the street and the manners of society . A man is not obliged to // conceal his headache , and he can give vent to his own feelings , when he enters his house . One is not a merchant or a doctor or a lawyer at home . There is one place in the world where even a clergyman can be a boy again ; and that is his father 's house . His father calls him by his first name , and his mother asks him to bring in an armful of wood . There is throwing off of care , and rejection of conventionality , at home , and yielding one 's self to nature , and slippers , and loose gown . ' " - p. 472 . The following is from an entry made in his private journal , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has found its mate . My tomb-life is broken ; my real life enjoyed . My heart is happy ; my purposes free ; my future certain ; my aspirations are at rest . I am tranquil now . I fret not ; I forebode nothing . Chiefly , ever , and for ever , I thank thee , 0 my God ! Every good and perfect gift cometh from thee ; and J. thou hast given me . I give to thee my supreme gratitude , my overflowing thankfulness . I consecrate my love , myself ; my all , to thee . From thee I received her , to thee I give her . From thee I received my heart , to thee I give it . All is thine ! all is mine ! From thee I would not for a moment be separated . In thee I would be united with all I love . Take us to thyself ; to thy own bosom , to thy own love , unworthy , weak , and sinful as we are . In thee alone are we holy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we dare to live . With thee our love is a holy flame . Bless us , we pray thee , now and evermore . " - p. 488 . " The planning and building of his cottage-residence , and the embellishment of his small grounds , was to Mr. Judd a very pleasant thing . But it was the idea of a kome , - one constructed according to his own taste and convenience ; one around which should cluster fondest memories , dearest associations , and which should become a cherished spot to his children , - it was this which gave him the chief delight . It was to him a very interesting problem , with given means and essential comforts , to produce the most pleasing effects . " - p. 494 . " The house commands an unbroken view of the Kennebec for the distance of a mile in a southerly direction . The principal part of the town of Augusta lies in full view , amphitheatre-like , on the opposite or western side of the river , its various church-spires pointing upwards to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand , the Capitol , and , on the other , the marble tablets of the cemetery for the dead ; and , crowning all , the sun-setting horizon , with its undulating outline and woody summits . // " And this was the home which to Mr. Judd was so precious , to which he sent letters almost daily when absent , and of which lie says : My heart turns to it with eagerness , and fondly settles on the objects of my love there , - my wife and my children I shall leave for home , - blessed , longed-for home , - to-morrow morning . ' It is this which he looks out from , and , with as much truth as beauty , paints in Richard Edney , ' where he says : A tale is like this June morning , when I am now writing . I hear from my open windows the singing of birds , the rumble of a stage-coach , and the blacksmith 's anvil . The water glides prettily through elms and willows . There are deep shadows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple-trees , glows in the sunlight , as if it belonged to some other realm of being The dew , early this morning , covered the world with topazes and rainbows , and my child got her feet wet in the midst of the glory . Through gully and orchard , basement-windows and oriels , shade and sheen , vibrates a delicious breeze . Over all hangs the sun ; down upon the village looks that eye of infinite blessedness , and into the scene , *that urn of exhaustless beauty pours beauty . ' " - pp. 495 , 496 . We have given these glimpses of Mr. Judd in his parish and his home , as explaining better than anything that we could say the spirit and design of his writings . He longed to do whatever lay in his power to make home and all its relations attractive , to make life holy and beautiful , to make Christ and his religion , and especially his Church , living and divine agencies in the world , removing social wrongs and individual sins , bringing men into a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with one another . His idea of the intimate connection of God with all his works , the low , the neglected , and the unsightly not less than the dignified , the honored , and the beautiful , pervaded all his feelings , controlled his tastes , and led to many of the peculiarities which have stood in the way of his popularity as a writer of fiction . With him every work of God was good . For this reason he looked on everything in nature as beautiful . " Nature , " he said , " is not shocked at toads* ' ; and as nature is not , no more ought we to be . Therefore it is that his works abound in what to most readers are incongruous and discordant images . The effect of his finest passages is marred , and , in reading aloud pages of extraordinary beauty and elevation of sentiment clothed in fitting language , we // sometimes meet expressions which we should be glad to omit . But to leave out these homely phrases and metaphors would have been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste as an offence against conscience . His mission was to give interest and dignity to the lowly . To exclude burdocks and toads from the pleasant companionship of natural objects , he would have deemed an offence almost like that of driving a way a ragged child from the merry gatherings of young people which delighted him so much . Except sin , there was nothing to him " common or unclean . " He extended a hospitable welcome to every object in nature . That which was despised and rejected of men had , on that account , a special title to his sympathy . He could not desert it , but felt hound to assert its claims , to place it in its rightful position , and to show by so placing it how it contributed to the general effect . Even a homely , neglected , half-forgotten word had something of the same force in its appeal to his sympathies . He could not make up his mind to cast it off , but gave it a quiet shelter in his rich and ample vocabulary . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images and words , by their awkward look and gait , betray their want of familiarity with the company into which they have been introduced . And though the master of the feast looks with a peculiarly benignant and complacent eye upon them , we confess that to us they do sometimes seriously disturb the harmony of the occasion . But while this is the cause of many of those characteristics of 1ir . Judd 's writings which have given offence to fastidious readers , and impaired their general popularity and influence , it is also , to no small extent , the source of his peculiar excellences . It brings him closely and genially into contact with natural objects . Nothing is too minute to escape his notice , or too lowly to find a place in his affections . He therefore takes us into the very heart of nature . The breath of the woods is round us ; their deep solitude , their individual occupants in all their native wildness and grotesqueness of form or sound , are before us . We recognize the voice of each separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the crushing of the mosses under our feet . No American // writer surpasses Mr. Judd , we know of no one who equals him , in the lifelike delineatioi* , or rather in the fresh creation , of natural scenery and events . His are not so much pictures of nature placed before us , as scenes and incidents through which we are actually carried . No one , not even Mr. Emerson , has led us through such snow-storms as are made to visit us in " Margaret " and " Richard Edney . " They are just such storms as we knew in our childhood , and call back to us the thoughts and pleasant longings of those early days . " The storm had a good many plans and purposes of action . It riddled the apple-trees ; it threw up its embankments against the fences ; it fell soft and even upon shrubs and flowers in the woods , as if it were tenderly burying its dead ; it brought out the farmer , to defend his herds against it ; it stirred the pluck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and laughed at it with their faces ; and , as if to spite this , it turned upon an unprotected female , a dress-maker , going home from her daily task , and twisted her hood and snatched off her shawl ; but , failing in the attempt to rend her entire dress to pieces , it blinded her with its gusts , and pitched her into the gutter . " Everywhere there is this blending of human interests with natural objects and incidents . Their mutual relations and interdependence are constantly recognized . Man , in all his vicissitudes of life , thought , and emotion , lends something of a human interest to the outward world which environs him , and Nature , even in her hardest moods , softens the violence of human passion , and broods tenderly over the affections and the griefs of her children . We do not know that even Wordsworth , in his Excursion , has brought out this sentiment more successfully than Mr. Judd . Margaret is herself a part of the landscape . The sky is more beautiful because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . And if she is thrown among coarse , violent , and drunken men , if she is persecuted and made more than ever an outcast by the wellmeant mistakes or the malignant hypocrisy and spiritual pride of another class of associates , we always feel that her love of Nature , her sympathy with whatever is grand or beautiful around her , must , like a pure shrine in which her spirit dwells , * preserve her from contagion . Yet we are never allowed to suppose that nature is all . A // higher element is recognized as needful for the soul 's culture . We are always made to feel that , without the Gospel of Christ , Nature would be robbed of her highest power for good . The child can not come to herself , or accomplish her work , except under its guidance . Nature , hardly less than man , needs to be redeemed from its wearisome bondage by the Son of God , before its highest influences can go forth . This tone of sentiment pervades almost every page of Mr. Judd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something of an optimist . Whatever of evil may be active around us is felt to have some good purpose in the end . " Dust , " he says , " sometimes falls with the purest snow , discoloring the face of Winter , but it enriches the growth and enhances the beauty of Spring . Will it not be so in our spring ? " " Richard was deeply religious , and he knew God said to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; and he felt that Divine Providence cared for the lilies of the field in their decay as well as in their bloom ; and that a ceaseless Benignity was covering the beds where they lay with the lovely raiment of the season , and cherishing in the cold ground the juices that should , after a brief interval , spring forth again , and create a gladsome resurrection of nature . " It is not often that we find a beautiful thought more beautifully expressed . The following is of a different sort , but stands , perhaps , in its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the solution of the great problem which has puzzled philosophers from the time when men first began to think of the origin of evil . " They visited a washerwoman , who cared more for others than herself , and seemed to absorb in her own family all the dirt she took from the world at large . " Without presuming to hint at a hidden wisdom here which the writer never thought of , or to aver that , because there must be dirt somewhere , therefore there must be evil in the world , we would venture good-naturedly to commend the passage to the consideration of some of our world-reformers , and to certain classes of " unco ' guid " people and village gossips , who are too much taken up with the faults of others to regard their own . If Mr. Judd carries us into the midst of external nature , // and makes us feel the presence of natural objects in all the freshness and vividness of actual life , with something of a tender human interest superadded , - if from his love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiplies them around us , calling each one by its individual name , lingering perhaps with peculiar fondness over a plant that has little to commend it to us , - so in his human characters and incidents there is the same love of nature , the same vivid pictorial faculty , the same gentle appreciation of what is retiring and modest , the same hearty sympathy with whatever is genuine in thought or life . He has not the dramatic power or the keen and easy humor of Mrs. Stowe , but his characters have a clearly defined individuality . They are of flesh and blood , flexible in their movements , with electric currents of feeling and passion . They live so in the heart of nature , that it sometimes is difficult to say whether they are a part of the landscape , or the landscape a portion of their being ; as it is sometimes not easy to say which is most real , the image of the sky in the still waters below , or the sky itself , " bending , Narcissus-like , over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animated part of the tree itself , and , once seen , enters into all our thoughts of it afterwards , so Margaret and the scenes with which her young life was connected make one united whole . Take , for example , the child as she sits under a clump of white birches on the border of the solitary pond . " The shadows of the trees refreshingly invested her , the waves struck musically upon the rocks , and in the clear air her own thoughts sped like a breath away ; the vivacity of the birds was qualified by the advance of the day , and while she had been delighted at first with what she saw , all things now subsided into harmony with what she felt . " Where does the child 's life end , and that of the objects around her begin ? Or are they mutually blended in one , all outward influences , sights , and sounds lending themselves to her , and harmonizing with her spirit , while her thoughts spread them selves out over the water , through the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul animates the body with its own life ? In King Lear , the angry heavens , the violence and terrific rage of the storm , are but a part of the overmastering hu // man passion that tyrannizes over the whole scene . So in Macbeth , as commentators have often shown , the air that " Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses , " harmonizes with the feelings of the unsuspecting king who has come to be murdered by his host . And when the deed is done , the terrific darkness of the night adds its horrors to the occasion . " Ah , good father , Thou seest , the heavens , as troubled with man 's act , Threaten his bloody stage . " No writer , unless it be Homer , has ever approached Shakespeare in the quickness with which he catches the slight , impalpable , but subtile and powerful sympathies between man and nature . It is this that lends such indescribable sweetness to the little snatches of song which he has thrown into some of his plays , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This faculty , we think , Mr. Judd has to a remarkable degree . His fault is in carrying the process out too minutely , and continuing it too long . It is often better to strike a note or two , and leave the mind to carry on the emotions thus awakened , or rather to be carried on by them , than to play note by note the whole air . In this Shakespeare is as unrivalled as in his mastery over every other mode of acting on the human passions . But it is not fair to institute such comparisons . Mr. Judd 's characters are living men , women , and especially children . We love to meet them , to hear them talk , and to see them act . We are interested in whatever concerns them . If , in the latter half of Margaret , the discussions on moral or aesthetic subjects sometimes seem a little wearisome to us , in our impatience to know what is coming next , - if in our walks we are sometimes too much retarded by being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the plants and flowers , birds and stones , in our path , - we shall find , on going through the book a second time , that the way will seem less tedious , and more pleasant , and the discussion not without // an object . There are few works of our day that let us more than this into a knowledge of the capacities of our nature , and none that lead us more pleasantly into an intimate acquaintance with what is most peculiar and most beautiful in our New England scenery , or with what is most beneficent and hopeful in the workings of our New England society . If its low life sometimes offends us as coarse and vulgar , we must remember that it does not , like similar scenes in Thackcray or Dickens , come to us softened by an intervening ocean of three thousand miles , and that the truthfulness which gives offence is what cbnstitutes its usefulness . Where , among the novel-writers of the present century , can we find a more felicitous portraiture , including the man and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Richard Edney ? And who will say that it is charged beyond what is allowable in works of the imagination ? " In the first place , Winkle knew everybody , and everything ; and every body and thing knew Winkle . He knew all the girls , and the school-children , and the old men , and the young men ; and bowed to them all , as he rode by , and they bowed to him . For forty miles , he knew where everybody lived , and who everybody was that lived anywhere . He knew the tall , white house on the hill , and the large house , with pillars in front , among the trees , and the little black house over in the field ; and there was always somebody standing by all the houses , to whom he bowed . Sometimes he bowed to the well-sweep that happened to move in the wind ; sometimes to a dog that sat on the doorsteps . How many smiling favors he got from the girls , who , after dinner , and after dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! how many from the children that swarmed about the schoolhouses ! In fact , everybody smiled and bowed when he passed , - black and hard-favored men ; muggy and obstinate men ; coarse and awkward men . Every day he had a sort of President 's tour . " Then , he pointed out the tree where a man hung himself and the woods where a bear was shot , and the barn that was struck by lightning , and the stream where a man was drowned . " And this , in the second place : because of his unbounded good-nature . He did errands for all those people ; he ran a sort of express to the city ; an express , too , from one neighborhood to another . Then , he did his errands so correctly , so promptly , and so genially . If those for whom he acted were poor , he charged but little . He knew every place 37 * // in Woodylin , and could exccute any order , from getting iron castings to purchasing gimp , and matching paper-hangings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of Winkle was seen - he ran express between Hearts . Nothing pleased him better than to have a love-case in hand between two persons on different parts of his route ; there was such a carrying of little notes , and little remember me 's , and little nods and signs ; and then he could drop a big bundle of tenderness in a single look , as he passed the sweetheart , hanging out the washing of a Monday morning . Then of the widow 's son , whom he carried to the city some five years before , and who had been all this time at sea , he got the first intelligence ; and as he walked his horses up a long hill , and the mother sat rocking and knitting by the road-side , he told her that her boy had been spoken off the Cape of Good Hope , or that his ship had been reported from Rio . When anybody was sick along the road he bore the daily intelligence to friends , who stood at their doors waiting for it ; by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect was instantaneous ; so , by an invisible , and , as it were , omnipotent hand , he dropped smiles and tears , joy and sorrow , wherever.he went ; and his own heart was so much in it all , none could help loving him . In addition , and notwithstanding Mr. St. John , he gave little gratuitous rides ; he let the boys hang on behind ; and in the winter we have heard of his taking up half a dozen school-children with their mistress , and helping them through snow-drifts . Then he carried the mail , which is itself a small universe in a leather bag ; - here sweet spring to some bleak and ice-bound soul , - at the next turn a black thunder-storm on some tranquil household ; - now singing at one corner of its mouth , as if it was full of Jenny Linds , - anon tromboning out its melancholy intelligence ; and , like a Leyden jar on wheels , giving everybody a shock as it passes , making some laugh and others scream . Winkle carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and some people , notwithstanding they loved him so , hardly dare see him , or have him open his mouth ; they did n't know , any more than Aunt Grint , what had happened , or what might happen . In addition , he brought people home ; and as he drove on , he got the first sight of the old roof and chimneys ; he got the first sight of the rosebushes and the lilacs in the yard ; he saw , too , from the quietness about the house , that a surprise was on hand ; he knew perfectly well that the daughter whom he was bringing was not expected ,  --  that she meant to surprise the old folks . He did not hurry his horses ; he did not make any sign . He landed the young lady at the gate , and was taking off the baggage , when he heard a scream in the door . lie had expected it all , and looked so sober , as he pulled at the strap , with one // foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Naughty , naughty Winkle ! ' cried the mother ; why did n't you tell us Susan was coming ? You have almost killed me . ' Winkle loved to kill people so . " - pp. 237-240 . Writings instinct with such life as this , pervaded everywhere by a genial , religious spirit , holding up the living present before us , reanimating the dead forms of the past , and unfolding a fairer and brighter future through the evolution of the higher elements that are at work in society , ought not to be allowed to perish from the memory of men . Nor can we believe that they will do so . A more intimate acquaintance with natural objects , and a more thoroughly Christian culture , will bring us into a closer intimacy with them , will cause their defects to seem less , and their excellences to shine with a richer lustre . Their influence over us will not , like that of common novels , vanish away as we close their pages , but , as with the intimacy between Evelina and Sally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it will stop ; " indeed , it will probably go on through this world into the next . " We have spoken more of Mr. Judd 's writings than of his biography , because in reading it they have been brought vividly before us ; and , reading them again , we have felt more than ever their power . The memoir is excellent . Like almost all works of its class , it would bear condensation . But it is the truthful portraiture , by one who knew him well , of a man of genius , of warm affections , of large and generous endowments and high aims , who passed through severe mental and moral conflicts , and who faithfully bore his testimony , and finished the work that was given him to do . We do not see how any one can read it without being made better by it . The " Life , " which in itself furnishes the best illustrations for such writings as " Margaret , " " Philo , " and " Richard Edney , " can be marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Judd , has done her part modestly , skilfully , and faithfully . Biography is sometimes made up of what the man has left behind , his formal words and acts , the clothes that he has worn out and thrown away ; and sometimes it contains all that was vital in him , - whatever of thought , aspiration , fear , hope , effort , and attainment // made him what he was , - a lifetime of thirty , sixty , or eighty years condensed into a volume , to instruct by its wisdom , encourage by its example , find its way to our hearts by its own quickening affections , and inspire us by its generous and lofty aims . Judged by this highest standard , the Life of Mr. Judd has great merit , and should find everywhere hearty welcome . Mr. Judd died on the 26th of January , 1852 . On that morning the announcement of the near approach of death was first made to him . He was at first much overcome by the intelligence . " He broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , " in piercing tones of anguish , 0 my God ! I love thee , - I love heaven , - I love its glories ! - but my dear brothers and sisters , - my parents , - my wsfe and children , - I love you ! - how can I ! how can I ! ' But he soon became quiet , as he had been before the announcement , although much exhausted by his emotions and his efforts to speak . I sang Majestic sweetness sits enthroned , ' and Allis well . ' J. read passages from the New Testament . His children were referred to ; but , too much overcome to bear more then , he said , Let the dear children come to-morrow , - little children come to-morrow , ' evidently not thinking his hour so near . He said to us who were about him , Cover me up warm , keep my utterance clear . ' He afterwards added , I 'm doing well , ' - and in a few moments , with but a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - p. 520 . " It was in the very last discourse he ever preached , that occur these words , so remarkable in their coincidence : Will it be you that shall next perform the last sad duties to the cold remains of your pastor ? ' - words whose resonance still seemed to linger among the Christmas evergreens that first received them , when , a few brief days afterwards , mingled with mourning weeds , was verified a sad response . " The Pastor , in Philo , ' too , utters the poet 's own heart-felt words , in saying : Above the gloomy grave our hope ascends , E'en as the moon above the silent mountains . These partings are reunions in the skies ; To that great company of holy oues Wego ; In shadowy void , betwixt two worlds , we stand ; The distant All-Light opes its wicker gate , The future beams auroral , flesh expires , The soul begins its perfect day . ' // " But earth was now left behind . Tender friends arranged for its last rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in apparen ( comfort upon his couch , as if in quiet , natural slumber . A winter rose lay by his side ; a simple circlet , twined by loving hands from his own fresh evergreens and house-geraniums , was the symbol of his pillow . No sound of preparation of funeral weeds disturbed the quiet scene ; no air of gloominess and dread was thrown around . Freely as when their father was ever ready to greet their entrance to that study with a welcome smile , the children passed in and out , but with a wistful gaze , a chastened cheerfulness , and tender foot-fall , that told their little hearts had saddened comprehension of the change . Mourning parishioners came in groups to look on that dear pastor 's tranquil face , - on that pale brow , still noble in its amplitude . " When the hour arrived to prepare for burial that lifeless form , no stranger hands were permitted to share the service ; but only those to whom in life it had been dearest now took part in this last sad office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that same silken robe in which he always stood before his people , now , alas ! in preparation for that silent service in which he was to appear before them . Placed in easy guise upon a simple lounge , the burial-case received within its snowy folds that gentle form . Sympathizing friends from his own and distant cities sent fresh , fragrant flowers he loved so well ; and these were placed upon his breast and pillow . And there he lay , wellnigh as lovely and attractive as in life . The children , as they came around , involuntarily exclaimed , How beautiful father looks ! ' " And thus was carried out his own idea , that , even in the house of deepest mourning , cheering symbols should bear witness that life goes not out in eternal darkness . " One by one , there gathered to this scene of sorrow - but all too late for even a parting recognition - each living member of his childhood 's home , save the devoted mother , whose feeble health precluded so long a journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solemn obsequies was the Sabbath morning , the hour on which he was always seen quitting his home , and so meekly wending his way to minister to his people . But now , after brieg fitting service , that unconscious form was borne along the avenue of pines and cedars which had grown up amid his companionship , adown the gravel walk familiar with his footstep , and through the gate of that tasteful , rustic fence inclosing his domicile , - the last work for its improvement he ever planned . The most ethereal of snow-flakes , at this moment , began slowly and solemnly to fall , on all its way to the house of God , curtaining around that funeral carriage with an emblem // of heaven 's own purity . At church , the profusion of Christmas greens still lent their decoration in strange yet pleasing contrast with the black drapery that had everywhere been blended . In front of that hallowed desk there hung a cedarn cross , that favorite sign ; and the communiontable beneath received its precious burden . Immediately around were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was densely filled , all denominations , testifying to the value of the man , the citizen ; and the stillness felt telling how deep the sense of loss . In touching tones , and with tender manner , the Rev. Mr. Waterston performed the funeral service , and , in beautiful yet discriminating remarks , showed forth his appreciation of his early friend . The choir chanted , in plaintive notes , those stanzas sung by the children in Philo ' : - " A SONG THEIR PASTOR TEACHES THEM . " 0 Love of God ! we seek to dwcll In love and God and thee ; The end of woes , the cad of sins , Shall love 's perfection be . " 0 Crucified ! we share thy cross ; Thy passion , too , sustain ; We die thy death , to live thy life , And rise with thee again . " 0 Glorified ! thy glory hrenks ; Our new-horn spirits sing ; Salvation cometh with the morn ; Hope spreads an heavenward wing . ' " And then , with bearers from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augmented by a long procession , recrossed the river beneath the arches of that old bridge so humorously set forth in Richard Edney , ' and moved onward to that beautifully secluded familytomb to which the pale sleeper 's first rural excursion on the eastern bank of the river had been made . Gathered beneath the funereal firs around , the mourning congregation and afflicted relatives took their last , sad , parting look at that dear face . At that moment , the clouds , which all day till then had shrouded the heavens , suddenly parted , and bright rays of sunlight , penetrating that open vault , illuminated its dark , mouldering depths ; or , - to close this history , penned with love , delight , and sorrow , mingled in varying hues , in his own beautiful words , descriptive of a like occasion , and striking in their coincidence with the present scene , - " As the relics were conveyed into the tomb , the clouds broke away // in the heavens ; a bland light diffused itself over the seventies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coloring , in that blue break of the skies . How fair an induction to the final rest !
