Reviews and Literary Notices . REVIEWS AND LITERARY NOTICES . A New History of the conquest of Mexico . In which Las Casas ' Denunciations of the Popular Historians of that War are fully vindicated . By ROBERT ANDREsox WILson , Counsellor at Law ; Author of " Mexico and its Religion , " etc . Philadelphia : James Challen &amp; Son . Boston : Crosby , Nichols , &amp; Co. ( sEconD nOTIcE . ) AccoxDIn* to the well-authenticated legend of the martyrdom of Saint Lawrence , the Saint , as he lay upon the gridiron , conscious that he had been sufficiently done on one side , begged the cooks . if it were a matter of indifference to them , to turn him on the other . Common humanity demanded compliance with so reasonable a request . We fancy that we hear Mr. Wilson preferring a similar petition ; and we hope we are too goodnatured to be insensible to the appeal . We can not , at this moment , indeed , think of him otherwise than good-naturedly . With many things in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the novelty , and the variety of his blunders have given us a very favorable impression of his ingenuity , and have afforded us constant entertainment in what we feared was to be a drudgery and a task . We had intended to cull some of these beauties for the amusement of our readers and the personal gratification of Mr. Wilson himself . But , as children , gathering shells on the sea-shore , resign , one after another , the treasures which they have collected , and grasp at newer , and , therefore , more pleasing specimens , which are abandoned in their turn , so we , finding our stores accumulate beyond our means of transportation , and tantalized by a richness that made the task of selection an impossible one , have been forced to relinquish the prize and come away with empty hands . If there be , in the compass of what the author calls " these volumes , " - though to us , perhaps from inability to distinguish between unity and duality , his work appears to be comprised in a single tome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelt , a punctuation-mark rightly placed , a fact clearly and accurately stated , or an argument that is not capable of an easy reduction to the absurd , we have not been so unfortunate as to discover it . Mr. Wilson is a man who , to use Carlyle 's favorite expression , has " swallowed all formulas . " The principles that have generally been held to govern the use of language appear to him mere arbitrary rules , invented by the " sevenfold censorship " and the Spanish Inquisition , for the purpose of preventing the free communication of ideas . All such trammels he rejects ; and , accordingly , we have to thank him , so far as mere style is concerned , for an uninterrupted flow of pleasure in the perusal of his book , adorned as it is with " graces " that are very far indeed " beyond the reach of Art . " We come now to those important quesfions which Mr. Wilson was not , indeed , the first to agitate , but which he has awakened from their profound slumbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages of the " North American Review . " We are not to be tempted into writing another " New History of the Conquest of Mexico but we shall endeavor to state with clearness those points on which the world has had the temerity to differ from the " high authorities " we have named . It has been , then , commonly asserted , and is , we fear , by the great mass of our readers still superstitiously believed , that , at the time of the discovery of this continent , there existed , in certain portions of it , nations not wholly barbarous , and yet not civilized , according to our notions of that term ,  --  nations which had regular governments and systems of polity , many correct notions in regard to morals , and some acquaintance with Art and with the refinements of life  --  but which were yet , in a great measure , ignorant of the true principles of science , little skilled in mechanics , and addicted to the practice of idolatrous rites . This assertion would seem to have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these nations are said to have existed lie within the tropics ; and it is a well-established principle , that a genial climate , a fertile soil , the consequent facilities for obtaining a subsistence , and the stimulus thus given to the increase of population , are the first 1859. // elements of an advance from * savage to a civilized state , of the abandonment of rude freedom and nomadic habits , and ef the development of a regular social system . This principle is clearly set forth and elaborately illustrated hy Mr. Buckle ; and we the more readily refer to this author , because he stands high in the esteem of Mr. Wilson , who , in order to prove his own especial fitness for historical composition , and the incompetence of all who have preceded him in the attempt , refers to a passage in Buckle , containing an enumeration of the qualifications which he considers ' indispensable for the historian . This enumeration includes all the attainments that have ever been in the common possession of the human family . Mr. Buckle remarks , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these qualifications , another historian has lacked others of them . Mr. Wilson states that " each and every writers ' who has preceded him has lacked them all . Mr. Buckle , by implication , excepts one person , as uniting in himself all the qualifications , he demands . Mr. Wilson thinks he is the exception ; hut we are quite sure that the exception intended by the author was-Henry Thomas Buckle . In the Old World , civilization , as all admit , had its origin in tropical regions . Across the whole extent of the Eastern Continent , races are found inhabiting the warmer latitudes , which are now , or formerly were , in what is popularly called a semi-civilized condition . No one , we believe , has ever heen foolish enough to account for this fact by supposing that a single people or tribe , having attained some degree of culture , bad diffused the germs of knowledge over so large a portion of the globe . Chinese civilization differs almost as much from that of Ilindostan as from that of England or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Euphrates , and the Egyptian on the borders of the Nile . What is remarkable in these and in all the other cases that might be cited is , that in those regions civilization never reached the high point which it has attained in other parts of the world , less favored at the outset ; that it exhibited a grotesque union of refined ideas and strangely artificial institutions , with customs , manners , and creeds that seem to the European May , mind abhorrent and ridiculous ; and that , the internal impulse with which it started having been exhausted , it either remained stationary , without further development , or sank into decay , or fell before the hostile attacks of races that had never yielded to its influence . Now the civilization which is described as having once existed in America exhibits these general characteristics , while it has , like each of the others , its own peculiar traits . If the discoverers had made a different report , we might have been led to suppose that some such state of things as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arrival . Mr. Wilson , however , does not reason in this manner . lie has found , from his own observation , - the only source of knowledge , if such it can be called , on which he is willing to place much reliance , - that  --  the Ojibways and Iroquois are savages , and he rightly argues that their ancestors must have been savages . From these premises , without any process of reasonin* , he leaps at once to the conclusion , that in no part of America could the aboriginal inhabitants ever have lived in any other than a savage state . Hence he tells us , that , in all statements regarding them , everything " must be rejected that is inconsistent with wellestablished Indian traits . " The ancient Mexican empire was , according to his showing , nothing more than one of those confederacies of tribes with which the reader of early New England history is perfectly familiar . The far-famed city of Mexico was " an Indian village of the first class , " - such , we may hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Massasaugus , where , to his immense astonishment , he found the people " clothed , and in their right minds . " The Aztecs , he argues , could not have built temples , for the Iroquois do not build temples . The Aztecs could not have been idolaters or offered up human sacrifices , for the Iroquois are not idolaters and do not offer up human sacrifices . The Aztecs could not have been addicted to cannibalism , for the Iroquois never eat human flesh , unless driven to it by hunger . This is what Mr. Wilson means by the " American standpoint " ; and those who adopt his views may consider the whole question settled without any debate . // But there are some slight difficulties to be overcome , before we can embrace these ' views . Putting human testimony aside , there are witnesses of the past that still give their evidence to the fact , that parts of this continent were once inhabited by races who had other pursuits besides hunting and fishing , and whose ideas and manners differed widely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ruined cities , defaced temples , broken statues ,  --  relics such as on the Eastern Continent , from the Straits of Gibraltar to the shores of the Ganges , mark the sites of fallen empires and extinct civilizations , - relics such as we should have expected , from a-priori reasoning , to meet with in the corresponding latitudes of the New World ,  --  lie scattered through their whole extent , proclaiming themselves the works of men who lived in settled communities and under regular forms of government , who had some knowledge of architecture and some rude notions of the beautiful and the sublime , who had strong feelings and vivid conceptions in regard to the agency of supernal powers in the control of human affairs , but who clothed their conceptions in uncouth forms , and worshipped their deities with absurd and debasing rites . Some of these remains being known to Mr. Wilson , on the evidence of the only pair of eyes in the universe which , in his estimation , have the faculty of seeing , be can not treat them , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spanish priests and lying chroniclers . How , then , does he account ter them l He unfolds a theory on the subject , which he has stolen from the " monkish chroniclers** whom he treats with so much contempt , and which has long ago been exploded and set aside . Re tells us , that these relics have no connection with the history of the American Aborigines ,  --  that they have a diffhrent origin and a far greater antiqulty ,  --  that they are proofs , not to be gainsaid , of the discovery of this continent , at a very early date , by Phumician adventurers , and of the establishment , in the regions where they are found , of Photnician colonies . These ruins , he tells us , were Photnician temples , these statues are the representations of Photnician gods . In the comparison of facts by which he endeavors to support this theory , we have been surprised to find him admitting the testimony of other explorers . But they are , it seems , reluctant witnesses . Their inferences from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . " Proving our case , " he says , " by such testimony , we have admitted their statenient of fact , only rejecting their conclusions . " Their proper business , it would appear , was to amass the materials which our author alone was competent to use . He encountered , indeed , a solitary difficulty ; but this , in the most astonishing manner , has been removed . " Thus far , " he writes , " had we carried the argument , but had here been compelled to stop , for want of further evidence ; and the very stereotype plate that at first occupied this page , expressed our regrets that we were not able more completely to identify the Palenque statue as Hercules . At our publishers ' , however , the eyes of that distinguished Orientalist , the Rev. Mr. Osborn , chanced to fall upon a proof of the American goddess in the fourth note to this chapter , which he at once recognized as Astarte , represented according to an antique pattern . Her head-dress , he insisted* was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crescent , the prototype of that worn by Diana of the Ephesians , and so too , he insisted , was her necklace of two rows . ' " Thus the chain of evidence was complete , and , for once , Mr. Wilson derived assistance from eyes not placed in his own head . But , whatever distinguished Orientalists may say , undistinguished Occidentalists may be pardoned for inquiring when it was that this stream of Photnician emigration flowed to the American shores , in what manner such an enormous body of colonists as the hypothesis necessarily sup . poses were conveyed hither , and what has become of their descendants . With an uncommon indulgence to our weakness of faith , Mr. Wilson condescends to meet these obvious questions . The time he can not exactly fix ; but it was " thousands of years ago , " - " before the time of Moses . " To the query in regard to the means of conveyance , he answers , that at that remote period sailing ships were in common use ,  --  as is proved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were afterwards superseded by galleys propelled by oars alone . The reason assigned by Mr. Wilson for this change // makes a valuable addition to the stores of Biblical commentary . " The Greeks , " he says , " appear to have been selected from their imitative powers , to perpetuate such of the arts and civilization of the elder world , as were to be preserved from that decree of extermination , pronounced by the Almighty against its nations . Goatmet-ce had been the chief cause of the total demoralization of antiquity , and of this , they were permitted to j*reserve only a boat navigation . " Coeval with the decline of commerce and the extermination of sailing ships was the cessation of this Phtieniclan emigration to America . The colonists , having no longer any communication with the mother country , soon dwindled away and perished , in accordance with a well-known law of Nature . " Extinction is the doom of every immigrant population in an uncongenial climate ( habitat ) when migration ceases to keep up and renew the original stock . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country various causes have been assigned for the recognized delicacy , which is steadily advancing in what may be called the pure American . The growing smallness of the hands and feet , the shortening of the jawhones , the diminution in the number of the teeth and their rapid decay , are matters of daily comment . " In like manner , the Caucasian race is melting away in the colonies of Great Britain , in South Africa , Australia , and the West Indies . " In these uniform consequences the most obtuse can not fail to recognise the operation of a universal law , whose primary effects are to diminish migration , and whose ultimate results are the extinction of the exotic population . " We suppose none of our readers are obtuse enough not to be aware of the gradual shortening of their jawbonus , a phenomenon especially noticeable in members of Congress and popular lecturers . As for the diminution in the number of our teeth , and their rapid decay , we need , alas ! no Wilson to remind us of these melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the Aztec civilization having been thus disposed of by Mr. Wilson , we come now to his treatment of the written and traditional testimony , the accounts that have been handed down to us of the Spanish conquest of Mexico , and of the condition of the country at the time when that conquest was made . Mr. Wilson opens his " Chapter Preliminary " with the statement , that , " in this work , the standard Spanish authorities have been followed as long as they followed the truth . " This declaration excited , we confess , painful misgivings in our mind ; for , if Mr. XVilson was already in possession of the truth , independently of historical research , - whether by communications from the spirits of the ( ion quistadores , or by any other of the easy and popular metliods of solving obscure problems , - what need was there of his consulting the standard authorities at all But we were somewhat cheered , when , a little farther on , we found him stating , that the writer who enters into these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it will not do to denounce in general terms the venerable precedents ? so constantly quoted by our annalists , " but that " their defects and their errors must he shown in detail . " For it does appear to us , that , if a great historical question is to be opened , - if a series of extraordinary events , hitherto believed by the world to have really happened , are to be denounced as fabulous , - if numerous writers , whose statements and relations have been regarded in the main as worthy of credit , are now to be rejected as liars and impostors-it is indispensable that the works containing these relations should be carefully examined , that the statements should be compared and subjected to the severest scrutiny , and that the refutation should proceed , step by step , inch by inch , over the whole field of debate . Has Mr. Wilson taken this course l Has he met with clear and resolute argument the accounts which he denounces as " fabrications " l Has he diligently and carefully examined the " standard Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " l Has he read all the works in question l lies he eaer seen them ? We may divide these works into three classes ,  --  uot with reference to their different degrees of merit and importance , but as regards their accessibility and the relative ease with which they may be consulted . The first class comprises two or three works which have been translated into English ; and these translations may be procured with facility and read by any one who has some acquaintance with the // English language , though not acquainted with any other . In the second class we may place a considerable number of works which have been published indeed , but only in the original Spanish , or , in a few instances , in French or Italian translations . Some of them are rare , and difficult to meet with ; others may be found in several of our best libraries . The third class embraces relations and documents which have never been translated , which have never been published , of which the originals repose in the Spanish archives at Simancas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded , in Mexico or Madrid , and of which the only copies known to exist in this country are in the collection formed , with so much trouble and at so great cost , by Mr. Prescott . Now the writings which come under our first category Mr. Wilson has both seen and read ,  --  to what purpose and with what profit we shall hereafter show . The publications comprised in the second class we feel very confident he has never read . The manuscripts , which come under the last head , we are morally certain he has never seen . That he has not seen them is capable of the strongest proof , short of absolute demonstration . That he had no acquaintance with Mr. Prescott 's collection is a matter within our personal knowledge . Had he been in a position to obtain copies for himself , and had he availed himself of that circumstance , he would not have failed to proclaim the fact in his loudest and shrillest tones . Nor does he pretend that he has ever visited Spain , and had access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have ventured upon such a step . He tells us , that , " besides the reasons already given for distrusting the correctness of Spanish statements , there is another , more secret in character , but not less potent than all combined-fear of incurring the displeasure of that tribunal which punished unbelief with fire , torture , and confiscation . " If Mr. Wilson , as his language implies , stands in fear of " fire , torture , an ( l confiscation , " and if this is his most potent reason for distrusting the correctness of Spanish statements , we can readily understand why he should have chosen to remain on his native soil and write the history of the Conquest of Mexico from " the American stand-point . " Lastly , Mr. Wilson makes no allusions to matter contained in the manuscripts which had not been reproduced in the pages of Prescott . He is careful , indeed , to tell us very little of the contents of these works ; but he talks about them with the most gratifying candor , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's History of the Peruvian Incas altogether surpasses that of Dr. Johnson 's Rasselas and the Happy Valley . " The history of Dr. Johnson 's " Rasselas " is related , we believe , by Boswell . The great moralist composed his beautiful and philosophical , but somewhat gloomy romance , in the evenings of a single week , in order to obtain the means of defraying the expenses of his mother 's funeral . The story is a touching one ; but Mr. Wilson 's comparison is so inapt , that we can not help suspecting him of having had in his mind , not the history of Johnson 's " Rasselas , " but Johnson 's history of Rasselas . We think it rather hard , that , having , in general , such a limited amount of meaning to express , Mr. Wilson should have followed the maxim of Talleyrand , and employed language chiefly as a means of concealing his thoughts . Mr. Wilson nowhere asserts , in so many words , that lie has had access to manuscript authorities . His mode of speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently intends that this inference should be drawn by his readers . In a printed note , addressed to his publishers , diselaiming any intention of " assailing the memory of the dead , "  --  a disclaimer which was not needed to suggest the reason why his book , loaded with typographical blunders , was hurried through the press , *-he " insists on the lawyer 's privilege of sifting the evidence  --  a labor which Mr. Prescott was incapable of performing , from a physical infirmity " ; and he undertakes to prove that Mr. Prescott 's " books and manuscripts were not reliable authorities . " Now even " the lawyer 's privilege " does not extend to sifting evidence which he has never heard ; and if Mr. Prescott was to Author , compositor , and proof-reader were evidently engaged in a " stampede , " the ( Printer 's ) Devil having strict orders to make seizure of the hindmost . Part of a Spanish poem , borrowed , without acknowledgment , from Prescott , seems to have gone to " pie " on the imposing-stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " incapable , from a physical infirmity , " of properly scrutinizing his authorities , it was the more necessary that Mr. Wilson , with his own wonderful eyes , should undertake the task . There is one manuscript which he might he supposed to have had a strong desire to examine . His hook professes to he a vindication of " Las Casas ' denunciations of the popular historians " of the Conquest . The work of Las Casas , supposed to contain these denunciations , is his History of the Indies . Mr. Wilson acknowledges that he has never seen this work ; it has , he says , " been wholly suppressed " ; and he is terribly severe on the censorship and the Inquisition for having been guilty of this suppression . But the only suppression in the case is , that the book has never been printed . The original manuscript may he consulted at Madrid . A copy of the most important parts of it is in Mr. Prescott 's collection . Mr. Wilson might have seen that copy , had he expressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trouble ; and we think be was right . The truth is , that , of all the Spanish historians of the Conquest of Mexico , Las Casas is the one who has indulged most largely in hyperbole . Writing , with little personal knowledge , in support of a theory which required him to magnify the ruin accomplished by the Conquistadores , he has exaggerated the population of the Mexican empire , the number and size of its towns , and the evidences of its civilization . It was on this very account that Navarrete , who examined the work with a view to its publication , came to the decision not to print it . We have little doubt as to the propriety of that decision ; and Mr. Wilson , we think , also did well in stickin , , to Cass and " suppressing " Las Casas. te Mr. Wilson would have been less unfortunate , if he could have " suppressed " the work of Mr. Gallatin to which he has the effrontery to refer as an authority for his ridiculous assertion , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention . As Mr. Gallatin 's essay is within the reach of any of our readers who may he inclined to consult it we shall content ourselves with a single remark on the subject . That learned writer , who had made a real and thorough study of the Mexican civilization , ( having obtained from Mr. Prescott the books necessary for the purpose , ) was so far from denying that hieroglyphical painting was uracusen by the Our reason for believing that Mr. Wilson has never read the works , relating to his subject , which have been published only in the original Spanish or in translations into other foreign languages , is a very simple one . He produces no evidence that he has ever read them . Some of them he does not even mention . From none of them does he glean a single fact that was not ready to his hand in the pages of Prescott . Except in two or three instances , where he filches a reference from the citations made by the latter historian , he brings forward no statement contained in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to refute theirs . Why did he take from Prescott  --  to whom on* this occasion he confesses his indebtedness  --  the facts in relation to the early life of Cort*s , ( we would he had borrowed the language as well as the matter ! ) if he had himself the means of consulting the works from which Prescott 's account was derived l But it is unnecessary to pursue the argument ; Mr. Wilson acknowledges that he knows nothing of the works in question . " For our purpose , " he writes , " the standard histories of the conquest might as well be blank paper . " We believe him ; but had his purpose been , not " to denounce in general terms the venerable precedents so constantly quoted by our annalists , but to show their defects and their errors in detail , " he would hardly have used them , as he has done , as mere wadding for the great gun which he was loading , and which has exploded with such terrible effect . His objection to the " stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ecclesiastics , royal historiographers ,  --  that they wrote under the eye of the Inquisition and the censorship . Like objections would apply to the whole field of Spanish history . The reigns of Ferdinand and Isabella , Charles the Fifth , and Philip the Second must , therefore , be as fabulous as the conquests of MexAztecs , or that authentic copies , and even actual specimens of it , have been preserved , that he himself constructed a Mexican chronology which has no other foundation than these same picture-writings . There is one remark in Mr. Gallatin 's work on which Mr. Wilson would have done wisely to ponder . It is this : - " The conquest of Mexico is an important event in the history of man . Air . Prescott has ea'heusted the subject . " // ico and Peru . Accordingly , Mr. Wilson , when he wishes to study the history of Spain , declines to have recourse to Spanish writers . He goes to writers of other countries , and has a very natural preference for such as speak the English tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Encyclopudia Britannica , " hut usually cited hy Mr. Wilson , in an off-hand and familiar way , as " Britannica , " he draws much upon a treasure of his own discovery , " a ponderous folio " of the seventeenth century , written in English hy one Grimshaw , and containing a full and veritable history of Spain from the earliest epochs . He makes much of Grimshaw , styling him " our chronicler . " fle pats the volume fondly , and calls it " my old folio , " - just as Mr. Collier pats and fondles his celebrated old folio . To judge from some specimens which Mr. Wilson gives us , the venerable Grimshaw can not have the merit of being very easy of comprehension . Here is an extract , just as we find it " About the year 756 , at which time there were great troops of Turks beginne to disperse themselves over all Armenia , the which did overrunne and spoil the Sarrazin 's country . " And here is another " Over common , then , in Spain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that this sinue is at this day more in use than ever it was , to the dishonor of our God , contempt of his laws , and confusion of all good order . " Apparently , Mr. Wilson , besides writing in a singular style himself , is the cause of singularities in the writings of other men . What is more worthy of note is the credulity with which lie swallows the fabulous inventions of the " monkish chroniclers " when set before him in English earthenware . We would undertake , for a very trifling consideration , to furnish him with the Spanish originals of the stories of " Hispan " and " Hercules , " and all the other absurdities with which his old folio has supplied him . From what source does he imagine them to have been derived Does lie think they belong to the stock of traditions in possession of the Anglo-Saxon race ,  --  that Grimshaw got them from Bagshaw , and Bagshaw from Bradshaw * Our argument in regard to Mr. Wilson 's ignorance of most of the " standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works which he actually has used ,  --  or , to speak more correctly , misused ,  --  and an examination of his reasons for selecting them . They are two in number . He can hardly be said to overrate the importance of one of these works ,  - -  the celebrated Letters of Cort5s . For the events of the Conquest , and the first impressions made upon the minds of the discoverers by the aspect of the country , we could have no evidence of equal value with the dispatches written by the great adventurer from the field of his enterprises and during the course of the operations . Mr. Wilson does not , however , consult the original letters . His strong prejudice against everything Spanish would not allow him to do so . He has studied them through the medium of a translation ; and the reason he assigns for his preference of this version is , that " it is better than the original . " We *ave no doubt that it is better for Mr. Wilson 's " purpose " ; indeed , we fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the translator , Mr. George Folsom , the letters of Cort*s would , like " most of the standard histories , " have been regarded by Mr. Wilson as " no better than so much blank paper . " Lockhart , by translating I*he chronicle of Bernal Diaz , has saved it from similar condemnation ,  --  but only that it might incur a still more terrible fate . Mr. Wilson 's theory in regard to the origin and character of this work is no less subtile than startling . According to the common belieg Bernal Diaz was a soldier in the army of Corhis , accompanied him throughout his campaigns , arid , at a late period of his life , composed a narrative of the memorable events in which he had participated as an actor or an eye-witness . Writers who knew him in his old age have left us descriptions of his appearance and character . Mr. Wilson , however , holds that he never existed . The chronicle which bears the name is , according to him , a work of fiction , written by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conquest of Mexico , but who had no personal knowledge of the scene in which his story is laid . What first excited Mr. Wilson 's suspicions was the charming simplicity and apparent truthfulness which , in common with all readers of Bernal Diaz , he has found to be the distinguishing char. // acteristics of the narrative . " A striking feature , " he tells us , " in Spanish literature , is the plausibility with which it has carried a fictitious narrative through its most minute details , completely captivating the uninitiated . If its supporters were not permitted to write truth , they succeeded in getting up a most excellent imitation . In Bernal Diaz the alleged individual affairs of private soldiers are so artfully interwoven with the general history as to give the effect of truth to the whole . There being no fear of contradiction , this practice of inventing familiar details cotild be indulged in to any extent , while the beauty and simplicity of such a style fixes at once the doubting . " " Ah ! si Moliere avait connu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partridge , a mere unsophisticated booby , thought simplicity the characteristic of Nature , and therefore out of place in Art . Mr. Wilson , a transcendental Partridge , thinks simplicity the characteristic of Art , and therefore out of place in Nature . He is more than ordinarily severe on Mr. Prescott for not havin , , detected in Bernal Diaz these " striking marks of the count rfeit instead of the common soldier . " " We differ , " he says , " decidedly from Mr. Prescott . " The difference seems to he , that Prescott regarded the appearance of truthfulness in the narrative of Bernal Diaz as primd facie evidence of its truthfulness , while Mr. Wilson regards the same appearance as the most complete evidence of its untruthfulness . But we have been anxious to discover some more definite and substantial grounds for Mr. Wilson 's hypothesis . In a couple of closely-printed pages , devoted to the subject , he asks himself again and again , the questions ,  --  " Who , then , was Bernal Diaz " - " Who , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extract any reply from the singular individual to whom these queries are addressed , he winds up with the solemn and emphatic declaration , " On the evidence hereafter to be presented , we have with much deliberation concluded to denounce Bernal Diaz as a myth . " For the evidence here promised we have searched with a patience of investigation which , if applied to the problem of perpetual motion or squaring the circle , could not , we humbly think , have been wholly unproductive ; and these are the results . " The author of Bernal Diaz ' says the march to Jalapa was accomplished in one day ;  --  a proof that he never saw the country . . . . Cortez makes the ascent the work of three days , and says he did not reach Sienchimalen until the fourth day . " The main discrepancy here is Mr. Wilson 's own handiwork , as he has confounded the " Sienchimalen " of Cort*s with Jalapa , instead of identifying it with the " Socochima " of I3ernal iDiaz . But so far as there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark , in explanation of it , that Bernal Diaz professes to have written many years after the events which he narrates , and at a distance from the scene , while the letters of Cort*s were written in the country , and while the events were taking place . On another occasion , Bernal Diaz represents the Tiascalans as complaining that they could " get no cotton for their clothing . " " If this writer , " says Mr. Wilson , " had really been acquainted with the tribes of the table-land , he must have known that the fibres of the maguey were , among them , substitutes for that article , and are even now used at the city of Jexico in the manufacture of some fine fabrics . " We do not see how I3ernal Diaz could be expected to know that the fibres of the maguey are now used in Mexican manufactures ; neither can we comprehend how his statement , that the Tlascalans had no cotton , is at variance with Mr. Wilson 's assertion , that they used the nzaqney as a substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , writing for the " uninitiated , " might prefer to speak of cotton , for which he had a Spanish word , rather than enter into explanations in regard to an Indian substitute for cotton , resembling it in appearance ; while it is not easy to believe , on Mr. Wilson 's hare assertion , that an article in common use throughout the Valley of Mexico was wholly unknown to the inhabitants of the table-land . These , and , so far as we can discover , these alone , are the proofs on which Mr. Wilson convicts Bernal Diaz of being a nonentity , - of having , like Rosalind in " As you like it , " merely " counterfeited to be a man . " As a natural sequitur to this delicious train of reasoning , he proceeds to take this nonentity , this " myth , " as his guide throughout the narrative of the Conquest . " We may safely follow Diaz , " // he remarks , " in unimportant particulars " ; and the " particulars " of the Conquest being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally " unimportant , " he is so far consistent in following Diaz throughout . Surely the Grecian fables-will never grow old ; here again we have blind Polyphemus groping in pursuit of cunning Ohrtg . But we must he allowed to ask Mr. Wilson why he has not rather preferred to take Goniara as his guide . It is true that he entertains a strong loathing , a rooted aversion , for this harmless old chronicler , whom he calls always " Gomora , " - assodating him , apparently , by some confusion of ideas , with the ancient city of bad fame , buried with Sodom beneath the waters of the Dead Sea . But , at least , he does not deny that Gomara had an actual existence , that he was a veritable somebody ,  --  a reality , and not a " myth , " - that he was the chaplain of Cort*s , that he had access to the papers of the great commander , that he wrote a history of the Conquest , and that this history is still extant . Mr. Wilson himself asserts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomora are the only original documents touching the Conquest of Mexico , its people , its civilization , its difficulties , and its dangers . " After this declaration , it is somewhat remarkable , that , throughout his narrative of the Conquest , while continually quoting from Diaz , lie makes not a single reference to Gomara ; and he even censures Mr. Prescott for having l ) ursued a different course . How shall we explain this fact Alas for Gomara ! he wrote in his native Castilian , no Lockhart or Folsom had done him into English , and so he missed his chance of having his statements cited , and , possibly even , - though we should not like to hazard an assertion on this point ,  - -  of having his name correctly spelt , by the author of the " New History of the Conquest of Mexico . " It remains only that we should notice , as briefly as possible , the use which Mr. Wilson has made of his two authorities , the translations of Bernal Diaz and Cort*s , which , rejecting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his narrative . That narrative is constructed on a plan which , we venture to say , is without a parallel in literature . Like whatever else is strikingly original , it can not be described ; we can only hope to convey a faint idea of it by some random illustrations . To nearly every statement which he notices in the works before him Mr. Wilson offers a flat contradiction . When these statements relate to numbers , his method of treating them is a systematic one . He has picked out of Bernal IDiaz , who wrote in an avowed spirit of hostility to Gomara , a pettish remark , that the exaggerations of the latter are so great , that , when he says eighty thousand , we may read one thousand . This piece of rhetoric Mr. Wilson receives literally , and makes it a rule of measurement , applying it with more or less exactness ,  --  not , however , to the statements of Gomara , with whose work he is acquainted only at second hand , but to those of Cortds and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of the enemy 's forces , or of the Indian allies who joined the Spaniards in their contest with the Aztecs , Mr. Wilson " takes the liberty , " to use his own phrase , of " dropping " one or more ciphers from the amount . This mode of adapting the narrative to his own conceptions he calls . " reducing it to reality . " When Cort*snot Gomara , be it remembered-computes. * the number of his allies at eighty thousand , Mr. Wilson says , " Let us drop the thousands , and assume eighty as the actual number . We must do so o/hen . " When Cort*s. writes " thirty-five thousand , " Mr. Wilson . prefers to say " three hundred or so . " - When Diaz writes " twelve thousand , " * Mr. Wilson suggests that we should read " live hundred . " Cortds says that he . caused a canal to be dug twelve feet deep .. Mr. Wilson , speaking as if he had been an eye-witness , says the canal was only . twelve inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly a force of thirte horse , two hundred foot , and three hun-. dred-not thirty thousand-Indian allies . were sent to relieve that village " ; merely . leaving his readers to the inference thatthe number placed between dashes is the . one given by CortSs . In a single instance , he admits the estimate of Bernal I ) iaz* who puts the loss sustained by the Indians . in a battle at eight hundred : while Las .. Casas , whose corrections of other writers . Mr. Wilson professes to " vindicate , " says . the loss of the Indians on this occasion amounted to thirty thousand . Las . Casasalso reckons the number of natives who fell victims to Spanish cruelty in America // at forty millions . This wild estimate has been often quoted . Mr. Wilson , instead of " vindicating " it , as he was bound to do , triumphantly refutes it . " There never probably existed , " he most justly remarks , " more than forty millions of savage races at one time on our globe . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson undertakes to rectify . When they describe a pitched battle , he asserts that it was a mere skirmish . When they speak of a large town , he tells us it was a rude hamlet . When they portray the magnificence of the city of Mexico , he says that they are " painting wild fiqments , " - whatever that may mean ,  --  and that Montezuma 's capital was a mere collection of huts . Cort*s tells us , that , in his retreat , he lost a great portion of his treasure . Mr. Wilson writes , " The Conquistador was too good a soldier to hazard his gold ; it was therefore in the advance , and came safely off . " Cort*s states , that , in a certain battle , he retired from the front in order to make a new ditposition of his rear . Mr. Wilson replies , that Corte*s did not go to the rear , because , though his presence was greatly needed there , the press must have been too great to allow of his reaching it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Montezuma , he transmitted to the Emperor Charles the Fifth , sending , at the same time , n.n inventory of the articles , among which was " a large wheel of gold , with figures of strange animals on it , and worked with tufts of leaves ,  --  weighing three thousand eight hundred ounces . " The original inventory is still in existence . We have the evidence of persons who were then at the imperial court . of the reception of these presents , of the sen sation which they produced , and of the ideas which they suggested in regard to the wealth and civilization of the New World ; and we have minute descriptions of the different articles , including the wheel ef gold , from persons who saw them at Seville and at Valladolid . Mr. Wilson , without making the least allusion to this testimony , which we can not help regarding as of the stron*est possible kind , intimates that the presents were of very little value-represents the workmanship , which excited the admiration of the best European artificers , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wheel of gold , tells us that it " never existed but in the fertile fancy of Cortez . " In general , Mr. Wilson contents himself with the barest , though broadest , denial of the statements of his authorities , or with silently substituting *his own version of the facts in place of theirs . But he sometimes condescends to argue the point . His logic is ingenious , but singularly monotonous . His arguments are all drawn from one source , namely , his own personal experience . The Tlascalan wall , described by Cort*s and Diaz , can never have been in existence , for Mr. Wilson has been on the very spot and found no remains of a wall . Other travellers , it may be remarked , have been more fortunate . Cort*s states , that , in a march across the mountains , some of his Indian allies perished of thirst . This Mr. Wilson pronounces " impossible , " hecause he himself travelled over the same route , and did not perish of thirst , as neither did his horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other cause , were great . One of the most remarkable acts in the career of Cortds was his voluntary destruction of the vessels which had brought his little army to the Mexican coast , in order , as he avers , that his men might stand committed to follow the fortunes of their leader , whatever might be the dangers of the enterprise . " This event , " says Mr. Wilson , " has been the subject of eloquent eulogies for centuries . Among these Robertson is of course pre-eminent . " We are here left in doubt whether Robertson is to be regarded as a predminent century or a preeminent eulogy . However this may be , our author denies that the stranding of lie vessels was the voluntary act of the Spanish general . He is confident that they were cast away in a storm . His " most potent " reason is , that he himself has " witnessed , not only hereabout , but elsewhere , upon this tideless shore , wrecks by the grounding of vessels at anchor . " This he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " However , as we have already intimated , it is seldom that his authorities are submitted to this " ordeal , " which we admit to be a trying one . Usually they are informed that their assertions " rest on air , ** that they are " foolish " and " baseless , " - " wild figments , " or " intolerable nonsense . " Cort*s states that some of his // men , who had been taken prisoners by the Mexicans , were offered up as sacrifices to the Aztec deities . Mr. Wilson , after telling that their hearts were cut out , and their bodies " tumbled to the ground , " complains that " to this most probable act of an Indian enemy , is foolishly added - it was done in sacrifice to their idols , though the very existence of Indian idols is still problematical ! " Cort6s , who had seen too many Indian idols to entertain any doubts of their existence , ought , nevertheless , not to have mentioned them , because to Mr. Wilson the mattcr is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " reduce " the statements of the Spanish historians to " realities , " he omits thdm altogether . Thus , he says not a word of those fearful spectacles which struck horror to the hearts of the Spaniards in their visit to the teocaliis ,  - -  thc pyramidal mound garnished with human skulls , the hideous idols and the bloodstained priests , the chapels drenched with gore , and other evidences of a diabolical worship . Not unfrequently he fills up what he considers as gaps in the ordinary narratives . Thus , he pictures the dying Cuitlahua as " stoically wrappin , , himself in his feathered mantle , " and " rejoicing at his expected welcome to the celestial hunting-grounds , " where he " felt that he was worthy a name among the immortal braves . " This " wild figment " from Mr. Wilson 's " fertile fancy " was , perhaps , suggested by Theohald 's famous emendation in the description of Falstaff 's deathscene ,  --  " a babbled o ' green fields . " On such occasions , Mr. Wilson explains that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one familiar with Indian affairs . " A remarkable example of this method of narration shall close our citations from his work . The reader is , doubtless , acquainted with the tradition , said to have been preserved among the Mexicans , of a fair-complexioned deity , with flowing beard , who had once ruled over them and taught them the arts of peace , and , being subsequently driven from the country , promised to return at some future time . Predictions of his reappearance lingered amongst them , and were supposed to be accomplish . ed in the arrival of the Spaniards . Mr. Wilson tells us that " too much stress " has been laid on this tradition ; but we know of no modern writer who has laid any stress on it except himself . It has been usually supposed to be one of those myths in which nations partially civilized embalm the memory of their heroes . Mr. Wilson does not believe the Mexicans to have been partially civilized . He regards them merely as a horde of savages . Nevertheless , he believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had handed down , through untold generations , from a remote antiquity , " the establishment in America of Phivnician colonies , their history , and their subsequent extinction . Nor is this the whole story . In order to strengthen his argument , he gives a new and corrected version of this tradition . " It told , " he writes , " that pale fiwes had once before occupied the hot country , coming from beyond the great water . Perhaps with this were coupled also tales of suffering and wrongs ; perhaps how cruelly they , the natives , had been forced , by these hard task-masters , to labor upon the truncated pyramids and their crowning chapels . With unrequited Indian toil , these men had builded cities and public works which still preserved their memory , though they themselves had long since perished , haying fulfilled their allotted centuries . But with theh decaying monuments they left a fearful prophecy , and thus it ran : that ftoating houses would again return to the eastern coast , wafted by like winds , and filled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practise the same cruelties , until they again finished their cycle , and gave place to others , such as the laws of climate and population might determine . " When the reader , after perusing this extraordinary relation , recovers his breath , he naturally casts his eye towards the bottom of the page , in the hope of finding some explanation of it . lie accordingly discovers a note , in which Mr. Wilson states that he has " given a little different shadiny to the famous tradition , " but that " such , translated into Indian phraseoloqq , would be the popular accounts . " Now he had a perfect right to interpret the tradition as he pleased . He was at liberty to conjecture that it related to the Phwnicians , as the Spaniards were at liberty to conjecture that it related to St. Thomas . Of the two interpretations , we prefer the latter . Mr. Wilson , were // he consistent , would have done so too ; for how could the Aztecs , when they saw the Spaniards desecrating the Phomician temples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of the " same race , " and had come " to teach the same religion " NYc care little for his inconsistencies ; but the feat which he has here performed , by his " shadings , " his " translations into Indian phraseology , " and his medley of " pale faces , " " great waters , " " floating houses , " " truncated pyramids , " " hard taskmasters , " " winds , " " climates , " " religiGns , " and " laws of population , " we believe to be unsurpassed by anything ever perpetrated in prose or rhyme , by Grecian bard or medieval monk . He appears to think himself justified in taking these liberties with the Muse of History by his anxiety to construct a narrative that should not overstep the bounds of probability . As if all history were not a chain of improbabilities , and what is most improbable were not often that which is most certain ! But it ; at Mr. Wilson 's summons , we reject as improbable a series of events supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquests of Alexander , the Crusades , or the Norman conquest of England , what is it , we may ask , that he calls upon us to believe His skepticism , as so often happens , affords the measure of his credulity . He contends that Cortes , the greatest Spaniard of the sixteenth century , a man little acquainted with books , but endowed with a gigantic genius and with all the qualities requisite for success in warlike enterprises and an adventurous career , had his brain so filled with the romances of chivalry , and so preoccupied with reminiscences of the Spanish contests with the Moslems , that he saw in the New World nothing but duplicates of those contests ,  --  that his heated imagination turned wigwams into palaces , Indian villages into cities like Granada , swamps into lakes , a tribe of savages into an empire of civilized men ,  --  that , in the midst of embarrassments and dangers which , even on Mr. Wilson 's showing , must have taxed all his faculties to the utmost , he employed himself chiefly in coining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants of Christendom , - that , although he had a host of powerful enemies amon , , his coun trymen , enemies who were in a position to discover the truth , his statements passed unchallenged and uncontradicted by them , - that the numerous adventurers and explorers who followed in his track , instead of exposing the falsity of his relations and descriptions , found their interest in embellishing the narrative ,  --  that a similar drama was performed by other actors and on a different sta , , e ,  --  that the Peruvian civilization , so analogous to that of the Aztecs and yet so different from it , was , like that , the baseless fabric of a vision ,  --  that the whole intellect , in short , of the sixteenth century was employed in fashioning a gorgeous fable , and that to this end continents were discovered , nations exterminated , countries laid waste , evidences forged , and , witnesses invented . And this theory is to be swallowed in one solid and indigestible lump , unleavened with logic , unmoistened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are strong , and whose olfactory nerves are not too delicate , sit down to the repast . For our own part , we are quite satisfied with the bare contemplation of the fare . Our readers , also , we suspect , have long ago been satiated . They have dropped oft one by one , and left us alone with our kind entertainer . What more we have to say must therefore be bestowed upon his private ear . We shall speak with the greater freedom . We know the exquisite pleasure we have given him . We are sure that lie is not ungrateful . When his book comes to a second edition ,  --  with a change of title*veqe corresponding to some change in the popular sentiinent ,  --  we shall have to submit to the same honors which he has inflicted on Mr. Prescott and " Housseau de St. Hilaire " ; he will reprint our article as " a flattering notice , " - as the " Atlantic Monthly 's estimate of his researches . " We beg to call his attention to our closing remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole . When he has " translated them into Indian phraseology , " ( we regret that we can not save him this trouble , ) and " reduced them to reality , " we shall take our leave of him , not without a mournful presentiment that the separation is to be eternal . There are many points of difference between his work and Mr. Prescott 's " History of the Conquest of Mexico " ; but the // chief distinction , we think , may be thus stated . If the foundations on which Mr. Prescott 's narrative is built should ever he overthrown ,  --  a contingency which as yet we do not apprehend ,  --  that narrative would still rank among the masterpieces of our literature . It could no longer be received as a truthful relation of what had actually happened in the past ; but it would be received as a most faithful and graphic relation of what had been asserted , of what was once universally believed , to have so happened . If the reality appears strange , how much stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story may seem improbable ; the invention of such a story would be little short of miraculous . Prescott 's work , if removed from its place among histories , must stand in the first rank among works of imagination ,  --  must be classed with the " Odyssey " and the " Arabian Nights ' Entertainments . " But this book of Wilson 's must , under all conditions , and in any contingency , be regarded as worthless . Be the story of the Conquest true or false , this contains no relation of it , this contains no refutation of it . Not content with vilifying his authorities , with impugning their faith , denying their existence , and mangling their names , he has disfigured their statements , corrupted their narrative , and substituted gross absurdities for what was at least beautiful and coherent , whether it was fiction or reality . His book is in every sense a fabrication . It is no record of the truth ; it is not a romance or a fable , artfully constructed and elegantly told ; it is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion authorizes and demands  --  a barefaced , but awkward falsification of history , - so awkward , that it has cost us little trouble to detect it ,  --  so barefaced , that it has been a duty , though , of course , a painful one , to expose it .
