Townsend , Eliza , 1788-1854 : TO A. T. ON HIS IMPORTUNING THE WRITER TO COMPOSE SOMETHING OF MAGNITUDE . from Poems and miscellanies ( 1856 ) Salem , 1808 . Oft have you said , ( or scolded rather , ) In many a literary quarrel , Why strive these useless sprigs to gather , E'en though they should be " sprigs of laurel ? " No ! strive to have some lofty tree , Whose branches stretching o'er the plain , Reclined beneath thou ' lt gladly see ; Then take thy ease , nor plant again ! Thou dearest one ! and dost thou , then , Prize the rude lines I thus indite ? And think of manners and of men Thy minstrel qualified to write ? Grant that " the tree " thy wish would raise , To meet thy wish , had grown and flourished , Protected by thy guardian praise , And by thy kind attention nourished ; Grant that its early buds were fair , That taste and tint its fruits combined ; Its dewy foliage cooled the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots were firmly fixed , Its limbs its just proportion knew , Duly its soft'ning shadows mixed , And pruned each shoot that wildly grew ;  --  All unadmired those leaves would fade , Untasted be that fruitage-store ; Ah ! withered soon its slighted shade , Its wasted fragrance breathed no more !  --  Thy hand alone , indulgent friend , Its garlands , meet for praise , would twine , And ev'ry sweet it e'er might lend , Would satisfy no sense but thine . Then cease , thou partial prompter , cease The wish to urge a loftier strain ; The humble-hearted taste a peace The rash aspirant ne'er could gain , And still indulge the careless muse ; These wild-flower shoots , as wont entwined , The tears of love its only dews , Then graft the chaplet on thy mind . Townsend , Eliza , 1788-1854 : TRIBUTARY LINES . TO JAMES FENNELL. from Poems and miscellanies ( 1856 ) Where is the one , whose soul of amplest plan In Nature 's mint received the stamp of man ? When erst the goddess , fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age ; Intent her treasury , the stage , to clear From dazzling counterfeits , late current here ; Bade from her mines their purest ore be brought , Mines , pervious only to the track of thought ; And taught the braggart witlings to behold , And learn the diff'rence ' twixt their dross and gold . While just discernments give to worth its due , Detect base metal , and admire the true . Say where the one , thus singled from an host , Nature 's exemplar , votary , and boast ? Tell me , ye crowds , who owns that eye-ball 's glare , That form majestic , and that martial air ? Who , grateful for the impress which he bore , Has much received , but still has rendered more .

Supremely skilled to point the forceful phrase Of secret rancor or ingenuous praise ; Minutest meaning , studious to explain , Nor let a particle be given in vain ! A thousand voices swell the loud acclaim ; A thousand voices echo Fennell 's name . All hail , thou master of the drama 's art ! Thou necromancer of the human heart ! Thou speak'st the word ;  --  it glows with tenfold heat , Thou speak'st again ;  --  its pulses cease to beat . With wily potency , thy skill entwines The charm that trances , and the spell that binds . Like the weird sisters at thy Macbeth 's word , The subject Passions throng around their lord .

Where embryo mischiefs nameless ill presage , Or plagues embodied taint a present age ; Where the brain quivers with its own intent , And guilt 's design becomes guilt 's punishment ; Where crazed Reflection to a fiend dilates , And starts from furies which itself creates ! Conversant thus with moral , mental power , ' T is these have taught thy genius thus to tower ; More than thy voice 's strength , thy awful mien , Thy frown tremendous , or thy smile serene !

" Myriads indeed , with high , theatric rage , Or mere mechanic art , can stalk the stage ; Can leave their writer 's meaning on the shelf , And find a substitute in sapient self ; Till broad Burlesque too plainly shows his face , And struggling Laughter bids Grief give him place ; While poor Melpomene , o'ercome with shame , Disowns the changeling that assumed her name . But he who wears his author deep enshrined , Joins heart to heart , and mixes mind with mind ; Feels as he wrote , enforces all he taught , Quickens perception , and embodies thought ; Bear witness , Truth ! Scarce such an one appears Within the circuit of an hundred years . Though scores of poets graced Eliza 's throne , The perfect player was a prize unknown .

Macbeth had still , within his page , ' t is true , Instructed some , perhaps  --  th ' attentive few ; But like the fated writing on the wall , That told Chaldea 's monarch of his fall , By most unheeded , had enticed in vain From the rich banquet , and the mirth profane ; Had not a moving hand  --  that all might see , Beckoned to all  --  itself a prodigy !

Looked dark , talked sentiment , and  --  killed their man . Love , shown by thee , is tenderness sublimed , The condescension of the loftiest mind . ' T is Jove , who bending o'er his Juno 's charms , Smooths his dark brow , and spreads his mighty arms ; With fondness wins whom majesty had awed , And is at once , the lover and the god !

Thy villain  --  hold ! No villain can we see ; E'en Zanga wins us , when performed by thee ! Moved by thy plaints of his disastrous fate , We melt in pity o'er the wretch we hate ; The rising curse is smothered on his tomb , And hell implored to mitigate his doom . And shall the minstrel cease these feeble lays , Nor touch one chord , that yields thee sweeter praise ?

Such notes the Mantuan minstrel owns , Long lured his Trojan from the main ; And bleeding Arria in such tones , Assured her lord she " felt not pain . " Such notes , in Rome 's delirious days , Could liberty and laws restore ; Could bid " be still " sedition 's waves , And faction 's whirlwind cease to roar . ' T was by such suasive sounds inspired , The matrons pressed the hostile field ; The Volscian hosts amazed retired ; The proud Patrician learned to yield .

The second of the kindred race Received from heaven a livelier grace ; With health 's own rose her cheek was dyed , Bright was her hazel eye , And graceful activeness supplied The place of majesty .

Thus reckless though she roved , yet near Methought I traced the frequent tear ; And that she noted not the care Or sorrows of the elder Fair , Was not that ( captious or severe ) She ceased to deem that sister dear , But that her fond and eager sight , ( That else its glance had backward turned , And taught it there to rest , ) Now with extatic ardor burned , And darted onward on its light , Where , seeming just from Ida 's height , As Hebe young , as Venus bright , To-morrow stood confessed !

But with her mantle 's hues so fair What tints of Nature could compare ? ' T was April 's once  --  so poets say  --  But Proteus stole the robe for May , And Iris tinged it with her ray , And Hope had borrowed from the skies The colors for those azure eyes , Whose tempered radiance , softened dyes , Allured but not fatigued the sight ; And seemed a sunny orb to view , Wreathed by a cloud of faintest blue , That swam in liquid light !

Already settled Its awful shadows round his brow , and closed His sunken eyelids . One by one each sense Had yielded up its function . Can it be ? This powerless arm belonged to him , who proved In very deed the Syracusan 's project , And tossed the globe ?

Where old Phenicia 's friendly sails Afar her gen'rous products bore , Our age beheld the recr'ant gales Waft to his prey the robber Moor . The oath that bound Hamilian 's heir , On Rome alone its vengeance hurled ; More fell than Punic ruffian 's swear  --  Eternal wrath to all the world .

The shades of that crusading band Who once the Soldan 's host o'erthrew , Hailed kindred prowess from their hand ' Gainst that same misbelieving crew . Whilst fire , and flood , and sword , and storm , And every form of death was there , Shrank the fierce Turk before that form That seemed " a charmed life to wear .

Though since , that banner turned by fate To those who first its ensigns wore , Thy soul in victory unelate Its failure undejected bore . Did chance or change thy course invade , Like clouds that tinge Italian skies , They did but soften by their shade The dizzying radiance of its dyes .

And next the fatal season follows on That took thee from us ; never more by me That season can be witnessed but with woe ! The reaper 's song shall wake no glad response , And the bright glories of the harvest moon Shine dimly through my tears . Would I could sleep Until the vintage shall be gathered in !

Yet more , those home-bred feuds have proved the heralds Of foreign war , and now its best ally , As these three ling'ring , suffering months can witness , Since haughty Edward , with a chosen host , Buckled his armor on and spurred his steed To Berwick 's menaced walls .

Even to demand The town 's surrender as our monarch 's right , And holden by his father 's heretofore , Ere farther loss of time , and wealth , and life , Serve to impoverish you , exasperate him , And make the path to future peace and concord Less easy than the present . We have said . SEATON .

Another apartment . Mordaunt , Neville discovered , to whom enter Seaton and Dunbar . SEATON . Barons , the Scottish Council have decreed That I should thus reply unto your mission : Berwick was always ours , till thirst of power Prompted your monarch 's warlike ancestor By violence to seize it ; but when Bruce , Our glorious champion , won his country back From its usurpers , Berwick with the rest Resumed its ancient government and laws . But more ; the right of conquest thus obtained , By right of treaty was confirmed ; for , pressed And counselled by the wise men of his land , Four years ago your English King renounced All right himself or his forefathers claimed To Scotland 's crown , and swore to leave its realm Free as it was ere the contending claims Of Bruce or Baliol rose , pressed by no yoke Of foreign servitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whatsoe'er Might seem a vestige of a subject state ; And , on our part , we promised to repay A stipulated sum for those domains By Edward and his sires possessed among us , To yield to him our lands in England held , And even to consider Stanmore 's cross Our utmost boundary . To fix this league We farther fastened on the added tie Of family and friend ; our Prince espoused The sister of your sovereign , and the names Of Robert and of Henry to our ears Were as the names of brothers . Wherefore , then , Have we been thus assailed with secret art And open warfare , while ourselves in aught Had ne'er infringed those articles of peace , Nor would reject it now on any terms , So they were honorable ? MORDAUNT . Is this all ? SEATON . This for your monarch ; for yourselves , as missioned To mediate between us , we would urge A claim to favorable offices ; Such as may seem to you as but comporting With duty to your country ; well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By being just to Scotland . You are answered . MORDAUNT . I am concerned our orders should insist Plainly and positively on this point , Stated at first  --  the rendering up of Berwick . SEATON . But , surely , you did not at first exact Instant surrender . NEVILLE . Truly , no , we did not ; And to the farthest we are authorized To grant you , will we go . Take a given time ; Name it yourself ; till which , if no relief Come to the garrison , ( aware that soon The Douglas will arrive , ) you then consent To yield it to our arms . SEATON . I must consent ! Unwilling howsoe'er . Too well you know I have no choice . ' T is now the thirteenth day Of our midsummer month ; if ere the thirtieth No succors reach the town from Douglas ' force , I yield it up . MORDAUNT . But further , our instructions Demand that , as a pledge for the performance Of this engagement on your part , your son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ) Be rendered for an hostage . SEATON . My poor Duncan ! Must he , too , go ? His brother 's early valor Already had betrayed him to captivity ; Must I be reft of both ? DUNBAR . You press us hardly ; As men , as knights , I put it to yourselves ; Are not these harsh conditions ? NEVILLE . ' T is not ours To make them easier ; though , to your discretion , I own the wish that they were otherwise . MORDAUNT . Our worthy host and his compeer are each Too well informed upon a soldier 's duty Not to acknowledge it the part of such But to discharge their orders  --  not dispute them . DUNBAR . Yet soldiers do remonstrate ; aye , rebel , When their own rights , or real or supposed , Have seemed to be impaired ; their pay withheld ; Their privileges lowered ; causes like these Sometimes create such things as mutinies , Even in English armies .

Little know ye The mind of him we serve , if you imagine That aught in us were prevalent to alter His strenuous will , or check his dread resolve On sovereignty here . DUNBAR . Vain expectation ! Can iron break the northern iron ? No ! Ours is yet harder metal than your own . Witness the many shocks by which ' t was bent , But never yet was riven . Your Roman master Obtained no mastery here . His legions scaled Our cliffs in vain ; and to his eagle 's scream Athwart our cliffs , was borne with echo back , Answering defiance from our native eyrie . Since then the like assault hath still received The like discomfiture ; our frigid clime Had reared a race too rough for the grim Norman Or bloodier Dane to quell . MORDAUNT . The more the glory If we succeed . DUNBAR . How far succeed , I pray ? What if a castle fall , a town be taken ? Dream not that Scotland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thus be won . Behold the board whereon the game is played ! Look far and wide ; each rock shall prove a castle , Each crag a tower , each cave a walled city ; Ramparts of strength , on which the miner , Nature , Hath wrought so secretly , and surely , too , That human prowess vainly may assail The superhuman barrier . MORDAUNT . Nay , go on ; Stop not with Nature . Canst not tell us somewhat Of marvels passing Nature , which your Celts Have long had credit for ? DUNBAR . Did I think meet For tongue of sturdy soldier or the ear Of Christian knights to note such fantasies  --  For such they seem , albeit they may be more  --  There were enough to occupy more time Than , by the strictness of our several callings , Could now be warranted .

Enough of these . NEVILLE . But you did not include The strange pretensions of those bold diviners Who claim to call the future  --  and it cometh ? DUNBAR . True , Englishmen , I did not ; for , believe me , There 's more of might , whate'er of mystery , In this than merits scoffing ; nor would I To stranger eyes expose a gift thus solemn ; The less that , peradventure , at some period , Themselves may mark its power .

But , my comrade , Be that as may , our business toucheth not The world of spirits , but concerneth merely Such an inferior sphere , that I would counsel We put the warning to some present use ; Letting it hasten us in our leave-taking , Soon as the Governor prepare his hostage To bear us company .

Besides , if thou desert thy trust , and thus Betray the sons of all the sires in Scotland To save thine own , blotting the fair escutcheon Worn by thine ancestry unsoiled till now ;  --  Bethink thee , after all , if thou be sure To gain the guerdon ? to deliver those For whom all else were forfeited ? Not so ! For if , in mockery of the faith of treaties , Of his own covenant , the tyrant now Has broke his oath  --  who knows but then he fail To spare the captives , and thou sow'st the wind Only to reap the whirlwind ! SEATON . Hold , in mercy ! LADY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have other children . SEATON . None other half so dear . LADY AGNES . None dearer , sure . The absent and the dead Are ever most delighted in  --  and justly . The heart must seek to compensate itself , When past the power to pour it forth in act , By hoarding larger measures of affection . So let it be with them ! SEATON . Thy solemn words Fall like a requiem ! Hast thou more to move me ? LADY AGNES . Nought of my own ; but , could I summon others , There are , whose words to second my appeal , Were more prevailing . SEATON . Who could be thus gifted ? Say , who ? LADY AGNES . The lads themselves ! Start not ! ' t is true ! Stood they before us now , Themselves to hold the balance , and their doom The weight depending , confident I am Allan and Duncan are no sons of ours But they would beg thee not to spare their lives At peril of their honor ; would prefer To die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitor 's heirs ! And dost thou shrink At the mere name ? Think of the thing , my Seaton ! And let it nerve thee to the only course By which thou canst avoid it . SEATON . Thou hast won me ; Hast conquered , Agnes ! Thou hast gained thy husband , But lost thy sons ! Falls on her neck , when , suddenly catching a glance at the side scene , she screams and sinks back . What means that fearful shriek ? LADY AGNES . A sudden pang . Within . ( pointing to the folding-doors . ) Send Margaret hither . I shall be better soon , and come to thee . Seaton goes into the inner room . ( Enter Margaret . ) Lady Agnes , starting up , snatches the hand of Margaret , and points with it to the view through the side scene . LADY AGNES . ' T is there , already . Look ! the fatal tree ! Beneath our walls  --  within our very sight ! I sped my husband hence , ere he beheld What might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy savage heart Contrive this aggravation ? Curses on thee ! On thee and thine . Take , ruthless spoiler , take A mother 's malison . O , may it reach thee ! Follow through life and haunt thee at thy death ! And let it cleave the tomb , and pierce beneath , Keen as a falchion , till it find the hell To which thy crimes shall sink thee , and dire Heaven Deaf to thy cries , as thou wert deaf to mine ! Falls exhausted into the arms of Margaret . Curtain drops . END OF THE THIRD ACT . ACT IV . Scene 1 . The grounds belonging to the Governor 's house . Lady Agnes , disordered . Margaret following . LADY AGNES . Follow me not ; I go to seek my sons . Dost hear me , girl ? Let go my hand ! My sons Are in the camp ; no place for such as thee . My errand is a lone one . MARGARET .

Thou canst not know How pitiless  --  nor will they let me tell thee  --  The leech forbade it ; did he not ? MARGARET . Yes , lady ; He bade me keep you quieted . LADY AGNES . Most truly . Well , we must do his bidding . I 'll but whisper  --  These English are so fell they neither spare Mother nor children . Children ! that reminds me My own are waiting me in yonder camp , While I am loit'ring here ; my bright-eyed Allan And my dark Duncan . Ha ! in yonder camp ? What do they there ? Art tampering with the foe ? I tell thee , Margaret , if the lads are traitors Then they are none of mine . ' T is some mistake !

LADY AGNES . Truly , so can I ; thou sayest well , my Margaret . No more discreet an handmaid can attend On any dame . ' T is fittest we await The Friar 's return , to ascertain this matter , Ere we depart on an uncertain quest . Meantime , let me betake me to my couch , And tell my beads . Lend me thy arm , my girl . Scene 2 . The armory of the castle . Dunbar and the Friar conversing . FRIAR . I did fear me this . DUNBAR .

Ah , that it should be thus with poor mortality , Even at the highest ! The weak frame gives way , Though the firm purpose fail not ; but hereafter The spirits of the saints , we may believe , ( Freed from a world scarce worthy of their stay , ) Shall gain befitting forms , with a duration Eternal , as the souls inspiring them . DUNBAR . Our Lady grant it . FRIAR . Yes , the shrinking nerve , Not then , as now , perchance , shall counteract " Th ' unconquerable will ; " that the strong man , Armed at all points against a foreign foe , Shall start aghast to see himself subdued By his own flesh and blood ! the pilgrim faints Beneath the penance he must yet perform At peril of his soul , and the rough soldier  --  DUNBAR . Aye , father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for , if so , Son of the church , and duteous as I may be , I hardly shall respond to it ; the less At such a time of need for dauntless hearts In our beleaguered realm . FRIAR . I had foreseen Thy soldierly protest , heroic Dunbar , Nor would it suit , in this emergency , To preach such doctrine to the famished troops Of either garrison  --  thy castle 's charge , Or hapless Seaton 's  --  but , in calmer moments , I ask it of the conscience of that chieftain Who ever closely communed with himself Whether he have not found a subtle something That strove to curb his mettle , and anon Cried " craven " to his prowess ? that , repressed , Returned with powers repaired , e'en as the reptile , Though once dissevered , rallies yet again With fangs renewed ? or rather , like the fiend , ( If such may now be suffered to possess us , As sacred records teach they did of old , ) Who , once expelled , came back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DUNBAR . I bow me to thy holy record , father , Howe'er , as commandment of Berwick castle , Strenuous to disallow the application That shelters timorous natures ; all too many Of such our bastion doth enclose already , Fled here , perforce , for safety from the foe . The anxious matron and the trembling maid ; The worn-out veteran , whose encumb'ring limb ( As if in mockery of its former strength ) Hangs withered now  --  a dead and useless weight ; And the poor child , whose utmost stretch of height Scarce gains his grandsire 's knee ; whose height of hope Already reaches what his grandsire was ! But the effective force that guardeth these Is all too small , in view of Edward 's numbers , To need enfeebling dogmas ; yet I grant There 's weight within your words ; and these wars over , When I have leisure to look o'er my conscience , If the survey disclose to me such lurkers As those whose ambush you so well denote , Lowly at thy confessional , good father , Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' T is frankly said , and I accept the pledge Freely as given . Meanwhile , mistake me not . Neither the frost of age , nor cloister 's chill , Hath frozen yet the blood within these veins That once hath burned upon the battle-field , Alas ! too hotly ! But the helm and corslet Possessed the man before the cowl and gown . My breath , while lent , shall fan , and not extinguish The fire of action ; but , that action done , Should strive to temper the delirious pulse Of human exultation , in the hour Of its wild triumph , by recalling , then , The conscious thought to tranquilize its throbs ; And silently impart that touch of humbleness That lends a grace to honor . ( Enter Attendant . ) ATTENDANT .

( To Dundar . ) I have good hope That my narration of the constancy With which her youthful martyrs met their fate , How sad soe'er , may yet be salutary To the condition of the noble mourner ; Healing the broken heart-strings that had snapped From over tension . DUNBAR . Sights like these , good father , Have lessened my repining at my portion , When  --  as a lonely man , beholding none My name may rest upon when I resign it  --  Tempted to discontent , in those brief hours A soldier steals from warfare . FRIAR . Yes , my son , Though selfish be the thought , and subject after For mortifying penance , I have found , In my own case , the sworn celibacy Enjoined our sect a rule less burdensome , When called to witness those domestic sorrows My duty bids me comfort . DUNBAR . Even so .

( Enter Seaton . ) SEATON . My worthy Dunbar will not think it strange If late his comrade , borne down with the weight Of individual burden , lacked the power To hold discourse upon the common interest . DUNBAR . That common interest who so well had cared for As thy much-injured self , my suffering friend ? SEATON . But now I would be aided by thy judgment . What saith it to this aspect of affairs ? DUNBAR . That they have reached their crisis ; or , at least , Inevitably must , in no long time . The mighty forces mustered by the foe On sea and land , when brought to bear at once Upon our wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I gather ( More than yourself , I think , ) much hope from Douglas . SEATON . Grant Heaven his coming be not ominous To all , as to myself ! its doleful consequences To me and mine may cloud , perchance , my judgment . DUNBAR . No . It has proved , as yet , disastrous merely ; Provoked his foes , and done his friends no good . SEATON . And yet , one should not willingly prejudge A great and gallant name ; but , in the case Of Archibald Douglas , will it be dispraise To own that I distrust his very virtues , Deeming him over brave ? a quality , ( I need not say , ) in circumstance like ours , Worse than its abject opposite .

Is all in vain , and Scotland doomed to follow In the long funeral of departed nations Whose being ended ere her own began ? DUNBAR . No , no ! believe it not ! SEATON . Or , if forbade By policy  --  not pity  --  to be struck From off the roll of states , is she reserved The more degraded lot to hold existence The feudatory servitor of England , And the rapacious and remorseless wretch That sways her sceptre ? DUNBAR . Neither fate , I trust , Awaits our country . The foe may enter , But can he keep its borders ? Will fair Tweed E'er settle to a tributary stream ?

SEATON . Would I might share thy faith ! Ah , Dunbar ! ' t is the cheerful character Of thy own mind that ever coloreth thus The scenery it surveyed . My darkened spirit From the same sounds would catch the groans of bondage Or the sharp death-cry ! Bear with me , my friend , As the survivor of a recent wreck , The raving tempest clamorous in his ears When calmed to all beside . DUNBAR . Doth Berwick own A heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whose own has thus been wrung ? SEATON . For thine , at least , I ask no guarantee . Now let 's away . I must have sight of Agnes . DUNBAR .

Now , holy father , blessings on thy head , Here and hereafter , for that charity ! FRIAR . In aught to comfort thee hath more than paid me . LADY AGNES . I did not think ever to weep again , But thou hast touched the spring within the rock , And healing waters flow . ( Enter Dunbar and Seaton . ) SEATON . How fares my Agnes ? How is it with thee now ? LADY AGNES . Better , my lord ; And not unmindful of the kind solicitude That prompts the asking . SEATON .

DUNBAR . Such lowly estimate of thy own merits Does but enhance the worth it seeks to lower . LADY AGNES . Forbear ! my friend , thy plaudits overpower me .

They are gone ; they are gone from the hearth and the home ; To the hall of their fathers no more can they come ; In the bloom of their youth , in the light of their prime , Ere the tempests of life or the shadows of time , They are gone ! No more shall the hind hear their call at the morn , Nor the stag start , when echo their bugle hath borne ; Not again wave the plumes that in battle they wore , Nor their arm bears the banner their forefathers bore .
