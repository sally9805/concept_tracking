THE BROTHER CLERKS . CHAPTER I. There , stranger lips shall give the greeting , There , stranger eyes shall mark the meeting ; While the bosom , sad and lone , Turns its heavy heart-beats home . A September sun was casting its parting rays far over the dull waters of the Mississippi , as a steamer , with steady course , ploughed her way through the thick waves and " rounded to " at the thronged and busy wharf of New Orleans . Upon her deck , apart from all other passengers , stood two youths gazing with anxious eyes on the vast city spread out before them . The taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flush of his twentieth summer . His figure seemed already to have gained its full proportions , and in his carriage and tone of voice there was all the pliant grace of youth , combined with manhood 's strength and ease . His hair was of that purplish black so rarely seen save in the raven 's wing , or the exquisite portraits of the old masters . The full broad forehead , shadowed by its dark locks , the clear black eye , the hue of health upon the check , and the smile upon the red lips as they parted over the snowy teeth , formed a picture of fresh and manly beauty over which the wing of this wicked world had as yet never hung darkly . The younger was a mere boy ; and stood beside his brother in that autumn hour , like a pure memory of other days ; so marked was his whole bearing with that pureness of grace and refinement which circles some young brows like a halo . His figure was slender and delicate as a girl 's ; while his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls about the blue-veined temples , and a brow of solid and exquisite formation , such as the lover of the intellectual delights to behold . His eyes were like the blue which lies revealed when the storm ceases and the clouds part in the sunshine ; and the long lashes curled upon a cheek of almost invariable whiteness . His nose was of a pure Grecian cast , his mouth one of great expression and most beautifully cut . No one ever looked upon that young face without turning to look again , and felt holier for the gaze , in their hearts . Dear reader , do not imagine this an over-drawn sketch from a romantic fancy . I have only too weakly delineated the reality , as the portrait which hangs before me , looking down with its golden-fringed blue eyes upon my task , can fully testify . During the whole passage the brothers had attracted universal attention , and won the good will of all ; and now , as they stood arm in arm , amid all the hurry and bustle of the " first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but raised his dusty tarpaulin with a hearty " good e'en to the lads , " and the passengers , as they reached the shore , would look up through the crowd once more at their young faces , to gain one more smile or one more parting wave of the hand , thinking , perhaps , it might be the last time forever . " Guly , " said the elder of the two , suddenly throwing his right arm around the slight figure of his brother , and drawing him closer to him , " tell me what makes you silent and thoughtful at this moment , when the scene of our future action lies before us , and our destination is gained . Of what are you thinking ? " I was thinking , " replied the boy , as he laid his cheek caressingly upon his brother 's shoulder , while his thoughtful eyes became suffused with emotion , " I was thinking of home . The sun is setting , and you know , at this hour our mother prays for her absent boys -- were you thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reply for a moment ; Arthur only pressed his brother closer to him , but he answered at last , while a faint blush stole over his cheek : " No , Guly , I must confess my thoughts were far from that . I wish I could always think as rightly as you do , but it is n't my nature so to do . I was thinking of the untried path before us , the probable events of the next few years , the fair home so recently torn from us , the possibility of regaining possession of it through our efforts , and re-establishing ourselves in that station where we have ever moved . We must do this , Guly , for our mother 's sake . " " With God 's help we will . " Again Arthur 's clasp tightened round his brother 's figure , and again for a few moments he was silent ; then suddenly resuming he said : " You must strive to make a good impression on Mr. Delancey , Guly ; do n't be timid or shrinking -- such things have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you so well know how to be ; bear always in mind how much depends on us two , and we shall get on bravely . " It was evident Arthur dreaded more for his brother than he thought of for himself . " I dread the meeting , " returned Guly ; " from the tone of his letter I learned to dread the man , and a boy-novice , as I am , in mercantile business , I shrink from the examination I may have to undergo , while you , with your experience , of course , scarce give it a thought . I have pictured Mr. Delancey as a very stern man . " They put themselves and their baggage into a cab , and at length brought up before a large and brilliantly lighted store , with the name " Delancey , " in gilt block letters over the door . The cabman set the trunks which comprised the brothers ' baggage , within , and pocketing his fare , drove off , leaving the youthful strangers standing upon the stage of their young future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a short time a tall , heavily built young man , with a fine eye and pleasant smile , stepped between them , with an interrogative expression on his countenance , which asked , without the aid of any words , what might be their business ; and Arthur replied that they desired to see Mr. Delancey as soon as possible . The young man glanced at the trunk , and then at Guly 's face , and ejaculating an " Ah , yes ! " as if he had suddenly jumped at a conclusion , asked -- this time putting his question into words -- if they were the young chaps Mr. Delancey was looking for from the North ; " because , " said he , " if you are , I can settle you . " Guly replied that they were the same ; and informed him they were not a little fatigued with their recent journey , and would be pleased to be " settled " as soon as convenient . The clerk , whose name was Wilkins , regarded Guly attentively a moment , then smiled pleasantly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . If I 'm a judge , you 've been used to pleasanter places ; however , I presume it will soon be home to you . Here , Jeff , " beckoning to a tall negro near by , " tote this trunk up for your young masters . " " Jeff " appeared , and with a scrape and a bow signified his readiness to show the brothers to their room , and nodding to Wilkins , they followed the negro to the back part of the store , where a long winding staircase led to the floor above . They had reached the stair foot , when Wilkins , who had been observing them , hurried after them , and holding out his hand to Gulian , said : " Do n't get a bad impression of all of us here by the dingy room you 'll find up there ; notwithstanding you meet such a rough welcome , I hope you 'll learn to like us and be happy . " " Thank you , " said Guly , shaking his hand warmly , and feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've no doubt we shall be very good friends . Good-night . " " Good-night , " returned Wilkins , and he stood watching the boy as he mounted the steep staircase , until the golden curls and young face were lost to sight . He turned away then with a short deep sigh , which sounded almost like a gasp , and thoughtfully resumed his station near the door . " Dis is a gloomsome sort of place , young massa , " said Jeff , the negro , as he placed the trunk at the foot of the bed and turned towards Guly , who was trying to look through the dingy window ; " howsomever , ' taint quite so bad in the day time . " " What makes it more pleasant then ? " asked the boy . " Oh , " said Jeff , " when ' t is light you can look straight down from here into de neighbors ' kitchens ; you can see all dey hab for dinner , how dey ' conomize , how different de misses are drest in de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , and all dat . " " A pleasant occupation , truly , " laughed Guly . " Does any one sleep in the store beside ourselves ? " " Massa Wilkins , sah , and me . Massa Wilkins ' room is down below , just under the stairs ; I sleeps behind the big door on the floor , and play watch-dog for master . " " What 's your name besides Jeff ? " asked Arthur , amused at the loquacity of the black . " Same as my father 's , sah . " " And what is your father 's ? " " Well , " said the negro , twisting a lock of wool in his fingers , " dat 's a puzzler ! His fust name 's Voltaire , and I guess his last one 's Delancey , ' cause he belongs to master , and his belongings generally take his name -- sich as Delancey 's hosses and Delancey 's niggers ; but bress de Lord ! I ' spec you 's sleepy ; good-night , young massars -- why did n't I tink of dis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time lifting a book from his trunk . Jeff reached the door and laid his hand on the knob to go out , but as he cast his eye back at the brothers , he stopped short , then walked towards them on tip-toe . " ' Scuse me , massa , " said he to Guly , " but I jist happened to tink mebbe dat big book was de Bible . " " And you are right . " " Was you gwine to read it , sah ! " " Yes . " " May dis chile stay an ' listen ? I like to hear de talk ob dat book ; It fecks me inordly and makes me feel better in my heart . " Guly signified his assent , and opening the book , read in a sweet , mellow voice a selection of Psalms . Arthur listened attentively , but not more so than Jeff , who stood with parted lips drinking eagerly in every word . When Guly closed the Bible no one spoke ; and after a moment 's hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the depths of his pure young heart poured forth a prayer of sweet and touching eloquence , such as might have graced the lips of older and wiser persons . CHAPTER II . Backward we turn life 's varied page , To note the changes written there . On the banks of the Hudson , in one of the oldest settled counties of New-York , stood the handsome dwelling of Arthur Pratt , the elder . All that wealth could buy was lavished upon the elegant house and grounds , to gratify the taste of the owner . Mr. Pratt ( or Colonel Pratt , as he was more generally called ) had married quite early in life , and having inherited a large fortune from his father , sought out for himself and bride a home suited to their wealth and station . His wife was a woman of great personal beauty , of most engaging and graceful manners , and distinguished in her own circle for her sweet and unobtrusive piety . As far as was consistent with what she considered her Christian duty , Mrs. Pratt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in contact ; and her gentleness and affability were the comment of all . Col. Pratt having located himself in business ( with the desire of having " something to do , " which sometimes prompts the millionaire to busy himself in some way ) in the adjacent city of New-York , was enabled to pass much of his time in the precincts of his happy home , and at the same time to enjoy the society of the haut ton of the city . When the happy father clasped to his proud breast his first-born child , the little Arthur , he deemed his happiness complete . The boy was like his father , both in character and beauty ; and as he grew in " winsome ways , " he became the pride and pet not only of the household , but of friends and visitors . So much indulgence , and openly expressed admiration , did not fail to foster the boy 's inherent spirit of pride , and he soon learned to demand concessions and indulgences which were all too rarely denied him . At times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her child , would remonstrate upon the course of training pursued with him ; but a laughing promise of amendment , forgotten almost as soon as given , a kiss , a word of endearment , or a gentle smile , caused the subject to be dropped ; not to be renewed until some glaring fault in their darling boy again demanded it . Gulian seemed sent to his father 's arms just in time to prevent the utter ruin , by over-indulgence , of young Arthur . He was a delicate but exquisitely beautiful babe , and his frequent illnesses made deep demands on the endearments hitherto so freely lavished upon his brother . For a time Arthur was highly indignant at the new turn of affairs , and openly resented the slights which necessarily he now often received . Naturally , however , he was of a noble and generous disposition , and soon learned to tenderly love the helpless babe , whose blue eyes would brighten when he drew near , and whose lips murmured , for their first word , " Arty . " Arthur had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when time had written Guly a schoolboy , the closest affection united the children , notwithstanding the difference in their years and disposition . Guly , as he was called , though of a cheerful disposition , never displayed that sprightliness and vivacity which characterized Arthur . Even in his merriest moments , a thoughtfulness mingled with his mirth , which rendered him ever attentive to the comfort of others . There was an attraction about the child which won all hearts -- a natural grace and refinement of manner , mingled with a presence whose influence was always for good . With the tattered beggar he came in contact kindly , pressing into his tawny hands the alms he had to give , while Arthur , though equally generous , spoiled his gift by the manner in which it was bestowed , tossing his gold contemptuously at the weary feet of those who asked it , and turning carelessly away . Too early had he learned the power of that wealth to which he might one day becomes the joint heir with his brother , and his pride , perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother and brother were strong redeeming traits in that self-willed nature , and toward those two beings he ever exercised a lofty and ennobling forbearance . Throughout their school-days he assumed the part of defender and protector toward his younger companion , and if a slur was ever cast upon Guly 's meekness , or a taunt uttered at his almost girlish beauty , an earnest champion was ever at his side to adopt his cause , and give the lie to those who dared thus to speak ; and Guly in return looked up to Arthur as one brave and manly in all things , a superior both in mind and body ; little dreaming of the hour when their stations should seem changed , and he assume the part of guide and guardian over his brother . Colonel Pratt was desirous that both his children should choose a profession . But Arthur impatiently expressed his distaste for such a course , preferring the busy hum of mercantile life , to the long study necessary to fit him for a profession . Consequently , after having received a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , there to become acquainted with the business under the immediate care and supervision of his doting parent . Gulian at this time was still at school , the same gentle-souled , spiritual-looking boy ; who perhaps more than Arthur had wound himself round the fond heart of his mother , and who seemed to love her presence , and cherish her affection , with a depth of feeling unusual in boys of his age . One morning , late in August , as Colonel Pratt was about to proceed to the city , his wife observed him wandering over the house and grounds with an air of thoughtfulness amounting even to dejection . Astonished at this in one usually so cheerful-hearted , she joined him , and anxiously inquired the cause . " I have suffered for several days from this same depression of spirits , " he answered , with a faint attempt to smile . " Perhaps some wise sightseer might declare it a presentiment of coming evil , but it is no doubt the mere effect of a slight indisposition , occasioned by the extreme heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me to-day , Arthur ! " said his wife , earnestly , reading beneath his attempts to treat the matter lightly a seriousness which he had striven to conceal . " Nay , my wife , " he answered , " it would but seem that I yielded to a superstitious dread . It will all be right to-morrow . " Seeing the boat drawing near , the fond husband bade his wife an affectionate farewell , and hurried to the wharf . She saw him safely on board , and watched the steamer till out of sight . In life she never saw that husband more . The boat in which he returned was the ill-fated " Empire , " which was sunk near Newburgh , and he was among those who perished . The corpse of Colonel Pratt was not discovered until two days had elapsed , and immediate burial was necessary upon the arrival of the body at that dear home whence he had so lately departed . This blow was so severe to his wife , that for several weeks her reason deserted her , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn , that extensive speculations , whose prospect of certain success had induced Colonel Pratt to invest very nearly the whole of his fortune , had proved an utter failure , and that she and her children were destitute . Here was something which called forth all her energies , and for her children 's sake she nerved herself to action . Their beautiful home , the scene of so much happiness , passed into strangers ' hands . Horses and carriage , and even Mrs. Pratt 's jewelry , all went in the general ruin . Naught was reserved save enough to purchase a diminutive cottage not many miles from the scene of her former prosperity , and thither she departed , taking with her Arthur and Gulian , who had never before tasted the bitter dregs of poverty or sorrow . As usual , in such cases , the many friends who had so gladly shared her wealth , now apparently forgot her existence , and she was left to battle with the heavy change alone . It was impossible for them all to live together now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillian , too , must go to learn the ways of that world , of the hollowness and falseness of which he as yet knew nothing . About this time , a Southern paper fell into their hands , containing an advertisement , by a merchant in New-Orleans , for two young clerks , to fill vacancies recently made in his number of assistants . After due consideration , it was determined that they might fill those places , and the merchant was accordingly written to . An answer was immediately returned , desiring that they should come on as soon as possible , stating that it was not his custom to engage Northern clerks , but that it was a season of the year when it was difficult to procure any one , and for this reason he had decided in their favor . He further stated that he should expect them to remain with him winter and summer , as he could not go to the inconvenience of engaging clerks from such a distance , and then have them away three or four months in a year . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern and disagreeable one in tone , and shuddered as she pictured to herself the character of the writer . What would her delicate and gentle Guly do , in daily contact with such a cold , blunt-lipped man . Still , there was nothing she could devise that would be well for them , and New-Orleans , at that time , was considered an El Dorado , where industry and perseverance soon brought the fickle goddess to bestow her glittering stores . It was a long way to send them from her side , but she experienced a pride which prevented her from applying for situations for them nearer home . Thus , it was decided they should go . In the bright anticipations of future fortune and happiness , which immediately filled his busy brain , in the preparation for departure , and the prospect of his approaching journey , Arthur in a measure forgot the calamity which had over-taken them , and the attendant painful separation from his sole remaining parent . He dwelt enthusiastically upon the fortune he was confident he should soon win . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as soon as practicable , they would contain something more than mere words . His voice , when dwelling upon this subject , was always loud and confident , and even in the midst of all their troubles he sometimes laughed as merrily as of old , when picturing their restored wealth and renewed happiness . Not so Guly . He hovered round his mother like some gentle spirit ; saying but little , yet evincing in every glance of his expressive blue eyes , and in every noiseless footfall , the deep sorrow which lay in the recesses of his young heart . When he spoke it was in accents of tenderness and sympathy for his mother ; and though he never talked as Arthur did of the approaching journey , and its results , there was an expression of firmness and determination in his thoughtful face , which more than once forced upon the mother 's heart the conviction , that in that distant land , this frail being , after all , might prove the stronger of the two . Daily she warned them of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught them to zealously shun such , as they would a viper in their way . They listened and promised ; and when the expected day of departure arrived , bade her adieu in the midst of her tears , and prayers , and blessings . Thus was the widow left utterly alone ; yet in her faith she felt not forsaken , knowing that the Father of the fatherless was with her in her woe . CHAPTER III . Number  --  Chartres-Street . With the first ray of the morning light , Gulian was awake . Without disturbing his brother , he rose , dressed himself , and took a survey of his chamber by daylight . It was a large , gloomy-looking room , unceiled and unpainted , and the rough beams and rafters looked like the ponderous ribs of some antediluvian monster , which might crumble in at any time , and bury all beneath them . The windows were large , but dingy and begrimed with the unmoved dust of years ; and spiders ' webs hung in profuse festoons from the dirty sashes . A quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other lumber , were carelessly thrown in one corner , and the door which opened upon the staircase was covered with big-lettered advertisements , in such diversified type that it seemed as if the old door was " making faces " all the time , to improve its Punch and Judyish appearance . The windows looked down into the courtyards of adjoining dwellings , which were built up so high that no view was afforded beyond . As Guly looked down now , he saw the servants hurrying about with their turbaned heads and ebony faces , busied with preparations for the morning meal ; laughing and joking as they passed one another , apparently as happy in these narrow gloomy courts as though they were the possessors of the proud mansions adjoining . Such was the view from two of the windows of the room . There was another one covered partially by a tattered and dusty painted shade , at the southern extremity of the apartment , but Guly did not approach it , not caring to look down upon what he thought must be a third edition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty dry goods boxes ; and one or two pieces of furniture of the same description were placed about the room , which , with the addition of one store stool , minus a bottom , served for seats . The bedstead was of common stained wood , furnished with a tester and flimsy mosquito bar , through the grim and smoky folds of which were visible sheets of unbleached factory muslin , an emaciated mattress , and a pair of lean pillows , which seemed quite lost in the much too large cases which covered them . The boy sighed as he took in all the dinginess and gloom , and his heart throbbed yearningly for the pleasant room which , even in adversity , had been his at home , cheered and enlivened so often , too , by the presence of his tender mother . " It is n't time to get up yet , is it , Gulian ? " said Arthur , half-rousing himself , then closing his weary lids again . " The sun is n't up yet , is it ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only know when it 's up by the increased light . " " I was dreaming of home ; oh ! such a pleasant dream ! I must sleep a little longer , " murmured Arthur again , in the lingering tones of one but half-awake . " Not this morning , brother . Come , we must up , and be doing . I hear them opening the store below ; we should n't be late the first morning , you know , dear Arthur . It is too late to sleep . " Alas ! that this first bright dream of home , in that old gloomy room , should ever have been broken ! Alas ! that the first sweet slumber , on that rude couch , should have had its awaking ! Alas ! for the beauty of that boyish face , radiant in the flush and glow of early youth , with the halo of home dreams upon it , that it had not there and then chilled and crumbled ! Alas ! for the innocence and purity of that buoyant spirit , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forewarned of the dark time coming , when it would quake to find in conscience 's depths , that , indeed , " it was too late to sleep . " Upon going down stairs the first person the brothers met was Jeff , who stood at the foot of the staircase , looking up as if expecting them . They returned his cheerful and respectful salutation kindly , and passed on to the front door , where Wilkins stood in his shirt-sleeves ; leaning against the door-post , reading the morning paper . He raised his eyes as they approached , and nodded to them , and , somewhat to Guly 's surprise , inquired how they had rested , adding that the room needed some cleaning before it could be made habitable for human beings , and he would see to it . They thanked him , and , as he resumed his reading , they could do nothing more than stand in the door and look out , or walk briskly up and down the floor for exercise . The clerks began to gather in after a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting , as they stationed themselves at their respective places . At length beginning to experience the craving of naturally good appetites , they walked up to Wilkins , and inquired where they were expected to board . " Good gracious ! sure enough ! " said he , flinging his paper on the counter , " I came near forgetting you ; and would have been off to breakfast without you in a minute more . Come on , " and he put on his coat as he went out of the door , and led the way down street . They only walked a couple of blocks , then entered a large room , opening upon the street , with glazed glass doors , which stood open on account of the heat of the morning . " I always eat here , as it is cheaper than to take a boarding-house , I think ; and , besides , you can always have just what you call for . If you take my advice , you 'll take your meals here , too , " said Wilkins , assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table bell for the waiter . Arthur thanked him for his kindness , and asked him when they would probably see Mr. Delancey . " He 's only in the store from nine in the morning till three in the afternoon , " replied Wilkins . " You will see him shortly after we get back there . " When their meal was over , arm in arm they took their way back to the store . It was n't nine o'clock yet , so they did n't walk very briskly , but looked about them , and made their comments to each other on the appearance of the buildings , the streets , etc. , etc. , and Arthur drew some comparisons between them and those in New-York . They reached the store almost at the same time that a pony-chaise , driven by a very respectable-looking negro man , drew up at the door . A tall , spare gentleman , in a suit of black , stepped out of it , and after reaching back for his walking-stick , entered the building . He had , apparently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fifty , but he was wrinkled and skinny enough to be sixty . His hair was quite grey , and of a dry , husky nature , which prevented its ever looking smooth ; and , in consequence , it stuck straight up in front , and straight out at the sides , in a very bristling and business-like manner . He had a deep frown between the eyes , which were of a cold stone color , of a most peculiar expression , and exceedingly quick and restless ; always darting hither and thither , never as if looking for a bright side to anything , but always as if seeking for something amiss . His nose was high and pinched , but long , also , and very hooked ; so hooked that it seemed as if each nostril had baited a corner of his mouth , and drawn it up in speaking distance , so that when it was open , the end of that prodigious nasal organ might refresh itself by looking down his throat . There was a firmness in his tread , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left , without turning his head , which told of energy and decision ; but there was in the whole appearance of the man something repugnant and disagreeable , and a shadow seemed to fall on every face he passed , so that the whole line of clerks , ranged on either side behind the counters , and a moment before so cheerful and bright , looked as if a pall had been dropped over them after he had gone by . Gulian and Arthur had shrunk back at his first entrance , and felt as certain at that moment that this man was Mr. Delancey as they did a few minutes afterwards , when Wilkins took them up , and formally introduced them . " So , you 've come ? " said he , by way of greeting , and turning his keen eyes upon them alternately , as Wilkins named them , " which of you is it that 's been in the business before ? " " I , sir , " said Arthur , stepping forward . " What do you know about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and cleaning the lamps ? " " I never swept out , or cleaned a lamp , in my life , sir . I have sold goods , and sometimes taken charge of the books in the book-keeper 's absence . " " No airs , young man -- do n't want any exhibitions of pride here ; you 'll have to do whatever you 're set at in my service , if it 's washing windows . Can you make out , a bill ? " Arthur 's face was very red , and angry words were on his lips , but Guly 's hand that moment touched his arm , and pressed it gently . He remembered all , and answered calmly that he could . " Step up here , then , and let me see you do it , " said Mr. Delancey , making room for him to use the large desk . Arthur obeyed , and in a clear , bold hand , drew up the bill properly , and handed it to him . He ran it over with his eyes quickly and eagerly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something like disappointment in the tone of his voice as he said , briefly , " Right , sir , " and laid it down . There was a moment 's pause , during which Mr. Delancey busied himself in writing down a great many figures on a piece of paper . When he had finished he handed it to Arthur , with a look of triumph in his face , and said , " Let 's see you solve this problem correctly , if you can . " That sneering " if you can , " to Arthur 's mind seemed to imply so much doubt of his capacity , that he felt stung to the quick ; and it was with a gesture of pride and impatience , which he could not repress , that he took the paper . He returned it to the desk in a few minutes , and again those cold gray eyes ran over his work , and again they showed disappointment when it proved to be right . " Wilkins , " said Mr. Delancey , turning to that individual , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vacancy in the bleached goods department , which Jones left . " Mr. Wilkins moved away to fulfill the order , and Arthur was about to follow him , when his employer called him back . " It is my custom , " said he , " to give young clerks the first year a merely nominal salary , but as you seem to be pretty well acquainted with the business , and have a face that may win custom , you will get liberal pay . I will give you five hundred a year . Five hundred -- but mark me , sir , you 've got to earn it !  - -  every picayune of it , sir , you 've got to work for . When any clerk is caught idling or dawdling about these premises , he 's turned out , neck and heels , with only just what he can scrape together on the shortest possible notice . I hope we understand each other . Go , now . " Arthur bowed , and moved away with Wilkins , who pointed out his place to him , and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , returned to his position near the big desk . After dismissing Arthur , Mr. Delancey seemed entirely to have forgotten Gulian , and leaned stiffly back in his chair , regarding the lines of clerks and the customers , who now began to flock in , without taking any notice of him . When Wilkins approached , however , and cast a meaning glance toward him , he seemed suddenly to remember Gulian , and turning round , said , bluntly : " Come here , sir . " Guly 's face had lost every vestige of color , and his heart beat so violently that it seemed to make him tremble all over , and he came forward hesitatingly , with his eyes cast upon the floor . " So , you know nothing at all about a store , eh ? " " No , sir . " " Well , I think , for my part , such a white-livered , baby-faced chap as you are would have been better off at your mother 's apron strings , than coming so far from home to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and golden head drooped a trifle lower . " Do you know your multiplication-table ? " " Yes , sir . " " Step up here , and repeat it . " Without lifting his eyes Guly obeyed ; and stepping forward , commenced in a low tone to repeat the table . " Louder , sir ! " exclaimed Mr. Delancey , angrily ; " how do you suppose I can hear such a muttering as that ? " The throbbing in his breast increased to such a degree , that Guly felt as if he could not breathe . He reached up and laid one white delicate hand upon the desk tightly , for support , then summoning all his courage , he elevated his voice , and went on , mechanically , to repeat what , in calm moments , he knew as well as A B C , but which now seemed to be a sort of dead memory , which would desert him every moment . " Louder , sir ! " again shouted his tormentor , as his voice unconsciously lulled again . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? If you know it , speak up . " There was a sudden turning of heads by the clerks nearest the desk towards the spot , attracted by the unusually loud tone of the proprietor . Guly felt , rather than saw , that he had become the object of attention , and with a last effort raised his voice , and commenced another number , but suddenly he ceased altogether , the white hand slid from the desk , and he fell fainting at Delancey 's feet . Wilkins sprang quickly forward , with a hot flush burning on either cheek , and lifted the boy like a baby in his arms . As he did so he cast a look full of deep and mysterious meaning upon Delancey . It was a look difficult for a mere observer to interpret , but the merchant quailed visibly beneath it , and turned aside his head . Wilkins bore the quiet figure in his arms farther back into the shadow of the staircase , and placing him in a large chair which stood there , bathed his temples with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing upon him meanwhile with an intense and anxious gaze . At length the snowy lids , with their curve of golden lashes , trembled slightly , then opened wide , and the blue eyes were raised an instant , appealingly , to the face which bent kindly over him . " A drop of water , Mr. Wilkins , if you please . " It was brought , and he drank eagerly . " Are you better ? " " Yes , Wilkins , almost well . " He dropped his head upon his hand a moment , and those to whom he was visible saw his lips move earnestly for a moment or two . " I can go on without any trouble , I think , " he said , in a voice of gentle earnestness , referring to his unsaid table . " You need n't say any more unless you would like to , " returned Wilkins ; " I am sure you know it . " " I would rather , " said Guly , firmly . He rose , and , with Wilkins at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had resumed his stiff position , leaning back in his chair . " He will finish , if you please , sir , " said Wilkins , with the respectful bow of an inferior , but at the same time fixing his eyes sternly on the merchant 's face . Mr. Delancey assumed an air of attention , and Guly , taking his old station in front of him , commenced in a clear , distinct voice , and repeated the table unfalteringly , from beginning to end . " There ! why could n't you have done that in the first place , without acting such a namby-pamby farce , I 'd like to know ? " " I had not the power , sir . " " Well , what do you s'pose you 're good for in a dry goods store , anyway , eh ? Look at that ! " and he lifted one of the boy 's small white hands by the tips of the fingers , and held it towards the light , as if he would look through it , then dropped it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with him , Wilkins ? " " Give him the embroidery department . His hands are just fit for such delicate work , and besides it will just put him under my eye . " " Poh ! he 'll make such ruinous mistakes , that I 'll never be able to stand it , sir . Give him Harper 's place in the thread and tape , up here , then he 'll be under my eye . " Guly shuddered . " He 'll do well , sir , in the place I propose , " Wilkins returned quietly , but firmly . " With a little instruction , I 'll answer for him ; and there 's a freer circulation of air down there , something he needs . " " Well , take him along , and see what you can do with him . I expect nothing more than that he 'll die on my hands , before he 's earned enough to pay his funeral expenses . " Wilkins turned , and beckoned the boy to follow him . CHAPTER IV . The First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishment , and although he had all the books to keep , his work was lighter than that of any of the rest . He went to work later in the morning , and left it earlier at night . Besides being book-keeper , he was a sort of a superintendent of the whole concern ; and the clerks looked up to him as second only to the proprietor himself . To win Wilkins ' favor was to propitiate Mr. Delancey : a fact well known , and acted upon . Guly 's beauty , or gentle disposition , had evidently gained for him , through Wilkins , the best stand in the store . His work was light and agreeable , he had no heavy lifting to do , and the Beautiful , which in any form was delightful to him , was constantly before his eyes . In addition to this , the clerk who stood next to him , on his right hand , was a most estimable and kind young man , of the name of Hull ; who used every effort to assist his young neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his own example , taught him patiently to endure its tediousness . This , together with the frequent and kindly-tendered instructions of Wilkins , enabled Guly , who was naturally very quick , to readily acquire the knowledge requisite for his situation ; and with his brother , nearly opposite , to speak to occasionally , and to see all the time , he felt that he was highly favored . As Mr. Delancey had never shown any interest in the matter of their board , they still continued to " victual , " as Wilkins called it , at the restaurant , and sleep at the store . By dint of working a little before going to bed every night , the brothers , without reminding Wilkins of his promise to " see to it , " had managed to make their sleeping apartment present a very habitable appearance . As every moment of their time , since their arrival , had been taken up with business , they remained in their room the first Sunday , without going to church ; feeling that for each of them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts , feelings , and events , which they had experienced since they had left her side , would be as acceptable to Him whose day it was , as to attend church , leaving her to mourn in anxious uncertainty as to their safety or happiness . The succeeding Sabbath , however , they rose early , and , after performing their devotional exercises , prepared themselves to attend public worship . While waiting for the bell to ring , they sought Wilkins , for the purpose of inquiring what church Mr. Delancey attended . Wilkins had taken possession of the merchant 's seat at the high desk when they found him , and , as usual had his coat off , reading . He looked up , apparently a good deal surprised , as they put the question to him , and exclaimed , rather dryly : " Why , you do n't say you 're going to church ! " " Certainly , Mr. Wilkins . Wo n't you go with us ? " " Ah ! not I. " " Do you never go ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ago . You forget that I have been in New-Orleans five years . " " No , we do n't forget that . Mr. Hull said , the other day , that Mr. Delancey would never get as good a clerk as you again , or one that would be as faithful , and remain with him so long . But does being here a few years make any difference about going to church ? " " I 'm afraid you 'll find so . " " How can you spend so much unoccupied time without church , Wilkins ? " said Guly , earnestly , stepping up on the chair round , and seating himself quietly on the head clerk 's knee . Wilkins flung down the novel he had been reading , and , reaching out his strong arms , clasped both hands round the slender figure sitting there , and , throwing back his head , looked thoughtfully into the boy 's blue eyes . " I spend it , " said he , at length , speaking in a suppressed voice , and more as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shell Road , in betting on fast horses , in excursions out of town , and in visiting "  - -  he stopped short , then added , through his shut teeth , after an instant 's pause --  " places which I hope to God you 'll never know more about than you do now . " " Are you going to the race-course to-day ? " asked Guly , suddenly lifting his head . " I do n't feel quite well . No , I reckon not , " returned Wilkins , disjointedly , and moving uneasily in his chair . " I weary you , " said the boy , gently essaying to leave his seat on the head clerk 's knee . " No ! no ! you do n't ! " cried the other , eagerly ; and suddenly drawing the bright head down upon his bosom , he added , in a voice of deep emotion , " Oh , that I had you always thus to lie upon my heart , and keep the evil out ! " The church bell at this moment began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , the brothers started forth , and , arm-in-arm , walked briskly forward . Whenever Guly looked back at the tall store , towering up above its brick-and-mortar neighbors so proudly , he thought of Wilkins sitting in there in the gloom , all alone , and wishing for some one to lay upon his heart , and keep the evil out . When they reached the church , Arthur asked the sexton if Mr. Delancey 's pew was full , and , on being informed there was no one in it but himself and wife , he desired to be shown to it . It was situated quite at the head of the aisle , near the pulpit ; and the sexton 's hand was on the door , before the merchant , who was sitting in his usual position , bolt upright , in the pew , noticed their approach . When his eyes fell upon his two new clerks , the frown between his eyes deepened very visibly , while his whole face wore a look of angry astonishment . Holding the door shut , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Mr. Delancey leaned out , and , in a harsh whisper to Arthur , which was loud enough to reach Guly 's ear , exclaimed : " What the devil do you want ? I hope you do n't expect to sit with me ? Up gallery with you ! There 's seats enough for your class there . " So saying , the merchant jerked himself back , and , resuming his stiff position in the pew , looked straight ahead with his stony eyes , as if utterly unconscious of any one else . With burning cheeks the brothers took their way down the carpeted aisle , and reached the pillared porch . " I 'm not going up there to sit , " said the elder brother , proudly ; " if there is no place for me below , there is no place for me in the gallery ; " and flinging off the gentle hand that would have detained him , he sprang down the granite steps , and started at a rapid pace down the street . Guly stood for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing his brother took the direction towards the store , he decided to remain , and mounting the winding stairs , found himself in the spacious but scantily peopled gallery . Guly 's was a pure mind , unaccustomed to drawing sarcastic comparisons , or indulging in bitter fancies ; but , as he looked down into the body of the church , he could not help wondering to himself which were the most acceptable in God 's sight : the mass of life , bowing and swaying in their costly array of silks and laces , and fine cloth , kneeling on their velvet cushions , and bending their brows upon their jeweled hands , or the few earnest and devout , seated in the unornamented gallery , kneeling upon bare floors , seated on uncushioned benches , bending their hearts in simple worship to Him whose Word they came to hear . CHAPTER V. The Broken Sabbath . As soon as Arthur 's rapid walking had taken him out of sight of the church , he slackened his pace , and walked moodily on along the almost deserted banquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pride had received , his cheeks burning with the flush of anger , and his heart heavy at the remembrance of his unkind words to Guly , the youth looked anxiously about for something to divert his thoughts , and while away the hours till church was out , when he hoped to rejoin his brother , and with him return to their apartment . At this moment , however , he received a hearty slap upon his shoulder ; and turning quickly , saw one of the clerks of the store , well known to be of low and dissolute habits , but who managed to retain his place by steady application to business during business hours . Hitherto , Arthur had never had anything to say to him , beyond what was necessary in the store , having intuitively shunned him as an unfit associate . Now , however , he felt that any companion was better than solitude , for the unoccupied Sabbath hours ; and although a sense of shame filled his breast , that he should ever have given the opportunity to such a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort , and extending his hand , exclaimed , in a hearty tone : " Glad to see you , Quirk ; whither bound ? " " Anywhere that I can get company , " returned the other , giving Arthur 's hand a close grasp . " This is the only day , you know , that a clerk has to himself , and I always make it a point to have a deuce of a time to begin the week with . " And the fellow burst into a loud laugh . Arthur withdrew his hand hastily , and an expression of disgust swept over his fine features . The quick eye of the other did not fail to detect it , and , eager to retain the vantage he had gained , he said : " You mus n't mind my easy expressions , Pratt ; they come to me somehow like second nature , and I ca n't help them ; just let ' em pass ; and tell me what you 'd like to visit to-day , and what you 'd like to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no sight in this city that I ai n't as used to as measuring tape . " " I 've never been accustomed to go sight-seeing on Sunday , " said Arthur , in a hesitating tone . " That was because you were never accustomed to working every week-day before . " " No , it was because I was strictly taught to ' Remember the Sabbath-day , and keep it holy . ' " " Fiddlesticks ! all that 'll do in the North , where folks put on their long faces every Sunday , and go to church , rain or shine , and do n't cook any dinners , and do n't read anything but pious books , but such things ai n't expected here of anybody . Why , this is always a holiday here -- the military companies are always drilled on Sunday , the best races are reserved for Sunday , the best plays at the theatre are on Sunday nights , and so are the best balls . Ha ! ha ! to talk of keeping this day holy here . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just what every young prig from the North is sure to say at first , but they get to be one of the ' fast ones ' at last . I was quite sober myself when I first came here . I was from the land of steady habits , ye see -- the only son of my mother , and she was a widder ; but she died , and nobody cared for me here , so I just joined the b'hoys , and learned how to enjoy myself . " " I 'll tell you what we 'll do ! " exclaimed Quirk , after another short pause , " we 'll just take the cars , and go to Carrolton . That 's a fine place , and it ca n't hurt your conscience any to visit it . Even the ministers ride up there on Sundays sometimes . " " How soon could we return ? By the time church is out ? " " Oh , we can come back any minute we like . Hurrah ! Now hop in , or we 'll be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving , and they were obliged to run in order to catch their chance . The moment of reflection did not come to Arthur till he had taken his seat , and was rapidly moving away . If there came any pangs of conscience then , they were , from a dread of ridicule , studiously concealed from his companion , and consoling himself with the thought that it now was too late to repent , he gave himself up to the full enjoyment of his ride . After leaving the city , as the charming suburban retreats , one by one , came out upon his view , Arthur eagerly regarded each one , appreciating its brightness and freshness all the more from his recent confinement in the city . The clear sloping meadows , the rural cottages , the fresh air , all served to enliven and cheer him ; and , as the cars were crowded with pleasure-seekers , like himself , he forgot it was Sunday , and was happy in his forgetfulness . Near Carrolton a beautiful wood burst upon his sight , skirting either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright green sward beneath the branches . The trees were of noble growth , and from every limb hung pendant the tattered sheets of long gray moss , so common in the South , and so solemn and sombre in their effect . " Was there ever anything more beautiful , even on the banks of my own Hudson ! " exclaimed Arthur , enraptured at the scene . " Can we not persuade the conductor to stop , and let us down ? I would enjoy a stroll there . " " Nonsense ! " returned his companion . " I ca n't go with you if you go there . I have a horror of that swinging moss , and ca n't bear to be near it . Those trees always make me think of ghosts , with rotten shrouds on ' em . " " That 's a fine comparison , Charley , " said a clear , sarcastic voice near them ; and a young man , bearing the unmistakable stamp of the genteel loafer about him , stretched out a small white hand , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook Charley 's over the back of the seat . He was quite a youth , apparently not over twenty years of age ; but there was an expression in his eye which would lead one to believe him older . It was an eye old in cunning , old in craft , and old in sin . It was small , deep-set , and of piercing blackness . His hair was of a soft chestnut , and curled slightly at the ends . His lips were thin , and his complexion sallow . His dress , in every article , was of the finest material , but arranged with a decidedly foppish taste ; and , somehow or other , his whole appearance reminded one of those large bills , stuck up in depots , with " Beware of Pickpockets " on them . Charley leaned back , after shaking hands with him , and whispered something in his ear ; then , nodding to Arthur , said : " Mr. Pratt , I 'll make you acquainted with Mr. Clinton . Mr. Clinton , Mr. Pratt . " Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and politely expressed his pleasure at the acquaintance . " Well , just consider me one of you from this hour , " said Clinton , rising , and turning his seat so that he might face his friends . " Just confide to me your intentions for to-day , and you 'll find I 'm with you , heart and hand . " Charley tipped a sly wink at him , unperceived by Arthur , and answered : " We 're only going to Carrolton , to stroll through the gardens ; that 's all . " " Ah , yes ; going to contemplate the beauties of nature . I understand . Just so . Glad to hear it ; for , of all things in the world , it 's just what will suit me best . Just consider me one of you . " Arthur eyed his new friend with considerable curiosity , as he let off these little explosive sentences , and withdrew his eyes with an unsatisfied look , as the other ceased speaking . " He evidently , " thought he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . " " Here we are ! " cried Clinton , as the train stopped . " Now , my dear friends , let 's hasten to leave these clattering cars , where I scarcely can breathe . Ah ! you perceive this beautiful scenery has already inspired me . I s'pose , Mr. Pratt , you did n't know I was a poet before , did you ? " " I was certainly not previously aware of your poetical talents , Mr. Clinton , " returned Arthur , laughing , " but I shall never doubt it again . " " That 's right , my boy . Like your candor . You 're excusable for not noticing before that I was a genius . It was no doubt merely because you did n't look closely in my face . Any one can see it who does . There 's the pretty Miss Julia Tippet , she declares she 'd know me for one through a pair of green spectacles . " So saying , Mr. Clinton sprang to the ground , and being a little taller than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders as he stepped between them , and so passed on through the garden gate . As they trod the neat shell walks , and inhaled the fragrance of the many blooming flowers , Arthur enthusiastically expressed his delight ; and Mr. Clinton , suddenly drew in a long breath through his nostrils , and exclaimed , at the same time striking an attitude :  --  " Delightful spot ! I know not what could e'er draw hence my willing feet , Unless it be a chance I see , for some kind friend to stand a treat . " " There ! " bringing down his right hand , with a hearty whack upon his knee , " if I have n't been off again into one of my spontaneous bursts of poetical effusion ! Who ever saw that beat ? " " Ha ! ha ! ha ! " roared Charley . " I take the hint ; what 'll you have ; mint-juleps for three , or three for old Cogniac ? " " Thank you , " said Arthur , as he met Charley 's inquiring glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , you must have something , if it 's nothing more than lemonade with a stick in it , " returned Charley . " Hurry up your pegs there , Charley ! " cried Clinton , at the top of his voice . " Pratt 's getting faint , and wants something to strengthen him ! " This was said in such a good humored hope-I-don't-offend manner , that Arthur could not repress a smile ; and while the smile was on his lips the drinks arrived , and he received his with a bow . That he considered it good , was very evident from the manner in which he drank it , an act which Quirk and Clinton watched narrowly , over the brims of their glasses . Arthur experienced no more pangs of conscience that day ; neither did he recall his intended return by the time church was out . After drinking , his companions used every effort to make themselves agreeable , and showed him over the extensive grounds , strolled through the shady avenue on the Levee with him , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and proposed that Arthur should treat them . He eagerly assented , and for the first time in his life marched boldly into the bar-room , and ordered three strong drinks , all of the same description . Then a military company arrived , and the excitement of the drill , the sound of the martial music , and the fresh uniform of the soldiers , combined with the noise and bustle of railroad travel , and the crowd of lookers on , seemed to dispel all remembrance of Sunday , and the whole afternoon passed in this way , in what then seemed real enjoyment . It was eleven o'clock in the evening when , heated and dizzy from the wine they had drunk , Arthur and Charley took their seats in the cars for home ; with Mr. Clinton heavily reclining between them . They were a noisy trio , though an experienced eye might have detected readily that Clinton pretended to be much more intoxicated than he really was . When the cars arrived at St. Joseph-street he alighted , bidding his two friends a hearty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand : " Hope to see you soon again , Pratt , hic -- from this day for hic ward , consider me one of you . " And , with a stagger which threatened a fall , he left the cars , and disappeared round the corner . As he did so , he drew a ponderous key from his pocket , and holding it up between his eye and an adjacent lamp , regarded it closely , then burst into a laugh : " I 'll have some fun with this yet , I reckon ; I 'll teach the governor to forbid my having any of the keys . By the gods ! I 'll bring him round with this , or die in the attempt , " soliloquized Mr. Clinton , swinging the key between his thumb and finger . " By-the-by , " he added , suddenly thrusting it deep into a side-pocket , " I 'll just stroll down Chartres-street , and see what the boys 'll do when they find it out . " Mr. Clinton was evidently perfectly sober . Whistling a tune thoughtfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the shady side , he struck into a run , which pace he kept up until he had crossed Canal , then he assumed a slow , careless walk ; and as the moon had now risen , the lamps had been put out , and one side of Chartres-street lay in deep shadow . To this side he kept , and when he had arrived nearly opposite Delancey 's store , he stepped back into an archway , and remained quiet . In a few moments he heard the voices of his late companions , and saw them coming down the other side of the street , leaning upon each other , and both evidently fully affected by the liquor they had imbibed . As Charley gained the door , he sustained himself by holding with his left hand upon the door-post , while with the right he applied a small steel key to the key-hole . " Why the devil do n't it fit ? Lend a hand here , Pratt , and see what you can do . " Arthur had seated himself upon the step , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he rose at Charley 's bidding , and took the key . " Why do n't it fit ? " said he , after looking at it a moment , intently . " Well , the reason is my trunk key do n't fit this door , and I 'd like to know how you came by it . " " Your trunk key ! well , where 's the other ? Your trunk key ! I guess so ! Well , here 's one that will fit , " and he drew out a brass house-door key , and shufflingly applied it to the lock . " Devil ! wrong again . Pratt , stand up here , and help me . " " We 'll never get in at this rate , Charley . " " I 'll give you a lodging , if that 's what you 're after , " said a voice near them , and a hand fell heavily on a shoulder of each . " Nabbed , by gripes ! " cried Quirk , suddenly turning round . " But just look here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what for you arrest a couple -- of gen'l'men for -- as is decently hic to go home to bed . " " Breaking into a store is a new way of going to bed . You 're my prisoners ; so march along with you . " " Do you take us for thieves , " said Arthur , startled into soberness ; " we belong there , and were trying to use our pass-key . " " Let 's see your pass-key , then . " " It 's lost ! I can find it neither in my own nor my companion 's pockets . " " Good story , but wo n't go down , so trot along . " And the watchman , stepping between them , seized an arm of each , and hurried them off to the guard-house . " Phew ! that 's more than I bargained for , " said Clinton , stepping out of the archway , and looking after the retreating figures . " However , that 's Grey that 's got ' em , and I can make it straight by morning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponderous key he held , and muttering , " Ah , a good time 's coming , " turned his steps toward the First Municipality . CHAPTER VI . Since noonday , Guly had sat in the darkened store alone . He could not go out in search of his brother , being ignorant of the streets ; and besides , where in that great city could he have looked with any hope of finding him ? When he returned from church , and found Arthur absent , he was not only surprised , but deeply troubled . Knowing what a stranger he was in that vast metropolis , the thought crossed his mind that in the proud and angry mood that was upon him , he might have wandered off , and lost himself . But an instant 's reflection told him that any one would be able to give the direction of Mr. Delancey 's store , and that Arthur , in such a case , would not be slow to make inquiry . He could but wait patiently , as there was no one near , either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice . He seated himself to write to his mother , deeming that his time could not be more dutifully passed . The letter was finished and sealed , and still no news of Arthur . Guly had seized his hat with the intent of going forth at all hazards , when the door of his room slowly opened , and Jeff 's shining face was thrust in . " Please , young massar , may I come in ? " " Certainly . Close the door . " The negro entered with a shuffling gait , holding a tattered straw hat in his hands , and with a bow and sheepish look stopped directly in front of Guly . " Anything I can do for you , Jeff ? " " Well , I hopes you 'll ' scuse my ' trusion , young massar , but I thought as dis was Sunday , mebbe you 'd be reading dat big book yourself , and would let me hear you . " " To be sure , Jeff , to be sure . Whenever that big book is read you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time I shall always be ready to read it to you . " " Oh , young massar , you is so good to de poor nigger -- sometimes when I look at you , I ca n't help tinking you'se just some angel as has lost his wings , and a-waiting on dis airth till they grow agin . " " Hush , Jeff . " " Yes , massar ; if you'se ready to read , I'se ready to listen . " Guly smiled at this misconstruction of his words , but opening the Bible he read aloud the fourteenth chapter of John ; while Jeff sat with his elbows on his knees , and his chin in his palms , his large eyes fixed attentively on the reader . When the chapter was finished , Guly took the different paragraphs , and in a simple but concise manner endeavored to explain all which was difficult for his listener to understand . " Thar ! " said Jeff , flinging his old hat emphatically upon the floor , as Guly ceased , " If that ai n't as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all ! Oh , young massar , if you 'd just call a meetin ' ob de clerks in dis store , and read and ' spound to ' em sometime in dis way , dar 'd be a better set in old massar 's bizness , to say the least . " " Your master 's clerks all seem to be well-disposed young men , I 'm sure , Jeff -- I never see them commit a wrong . " " You'se too good yousef to see evil , sah ; but mebbe de clerks is good when de Boss 's sharp eye is on ' em . " " Oh ! " exclaimed Guly , starting to his feet , and rapidly pacing the floor , " What a place of sin for a young inexperienced boy to be in , and under the influence of evil companions . Oh ! my brother ! my brother ! " " He 'll be home by night-time , Massar Gulian , in my ' pinion . I'se jus sorry I told you , sah , since you take on so , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I could n't help it . " Guly drew a chair near one of the windows , and though he could see neither sky above or brightness below , he gazed out upon the brick walls before him , and his thoughts flew backward to the past . From that hour of reflection Guly rose up wiser and older . He felt how much depended on himself , and decided that henceforth his watchful eye should ever be upon the brother , who , though so much older than himself , required so much of tender counsel and care . The sun was down when he again approached the table where Jeff still sat , turning over the leaves of the " Big Book . " " Massar Gulian , you look in your eyes as though you was gwine to pray . May I hear you ' fore I go ? " Guly bowed , and knelt beside his dusky friend ; and as he prayed , the great white tears rolled over Jeff 's cheeks , and fell down on the box by which he was kneeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good night , Jeff , " said Guly , holding out his hand . " Good night , young Massar ; God forever bress your heart . " Left alone , Guly sat down to patiently await the termination of what he could not possibly avert ; but the loneliness was so oppressive , the silence and darkness lay like such a weight upon his troubled heart , that he determined to descend to Wilkins ' room , and if he were there to remain with him . Having no light in his chamber , he opened the door , and slowly groped his way down the winding stairs . When he had nearly reached the foot he fancied he heard voices , and , surprised at such a sound coming from the direction of the head-clerk 's room , he paused to listen ; but the step on which he stood creaked loudly , and the voices ceased . Going cautiously on in the darkness , he reached the big desk , and further back saw a stream of light glimmering through the crevice of Wilkins ' door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had very much deceived him , Guly felt certain he was not alone . Not wishing to play the spy , the boy went forward , and was about to knock , when through the crevice of the door his eye fell upon a scene which again arrested his attention , and held him speechless . Wilkins was seated at a low table , writing , apparently answering a letter , which lay open before him , written in a peculiarly beautiful and delicate female hand . The light of the lamp fell full upon his face , which was very pale ; and his teeth were pressed hard into his under lip . Behind him , with one hand clasped upon the back of his chair , stood a young girl ; and though her features were of exquisite proportions and beautiful moulding , she displayed in the slight tinge of duskiness upon her skin , and the peculiar blackness of her large eyes , unmistakable proofs , to an experienced judge , of the quadroon blood in her veins . Her hair was long , and of midnight blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful scarf which covered her shoulders . Her forehead was high and fine , her eyebrows arched and delicately traced -- her nose free from all trace of her negro origin , and her lashes long and curving upon her round cheek . Her mouth was small , and the lips parted over teeth of the most perfect regularity ; but in this feature , more than in any other , as she stood watching Wilkins , as he wrote , there was an expression of proud bitterness , which came and went over those exquisite features , like gleams of lightning . As Wilkins finished writing , he carefully folded and sealed his letter , and handed it to the girl , without adding any superscription . " There , Minny , give her that ; but , remember how much depends upon your secresy . There 's a day coming when you shall meet your full reward for all you are doing for us now . " " Yes , Mr. Bernard , " she replied , addressing him by his first name , and speaking earnestly , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And tremble ! What do you mean ? " " Nothing , nothing ; no matter now . Give me a pass , and let me be gone ! The great gun has fired two hours ago ! " " You are too white to need a pass , Minny . " " Ay ! but I am a slave . " The bitter emphasis with which she uttered these last words sank deep into Guly 's young heart , and was the first intimation to him that she was not of unmixed origin . She looked so purely beautiful , as she stood there with that shade of scornful sadness on her face , that the boy forgot the part he was acting in standing there , and remained with his large eyes riveted upon her . " Here 's your pass , Minny ; but , mark me , it will not be claimed of you . " As he spoke Wilkins rose , and handed her the paper . She concealed the letter he had given her in her dress , then folded the pass between her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood still until how , watching her with a strange , eager expression on his face ; but as he saw her about to leave him he sprang suddenly forward , and throwing one of his huge arms about her waist , drew back her head with the other , and imprinted kiss after kiss upon her lips . She struggled wildly , but silently ; and at last , with an almost superhuman effort , freed herself from his grasp . She turned , as she did so , and lifting her small hand closely clenched , struck him furiously full in the mouth . The blood gushed over his lips ; and never , to the latest day of his existence , not even when he saw her lie cold and still in her coffin , did Guly forget the fearful expression in her pallid face , and the almost demoniacal glare in her black eye , as she marked the effect of her blow , and darted by him like some frightened bird , escaped from the spoiler 's net . He shrank further into the darkness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back part of the building , where the large windows descended to the floor . She flung one up hastily , and leaped through it to the ground . The next moment he heard the swift pattering of small feet in the alley , and the rustling of a woman 's dress , as if some one were running . The head clerk had thrown himself upon a couch , face downwards , after he received the blow , and Guly seeing he had been unobserved , thought best not to intrude upon him at this moment ; and with a quiet , cat-like tread , and trembling violently with the excitement of the scene he had witnessed , he groped his way back to his own chamber . An hour passed before he ventured to descend the stairs again ; and then he found Wilkins sitting as he had seen him in the morning , at the big desk , with his coat off , reading . " This is a late hour for you to be down stairs , my boy ! What has happened to make you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , but I am troubled . " And Guly stepped toward him , and laid one hand upon the desk , while he related to Wilkins all that he had felt with regard to his brother , since he parted from him in the morning . " Tut , tut ! " said he , shaking his head as the boy finished , " this is a bad business . If I had not thought you were together somewhere , I would have been with you . I 'm afraid your brother has got into bad company , which I should be sorry enough for , I promise you . " Wilkins spoke this in a tone of such kindly sympathy , at the same time laying one hand gently upon the golden head beside him , that Guly 's overwrought feelings could no longer be restrained ; and the tears gushed thickly from his eyes . " Do n't , " said Wilkins , tenderly , " do n't ! This will doubtless be the last time he will wander off in this way -- he is impulsive and yielding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in future . " Cheered , though not convinced , by Wilkins ' words , Guly once more sought his own room . He had never pressed that pillow alone before , and with a desolate and heavy heart , the golden lashes were allowed to droop , and the boy fell into a troubled slumber . Through a narrow chink in the roof above , a moonbeam stole , and nestled down beside him . It lay there in Arthur 's vacant place like the gleam of an angel 's smile ; and all it fell upon was purity and beauty . The night wore on . The boy slept , the moonbeam faded , and troubled dreams and desolate darkness alone remained behind . CHAPTER VII . Della . The city clocks were tolling midnight , and the moon rode high in the heavens . In one of the most elegant houses Apollo-street could boast , sat a young girl . The room in which she was sitting presented a scene of almost oriental ease and luxury . There was the rich carpet , giving back no echo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form sank as into down , the glittering chandeliers , the rare and exquisite vases , statuary , birds , books , and all that the capricious , self-willed spirit , which presided there , could wish to draw around her . The lights in the chandeliers had been extinguished ; and save that which crept in from the moon , and that emitted from a small night-lamp , burning behind its alabaster shade , the room lay in soft shadow . The long windows descended to the floor , and opened upon a balcony , from whence was wafted by the slight night-breeze , the delicate fragrance of the jasmine , mingled with that of rare roses , and other choice flowers . At the lower end of the balcony , a flight of steps descended to the garden , where the music of a tinkling fountain fell refreshingly on the ear . This part of the grounds was protected by a high brick wall , thickly overrun with luxuriant vines , which entirely concealed a small door , long left forgotten and unused by the proprietor of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little used save by the domestics , and thence egress was easy to the street . Seated upon a velvet cushion , the fair occupant of the apartment gazed eagerly out upon the garden-door . One slipper of small size and delicate hue lay a little distance from her , as if it had been cast impatiently from the unshod foot . Her brow was pressed against the window-sash , and every rustle of the vine-leaves , every whisper of the night-wind , had caused her to start violently , and called forth some low ejaculation of impatience or vexation . " Past twelve , and not here yet ! " she exclaimed , drawing from her belt a small French watch , glittering with jewels , and glancing at the hour with a frown . " Ah ! Dieu ! what can have happened now ? I shall be asleep before many minutes , unless --  " At this moment there came up from the garden a harsh grating sound , as of some one cautiously turning a key in a rusty lock . The listener started to her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were light steps upon the stairs -- a cautious tread upon the balcony -- and Minny , the Quadroon , sank at her mistress 's feet . " So , child , you 've come at last ! Where have you lingered this long , long time ? I am most distracted with watching for you , and my head aches terribly . " Minny lifted up her pale face , with the black hair falling in strong contrast around it , and the angry glitter not yet gone from her brilliant eye . " Lady , I have lingered nowhere unnecessarily . You bade me be cautious , and it takes time to take stealthy steps . Besides , I was obliged to wait before I could approach him , and then --  " " Enough , Minny ! and then he gave you a letter for me . Give it me , girl , quick ! " Minny drew the note from her bosom , and her mistress , approaching the lamp , put aside the shade which obscured it , and bent eagerly over the closely-written page she held . She read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the listless features , as she refolded it , and flung to the girl beside her to place in its delicate envelope . " Oh ! it is such a sweet note , Minny ; such a charming , delightful note ! How did he look , Min , when he was writing it ? Did he frown , and bite his lips , and grow pale , in that frightful way he has sometimes , or did he look handsome and happy ? " " His back was toward me , Miss . I could not see how he looked . " " Stupid Minny ! Another time get where you can look straight into those black eyes of his , and read what they say all the while . " " Another time I will , Miss . " " What 's the matter , Min ? Come here , child . How you frighten me . You are as pale as a ghost ! Tired with your long walk , that 's it , puss ! Kneel down here by me , and I 'll play nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young mistress drew toward her a bottle of lavender water , and poured it upon the bowed head before her ; putting it on with her own soft hands till the long black curls glittered with the bright drops , as if decked with diamonds . " There , Minny , you are better now . Wipe my hands and undress me . " With gentle , but trembling fingers , the girl proceeded to obey ; and as her mistress lay listlessly back in her large fauteuil , proceeded to remove each article of dress , without the slightest assistance from the languid form before her . The jewels were laid away in their velvet cases -- the ribbons folded and laid aside -- the rich robe placed in the armoire , and the frilled and embroidered robe de nuit placed upon her , and fastened with its gold buttons about her neck and wrists , with no more motion on the part of that passive figure , than if it had been a doll in the hands of a child . Finding herself ready for bed , the young lady arose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar was held up , while she laid herself upon the luxurious couch , and Minny arranged the scented pillow beneath the fair young head . " Anything more , Miss ? " " No , Minny ; yet stay ! That dear little note , hand it to me ; and the bottle of ottar of roses . " The white fingers of the heiress clasped the exquisitely cut bottle containing the precious perfume , and one clear drop was suffered to fall upon the snowy envelope of the note . She then pressed the paper to her lips , and laid it away beneath her pillow . " Anything more , my lady ? " " Yes , Minny . Did you ever have a lover ? Some one , Minny , to love you with all his heart , and swear he 'd die for you -- and to write you such tender letters -- and to -- and to --  " Della Delancey slept with the love-letter of Bernard Wilkins beneath her pillow . Minny had stood with every vestige of color faded from her cheek as her young mistress spoke , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to conceal . An expression of relief crossed her features , as her questioner fell away into slumber , and , hastening from the bedside , she sought the outer-room , and flung herself down into the large chair Della had so recently vacated . " Some one to love me , " she murmured , brokenly . " Ah ! yes , yes ! One who swore to love me ; one who vowed to cherish me , only to forget his oath . Fool ! idiot ! that I was , to thus yield up my passionate love , forgetful of my birth ! But did he not promise all ? Were we not wed ? God of the just -- who sees me -- yes ! yes ! yes ! " Springing to her feet , Minny paced the floor wildly . Her white closed teeth glittered through the portals of her parted lips -- her black eyes flashed and sparkled , and rained down the tears among the curls upon her bosom , while her white hands were clutched together , or wrung fiercely . She looked not unlike a personified tigress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly her whole aspect changed . The clutched hands unclasped , the tears ceased to fall , the knotted brow relaxed -- and , choking down her sobs , Minny approached the bedside of her young mistress . Softly she raised the rose-hued netting , and slid her hand beneath the pillow . It rested there a moment quietly , and then was gently withdrawn , holding the note tightly . Gliding away with her treasure , she seated herself by the lamp , and perused its contents . Every word , every line , every expression of endearment , and every sentence of fondness , she drank eagerly in , and seemed to write upon her heart . Again and again she read it ; but there were no more signs of emotion , save that now and then her teeth were pressed tight into her lip , or her hand laid hard against her heart . CHAPTER VIII . The Prisoners . What pen can describe the anguish of Arthur , when he found himself the inmate of a watch-house ! His arrest had completely sobered him , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he found it impossible to overcome . His companion treated the whole affair with the utmost indifference , and when the key was turned upon them had thrown himself heavily upon a bench , and immediately gone off into a drunken slumber . There were a few other prisoners besides themselves , bearing such a villainous , cut-throat appearance that Arthur shuddered as he looked at them . As his sickness in a measure subsided , he threw himself face downwards upon the hard , unyielding bench , and to escape the jeers of his companions , drew himself close up in a corner near the door , and pretended to be asleep . But alas ! no sleep came to those burning eyeballs through those long -- long hours , and though racked with a torturing headache and feverish thirst , he knew no way to relieve himself , and dared not move lest he should again encounter the ridicule of the brutes around him . He thought of himself as he was a few short hours before , wending his way to church at his brother 's side , happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the love and esteem which he felt were but his due . He contrasted the morning with the night ; and saw himself the inmate of a guard-house , herding with men whose very breath seemed crime and profanation , and whose every word was blackened with oaths or curses . He felt that the stain of guilt was on his hitherto pure brow , traced there by the finger of a justly angry God , whose laws he had violated , whose commands he had broken , and whose day he had abused . He thought of the coming morning , with the public trial , when he would be turned forth with the stamp of a thief or drunkard upon him , and the finger of scorn pointing derisively at him . He thought of his blue-eyed , pure-minded brother , mourning his absence , and weeping over his shame . He remembered his mother -- and the hot tears , so long pent up , gushed like raindrops through his trembling fingers , and bathed the hands which held that stricken head . A sense of weight and oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping , he sprang from his recumbent position . A glow of relief crossed his features as he saw that all the men around him were asleep , and glancing through the barred window he saw the streaks of light in the east , announcing the approach of day . At this moment he heard the key turned in the lock , and thinking that other prisoners were about being admitted , and not caring either to see or be seen by them , he again threw himself full length upon the bench . An instant more and a gush of cool air swept , over him , and a hand fell cautiously on his shoulder . He raised his head , and met the twinkling eyes of Mr. Clinton fixed upon him . " Hush ! " whispered Clinton , laying his finger on his lips , as he saw Arthur about to speak . " Not a word ; pick yourself up as noiselessly as you can , and get out of this hole . You are free . " Arthur glanced towards the door , and saw there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogged expression of countenance in the gray light , and shaking nervously in his hand a gold coin . He comprehended in a moment , as it were instinctively , that Clinton had procured his release by a bribe ; and though he felt to rejoice in his freedom , he shrunk at feeling that he must be under obligations to such a man for it . He drew his hat over his eyes , and went out softly . As he gained the open air , Quirk joined him , leaning on the arm of Mr. Clinton , and evidently not yet wholly recovered from what he was pleased to denominate a " dem fine spree . " " See what it is to have a friend , mon cher ! " exclaimed Clinton , slapping Arthur upon the shoulder . " But for our acquaintance to-day , you might have come up for trial this morning , and been sent down for thirty days . ' Oh ! my boy , always consider me one of you . ' " " Had I not so far forgotten myself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never seen the inside of such a place as this . Whatever expense you may have encountered in my behalf , this night , Mr. Clinton , consider me accountable for , and ready to refund at any moment . " Arthur spoke proudly , and experienced a sentiment of utter disgust , as he looked upon the two beings who had led him into sin , and been witnesses to his weakness . He felt that , in a measure , his good name lay in their hands , but he could not bend that proud spirit -- humbled and chastened though it then was -- to treat them in the slightest degree as his equals , or to accept , unrequited , any favor from such a source . " Do n't be huffy , boy , " said Clinton , again ; " and do n't insult me by offering pay for what I 've done ! It 's what I 'd expect you to do for me in such a case , and I reckon I 'd be a little grateful for it , too . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the spout of a public hydrant at the same moment , and drinking a long draught . " You see , Clint , he 's a fresh hand at this kind of life , and do n't know the ropes yet . Let him alone . " Arthur deigned not the slightest reply to this , and hastily turning into a side-street , left Mr. Clinton considerably in the rear , to bring up his " dear friend Quirk . " Free from the companionship of beings whom he detested , Arthur removed his hat , and lifted his brow to receive the breath of heaven . The sun was not yet risen , and save the occasional clatter of a market-cart , as it went jostling by , or the sluggish step of some sleepy servant , on his way to procure the breakfast for his fastidious owners , there was no signs of life or business in the streets . Arthur was glad of this , and he thought of the alley-way between the store and the adjoining building , and the steep stairs which led from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he happened to have the key of this door about him , he hoped to effect an entrance by this way , and , if possible , to conceal from his brother the fact of his having been absent all night . Elated by this prospect , he struck into a brisk pace toward Charles-street , and , having gained it , hurried rapidly onward in the direction of the store . He was within two blocks of his destination when two figures suddenly turned the corner ahead , and advanced towards him . There was no mistaking the slender form of the one with golden ringlets floating from his brow , and the tall , stalwart figure of the other was instantly recognized by Arthur , though part of the face was concealed by a handkerchief , tied over the mouth , as if the wearer was suffering from tooth-ache . There was no way of retreat , save to turn short round , and go back , which was something that pride would not permit him to do ; so assuming as bold an air as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked on and met Guly and Wilkins , face to face . " Ah ! Arthur , good morning , " said the latter , indifferently , as if nothing had happened ; " I see you are enjoying a stroll , as well as ourselves , this fine morning . " " Mr. Wilkins has been showing me about the city , " said Guly , taking his brother 's hand , " and giving me such directions about the streets as will enable me to go round alone . " " If your walk is not finished allow me to join you , " returned Arthur , slipping his hand through his brother 's arm , and turning back with them . He was evidently surprised at the cool manner in which his absence was treated , and had been very far from expecting such a reception . From Guly , at least , he had thought to hear some exclamations of joy at his return , some questions and many reproofs . But this was the course which Wilkins had advised to be pursued before they started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , undoubtedly , the best mode they could have hit upon -- for , to have questioned him , to have rebuked him , would have been to again arouse that fierce pride , and call forth some false excuse for his behavior . As it was , he was left to believe that Wilkins was unaware of what had passed , and that Guly only guessed half the truth , or , if he did , was kind enough to conceal his thoughts . This roused a glow of generous feeling , and he felt that he could only be happy in confessing all to his brother . The three walked on , chatting carelessly about indifferent matters , until Wilkins declared it to be breakfast time ; when they turned back toward their restaurant . As usual , the head clerk ordered his bottle of claret , and , as it was brought on , he offered it to Arthur . An expression of ineffable disgust crossed the youth 's face as he refused it , which Wilkins remarked with a quiet , half-concealed smile . It was with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his place in the store that morning . He could not plead illness as a pretext for absence , for there was one who he knew would be there that knew his secret all too well , and he could not trust him with it . As there were but few customers in that morning , however , he drew a stool behind the counter , and seated himself ; an act which placed at defiance one of the strictest rules of the establishment . He had scarcely done so when Mr. Delancey entered the door , and passed up between the lines of clerks , with his cold eyes , as usual , turning rapidly hither and thither , never looking for the right , but always for the wrong . As his glance fell upon Arthur he stopped short , and , in a tone loud enough to be heard all over the store , exclaimed :  --  " Have n't you been here long enough , young man , to know better than to sit down during business hours ? " Arthur rose and put away his stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling quite well that morning . " It 's very evident , " returned the merchant , running his practised eye over the wan lines of Arthur 's face , " that you 've been having a Sunday night spree , in order , I s'pose , to have a Monday morning benefit . But it wo n't do here ; stick to your post , and if I catch you in that lounging position again , you lose your place . " Without another word the merchant walked to the big desk , holding the head of his walking stick against his lips as he went . Arthur raised his eyes , and although he had striven all the morning to avoid it , he caught the gaze of Charley Quirk fixed upon him , and received a quick , sly wink from his left eye . That wink affected him like a blast of winter wind , and he felt chilled all over . The thought rushed upon him , too , that Charley had been keeping up an artillery of winks like that , to the other clerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured that his case was understood throughout the house . Wilkins , who had been regarding him steadily from behind the open door , stepped down from his place , and , sauntering towards the proprietor , addressed a few words to him in an under tone . The merchant nodded in reply , impatiently , and waved his hand . The head clerk came back again , and laying his hand on Arthur 's shoulder , said , quietly :  --  " I overheard you , I think , saying to Mr. Delancey you were not quite well . You are unacclimated , remember , and must take care of yourself . Go up stairs , and see if lying down awhile will not restore you . " Although Arthur felt certain now , that Wilkins knew all , he felt inexpressibly grateful for his apparent ignorance of it , and his kindness towards him , and showed as much in his manner . " You hesitate -- would you rather not go ? " " To tell the truth , Wilkins , I dislike to pass Mr. Delancey on my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my place is vacant , and perhaps discharge me . " " No ! You have his permission to go ; your place will be taken care of by the next clerk . " " You are very kind . " " No -- not a bit of it . " With a smile upon his pale lips , Arthur stepped out of the front-door , and turned into the narrow alley , which lay between the store and the adjoining building , and which was arched overhead , damp under foot , and hung with dirt and cobwebs . He reached a small door at the further end , which led to the right into a narrow paved court , where was a hydrant , which the clerks used for washing and drink . He stopped here for a moment , to bathe his burning brow and quench his parching thirst . As he bent down to place his lips to the faucet , a dark figure sprang out from beneath the staircase behind , and darted through the alley door , and out of sight . Startled and surprised , Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining the street , looked anxiously up and down , in a vain hope of seeing some one who would satisfy his curiosity as to who or what it was ; for it had passed him so fleetly and lightly , that he could almost believe it had been a shadow . He could see nothing , however ; but catching a glimpse of Mr. Clinton , leisurely sauntering down the other side of the street , smoking a cigar , he hurried back , lest he should be seen by him , and locked the alley door behind him , saying , as he did so --  " It was a careless trick in whoever left that open ; I 'll see to it myself in future ; " and then walked back to inspect the hiding-place of the shadow , or whatever it was . It was the niche formed by the steep flight of stairs ; and , as there was a number of old barrels there , and other rubbish , it afforded a fine place for concealment , especially on a dark night . As it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back had in the first place been toward it , whoever was there had evidently feared detection , when he should turn round , and so fled . Into this court the long windows of the back part of the store opened , and it was this way that Minny had found egress on the night of her visit to Wilkins ; and it was this way that Jeff , whose invariable honesty rendered him a privileged character about the place , always found egress on Sundays , and other hours when the store was closed . Musing upon the circumstances which had just occurred , Arthur took the way to his room , and flung himself upon his bed . It was easy to see what had been Guly 's occupation during the previous day of loneliness . There lay the Bible open , on the little rough stand ; there was the strip of carpet rumpled before the chair , where he had been kneeling -- and there was the folded letter , sealed and directed to his mother . Arthur turned upon his pillow with a moan . How differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consequence , were his Monday morning reflections ! But his sorrow was not a repentant sorrow . It had been in the morning , when he first met Guly and Wilkins , but he was changed now . Had he not been rebuked harshly by his employer , in the presence of all the clerks ? Had he not been openly accused of the error he had committed , read through and through by those cold , staring eyes ? Had not the attention of all the clerks been turned towards him , and his secret been laid bare to them by the merchant 's reproof , and quick , malicious glances ? There was no longer any need of further concealment , with the resolution of future improvement -- it was all known -- and to draw back henceforth , would be but to be reminded that he had already fallen once , and could never retake the step he had made . Such was the view Arthur took of the case , however false a light his pride may have cast upon it ; and he buried his face , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while , with bitter resentment , his young heart traced it all back to the primal cause -- the contemptuous repulse he had met with at Delancey 's pew door . It is not a question for reflection , where the punishment for Arthur 's first real sin should rest ? Was it for that young heart , till now free from all taint or corruption , save the corruption of pride , to suffer alone ? or was it for the older and stronger spirit -- the spirit stronger still in pride , and so much older in firmness , and power , and discipline , to bear its share ? CHAPTER IX . Contrition . At noontime Guly told Wilkins that if he would bring him a trifle of fruit from the Restaurant , or something of that kind , he would spend the time allowed him for dinner with his brother , and would much prefer it . Wilkins very cordially assented , and Guly mounted the winding stairs slowly and thoughtfully , pushed open the old door at the head of the staircase , which was covered with the big-lettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar was drawn back ; and , fully dressed , Arthur lay upon the humble bed . Perhaps the first plunge into dissipation leaves a deeper impression on youthful beauty , than the continued practice begun in older years . Guly was startled at the change in his brother 's features , which one night of excitement had wrought . He could see it now , as he lay there sleeping , more perfectly than when he had been with him in the morning , with his face full of ever-varying expression . There was a wasting upon the skin ; deep black marks beneath the eyes ; the lips were pale , and the nose seemed pinched ; and his whole appearance was that of one convalescing after a severe fit of sickness . Guly approached , and taking a low seat by the bedside , laid his face softly down beside his brother 's on the pillow , and reaching over , clasped his fingers gently round one burning hand . He lay quite still , with his eyes fixed upon the sleeper 's face . Who could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rushing through that throbbing heart , as it nestled there closer and closer , to all it held dear in that distant land ? The blue eyes filled suddenly full of tears , bright and pure , even as that boy 's path of life had ever been , and dropped down , one by one , upon the pillow . There was no visible cause for them , but they kept falling , those pure bright tears , till the fair cheeks over which they fell were bathed , and the pillow damped . Was there a shadow-like presentiment creeping over that young spirit then , telling him to nestle close , close , for the time was coming when those two hearts would throb no more beside each other , and that the waves of life 's ocean would some day cast one upon the shore , and bear the other far out to sea ? Even so ! It was dim , ghost-like , and undefined ; but still the shadow flitted there darkly ! The sleeper turned restlessly , and uttered a plaintive moan . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy ; as if the grief in the heart beside him had crept into his own . He lifted one arm wearily , and it fell back upon the pillow , and the unconscious fingers lifted the rings of jetty hair from the fevered brow . That bright brow ! that pale , proud brow ! how it gleamed out in contrast with those glossy curls . Guly gazed upon it , then lifted his head and kissed it ; and the tears , still quivering on his lashes , fell upon it -- that brother 's brow ! Arthur opened his eyes , and gazed up steadily at the face bent over him . There was something in the expression of that face which went over his heart like a strain of touching music . He could not bear that it should be turned away from him , or that he should lose it , and he raised both hands , and , laying them among the silken curls , held it there . " Oh , Guly ! Guly ! do you know all ? " " Dear Arthur ! do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrowed for me ; you have grieved , and been silent , and unreproachful . Oh , Guly ! what a wretch I am ! " " Hush , Arthur ! oh , do n't , do n't ! " The tears fell down again , unrestrainedly , upon that pale brow , gleaming up from the jetty locks , and for a moment neither spoke . " I feel , Guly , as though I had taken a long leap into sin -- such a long one , that I shall never get back ; and everything seems at work to keep me in it . What shall I ever , ever do -- I am so weak -- so -- so --  " " Oh , Arthur , look up -- look ever up . God 's finger points out the way to you from the sky ; trust yourself to its holy guidance , and be strong . " " Guly , I ca n't . It seems a long while since I prayed at all -- since yesterday I seem to have lived an age , and it is black , all black ! " " Nay , Arthur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your sight is darkened ; but the Great Shepherd calls to you with His gentle voice to return . Listen , and obey . " " I should only fall again . " " Trust , and you shall be strengthened . " " Oh , Guly , I have not your mind nor heart . I can not be patient , and meek , and charitable , through all things , as you can ; I have so much pride that I can not calmly bear reproof , and here I am fretted , and crushed , and ridiculed into sin all the time , and am too weak to make resistance . " " Try , and remember in your heart how we are here . Bear in your mind that we no longer have the wealth or influence that we once had ; and that if we ever are to have them again , depends upon the way we acquit ourselves here . Learn to bear and forbear ; and in the end , Arthur , you will come out so brightly , with your pride perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more be happy . " Arthur sighed . " And oh , Arthur ! oh , my brother ! think , we two are all to each other here . We have nought to lean upon save each other 's love and Him . Dear Arthur , if you should -- if one of us should be led into temptation , and should fall , and should go down into the pit of sin , what a blank would be the existence of the other ! Oh ! let us pray that our hearts may be bound together , and that no shadow may be allowed to fall upon or divide us . " " Oh , Guly , Guly ! " Arthur started up , and throwing his arms about his brother 's form , as he crept up closer to his side , drew the bright head down upon his bosom , and held it there , rocking backwards and forwards where he sat . " Pray God , indeed ! " he murmured , earnestly , lifting his swimming eyes to Heaven , " that I may sin no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dear love , which is to us as the thread of life ; and oh ! may He whose ways are the ways of righteousness , take us by the hand , like little children , and guide our steps aright . " " Amen ! Amen ! " CHAPTER X. The Merchant at Home . It was late when Della awoke , and Minny lay with her cheek on her hand , just fallen into her first sleep . " Minny ! Minny ! " " Bernard ! " murmured the girl , in her half-disturbed sleep . " Minny , I say ! " " Yes , Miss . " " Bring me my watch , Min , and show me the hour . Did n't I hear you say ' Bernard , ' just now , in your sleep ? You have n't any Bernard ; that 's for me to say . " " No , Miss , I have n't any Bernard . " " Well , then , you should n't talk so in your sleep . " " True enough . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Bernard you mea n't , I am quite sure . May be you were talking about those priests on that great snowy mountain , somewhere in the world , which you made me so sleepy reading about the other evening ? " " The Monks of St. Bernard , Miss . " " Yes ; how droll ! " " Will you get up , Miss Della ? " " Yes ; how late , Min ? I forgot to look , after all . " " A quarter past nine . " " Papa must have gone . " " He never goes down street before seeing you . " " Dear papa ! Minny , wheel my little chair in front of the dressing-glass . I 'll be with you in a second . " " It is ready , Miss . " " There , Min , I left my note under my pillow ! Bring it , and let me read it again while you dress my hair . " Minny obeyed . " Minny , I wonder if it 's as delightful to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems strange to hear you talking about either , Miss . " " Why , Minny , I am old enough , I am sure . " " Yes , but you seem so very young ; no one thinks about your being married yet . " " Mother does . " " Not to this man , Miss Della . For worlds I would n't dictate ; but , Miss , if all this secresy and deceit ends as it seems it will , is n't it going to break your mother 's heart ? " " I expect so , Minny ; every mother 's heart is broken when her daughter gets married ; but it heals up always , and is as good as ever . " Oh ! Della , Della ! " But , Miss , when she finds how deceitful you have been , after all her doting kindness , and love , and --  " " Do n't be tiresome , Minny . Deceitful ! oh , that 's awful -- you know I never was deceitful . " " No , no ! There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but when it is discovered , I say , think what a house of misery this will be . " " Well , Minny , if there 's misery it wo n't be my fault , I 'm sure . You know very well that papa would n't have me notice Bernard , much more than I would Black Voltaire . If he would , do n't you suppose I would be very glad to show him all my letters , and to tell him how we love each other , and all that ? But now , if I did , he 'd rave , and go into a furious passion , shut me up , maybe , and send Bernard to Europe , or some other horrid place . Oh , I should be frightened to death . " " That 's the very thing , Miss ; he looks so high for you . " " Bernard is just as high as papa was when he first came here ,  - -  but there 's another thing ; do n't you know I 'm not allowed to see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very instant that a gentleman calls , and says he 'd like to see Miss Della , does n't papa or mamma , or that provoking old governess , march straight into the parlor , and receive them before me ? And is n't it very provoking ? Why , even little Charley Devans , a boy three years younger than I , called to tell me a little innocent secret his sister had sent by him , and was n't there mamma , as straight as a marshal , in one chair , and my governess , stiff as my new parasol-top , in the other , and he could n't say a word ? But you know he met me in the street that day you walked out with me , and told me all about it . " " Yes , Miss , but this is all for your good . " " No , Minny , it is all for my hurt . Though , maybe , they do n't know it . Now , do n't you see that if young Mr. Devans could have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have planned a clandestine meeting , and so make me do a very naughty thing , by walking alone with him , after having been charged never to walk alone with any gentleman ? " " Yes , Miss . " " Well , Minny , I do n't often reflect , you know -- but the other day , after I had received a note from Bernard , I sat down and reflected a long time . And it was on this subject . And I came to the conclusion , that all this watching -- just raise that bandeau a trifle higher -- and spying , for it is nothing else , on the part of mammas and governesses , has a very bad tendency , indeed . Do n't you see that it throws a kind of mystery about the men , and , right away , young girls -- and it 's natural for young girls to be curious -- want to find out what there is so very awful about them , and go to work to do it ? " Minny looked up surprised ; she had never heard her mistress talk so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minny , see how many very young girls get married to men almost old enough to be their grandfathers , here . Ca n't you see the reason ? It 's so that they can be their own mistresses , and say and do what they like . I 've had them tell me so after marriage ; and then they 're almost always sure to begin to flirt a little , and enjoy themselves in this happy way they ought to have been left to do when single ; and then their old curmudgeons of husbands get jealous , and angry , and then there are dreadful times ! Oh , dear ! I think it is a terrible state of society ! " Now , Minny , I 'll tell you just how I feel when a gentleman calls here . There 's mamma , and maybe the governess , in the parlor ( now I would rather have them there than not , if I did n't know just what they were there for ; ) well , the governess fixes her eyes on me when I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget your Grecian bend ; ' and mamma looks down at my feet , and seems to say , ' Be sure and turn out your toes '  - -  and the consequence is , I forget both , and feel red all over , and know that I 'm acting like a very silly little fool . I sit down , and both pairs of those eyes are on me ; and both pairs of those ears are wide open , and I 'm as ungraceful as a giraffe ; when I know , if left to act naturally , and was n't watched all the time , I could appear very well . Then a young man here , no matter of how high family he is , or how good or how worthy , if he happens to be ever so poor , and feels as if he 'd like to take some young lady to a play or concert , or anything , he 's not only got to take her , but two or three duennas to keep himself and her straight ; and it 's such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's always poor ; and then mothers turn up their noses at him , and say he 's not eligible , and all that . " Who could have been more strict , as it is called , with any daughter than Madame Gerot with Louise ? Yet see how admirably she turned out ! Mon Dieu ! it was frightful ! Then there 's a dozen other cases I could cite almost like her . I tell you , Minny , young people ca n't learn each other 's characters at all , unless they 're alone by themselves a little time . But here , a man must pay his devoirs , and make his proposals , with a third person 's eyes upon him all the time ; and has almost to court the mother as much as the daughter , if not more . Oh ! these things make courting very unpleasant , and marriage sometimes very unhappy , when both should be the happiest seasons of one 's life . Ah , me ! it 's very hard to have mothers always act as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . " " Do daughters prove themselves trustworthy always , Miss , when they are left alone ? " " If mothers would make daughters trustworthy , Minny , I tell you they must trust them . Society is not conducted in this manner in the North , yet I believe the young people there are better by far than they are here . But I do n't care much about it now . I used to -- but I shall be married some day to the man I want , and be happy in my own way . " There , Minny , does that fold , just arranged , look well ? Do I appear quite elegant and pretty now ? " " Quite , Miss . " " What a long lecture I 've read you , Minny . I feel quite exhausted , I declare , and quite like going to bed again . Here 's Bernard 's letter -- put it with the rest , and take precious , precious care of it . " Fanning herself languidly , Della moved slowly away towards the breakfast-room . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an obsequious bow , and she stood in the presence of her parents . " Dear dort ! " cried her mother , ( making as she thought an affectionate abbreviation of daughter , ) " what is the matter that you look so flushed and excited this morning ? Your cheeks are really vulgarly red ; dear me , I hope they 'll pale off a little before evening . " " Good morning , Della , " said Mr. Delancey , formally , who even at home sat in his usual position , bolt upright in his chair ; " good morning ; I 'm glad to see that you have acquired a graceful manner of entering a breakfast-room . " " If I keep on improving , papa , you will give me the promised winter in Havana I suppose ? " " I suppose so , my child . I wish to make you very happy . " There was a softness in Mr. Delancey 's cold eyes , as he spoke , which one would no sooner have expected to see there , than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter could bring it there . " Miss Della , " said the governess , " your attitude is a trifle too stiff -- a little more of the bend , if you please . " Miss Della tipped a little . " Dort , darling , " said Mrs. Delancey , " pray do n't display such an appetite -- it is really frightful to see you eat so much . A young lady like you should be very delicate at table . " " And pay long visits to the cupboard between meals , eh , mamma ? " Mr. Delancey looked anxiously to note the progress his daughter had made in the viands before her . " Do n't do anything outre in public , Della , no matter what you are obliged to do in private . " " No , papa . " " I want to see you very perfect in all things ,  - -  in all things , Della -- do you understand ? " " Yes , papa . " " Make it your aim to be everything a young lady can be . Remember you are all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are upon you -- try never , never to disappoint me ! " Mr. Delancey rarely spoke so feelingly -- it was a rare manner for him , and the effect of his words was very strange . Della 's elegantly embroidered kerchief was clasped suddenly to her face , and she burst into a violent fit of weeping . " Della , how un-self-possessed ! you astonish me . " " You should n't have made that allusion to her brother , " said Mrs. Delancey , sympathizingly . " Dry your eyes immediately , Della ; I am ready to go , " said her father , sternly . Della choked back her tears , and rising , approached her father , and gracefully put her lips to his forehead , and gave the usual morning kiss . " No more scenes to-day , Della . " " No , papa . " The door closed , and he was gone . CHAPTER XI . " Then I 'll look up ; My fault is past . But oh , what form of prayer Can serve my turn ? Try what repentance can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when one can not repent ? " Hamlet . When Guly returned to his place that afternoon , Arthur was at his side ; and when both raised their eyes to Wilkins ' face , as they passed him , he read there an expression of calm tranquillity , such a trustful , happy look of hopefulness , that he could not restrain the cheering smile of encouragement , which came up to his lips in answer . A great change had taken place in Arthur 's face -- or rather in its expression . There was no longer the glance of proud defiance in the eye -- the flash of wounded pride upon the cheek , or curl of scorn upon the lip . All was subdued and quiet , and seemed to whisper of a peaceful , contrite heart . Still he studiously avoided the eye of Charley Quirk , and also seemed to wish to appear oblivious of the presence of the flint-eyed being sitting stiffly at the high desk . He could not trust himself to meet the gaze of either , lest the storm of pride and revenge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full force ,  - -  sweeping away , with its ocean strength , all the great resolves of future good , which he had piled up as a barrier against the door of evil in his heart . Though his sleep in a degree refreshed him , his head still ached ; and throughout his whole frame he experienced that feverish debility and painful soreness ever attendant upon a night of dissipation and exposure . With a firm heart Arthur filled his place , and performed his duties unshrinkingly , cheered and encouraged by the beaming face of his brother , which ever and anon was turned toward him , with such a look of happy confidence and love , that it could not fail to carry inspiration with it . Then night came ; and after the goods , which during the day had been pulled down , were properly replaced , Guly took his brother 's arm , and started out for a walk . They strolled slowly along toward the Place D'Arms , which then possessed all that natural beauty , in the shape of its green lawns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard as an eyesore , and to remove for ever thence . They were silent ; for the mind of each was busily occupied with its own reflections ; reflections good and effective in themselves , yet to which neither wished at that moment to give utterance , and no allusion , however distant , was made to the events of the previous day . Suddenly , a trembling hand was laid on Guly 's arm , and a supplicating voice murmured humbly : " Un picayune , Monsieur ; in pity , Monsieur , one picayune to buy me bread . " By the light of a street lamp , Guly saw a pale and wrinkled face , in which deep lines of grief or misfortune were deeply traced , raised pleadingly toward him . The face was so old , yet so very much lower than himself , that he at first thought the speaker must be in a sitting posture there , beneath the lamp . But a second glance showed to his wondering gaze the veriest dwarf his eyes had ever fallen upon . In height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ; yet the head was very large , the face possessed of its full growth of cunning and experience , the shoulders broad , but painfully humped , and the whole upper portion of the body immensely too large for the short and slender limbs , which served for its support . And yet , as if all this wretched deformity were not enough , one leg was shorter than the other , and the foot was a club one . To assist him in walking , he carried a pair of crutches , apparently much too long for him , which raised his spindle arms in their loose sockets , and rendered the hump more horrible . When he moved , his crutches spread out on either side of him , as he swung along between them , taking up a vast deal of room without any apparent necessity . His coat had apparently been the property of some great man of the previous century , for it was braided and embroidered , and trimmed to an extent rarely seen in the present age ; and the immense holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughed heartily at the rusty trimmings which it bore . It was so long and large too , that it almost precluded the necessity of any other clothes , for it quite enveloped his whole person , as he swung along between his crutches , dragged on the ground behind like the train of a lady 's dress . His pantaloons had also once belonged to some full grown specimen of humanity , but had been torn off to suit the dimensions of the present owner -- and , altogether , the appearance of this miserable object , with his one blind eye , and the cunning leer in the other , was calculated to excite both pity and disgust . The brothers looked upon him for a moment in mute astonishment , until again startled by that squeaking , supplicating voice --  " Un picayune , Monsieur -- one picayune to buy me bread ! " Guly took a dime from his purse , and dropped it into the ragged cap which the beggar extended , while he held his crutches by pressing his arms close to his body . As the piece dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greasy folds , and tipped his left eye down to look upon it , not unlike a vulture glancing down at its prey . After eyeing it a moment , he held the cap toward Arthur , as if expecting something from that quarter . Arthur had already searched every pocket for the change , which he felt certain was there the day before ; but , to his utter astonishment , it was all gone , together with a very beautiful portemonnaie his mother had given him when he left her , and in which , the day before , he had placed two ten dollar bills , for the purpose of sending home when he should write . He knew he could not have spent it all in yesterday 's rout , and the conviction forced itself painfully upon his mind that he had been robbed . As the mendicant held forth his cap , he shook his head , and showed his empty hands , at which movement the old man raised his eyebrows inquisitively , and muttered a most disagreeable and chuckling " Hih ! hih @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dime with trembling fingers , and slipped it quickly into some unseen deposit about his person ; then , with one more lift of his grey brows , adjusted his crutches , and swung himself away . The brothers gazed after the receding figure , until the mist entirely obscured it , and the skirts of the long coat could no longer be heard trailing on the pavement ; then , again linking their arms , proceeded on their way . Although Guly dwelt wonderingly upon the incident they had just met with , Arthur maintained a moody silence ; nor could aught that his brother said , direct his thoughts from the new course the recent event had turned them upon . The time had been , when the loss he had met with would have been regarded as one of no importance whatever ; but he felt now , and deeply felt , that it was more than he could afford to spend foolishly , more than even his generous impulses would have allowed him to charitably dispose of , and more by far than he could patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his good resolutions of the morning in a measure melted away before his indignant resentment , and vague plans were floating through his mind , as to how he might and would recover it , the bearing he should feel called upon to assume when next he met Mr. Clinton , &c.,; &c.; To tell Guly of the loss he had sustained , after some reflection , he decided was out of the question . True , he had been gentle and forbearing with regard to all that had passed , but he would not reveal this new discovery to him -- perhaps dreading more the rebuking silence of those loving lips , than the stormy reproaches he might have met with from another source . Guly had seen that nothing had been bestowed upon the beggar by his brother ; but he forbore to question him , lest it should lead them upon a subject unpleasant to both ; and thus grew up the first concealment between those hitherto confiding hearts . Reaching the square , they passed through the gate , and turned into a grassy walk , to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strolling on , they came suddenly upon a figure reclining at full length upon a bench , and smoking a cigar . As they approached , there was something in the man 's appearance that seemed to startle Arthur , for he clutched his brother 's arm closer , and turned abruptly to the left ; but he was too late to pass unperceived , for , with a bound , the reclining figure gained its feet , and in an instant more Arthur 's hand received a cordial grasp , while Mr. Clinton , as nicely dressed , as neatly curled , and as delicately perfumed as ever , stood before him . CHAPTER XII . " How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds Makes ill deeds done ! " " My dear fellow , how glad I am to meet you ! " cried Clinton , cordially extending his hand in a manner which permitted the diamond on his finger to catch the light , in what he thought a most bewildering glitter . Arthur would have shunned him , as his new resolutions and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful form half-bent for his greeting , there was that smiling face , looking its hearty " How are you ? " there was the social yet searching glance of that glittering eye , all saying , " Shake hands with me , " and Arthur did . " Mr. Clinton , how do you do ? " " Well , my boy , well ; really hope you 've got over the effects of your Carrolton ride . By-the-by , Quirk got you into that muss , not I , by Jove ! You were inclined to be a little huffy this morning ; however you were excusable -- that 's all forgotten . You 'll do me justice now -- there , give me your hand again , and tell me you consider me one of you . " Arthur 's generous heart could not withstand this merry , good-humored , yet apparently sincere appeal , and the hand was again given . He thought , too , that he might have been unjust in his reflections about Clinton , for he had met him only by chance on his way to Carrolton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , but had only joined him in what he was already doing . Then , had he not kindly been the means of liberating him from the watch-house , when he might otherwise have been left to meet the shame and expense of a public trial ? Verily , he had much for which to be grateful to Mr. Clinton , and with one of those sudden impulses , natural to a hasty temper and impetuous spirit , he sought instantly to make amends for what now seemed the unjust and unkindly sentiments he had all day been entertaining toward his new friend . " Mr. Clinton , I fear I have blamed you most wrongfully . However , let all this , as you say , be forgotten . " " That 's it , my boy , I knew I was n't mistaken in you . You 've just the heart there , in your bosom , that I was sure you had when I first saw you . Believe me , I am proud to know that heart . " Arthur was but human , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed without the aid of sweetmeats . He could not but remember , with a great deal of compunction , the great wrong he had , as he felt , done Clinton in harboring towards him such unkindly thoughts . " Oh , Mr. Clinton , pray pardon my neglect ! " said he , suddenly turning toward that young gentleman . " Allow me to make you acquainted with my brother . Gulian -- Mr . Clinton . " Guly bowed distantly . Those young eyes had seen deeper into the heart before him , in the few minutes that he had been an observer of its impulses , than Arthur had seen , or at least decided upon , in forty-eight hours of mingled acquaintanceship and reflection . True , the boy knew but little of the world ; but there are some , and they are not the worldly and suspicious , but the pure-minded and gentle , that shrink intuitively from a polluting presence , scarce knowing from what they shrink . There was much in Mr. Clinton which Guly saw to dread , as a companion for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was assured it was one of Arthur 's yesterday acquaintances , and felt a pang of disappointment at not seeing him differently received by his brother . " Where are you strolling ? " asked Mr. Clinton , breaking a pause , which had followed Guly 's cool reception of himself . " Merely out for a walk , " returned Arthur ; " it 's only before and after business hours , you know , that we have time for recreation . " " True , true , " replied the other , stroking his chin , and speaking in a commiserating tone . " Ah , that must be terribly dull business , for young chaps like you . I always pity a clerk . " " Indeed , sir , " said Guly , " we neither deserve nor need pity ; we have everything to make us contented and happy in our new situation , and appreciate it , I assure you . " Mr. Clinton glanced for an instant keenly at the speaker , then answered , with a light laugh :  --  " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark beyond myself ; in fact , it 's something I never could stand . " " We have extended our walk as far as we intended for to-night , have we not , brother ? Mr. Clinton , we bid you good evening , " said Guly , as they , for the third time , gained the gate by which they had entered the square . Mr. Clinton looked up in astonishment . " No ! you do n't mean to leave so ? Come , let 's just step over to Royal-street , and take a glass of soda-water . You will find it so refreshing . " Poor Arthur " felt his pockets bare , " and was about to refuse , when Mr. Clinton slipped a hand through his arm , and drew him with him , saying , as he did so :  --  " You know it 's my treat this time , Pratt . Do n't refuse a friend . " As Arthur moved away with him , Guly determined not to leave his side for an instant , while in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down as he saw Arthur thus forgeting all his new-formed resolutions , yet he hoped for the best , and went with him resolutely . They entered a richly ornamented saloon , where all that could please the palate or tickle the taste was most temptingly displayed ; and Clinton , tossing a gold half-eagle upon the marble counter , called for " a few choice titbits and a bottle of wine . " As the last desideratum was named , Guly glanced anxiously toward his brother , but Arthur 's eye was turned another way , and when the collation was brought he sat readily down at the table by Clinton 's side . Guly did not wish to appear ill-bred or impolite , and he accepted the hearty invitation of his new acquaintance to " sit by , " with as good a grace as he could command . Of the wine , however , he could not be prevailed upon to touch a drop -- though he did not fail to perceive the sneer that curled Mr. Clinton 's thin lip at his refusal . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half-pityingly , " that you expect to remain in New-Orleans any length of time without learning to drink wine ? " " I shall never touch a drop , sir , unless absolutely necessary in a case of sickness . " " Bah ! anybody would know you were from the North , my dear fellow , just by that speech . Nobody hesitates to drink wine here , unless those who are too poor to pay for it "  - -  and the speaker glanced keenly , but slyly , at Guly 's face , then added : " Why , it 's impossible here to avoid drinking , even if you would . A young man calls upon a lady , and the first thing she thinks of offering him after a seat is a glass of wine . It is always there on the sideboard , and to refuse would be an act of utter impoliteness . What could you do in such a case , my boy , eh ? " " I should , I hope , have sufficient courage to tell the young lady I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked me the less for it , I would bear in mind that if such an act deprived me of her good will , her good will certainly was not worth retaining . " " I should like to see you tried once , with a pretty girl in the case , " returned Clinton , gulping down a second glass . " I can not wonder at the depraved state of society in this city , " said Guly , earnestly , " when woman , who should be the first to frown upon and discountenance such practices , not only is the tempter , but the hearty partaker of them . I am certain if the other sex were more strict -- would positively refuse to attend places of amusement on Sabbath evenings , would refrain utterly from drinking wine themselves , and offering it to others -- there would be a great change here for the better . Woman little thinks how much of man 's depravity can be traced back to be laid upon her shoulders . " " Nonsense ! " said Clinton , with a short laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough , have less to do with it than rain-water full of wriggle-tails , as they call those young animals that fill our cisterns in summer time , and the no less disagreeable -- to one not a native here -- muddy water from the river as a beverage . One is absolutely forced to ' tip the goblet red , ' in order to have something palatable to rinse down his food . Woman , indeed ! Poh ! come , have a glass , and be social . " " No , " said Guly , firmly , drawing back ; " I will not drink . However you may scoff , Mr. Clinton , at woman 's influence , it is to that I impute my strength to withstand temptation here . My last promise to my mother , was never to become a wine-bibber , and I shall keep it . " " Bravo ! " exclaimed Clinton . " Here 's a bumper to your resolution and your mother , " and touching glasses with Arthur , he swallowed the contents of his goblet ; though his companion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , scarcely touched the sparkling beverage to his lips . " You spoke of the depravity of this city , also "  - -  continued Clinton , shoving back from the table , and wiping his lips . " It is n't , in my opinion , one-half , or , to say the least , any more depraved than any of your Northern cities . The only difference is , here everything is done open and above board ; what sin there is , is before your eyes , and you do n't feel when you tread our streets , that you are walking over hidden hells , and sunken purgatories , which is , I think , more than you can say in behalf of your Northern cities . Now , is n't it ? " " The fact of all the dissipation and Sabbath-breaking here being openly carried on , is the very worst argument , Mr. Clinton , you could bring forward . It proves how much worse the tendency , when it can so harden the heart of society as to regard it without a shudder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely loses its identity here , in the manner in which it is kept ; and a little more law , more rigidly enforced , would , I am certain , elevate the standard of society into a purer and more ennobling atmosphere . If men still persisted in sin , the fear of punishment would force them to keep out of sight of those who would be Christians , which , for some , must be really a hard matter now . Yesterday , in coming from church , I met a full company of soldiers , in complete uniform , out for a drill . I passed many stores thronged with customers , even as on a week-day , and received an invitation to attend a horse-race on the Metarie Course ; all of which , you will admit , was in jarring discordance with the sermon upon which I was trying to reflect , and the Prayer-Book in my hand . " Clinton burst into a loud laugh . " The time will come when you 'll know better than to reflect upon sermons here , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in your hand . People go to church in this place to see and be seen ; to learn the fashions and see new faces -- not to remember sermons or read prayers . I heard a minister declare , the other day , that he could preach a sermon over every six weeks , and not one in twenty of his hearers would remember to have heard it before . I 've had serious thoughts of turning minister myself ; donning a gray wig and white cravat , and ' spounding the Bible , as the blacks say , to my deluded hearers . ' Pon honor , it 's the most lucrative situation a poor devil can have . Preaching a short sermon , morning and night , to an inattentive but fashionable congregation , who are sure to make a minister popular among ' em , if he do n't touch their peculiar sins too closely , give him an immense salary , let him off on full pay for four months in a year , and pay his debts when he accepts a call in another quarter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Arthur , with a smile . " When you take a stand in the pulpit count upon me for one of your hearers . " " A thousand thanks for your promised patronage , " returned Mr. Clinton , with a bow of mock gravity ; " but suppose we discuss the matter moving ; " and rising , he led the way into the street . As much as Guly wished to be rid of Mr. Clinton 's society , he saw the thing was impossible , at least at present , and submitted to a farther endurance of it with as much suavity as possible . Still keeping by his brother 's side , he walked on in silence , anxiously awaiting the moment when their companion should see fit to leave them . " Hallo ! " cried Clinton , suddenly stopping before an illuminated window , and peering earnestly into it , " the new numbers for the next lottery are up ; come on , let 's go in , and take one jointly . " Arthur thought of his lost portemonnaie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in that way ; but he remembered that he had nothing wherewith to buy a ticket , and hesitated . " Do n't , " said Guly , earnestly , " do n't be led into such folly , Arthur . Come , let 's go back to the store . " " Not till you have tried your luck once , " said Clinton , persuasively ; " come , it is but a trifle if you lose it , and think of the chance you run . " " I 've left my purse at home , " said Arthur , blushing at the falsehood he stooped to utter ; " I would really like to join , but ca n't to-night , really . " " Pooh ! if the money is all , I 'll advance that ; and you can pay me when you like . Come along . " Arthur entered the shop reluctantly , it is true , yet ashamed to confess to his social , open-hearted companion , the compunction he felt . The ticket was purchased , and half given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket , Arthur , " said Guly , gravely , " I must insist that you do not run in debt to Mr. Clinton for it , " and opening his purse , he handed to that gentleman the sum just expended for his brother 's half of the ticket . " You are very particular , " remarked Clinton , with something like a sneer , and pocketing the change , while he glanced with a look of impertinent curiosity at Guly 's grave but beautiful features . " Do you go our way ? " inquired Arthur , turning toward him as they left the shop . " No ; sorry to say I do n't , " returned Clinton , lighting a cigar , and offering one to each of the brothers , who refused it . " I am really sorry to part with you ; but if you must go , good-night , " and with a graceful move of the hand , the young gentleman bade an adieu to his friends , and turning down another street , was soon out of sight . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first to speak . " Have you enjoyed your walk , Arthur , as much as you would have done , had we been left to enjoy ourselves in our own way ? " " Well , I must say , Guly , that I 've had a pleasant time . I think young Clinton a charming fellow , and must confess he has enlivened the last hour exceedingly . " " And your heart and conscience are both quite as unburthened as they would have been had you not met him ? " " I 'm sure I 've done nothing to burden either , Gulian , " returned Arthur , somewhat impatiently . " You must remember I am several years older than you are , and am expected to act differently from a mere boy like yourself . " " Did you remember that yesterday was your twenty-first birthday ? " inquired Guly , quietly . " No ! " said Arthur , with a slight start ; " and your sixteenth birthday was last Monday ! How differently have they passed from what they used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " " Mother must have remembered us yesterday , " remarked Guly . " How she would have loved but to look over here upon us ! " " I would not have had her seen me yesterday ! " exclaimed Arthur , warmly , " for all the wealth this city ever saw . Her heart would have broken . " " Yet you persist in recognizing your yesterday 's companions , and in a measure practising yesterday 's pursuits . Mother never allowed wine to make its appearance on our birthday-fetes , my brother . " " True , but that was in the North , and our parents were always very strict . What would you have me do when I meet such a social companion as Clinton ? He has such a pleasant , happy way with him , that one really ca n't refuse him ; and for my part , a glass of wine , more or less , will hurt nobody , I guess , materially . " " The social glass has been many a man 's ruin , dear Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning , than to fight the influence of liquor in the end . I wish I could coax you to promise never to taste another drop . " " What folly , " said Arthur , laughing . " Why , my little Puritan , as long as it is the custom here , why not indulge a little ? I think I can promise you never to be intoxicated . I shall shun that . But when I 'm with young men of such habits , it would seem very odd in me to refuse , and I must now and then take a harmless glass . " " Then , Arthur , why not choose companions of different habits ? You certainly will admit such a course is wrong for any young man . See the influence even , which Clinton 's society has had upon you this evening . He has really induced you to think such practices here are allowable , and even commendable . This morning , without arguing the case , you voluntarily confessed it to be very wrong . Oh , Arthur , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . " " You are a chicken-hearted little body , " returned Arthur , playfully ; then speaking more gravely , he continued : " Well , Guly , it is not , after all , so much my fault . I am of an age to wish to enjoy myself . I have been accustomed to having every comfort and happiness around me ; the fond love and refined society of a mother , together with the noble presence and good advice of our father . Look at the change ! We have come here poor , but with delicate and luxurious tastes . We have no father , no mother , no home . One rough and dingy apartment to sleep in , is the only spot we can look upon and call ours , and that we share in common with the refuse lumber of the store and a colony of spiders and bedbugs . Beyond our washer-woman , we have n't the acquaintance of a single member of the other sex in this city ; and , apart from each other , not one to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affairs to reflect upon , Guly ; and this morning , when I lay alone up stairs on the bed , I could n't keep from thinking that these wealthy merchants who employ so many clerks have much to answer for . " " How so , Arthur ? You surely could n't expect a merchant to direct and govern the private pursuits of every young man in his employ ? " " No , surely not . Those clerks who have their homes and relatives here in the city , are well enough off ; but when , like us , they come from the North , without even an acquaintance here , would n't it be better , not only for the clerks , but for the merchant himself , if he would show a little kindly interest in them and their welfare ? Here , for instance , are ourselves : Mr. Delancey was made acquainted by our first letter with all the train of circumstances which forced us to this course . He is well aware that our family is as good as his own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would be welcome visitors at his house , and thus given us one place where we might occasionally spend our leisure hours , and call it home ? Would it not at once have placed us in our own sphere , and kept us from looking for social friends among strangers , of whose character we know nothing ? With the firm standing and position that Mr. Delancey has here in society , to have taken this kindly notice of us could not have lowered or affected him one particle in the social scale , and would have placed us in that position which we have ever been accustomed to occupy . It would have bound us more closely to him ; and instead of clerks , coldly and rigidly performing our assigned duties for him , it would have rendered us his grateful and sincere friends , happy to do aught in our power , either in or out of business hours , which would oblige him or advance his interests . At least , I know this would be the case with me , and I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I must admit , Arthur , that you are right . Though I have not quite as impulsive a heart as yourself , and am not nearly as proud-spirited , I can not always bear meekly the curtness and harshness with which Mr. Delancey treats us . And with clerks , as a general thing , it is certainly more for an employer 's interest to win them as closely as possible to himself ; for , of course , if he forces them to seek companionship among whomsoever they may meet , and they fall into low and dissipated habits , which renders them unfit for business , then , of a necessity , that interest suffers ; and were I the employer in such a case , I am sure I could not hold myself entirely free from blame . " " Oh , in such a case , the employer thinks no farther than to give a clerk his walking papers , and to show him the door . They never pause to remember that they were probably the primal cause of his downfall ; neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good name he brought to them , for another situation . When I reflect upon these things , Guly , sometimes there 's a great deal of bitterness comes up in my heart , which I can not keep down , though I try ever so hard . " " Never let it rise there , Arthur . While we both live , dear brother , we are certain of one heart that is as true as life itself . Let us cling close to one another , and try and be happy and contented together , and no harm , save sickness and death , can approach us . In loving one another , we are but being true to ourselves . " They had by this time reached the store door , and as Guly ceased speaking , Arthur stepped upon the step , and placing both hands on his brother 's shoulders , held him a little way from him , and looked earnestly into the beautiful eyes raised up to meet his own . " Guly , whatever happens -- though I hope and am sure nothing will that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love me all the same ; forget my faults and remember my virtues -- if I have any ; I want always to think of your heart as trusting mine , and loving me . " He looked away for a moment , with his eyes bent thoughtfully upon the ground , then parting the hair from his brother 's brow , he bent down hastily and kissed it , as if from an impulse which he could not resist . Guly looked wonderingly up in his face for a moment , then drew him away into the shadow of the archway adjoining , and , laying his head upon his shoulder , wept . " Love you , Arthur ! " he exclaimed , throwing both arms about his brother , and drawing him close to his heart ; " Through all and through everything , come what might or may , I can never love or trust you less than now . Your happiness is my prayer and watch-word ; all I ask of you , dear , is but to be true to yourself and me . " " Bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall henceforth , I am sure , be very happy together . " " Then , what prompted you to speak so strangely and forebodingly ? " " I could not define the feeling , if I should try . It was nothing more than a flitting shadow , cast from my restless spirit upon my heart . Come , let 's go in . " CHAPTER XIII . " Our early days ! how often back We turn on life 's bewildering track , To where , o'er hill and valley , plays The sunlight of our early days ! " D. W. Gallagher . They went in through the alley-way , and gained their bedroom by the steep back-staircase . Guly , who was fatigued by his day 's labor and evening walk , immediately prepared for bed , and sought his pillow eagerly . But Arthur , after rising from their devotion , walked toward one of the windows , and stood for a long time gazing out upon the neighboring wall of brick , as if he found there deep food for reflection . Guly lay looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even while he wondered his eyes gradually closed , and he fell fast asleep . As Arthur heard his soft but regular breathing , and felt assured his brother slumbered , he threw off his coat , and seated himself on the bedside , gazing fixedly down upon the innocent and happy brow before him . There was a thoughtful softness upon the watcher 's face , that came not often there ; and ever and anon he raised his hands , and pressed them tightly upon his eyes , as if to keep back some emotion which would fain force itself thence . " What can have put these thoughts in my mind to-night ? " he murmured , impatiently , rising and walking the floor with bowed head and folded arms . " I could almost believe the wine I drank was drugged with memories of the past , and dark forebodings for the future . What form is this that rises constantly before me , with haggard face and burning eyes , pointing its skinny finger backward , ever backward , like an index turning ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghost ; and turn I here or there , ' t is always crouching close before me , pointing that skinny finger backward . Heavens ! what does it mean ? " With a sharp shudder , Arthur again sought his brother 's side , and sat down upon the bed . " If I should ever -- if I should ever -- ever fall so low , I ! Oh , impossible ! What a horrible picture ! Yet , surrounded , as I am , by danger and temptation -- the beautiful habiliments in which vice here presents itself -- the constant laceration of my haughty pride -- would it be , after all , so impossible ? Oh , my poor heart , be strong . Still that white figure pointing backward . Can this be the foreshadowing of my own fate ? Oh , never , never ! the wine I have taken has heated my brain . Guly ! Guly ! wake up ! I can not bear to be here by myself ! " And , with a moan of anguish , Arthur buried his face in the pillow . Guly started up quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a nightmare ; then his eye fell upon the prostrate figure beside him . " Dear Arthur , tell me what ails you to-night ; you seem strangely at variance with yourself . Tell me what troubles you , my brother . " " A ghost in my heart , Guly . I ca n't tell what brought it there -- I feel it , I see it constantly -- a pale , haggard figure , pointing with its bony finger backward . " " You have been asleep , and dreaming , Arthur ; undress and come by me here , and we will talk of something else . " " No , no , Guly , not asleep , but wide , wide awake -- in my heart , in my soul , everywhere ! " exclaimed Arthur , flinging his clothes hastily off , and creeping to his brother 's side , as if flying from some horrid phantom . Guly threw an arm about him , and with the other hand stroked the dark locks soothingly back from the excited brow . " There , Arthur ! brother ! hush ! do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all fancy , all mere idle fancy . Do you remember , Arthur , how , on such a night as this , the moon used to shine down upon the tall trees and green lawn at home ? And when all those merry friends used to visit us , how their figures would flit in and out so brightly through the long green avenues , and the shadows falling at their sides -- do you not remember , Arthur ? " " The shadows falling at their side ? Yes , Guly , I remember . " " And how , when on such bright nights we sailed upon the Hudson , the diamond foam broke away from the prow of our little boat , like a peal of jewelled laughter , if such a thing could be ? When we get the old home back , Arthur , we will find that old boat out , and have it , too -- eh , brother ? " " Dear Guly , yes . " " Everything will be so like its old self , we shall almost think all our troubles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have no more of earthly happiness to ask for -- our old home and our old joys . " " And our old friends , Guly , gliding through the green avenues , with their shadows under their feet . Our old friends , with their old shadows --  " Arthur was asleep ; soothed to slumber by the gentle words and fond tones breathed upon his ear , and he lay quietly , with his face calm , and his cheek upon his hand . Dreams came to him in the hours of that long night , and he was happy . Time and distance were annihilated , and he was back upon the shores of old Hudson , sporting with its waves , and gliding on its waters . There was the old boat , with the sparkling foam parting from the rushing prow , and the music of the dipping oars was falling gently on his ear . Again he was on the green lawn , and the moon was looking down upon the tall trees , and the soft green grass which lay before the broad door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out along the shaded avenues , their shadows falling by them always , and he was in their midst -- a child , merry-hearted , but fretted and proud -- toyed with by this one , caressed by that , and the favorite of all , commanding but to be obeyed , frowning but to be more attended , angered but to be coaxed to good-nature , first in his parents ' hearts , and high in the proffered love of every guest , reigning , like a boy-king , over all he surveyed . Then his dream for a moment grew clouded , and a tiny form , with snowy robes and gentle blue eyes , rose up before him , and took his place upon his mother 's bosom , and he knew he had a brother . The form expanded , and grew in height , and the hair hung in golden ringlets down to shadow the beautiful eyes . And a tiny hand sought his , and tottering steps fell lightly at his side . Still the form grew , till in his dream it seemed to rise above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silver cloud , which kept rising higher and higher , till the tiny hand he clasped in his was drawn perforce from his grasp , and still standing on the silver cloud , the light form , the golden hair , and blue eyes , passed from his sight ; and looking up , he learned to believe it was an angel , not a brother , which had been sent to him . And while he looked yearningly after it , a mother 's hand fell upon his shoulder , and her sweet voice trembled as she pointed upward , and bade him follow . Then he showed her his empty hand , from which the tiny hand had been drawn , and stepping quickly backward , he plunged headlong over an unseen precipice , and fell , fell far down , where all was darkness ; but finding no bottom , and shuddering with the thought that so he must go dizzily rushing through that blackened space to all eternity ! But , looking up , a glorious light broke through the surrounding gloom , and the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smile of thrilling happiness , and outstretched arms to save him . It reached him , it clasped him to its warm bosom , and he felt a quick heart throbbing there , and knew again it was his brother , with the sunny curls and radiant smile , who had saved him from that bottomless pit , and mounted , holding him upon his heart , to purer and to brighter realms . Thus the spirits of his earlier days thronged his fancy , as he slumbered there ; but the pale ghost in his heart , pointing with its skinny finger backward , came not to him as he lay there dreaming , with his cheek upon his hand . CHAPTER XIV . " Ah ! may'st thou ever be what now thou art , Nor unbeseem the promise of thy spring ; As fair in form , as warm yet pure of heart , Love 's image upon earth without his wing , And guileless beyond hope 's imagining . " Byron . A month went by , and Arthur during that time never once went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , nor met those companions whom he had begun to deem so social-hearted , and so necessary to his happiness . He seemed to shrink fearfully from the thought of coming in contact with them , and invariably after business hours sought his brother 's side , passing his leisure in whatever mode Guly chanced to propose . His proud will was kept in constant curb , and when he received the stern rebuke of his employer , or the taunt and sneer of those who would have led him their way , he answered nothing , but turned away with swelling heart and silent lips . Guly noticed that nightly , as they prayed , Arthur 's voice grew more earnest , and his manner more humble and contrite ; and he began to censure himself for the unjust fears he had entertained on his brother 's account , while his heart rose in thankful praises to Him " who doeth all things well , " for the happy change . None knew , save Arthur himself , the cause of it . Since the night when the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart , and since the dream of home hovered over his pillow , he had felt as if it might be possibly a visionary counterpart of one of those events which " cast their shadows before , " and he had striven right manfully against every impulse which might in any way tend to make himself the fulfiller of it . Often , when the stern reproof , or the sly sneer , had awakened his resentment and called the flush of anger to his cheek , a glimpse into his throbbing heart placed the seal of silence on his lips ; for , with a shudder , he beheld the haggard figure , with its burning eyes , pointing ever its skinny finger backward . It was something which he could not understand , yet which exerted over him an all-powerful influence . He often thought upon it , trying to devise what it could mean , and what could have brought it there within his heart ; and the only answer his reflections ever gave him , was that the fore-shadow had risen to warn him from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but steady eye upon the movements and character of the brothers , and , in spite of the usual coldness and indifference of his great heart , he had begun to feel a deep interest in them , and everything pertaining to them . Guly especially , he had learned to feel towards even as a younger brother . Still , with that unaccountable feeling , which sometimes forbids a generous sentiment to betray itself to another , he veiled his earnest friendship under a guise of mere clerkly companionship , rarely giving way to those bursts of tender feeling , which rendered him , in Guly 's young eyes , an absolute enigma . One day , as Arthur was about leaving the store for dinner , Wilkins called him back , and gave him some money to deposit in the bank , which he had to pass on his way to the restaurant . " We are so busy to-day , " remarked the head-clerk , as he gave it to him , " it is just now impossible for me to leave before the bank closes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur bowed , and viewed the bills with a glow of proud pleasure in his breast , at the trust reposed in him , and started away . Guly left his place an instant , and stepped quickly to the door , prompted by a feeling for which he could not account , to look after him ; and stood gazing upon his brother 's receding figure until lost to sight in the stream of busy life , which flowed through the narrow street . As he resumed his station , a light and exquisitely beautiful female form glided in at the door , and stopped at Guly 's counter . As he bent forward to inquire her wishes , she threw aside the veil , which concealed her features , and revealed to the boy 's bewildered gaze the most dazzling , beautiful face he had ever beheld . She was quite young ; apparently had just entered upon her fifteenth year , an age which in the North would be considered only as the dividing step between childhood and girlhood , but which in the South , where woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming season of female beauty , when the half-burst blossom retains all the purity , freshness , and fragrance of the tender bud . She was slight and delicate in figure , yet beautifully rounded and proportioned ; bearing , in every movement , that charming child-like grace , which is so frequently lost when the child merges into the woman . Her complexion was that of a brunette -- but beautifully clear ; and her cheeks , with their rich color , might well bear that exquisite comparison of somebody's -- a rose-leaf laid on ivory . Her hair was of a rich chestnut brown , and having been cut off during severe illness , was now left to its own free grace , and hung in short close curls about her full pure brow . Her eyes were of the same hue as her hair , large and full , and replete with that dewy , tender expression , when she lifted the long lashes from them , which sends the glance into the depths of the heart . Her mouth was small , and the full lips , like to a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guly 's eye took in the exquisite picture before him at a glance , and the words which were on his lips when he first bent forward remained unspoken , while he looked the glowing admiration which filled his heart . She seemed slightly embarrassed as she met his gaze , and , in a voice of clear richness of tone , she remarked :  --  " Mr. G --  --  is no longer here ? I have always been accustomed to seeing him , and have my work ready for disposal . " " I occupy Mr. G --  --  's place , Miss , " replied Guly , with a slight blush upon his young cheek , as he resumed his erect position . " Can I do anything for you ? " " Ah , Miss Blanche ! how do you do ? " exclaimed Wilkins , getting down from his desk before she could answer Guly 's question . " It is a long , long time since we have seen your young face here . What has been the matter ? " " Ah ! Monsieur , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing him in French , " I have had much trouble in the last two months . I have been greatly bereaved . My poor mother , sir --  " she could go no farther , but broke down as she glanced at the black dress , and burst into a fit of silent but bitter weeping . A shade of sympathetic sorrow passed over Wilkins ' face , and with a delicacy of feeling which would not have been expected in him , he stepped around to that side , where she was exposed to the view of the customers and clerks , and stood there as if he would , by the intervention of his huge form , screen her sorrow from the vulgar gaze . After a few moments Blanche dried her eyes ; and with a violent struggle for self-control , seemed to swallow her grief into her heart . " You must pardon me , Mr. Wilkins , for giving way here . I thought , Monsieur , I could do better ; but my grief lies very , very heavy here ; " and she laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah , Mademoiselle , " returned Wilkins , also in French , " I feel deeply for you , believe me . And you are alone now , and have no friends ? " " Oui , Monsieur , I have my blind grandfather , poor grandpapa ; he is very feeble and infirm . " She paused , as if the subject was one too painful to dwell upon , then drew toward her a little bundle , which she had laid upon the counter , and said : " I have here my broderie . I hope , Monsieur , you have not engaged any one else . I have worked day and night to finish what I had undertaken . I hope they please you . " Wilkins took the little roll , and drew thence several specimens of exquisite and tasteful embroidering , consisting of one or two heavily worked mouchoirs , several collars , some insertion , edging , &c.,; &c.; He examined them with a close and critical eye , then laying them down , with an encouraging smile , said :  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet had , Mademoiselle . These , really , command the highest price . " " I am very glad , Monsieur , " Blanche replied , quietly . Wilkins drew a small reference-book from his pocket , and after glancing over its pages a moment or two , he counted out a few pieces of gold from a drawer at his side , and Guly saw that , under pretence of making change , he added to the sum a little from his own purse . " There , Mademoiselle , that is well earned . " " Here is more than I received last time , Monsieur ; and you have had to wait for the work . Are you sure this is right ? " " Quite right . As I before told you , it is better done than any you have given us before . Take these articles , Guly , and put them in the box marked ' French Embroidery . ' " Guly obeyed , and his fingers lingered on the fair work before him , with an unconscious touch of admiration . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mademoiselle ? " " I think so , Monsieur Wilkins . I have nothing to occupy my time now , except a few little favors for poor grandpapa . " " Very well . Mr. G. has left , as you see . Henceforth Mr. Pratt will receive your work , and pay you for the same , as he has charge of this department . Let me make you acquainted . Guly , this is Blanche Duverne , " said Wilkins , in his brief , peculiar manner . Blanche held out her small hand , with an air of naive and innocent frankness , and Guly took the rosy finger tips , as he bent across the counter , and pressed them to his lips . It was an act totally unexpected by Blanche , but it was done with such a noble grace by the boy , and with an air of such delicate refinement , while a glow of boyish bashfulness swept over his fine face , that the most fastidious could not have found in it just cause for resentment , much less the guileless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand she looked at him more attentively than she had done before , and said , sweetly , in pure unaccented English --  " I hope we may be very good friends , Guly . " " Amen , " said the boy , with a smile . " And you will sell my work to your choice customers , wo n't you ? " " Invariably . " " Adieu . " " Adieu , Miss . " She flitted out of the door so like a spirit , that she was gone almost before Guly was aware she had left her seat . He longed to go to the door and look after her , but a sense of timidity withheld him ; and having no customers just then he took down the box which contained her work , under pretence of arranging it more nicely , but in reality to look upon the delicate labor of those rosy fingers once again . Wilkins was watching him , mischievously , from his desk , and Guly looked up , and caught his eye , with a blush and a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " A poor girl , and very pretty . " " And friendless ? " " Only her grandpapa , you heard her say . " " Poor thing , she does this for a living . " " For a living ? Yes . And it 's a hard one she gets , after all . " " You know all about her ! What else ? Tell me more . " " She is very good and pure . " " May she always be so . Go on . " Wilkins looked at him searchingly for a moment , but the boy met his glance steadily , and the head-clerk withdrew his eye with an air of one who is suddenly made aware of entertaining unjust suspicions ; and he went on , with a smile , getting down from his desk , and standing near to Guly meanwhile . " It would not be to every one , Guly , I would give poor Blanche 's history , or what I know of it ; but to you I am certain I can do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the daughter of one of the wealthiest bankers in this city , who died several yeas ago insolvent , and left his wife and child destitute . Of course , their former friends cut them , all except a very few ; and they took a suite of rooms in the Third Municipality , and removed thither with their few articles of furniture , and their blind and helpless relative . The mother 's health began to fail , and after a little while she was unable to do anything toward their support ; and all the duties of the household , together with the labor for a livelihood for the three , fell upon little brown-eyed Blanche . She went to work heroically , and turned her accomplishments to profit , and is , as you see , one of the very best brodeurs that can be found . She loved her mother devotedly , and I suppose it almost broke her little heart when she lost her . She has sickened and died within the last two months , as you heard her say . She had all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her old grandfather , yet she has neglected neither , and finished her work with it all . Think of it ! As you perceive she has an innocent little heart , is a stranger to guile , and is ready to believe every one is what he professes to be . God help her , poor thing ! " " And is that all you know of her , Wilkins ? " " This is all . I know her well ; for four years she has brought her work to this spot , and sold it at this counter . " Guly 's eye dropped upon that counter almost reverently . " Where are her relatives , Wilkins ? " " North , I believe . Her father was a poor but talented man when he came here , and his family , though highly estimable at the North , were also poor . He met his wife in some of the high circles , to which his letters admitted him , and they fell in love , and married , though in the face of decided opposition from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he rose , as I told you , to high station and standing ; so when he died there was no one to apply to . " " How did you learn all this , Wilkins ? " " She told it to me herself . " " But her Northern friends , they may have grown rich by this time . " " No . She told me her father 's family consisted only of his parents and one deformed brother . When he was making a fortune so rapidly here , I believe he received a letter from this brother , stating that he was coming on to try his fortune here , too . But Mr. Duverne , Blanche 's father , wrote back to discourage his intentions , for he seemed to think it was too long a journey for one so helpless as he . They never heard from the brother again ; for , soon after , Mr. Duverne died , and the state of his affairs became known , and all intercourse between the families ceased . " " And they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , he of course never came , or they would have heard of him , you know . " " Is Blanche French ? " " By the name , you see she is of French descent ; and she speaks the language like a native born Francaise ; however , her mother was purely American , and her father never spoke a word of French in all his life . She has acquired it by mingling , no doubt , with the Creoles here . " " You speak it yourself , Mr. Wilkins ? " " Yes ; and I acquired it in that way . " " You know where Blanche lives ? " " Yes . " " And visit her sometimes ? " " Occasionally . " " Can I accompany you there some evening , sir ? I would like to know her better . " " To be sure you may , Guly ; especially , as you are henceforth to be somewhat associated in the business line . As I have told you , Blanche is a noble little girl ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I would n't take every one there . You understand ? " " Certainly . I sha n't name her residence to any one . " " Very well , then ; whenever you say -- you alone , remember . " " Thank you , Wilkins ; when I can go I will tell you . " " Just so . " Wilkins stepped back to his desk , and Guly still stood arranging the new pieces of embroidery . There was for him a charm about them . Accustomed as he was to seeing such things , he could not get tired of looking at these . They were far more beautiful than any of those which were really French , and had come from over the seas ; and from every graceful twig and twining tendril , there looked up at him a pair of soft brown eyes , whose gentle glances went down , and made themselves a home in the boy 's pure heart . CHAPTER XV .  - -   - -   " He is a man , Setting his fate aside , of comely virtues ; Nor did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which buys out his faults --  But with a noble fury and fair spirit , Seeing his reputation touched to death , He did oppose his foe . " Shakspeare . " Mr. Delancey , will you wait one minute , sir ! " exclaimed Arthur , coming in , apparently much excited , just as Guly replaced the box on the shelf . The merchant stopped just as he was going out of the door , and planting his cane firmly down upon the floor , turned round with the frown between his eyebrows quite visibly deepened . " Well , sir , what will you have ? " " Your attention , if you can give it , sir -- one moment at your desk . " " Whatever you 've got to say , say it here . " " No , sir , I must see you privately . " Wilkins and Guly both looked at Arthur in mute astonishment . His face was flushed and heated , his breath came short , like one who had been running , and his eyes and lips , and whole manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular business , young man , that you must detain me now ? " said the merchant , somewhat angered at the prospect of detention from his usual dinner hour . " It is very particular business to me , sir ; and interests you not much less . " Mr. Delancey waved his hand impatiently , for Arthur to precede him to his desk ; then , with hasty step , and planting his cane each tread visibly on the floor , he followed him , and seating himself with formal precision , took off his hat , and leant stiffly back in his chair . " Well , sir ? " Arthur would almost have as soon undergone the terrors of the Inquisition as to brave the tempest he expected soon to fall upon his devoted head . He called up all his courage , however , and began . " This afternoon , sir , I took some money from Mr. Wilkins to deposit in the bank . " " Well ? come , be quick . " " I put it , as I thought , safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank . I do n't know how it happened , I 'm sure I ca n't imagine , " said Arthur , growing confused , with those stern , strong eyes staring straight into his , " but when I got to the bank I found , sir , I had lost it . " " The devil you did ! " " I am sorry to say it , it is true . " " And what were you doing , on your way to the bank , that you had n't an eye on that money , I 'd like to know ? " " The money I supposed was safe , sir , and I walked straight along without thinking about it , till I reached the bank . " " A likely story that ! Who did you talk to , or see , on your way ? any of your companions ? " " I saw only one person , sir , whom I knew at all ; one whom I have not seen before for several weeks . " " And that very one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his name ? who was he ? " " He is a gentleman , sir , who would not do such a thing , I 'm sure , any sooner than you would . He is a friend of mine . " " What is his name , I say ? " " Clinton , sir . No one that you know , probably . " The merchant leaned forward , and peered keenly into Arthur 's face , as if to see if there was aught of hidden meaning in his words ; and his features grew ashy pale while he asked , in a hoarse whisper :  --  " Clinton ? Clinton what ? " " Mr. Clinton is the only name I know him by . I have n't heard his given name , " returned Arthur , surprised at the merchant 's agitation . Mr. Delancey said nothing for a moment ; but sat leaning forward , with his pale face dropped in thought upon his breast . " Did he talk with you long ? " he asked , at last . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You had the money when he left you ? " " I did not touch it from here to the bank , sir ; and knew nothing of it from the time I left this door , till I reached the bank counter . " " Hem ! yes , yes , a very likely story . It could n't have got out of your pocket without hands , young man ; and if your friend would n't do such a thing , and your pocket was safe , I do n't think but what you know something about it . " " Me , sir ? Mr. Delancey , you do n't mean to say --  " " Tut , tut , I know about you young chaps ; I might have known I would have just such trouble when I took you , I suppose you think I do n't know that Henriquez 's billiard table is between here and the bank , eh ? " " If you do , you know more than I do , sir . " " Dare you tell me that ? Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  - -  and all that time going to the bank , eh ? " " I tell you the truth , Mr. Delancey ; and I am sure you are aware of it . " " Well , there 's no use talking now ; you will not convince me if you talk till doomsday . That money you 've got to replace out of your salary . " " Why , sir , it was three hundred dollars . " " There ! there ! how do you know how much it was , if you did n't look at it , I 'd like to know . " " I heard Wilkins say this morning he had such a deposit to make . Ask him , sir , if he did n't . " " I 've heard enough about it . You must make it up , that 's all ; and you 'll be more careful henceforth . " " And , sir , you will retract what you insinuated had become of it ? I 'll willingly make it up to you , if it takes every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blight upon my reputation , even in your opinion , sir . " His words fell upon empty air ; for Mr. Delancey had already left the high desk , and was striking his cane heavily down with each step , as he stalked down through the store . Arthur sank upon a chair , and buried his face in his hands . " A hard fate , " he murmured , bitterly . " First to suffer the loss , and then to be accused , or at least suspected , of appropriating it . Heavens ! it is too much ; I will not and can not stand it . " " Be calm , Arthur , " said Wilkins , in his full deep tones ; " look up , and tell us what has happened . " Arthur raised his head , and told his story unhesitatingly . " This is a bad business , my young friend . I am extremely sorry ; but the only way for you is not to mind it . This is Mr. Delancey 's way . Intercourse with the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that you do n't know something about the money . No one else that knows you will ever think so , though ; and you will stand just as high as ever . Yours is n't the first case of this kind . " " It is too outrageous , Wilkins , and I wo n't bear it . Do you think I 'll tamely submit to be called , or thought , a thief ? " " What can you do ? It is useless to talk or feel thus ; say nothing , go steadily on , and Delancey himself will forget , after awhile , his suspicions . As to replacing it , I feel that you have been unfortunate through my means , and I will assist you in that . " " I do n't wish you to , thank you , Wilkins . I do n't care so much for my money as I do for my good name . To be robbed of it in this manner , is more than I can possibly endure . " " Let me beg of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all will yet be well . " Arthur sat moodily down , and gave himself up to thought . He fancied there was no possible way to extricate himself from the difficulty , and that it would be useless to argue with such a man as his employer . With flushed cheek and thoughtful air he rose and took his place behind the counter . Wilkins watched him anxiously , and then , as though Guly were the elder , instead of the younger brother , he sought him for a consultation . He was busy with a customer , and Wilkins noticed that he was displaying some of Blanche 's new work , and wondered whether it was that , or interest in his brother 's behalf , which brought such a bright glow to his cheek . " It is very beautiful , " said the lady who was buying , examining one of the collars closely , " Very beautiful ; is that your lowest , Master Pratt ? " " The very lowest , Madame . I have been gratified in being able to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I know how well you like the first choice . " " No one else , then , has bought from these before ? " " No , Madame . " " It is high , but I 'll take it . " " Yes , Madame . " As the lady left the store , Guly turned to Wilkins , with a bright smile : " You see I have kept my promise to Blanche , and have sold her work to a ' choice customer . ' " " I see , " said Wilkins . " A word with you , Guly . " Guly stepped toward him . " Arthur has --  " " Poor Arthur ! true enough ! how could I forget him ; what was the matter , Wilkins ? I have been so busy , you know . " " He has got into sad trouble ; I feel very sorry for him ; but I ca n't help him an iota , that I see ; it 's too bad , I declare . " Wilkins then gave Guly the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's misfortune . " Well , Mr. Wilkins , this is outrageous ! " exclaimed Guly , with a vehemence unusual to him . " It would require the virtue and forbearance of a saint to bear up under such things . It is n't the money so much , though I 'm very sorry he lost it , but it is his good name ; to have that sullied , even in thought ! It is enough to drive any one to desperation . " " Do n't tell Arthur so , for the world , " said Wilkins , very earnestly . " No , no , I 'll not -- can I go to him ? " " Of course . " " Dear Arthur , " said Guly , beckoning his brother a little one side , " I know all . You know how I sympathize with you , my brother ; but cheer up , we can live through it all ; and you will be , in the end , thoroughly acquitted of what Mr. Delancey suspects you of , even in his own heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to show him by your future course how much such an act would be beneath you . " " Oh , there 's no use , Guly ; I never could convince such a flint-hearted man in the world , of my innocence , if he chose to think me guilty . I was horrified at first , but I 've thought of it , and thought of it , till I do n't care much . It 's my fate , I suppose . " " Do n't give up in this way , Arthur ; think of your own proud self , of how much depends upon you , of our dear mother , and all that . Do n't allow yourself to be crushed . " " Guly , just think of it -- a thief ! " " Only so in the opinion of one who will not reflect upon it long enough to see its utter impossibility . " " And all this year 's labor lost , Guly ; and nothing to send home now to mother . " " We 'll try what we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! the whole of it just covers the amount lost ; and how are you going to live ? " " Do n't give it up so , do n't ! There is One who will never desert those who trust Him . Remember that , Arthur , and look up . " " It is my fate to be forced to look down . It is useless for me to try to struggle against it . I ca n't be otherwise . " " You are too desponding , Arthur ; many a man , now rich and happy , if he could tell his experience in getting so , would no doubt relate a harder life than yours can ever be . This should only serve to make you stronger . " " If Mr. Delancey was only a different-tempered man , perhaps I could do better . If he had sympathized with me , and assured me kindly of his belief that it was all an accident , oh , I would have felt so differently , so happy in comparison ! There is no pleasure in serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigidly performed , for one you can not but hate . He is never so happy as when mixing gall with the honey of one 's happiness . I am miserable , Guly , miserable ! and I ca n't rouse myself . I wish I was as meek and forbearing as you are , I could be happier ; my pride , my strong unbending pride , has been , and ever will be , my curse . " Arthur 's tones seemed to struggle up so heavily in his sorrow , from his heart 's depths , that Guly felt strongly inclined to tell him there were very few , however meek and charitable , who would submit to an insult of this kind quietly ; but he remembered his promise to Wilkins , and refrained . " If I could reason with Mr. Delancey , if he would talk with me as it is his duty to talk with me , I am sure he would think differently upon the matter ; but for me to stay here for the ensuing year , as I now am forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that every time those cold eyes are turned upon me , they believe themselves to be looking on a thief ! Oh , my God ! Guly , it is too much ! " Arthur was intensely excited , and the veins in his forehead stood out like cords , so swollen were they , and his face was deeply flushed . Guly 's heart ached for him , and he was trying to think of something which he could say to comfort him , when he was called away by a customer , and , with a kindly pressure upon his brother 's hand , he left his side . Arthur also stepped back to his place ; but every attitude he assumed , every changing expression of his handsome face , told the restless misery of that young heart , and the crushing weight upon that lofty spirit . Guly waited anxiously for night to come , that he might talk to , and try to encourage , Arthur . When the lamps were lighted , and the customers had gradually thinned out , he was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise he saw that his place was vacant , and he was nowhere to be seen . A sharp pang went through the boy 's heart , succeeded by a sickening faintness ; and he leaned against the counter for support , filled with undefined fears of sorrow , and danger , and unhappiness . With a blush at his apparently causeless emotion , he stepped to the clerk who always stood next to Arthur , and inquired if he knew where he had gone . " No , " the young man said ; " he went out about half an hour ago , and Mr. Quirk was with him . " " Quirk ! " ejaculated Guly , involuntarily , while the pang went through his breast again ; and seizing his cap , he started forth , in the hope of discovering Arthur 's where-abouts . CHAPTER XVI . " Press me not , I beseech you , so ; There is no tongue that moves , none , none i ' the world , So soon as yours could win me ; so it should now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were needful I denied it . " Winter 's Tale . Through the damp streets , where shone mistily through the heavy fog the lamps on the corners , Guly , with anxious heart and hurried step , wandered alone . He sought every place of which he believed his brother to have any knowledge , and left no spot unvisited where they had ever been together . All in vain . None of whom he inquired had seen Arthur , and of many he could not bring himself to inquire , blushing at the thought of his brother being known to them . Still , as he turned to retrace his steps , he found himself involuntarily looking into the richly furnished saloons , where the show of luxury , and display of wealth , lead so many , through their very love of gorgeousness , to drink , to distress , to death ! Each time , as his eyes turned thitherward , a sigh of relief rose from his heart to find that Arthur was not an inmate there . Thus seeking , thus hoping , he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having no pass-key , he rapped for admittance , for the store was closed , and all around it dark . Wilkins ' voice bade him enter . Trying the door , he found it unlocked , and going in , saw Wilkins sitting by the coal fire -- which the chill air of November now rendered necessary -- alone , and apparently in deep thought . With as cheerful an air as he could assume , he approached him , and laying a hand upon each shoulder , as he stood behind his chair , bent forward , and looked up in the thoughtful eyes gazing on the fire . " What can be the subject of your meditations , Mr. Wilkins ? your face looks sad enough to be the index of a sorrowful heart ? " Mr. Wilkins made no reply , but lifting his arm , drew the golden head upon his bosom , and held it there , stroking back with listless fingers the soft bright curls . " Has anything unpleasant happened since I went out , Wilkins ? " " No , Guly ; nothing has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm-chair empty , so I sat down , and fell to thinking , that 's all . Have you been to see Blanche ? " " Blanche ! I do n't suppose I could have found her , had I thought of trying . " " True enough . We are going there together . What of your brother , Guly ? " Guly told him of his ineffectual search ; the fact of his not having seen him in any of the saloons , and the hope he entertained of seeing him walk in , by and by , feeling happier for his walk , and seating himself there by the fire . Wilkins shook his head , doubtingly . " Your brother 's spirit is one which needs to be peculiarly dealt with , until he grows a little older , and less impetuous . I 'm sorry to say it , but he has more pride than principle just at this age ; and he ought to have the blessing of a home and a mother 's love , till the principle could be made to predominate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , here . " Guly brought the chair , and placed it close to his companion , and seated himself . Wilkins drew his head again upon his bosom . " It is about him , " continued Wilkins , " that I have been thinking this evening . I really take a deep interest in his welfare , and wish I knew how to guide him . For his sake I wish my own heart was more disciplined , that I was not so utterly incapable . " " Do n't let such thoughts as these prevent you from using your influence with my poor brother , Wilkins . I am too young , too weak , too inexperienced , to control him . He would naturally scorn the advice of one so much younger ; but you , oh ! do n't let too lowly an opinion of yourself deprive Arthur of the counsel and guidance he so much needs . " " Ah ! Guly , you do n't know me . I might tell him how he should do ; but my example , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my advice . Had it been different when I first came here , I might now be a better man . I was an orphan , came here from the North , had no soul in this vast city to love or care for me , and for five years I have lived here loveless and lonely , save when with those companions which a friendless being is almost sure to fall in with here ; and I can turn to no one , feeling that they care for me . " " Wilkins , I love you ; indeed , I love you as a brother . " " I believe you , Guly ; though we are so different ; though my cherishing you is like the lion mating with the lamb , still I believe in my heart the honest love I feel for you , God has blest me by causing you to reciprocate . I have been a better man since I first held you here on my heart . A better man , Heaven knows ! " " Wilkins , in all the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say Mr. Delancey has never asked you to his house , or noticed you any more than he does now ? " " I have never been asked to enter his door , Guly , any more than you have . He would as soon , I suppose , turn a herd of swine into his drawing-room , as to ask his clerks there . He is very proud . " " That is n't pride , Wilkins ; it is meanness . A truly proud man would adopt the contrary course , I am sure ; and so attach all his employees to himself , and to his interests . " " Ah ! he never thinks of that . His negroes get better treatment than his clerks , by far ; and there is n't a soul among them but what loves him dearly , and would die for him , I do n't doubt , at any moment . So you see he can be kind , strange as it may seem . " " It is strange , Wilkins . Mr. Delancey is a man I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him at all . " " He certainly has done nothing to make you , my poor boy . His pride , for it is pride , renders him very disagreeable . If all the sin , which his harshness and indifference has caused in others , were laid up against him , ' t would make a mighty pile . There 's a day of retribution coming for him , though . " As Wilkins spoke he bent forward , and rested his head on his hand , with a peculiar smile upon his lips . " A day of retribution ! What do you mean , Wilkins ? Is there any trouble brooding for him ? " " All pride must have a fall , " muttered Wilkins , as if to himself , while he gave the coals a vehement thrust . " Do n't ask me anything more about it , Guly . " " But you have roused my curiosity , " said Guly , looking up in surprise . " If it is n't a secret , I would like to know more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , and would tell you sooner than any one else ; but it would do you no good if I would tell you , which I ca n't , and so we 'll say no more about it . " " Has Mr. Delancey any children ? " " Two -- a son and a daughter ; at least he had a son . " " And did he die ? " " Oh , no ; he fell in love with a poor but worthy girl , who has no doubt made him an excellent wife , or at least would have done so had it been in her power . Instead of taking his daughter-in-law to his heart and home , and making her what his wealth could have made her , with her worth and beauty , he met the whole affair with stern opposition , and after his son 's marriage turned him from him with a curse , and disinherited him . How the poor fellow has managed to live since , I ca n't imagine ; for he had no profession , nor anything to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become reckless and dissipated , and had sworn vengeance on his unnatural father , but I 've heard very little of him of late . " " This is shocking . A clerk can expect but little from such a father . Oh , horrible ! " " He is a man you will probably never know , however long you may live with him . Had it not been for the necessary contact my position in his employ brought us into , I should never have known him at all . " " And you believe he really deemed Arthur guilty to-day ? " " That is more than I can answer . Mr. Delancey is close with regard to money matters . " " My poor brother ! Wilkins , promise me to do all you can for him . Oh ! I know how much danger surrounds him . What can I , so young and feeble , do ? We two are all that is left our mother . Help me -- I 'm sure you will -- to save him . " " I will , Guly -- by my sworn love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when I may greatly need a friend to help me through a trouble or sorrow that is coming upon me -- when those that know me may shun me -- you , who love me , will be that friend . May I rely upon you ? " " Depend upon me ? yes , truly , Wilkins -- in anything that 's right . " Guly 's heart was racked with more sorrowful anxiety for his brother than he could , or cared to , express ; but in spite of his efforts to restrain them , the bright tears fell down his cheeks at Wilkins ' kind words , and dropped upon the broad breast which supported him . Wilkins raised his hand , and wiped them away . " Do n't cry , Guly ; your grief unmans me . " " Oh , Wilkins , how can I help it ? " Wilkins answered nothing , but drew the slight form closer in silent sympathy . The hours went on , and midnight still saw them sitting there together -- the golden head upon the broad , kind breast , and the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's beautiful , and therefore to be woo 'd ; She is a woman , therefore to be won . " Henry VI .  - -   - -   " Bright The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men ; A thousand hearts beat happily ; and when Music arose , with its voluptuous swell , Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again , And all went merry as a marriage bell . " Childe Harold . Della sat in her large chair , before the dressing-glass , with her delicate feet buried in the rich softness of a velvet cushion ; her hands were folded in her lap , and her eyes fixed upon Minny 's face , which was clearly reflected in the mirror , as she stood behind her mistress , arranging the shining bands of long fair hair . " Minny , how very , very white you are ! How came you to be so white , when your mother is the blackest slave papa owns ? " A scarlet flush rose to the quadroon 's cheek . " My father , Miss , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born here , Minn ? " " My mother was in your father 's service when she gave me birth , Miss Della . Will you have your bandeaux single or double for this evening ? " " Double , Minn , so the wreath can lie nicely in between ; and make those braids as rich as possible . I wish to look my best to-night . You have always lived here since you were born , Minn ?  - -  was a baby when I was a baby ? " " Yes , my dear Miss , and my mother was your nurse ; your own mother not liking to spoil her figure by nursing her child , you were put to my mother 's breast . So mother tells me . " " Well , if you had been a white child , that would have made us foster-sisters , would n't it ? That 's the reason old Mag loves me so well . I never knew of this before . " " It 's something very common here , you know , Miss , for white children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it ruins their forms to have a child at the breast . " " Yes , I know , Minn ; and I think it a very shameful practice , too . I never want to be a fashionable woman , if it is going to deprive me of performing a mother 's holiest offices for my children . I 'm sure after a child of mine had been reared at a black mother 's breast I should feel they were black children , had black blood in their veins , and I never could feel right toward them again . " " You are one in a thousand , dear Miss Della ; and such feelings are right , and good , and noble . But if you ever wish to be truly a mother to your children , do n't marry a fashionable man , whose pride will be to show you off all the time in gay company , and who will be always fretting to keep your beauty good . It is such husbands that make bad mothers . A woman ca n't be a votary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never shall marry a fashionable man , Minny -- you know that ; but when I do marry I shall try and be a good , and true , and dutiful wife , nothing more . I have n't a taste for high life -- that is , gay life , which has no heart in it . But , Minny , let 's go back to you ; I commenced about you ; what made you change the subject , child ? " " Did I , Miss ? " " Yes . Who was your father , Minny ? " Minny 's cheek lost it 's flush , and became pale as death . " I can not tell you , Miss . " " But you know . " Minny made no answer , but her hands shook violently , and the braids she had just fastened fell loose again from her trembling fingers . " What ails you , Minn ? why do n't you answer me ? " said Della , looking up earnestly at Minny , in the glass . " I never told you a lie in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you because I ca n't tell the truth now . " " You must tell me if you know , Minny ; and you must tell the truth , too . " " Oh , Miss Della , " said the girl , sinking at her mistress 's feet in a fit of wild weeping , " do n't , do n't ask me this . I never knew it myself till yesterday , and then I wrung it from my mother , who charged me , if I valued her life , never to lisp it again . It made me wretched . Oh , Miss Della , it would kill you . " " Kill me ? How can it affect me , silly child ? What nonsense . " Della lifted up the beautiful head which was bowed before her , and turned the pallid face toward her own . " Tell me , you foolish one , " she persisted , her curiosity fully aroused . " I must and will know about it now ; " and she stamped her little foot with an air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely assumed . Minny pressed her hands , clasped one upon the other , hard against her heart , as if its throbbing was painful , and raised her eyes , full of a strange , wild light , to her mistress 's face . " I would sooner die than tell you , Miss . " There might have been something in that agonized look that called forth emotion , or there might have been something in that cold , fixed gaze , which stamped for the instant the father on that upturned , ashy face ; for as she met the glance , Della suddenly clasped her hands to her face , and , with an exclamation of horror , fell back fainting . Minny sprang wildly to her feet --  " Oh , Miss Della ! " she exclaimed , as she bent over the senseless form before her , pouring out her passionate accents as if there was an ear to hear them . " Oh , Miss Della , how could you crave this knowledge to-day , of all other days ? Had it been yesterday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would not have known , and you would have never known . To-day , of all days ! Oh , I have broken this poor , sensitive heart ; woe is me , woe is me ! Oh , if I had only died before I learned this dreadful secret , only died ! only died ! " With trembling hands , and eyes raining down their gushing tears , Minny bathed the pale brow , and brought rare perfumes , and chafed the little hands . " Miss Della ! Miss Della ! I knew it would kill you -- and you only guessed ; I never told you -- oh , no , never , never , never ! " Slowly Della returned to consciousness , and as her eyes unclosed , they fell upon the agonized face of her weeping attendant . She closed them quickly , and raised her hand so as to wave her from her sight , but it dropped listlessly back into her lap , and she lay still in the large chair , apparently as weak and helpless as an infant . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , though I never meant to do it -- never thought to do it . What could have turned your thoughts on this to-day ? " " Go away , " murmured Della , faintly ; " go away , so that I may open my eyes and not see you . " Minny moved a few paces back . " I can see you in the glass yet ; go away so that I ca n't see you anywhere , Minn . " Weeping bitterly , Minny retired to the other apartment ; and Della , with folded hands , sat quite still with downcast eyes and pallid cheeks , looking like a statue of meditation . A little French clock upon the mantle-piece struck the hour , and went on with its monotonous tick , tick -- that unobtrusive voice of warning and admonition -- until the half hour was sweetly chimed , and still Della sat there , pale , and still thinking . At length she rose , and with an energy unusual with her , walked hastily back and forth across the room . It had a soothing effect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if with some new lesson of life , harshly forced upon her . She seated herself once more before the mirror . " Minny , I am ready for you now . " Minny came , with her face calm and corpse-like , and once more essayed to bind up the rich bands of hair . " Place my wreath a little more front . My cheek needs the shade of that bright rose to relieve its pallor -- so -- that effect is charming . " " Your hair is dressed , Miss . " Della sprang to her feet like one who resolutely tossed some load from the heart , and taking the hand-mirror from the table , surveyed the arrangement of her hair altogether . " Beautiful ! Minny , you have excelled yourself to-night . " " Thank you , Miss . What dress ? " " My India mull , and the rose-colored ribbons . " The dress was brought , and Della stood before the full-length mirror while Minny fastened it . " Tie my shoulder-knots in your prettiest manner , Minny . " " Yes , Miss ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conquests ? " " I suppose so , " smiled Della ; " Minn , I pet you a great deal too much . " " I know it , Miss ; and make me love you a great deal too well . " Della sighed . At this moment there was a tap at the door , and Mrs. Delancey , in full evening costume , entered the room . " Most ready , dort , darling ? " " Yes , mamma , I will be down in a few minutes . " " You look very sweetly in that simple dress ; what prompted you to choose that to-night , treasure ? " " An instinctive knowledge , I presume , mamma , that I would look very sweetly in it , " replied Della , archly . Mrs. Delancey was a fine-looking woman -- very fussy and very French . She smiled , and displayed her brilliant teeth at her daughter 's answer , then stooped , and kissed her brow . Mrs. Delancey loved her child , with all the strength of affection she was capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some moments of pride and ambition , and second never , save to her love of fashion and display . " Clasp this string of pearls about your throat , it will relieve the plainness of your attire . " " I 'd rather not have it relieved , mamma . " " What a strange whim , " returned the lady , proceeding to fasten on the necklace . As the toilet was declared finished , Mrs. Delancey stepped back to observe the effect . " Charmante , ma chere ! " she exclaimed . " Remember , love , your father and I wish you to be particularly agreeable to General Delville this evening . He is a splendid match , rich as a Jew , and of such fine family ! " " He is the gentleman who was of age when papa was born , is n't he , mamma ? " " Hush , child ; what of that ! He may be a little old , but all the better -- you 'll be left a charming young widow the sooner . " Della lifted a bracelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest inspection , while her little satin-slippered foot kept up an unconscious , nervous tapping upon the carpet . Mrs. Delancey looked at her watch --  " Nine o'clock , Della ; the guests will begin to arrive , shortly . You need not come down till your father comes for you . Remember , ma chere , General Delville , particularly . " So saying , the proud mother swept from the apartment . As the door closed upon her , Della stepped through the open window , and passed out upon the balcony . Minny busied herself with putting aside the jewels which had not been wanted , and other unnecessary articles of dress , which the capricious fancy of her mistress had drawn from their proper places during the process of preparation . A half hour passed before Mr. Delancey sought his daughter 's apartment ; when he entered , Della was seated gracefully on an ottoman , arranging a bouquet of orange flowers and mignonnette . It was a sweet picture , and the father stopped to look upon it . Della looked up , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , then dropped again upon her flowers . " Are you ready , Della ? " " One minute , papa . " " You are looking very lovely to-night , my daughter . Be careful and have your manners to correspond with your looks . My choicest friends are here this evening , and I wish to see you Queen of Hearts . " " Especially to General Delville ? " " Especially to General Delville , Della . I shall be very happy to see you his wife , and it is in your power to become so if you choose . " " I should like to know how many wives he has already , before I take that step , so that I may know how strong a fortification my eyes need against finger-nails . " " Fie , Della ! the General has never been married , and you will no doubt occupy the first place in his heart . " " I have always hoped that when I married such might be my lot , but it can not be in this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till he has grown old enough to be my grandfather , he ca n't have much of a heart left . " " Della , you astonish me ! " said her father , with the frown deepening . " One would think you had no ambition whatever to make a good match . " " Papa , do you love me at all ? " Mr. Delancey started at the abrupt question , and gazed upon his daughter in surprise . " Love you , Della ? the whole of my heart is centred in you . " Della sighed , as if the answer did not quite please her , and taking her father 's proffered arm , went down the broad staircase , and into the magnificent drawing-room . Wealth , and beauty , and state , and grandeur , all were there ; yet first , and fairest , and brightest , shone the merchant 's daughter . The happy father and proud mother watched her , as with a light step she flitted through the thronged rooms , the " observed of all observers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation in her tread , and a glow on her cheek , which was all the more beautiful for being rare . She leant upon Mr. Delville 's arm , the envied object of many a young heart there ; and when seated at the harp , her clear , unaffected voice rose in strains of thrilling melody . General Delville was at her side , listening with earnest attention , and turning the leaves of her music with all the grace of a more youthful courtier . Aware , as he was , of the sanction of the father and the eagerness of the mother , it was no wonder that the General strove to win to his withered heart so fair a flower . He had been a great traveler , and had feasted his eyes on the beautiful women of the East , and the more frigid beauties of northern climes . He had been courted rather than courting , and had gone through life dreading to take to his heart a wife , lest , when too late , he should find his wealth had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought he saw a sweet and guileless girl ; and put forth all his attractive powers of conversation and graces of person ( which , old as he was , became him well , ) to interest her in himself . Her father watched the progress of their acquaintance with a delight which manifested itself , even in his cold eyes , and Della received the assiduous attentions of her white-haired admirer with a triumph for which she was excusable ; yet with no desire to win him closer than now . The evening wore away , the splendid supper was over , and the guests , one by one , took their departure . Many a youthful suitor made his adieus to Della that night with a jealous pang , as Delville 's apparent success arose to his mind . When the rooms were cleared , Mr. Delancey called his daughter to his side . " I can not let you retire , Della , without telling you how much you have pleased and gratified a father 's heart this night . I am more than ever proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delville can place you . Bless you , Della . Good night . " " Good night , papa . " Della moved gracefully away , and slowly mounted the broad staircase leading to her chamber . " No blessing of love -- no blessing of affection , " she murmured softly , as she went on , step by step --  " only a blessing through his pride -- cold , hollow , empty pride , with nothing noble , nothing lofty in it ; having for foundation only an eligible match for me , or my station , or my appearance . What a life , what a life ! " Della expected to find Minny asleep , as the hour was late ; but when she entered her apartment , Minny was there , walking the floor with her hands clasped thoughtfully before her . " Undress me , Minn . I am weary -- weary . " " Have n't you been happy , Miss ? " asked the girl , as she knelt to unfasten the slender slipper from the pretty foot . " Yes -- and no , Minn . If triumph could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that is concerned ; but in thinking of you I have been unhappy ; and I have thought of you all the evening . " " Of me , Miss , in the midst of all that gaiety ! " " Of you . Would you like to be free , Minny ? " " Free , Miss Della ? to have my freedom , and leave you ? " " Yes , Minny , if you would like your freedom , you shall have it this very night ; papa will do anything I say with regard to it , and you may go , dear Minn , whenever you choose . You shall have money to carry you where you like . In the North you might do well ; marry some rich abolitionist , perhaps , and be very happy . I am in earnest , Minn ; you have but to speak . " " Miss Della , if I have offended you in any way , if I have hurt your heart by any means , if I have spoken , acted , or looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save sending me from you . What would my freedom be to me away from you ? Miss Della , you will never know how poor Minn loves you . " The girl had spoken in such a subdued voice , uttering her short sentences between the sobs that were trying to struggle up , that , as she paused in her task , and looked in her mistress 's face with an expression of such tearful , doubtful anxiety on her features , Della was deeply touched , and sat a moment with her handkerchief pressed to her eyes . She took it down at last , and went on very calmly and thoughtfully . " Minny , it is very painful for me to talk of this , but you must understand me : I 'm afraid I can never be quite happy again , with you performing such offices as this for me . The discovery I made this afternoon -- that unfortunate discovery for both of us -- was terrible -- very terrible ! " " Oh , Miss , that of all things you should have asked me that ! I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget it , and let me be to you what I have ever been . " " I was right in what I suspected -- I am sure I guessed the truth -- you must tell me now , Minny , " said Della , taking one of Minny 's hands in hers , and speaking in a tone half doubtful that she might be wrong . " My father was your father , n'est ce pas , dear Minny ? " Heedless of the kindness with which the words were spoken , Minny threw up her hands with a gesture of despair , then flung herself full length upon the floor , in a burst of passionate grief . " Get up , Minny ; get up , and come by me here ; come ! " With the deep sobs still bursting from her lips , the girl rose , and sat , with bowed head and falling tears , at her young mistress 's feet . " Minny , you understand me now , do n't you ? Think of it , Minny : you are my sister ! " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My father 's child must never be a slave to me . " " Miss Della ! Oh that this knowledge should have ever come to either of us ; do n't for the love of mercy talk so ; do n't put me from you ; what am I but a negro 's child , the fruit of the white man 's sin ? " " I know , Minny , I know the world would never look upon this as I do ; but you are in my sight as much my sister as if my father had lost a first wife and wedded again , and we were the fruits of the two marriages . The same blood is in your veins that is in mine . He who gave you being , to me is ' father , ' to you is ' master . ' You are more beautiful than I , as well as better fitted for the society into which I am forced to move , yet you are a slave ! " Della leaned back in her chair a moment ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself quickly however , and continued : " I set the case before you just as it is , Minny ; I want you to view it in its true light -- then choose between what I offer you , and what you must otherwise be . Do n't tremble so , Minny ; I never have felt towards you as a mistress would to a slave . When I look back , I remember you were the only playmate I ever had , the closest and best companion of my wayward girlhood ; and I feel that I have always loved you , always respected you , and , Minny , I always shall . I am certain , Minn , that though there may be black blood circling round it , there never was a purer heart , a nobler soul , than yours . Were it not for my father 's sake your position should be different in this house , but in honor to him I can only do you good by sending you where your birth and parentage will ever be a mystery . Minny , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this time quiet as a statue , at her mistress 's feet . As she heard her stop speaking , she raised herself upon her knees before her , and clasping her small hands above her , exclaimed :  --  " As God hears me , Miss Della , I would rather stay by you , rather be the veriest slave that ever breathed , a mere thing to answer to your beck and call , so that I may be near you , and love you , and do for you , than to be the wife of the richest white man that ever lived -- to be looked upon as white myself -- or to move in those circles which you would fain believe me fitted for . As God hears me this is true ! " " Heaven bless you , Minny ! Then we will never part . " With an exclamation of joy , Minny clasped her young mistress to her heart , and poured forth , with passionate vehemence , her prayers and tears and blessings . It seemed as if she could never cease , and Della @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiful , beneath the thick black curls , which covered Minny 's neck , and gave her kiss for kiss , and tear for tear . " When I am Bernard 's wife , Minn , then I can make you happier . You have all those dear letters safe , quite safe ? " " I keep them as the apple of my eye , Miss . You can never make me happier , dear Miss , than I am now . I can never wish to be more blest than I am this minute . " " Dear Minny , you have a woman 's heart , and that must know a woman 's longings . When I have it in my power I shall at least try to make you happier , though it may be in a different way . You have always been more a friend and a fond companion than a slave to me , and now , now --  " Della paused , as if it were impossible for her to speak the words she would , then added , after a moment 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go farther , place a seal upon your lips , and let it die with you for my sake . And , if you will stay , Minny , rather than to go and be free and happy in your own way , I will do everything for you , love you , care for you , all -- only never , never let this dreadful truth be known . " " Never , Miss , so help me Heaven ! Only let me stay with you , and be what I have ever been to you , and I will be content . Try , dear Miss , to forget all that 's passed to-day , and let us stand together in the old light . " " No , Minny , I can never forget it . The old light can never shine on me again ; but I will try always to remember it as I should ; and now , Minn , finish , undressing me ; or rather , teach me to undress myself . " " I claim this as my privilege , Miss , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patted Minny 's cheek . There had a change come over her in the last few hours , such as she never thought to experience . It seemed as if she had become more of a woman in that short space than she had ever thought she would become . Her judgment and heart , too , seemed suddenly to have expanded ; and she felt more respect for herself than she had ever done before . She had always been one who thought for herself , notwithstanding there were so many to think for her ; and , with a spirit above all affectation , she looked at things in a plain , common-sense , and true light . When the first shock was over in regard to her relationship to Minny , she had struggled with her natural feelings of wounded pride , till the matter stood before her as it was . Her father was not one to win his child 's affections , and Della had always feared more than loved him ; but of one so cold and stern she had never in all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she almost wondered how it was she had never suspected as much before . Few girls , in Della 's position , would have talked with a slave as she talked to Minny -- would ever have thought of placing matters in so strong a light before her ; but Della was guileless and innocent at heart , with a child-spirit in some things , yet more than woman 's strength in others . She never thought Minny could take advantage of the new aspect of affairs she painted for her ; she only felt that Minny was enduring a life of wrong , and longed to give her redress . And Minny 's was a great , and noble , and truthful heart . From earliest childhood she had been taught to regard Miss Della as her mistress , and was never absent from her side . Della had been educated at home ; and Minny , with her quick mind , and an occasional lesson from her young mistress , together with her earnest desire to learn , had acquired more real knowledge than Della herself , though lacking some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus had they grown up together , and they were not to be parted now . CHAPTER XVIII . " Alas ! the heart that inly bleeds Has naught to fear from outward blow ; Who falls from all he knows of bliss , Cares little into what abyss . " Byron . When Arthur left the store , the evening after the unfortunate affair of the bank deposit , he had gone forth with no definite purpose , no chosen course for his footsteps , only with a longing desire to feel the breath of Heaven upon his hot brow once again , and to look up at the stars , which he felt glad would gaze on him always the same , from the deep blue sky above ; no matter what changes came o'er the heart of man , or how black the frown adversity might bend upon him . Perhaps had the youth , that night , been left to commune with his own rebel thoughts , and to the companionship of those holy stars , and the still voice of the night , he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart refreshed from the storm that had swept over it . But his evil genius pursued him ; and before he reached the first corner , he heard a quick step behind him , and turning , stood face to face with the last person he at that moment wished to meet -- Quirk , his fellow-clerk . Since the Sabbath which they had spent so disgracefully together , he had shunned Quirk in every way . He had avoided his glances , shunned his presence , and turned a deaf ear to his sneers and gibes . But now there was no way to avoid him , and Arthur greeted him with as good a grace as possible . " What the devil 's the matter with you , Pratt ? " he exclaimed , after the first words of recognition . " I can see plainly there 's been a muss between you and old D. , someway , but I 'll be hanged if I could find out what ' t was about . He has n't found out we lost that pass-key , has he ? " " D --  -- n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath with cool nonchalance ; " I do n't know whether he 's found it out or not , and care less . " " You 'd have to care , I reckon , if he did find it out , though , " returned the other . " Do n't you see the store is liable to be entered any night , if a clever fellow happened to find that key ? You see the number of the store and all is on it . " Arthur walked on for a moment in silence , then replied : " If a ' clever fellow , ' as you say , had found it , and wanted to use it for such a purpose , he 'd have been in , I guess , before now -- that key has been gone a month or more . " " Aye , but the nights have been too fine ; starlight or moonlight all the while ; and may be he is waiting for the new stock of goods , who knows ? " " Well , if that 's going to happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will not come just yet ; I 've got trouble enough for one season . " " Trouble ! what have you got to trouble you , I 'd like to know ? But I forgot , you have n't told me what occurred to-day ; and that 's just what I come after you for , to find out . " " Well , I may as well tell you , I suppose , if you are so anxious to know . Delancey , I do n't believe , will keep it to himself , and you may as well know it from me as him . " " Never hope for him to keep anything secret that could hurt a body ; I never knew him to screen a clerk 's faults yet . He is of the opinion that to make the matter public , is the best way to ensure better luck next time . Let 's step in here , and take something refreshing ; and you can tell me the story over our glasses . " Arthur complied , and entering one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block of the Crescent City , Quirk stepped to the counter , and ordered a bottle of wine , and , in an under-tone , added :  --  " A private apartment , also , if you have one empty . " The clerk , who was a portly , sensual-faced , red-haired man , raised his brows , and , tipping a sly wink at Quirk , said :  --  " Up stairs or down ? " " Both , perhaps , " returned the other , with a laugh ; " but if we want an upper one , we 'll let you know . Down stairs for the present . " The man had by this time lighted a lamp , at the wick of which he had been working for some time , and taking the bottle of wine , he led the way into the back part of the saloon , where was a door partially concealed by red moreen hangings . He shoved aside the curtain , and passed into a long vestibule , elegantly furnished , with doors opening on each side , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into small apartments , carpeted , lighted , and containing four chairs and a card-table , with a pack of cards . " You are perfectly private here , gentlemen . " " Yes , " replied Quirk , seating himself with the air of a man who has bought his comfort , and means to enjoy it . " Ah , Quibbles , what shall we do for cigars ? I forgot them . " " We have some prime Havanas , sir ; how many did you order ? " " Oh , bring me half a dozen ; that 's enough after wine . " Quibbles departed on his mission . " This is a nice place , Pratt , to tell secrets in ; do n't you think so ? " " I do , indeed , " said Arthur , looking around with a knowing air , and thrumming on the table with his fingers . The clerk at this moment returned with cigars and wine glasses , and drew the cork of the wine bottle . " Quibbles . " " Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not yet . " " When he comes tell him we are here , and send him in , will you ? " Quibbles bowed , and retired . " Is that the proprietor of this establishment , Quirk ? " asked Arthur , helping himself to a glass of wine . " Ho , ho , bless your heart , no . The proprietor is one of the pillars of an up-town church , and would feel his reputation ruined , and himself disgraced , if seen behind the counter of such a concern . He hires this man to play proprietor , and keeps the place open for the benefit of those who prefer bar-rooms to churches . You see , Christians go into anything that pays well , here . " Arthur bent over his glass with something like a frown on his young brow ; then holding his wine up between his eye and the light , he shook it slowly , and watched the ruddy reflection playing on his hand . " Did n't I hear you ask if Clinton had been here , Quirk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he frequent this place ? " " Well , between you and me , he does . " " Does he use these ? " said Arthur , lifting a few of the cards , and letting them fall slowly through his fingers . " Well , sometimes he does one thing , sometimes another ; you see this is a very extensive establishment , and sometimes he drinks in the saloon , sometimes gambles in here , and sometimes passes the evening up stairs with the ladies , and occasionally does all in the course of an evening . He 's a fine fellow , I tell you ; a fast un , though . " " What ladies are in the house , the family of the man out yonder ? " " Ha ! ha ! ha ! " roared Quirk , uproariously ; " what a prime innocent it is , though . Why , my boy , this is one of the fashionable establishments of the city . " A glow of shame crossed Arthur 's cheek , as the truth flashed upon his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of being led into such a place , he was about to pass out of the door . " Why , hold on , Pratt ; have you forgotten what you came here for ? You have n't told me a word of what you were going to . " " Nor shall I in this hole , " returned Arthur , laying his hand upon the door-key ; " if you want to hear it you must get out of here . " " Nonsense ! " exclaimed Quirk , trying to detain him ; " hold on till we finish this bottle . " " Not I , " replied Arthur , " I 've had enough ; " and dashing open the door , he rushed against the trim figure of Clinton , who was just about to enter . CHAPTER XIX . " Fate is above us all ; We struggle , but what matters our endeavor ? Our doom is gone beyond our own recall ; May we deny or mitigate it ? Never ! " Miss Landon . " Whither so fast , whither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he laid both hands on Arthur 's shoulders , and playfully detained him , that he could not answer the speaker with a frown ; so , holding out his hand , he shook that of the new comer heartily , and suffered himself to be led back into the card-room . " If you had n't have come just as you did , Clin , this chap would have been off like a shot from a shovel , his young modesty was so shocked just by my telling him the state of affairs in the house here , " said Quirk , tipping back in his chair against the wall , while a sneer mingled in the smile upon his lips . " Well , if he is n't used to such things , I do n't wonder , " returned Clinton , drawing Arthur to a seat by his side , and squeezing cordially the hand he still held . " You 're a pretty one to side that way , " said Quirk , half angry at Clinton 's remark . " If he ai n't used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he ever expects to be a man . " " Time enough , time enough , " replied Clinton , good-naturedly , shaking the bottle to see if there was anything left in it , then touching a table-bell at his side , he summoned Quibbles . " A couple of bottles of champagne here , and clean glasses . " They were brought instantly . " How came you to drop in here , boys , to-night ? I declare it is an unexpected pleasure . " " Pratt had something on his mind , and came in here to tell me of it ; but he got so d --  -- d huffy , I do n't suppose I shall hear it now . " " Something on your mind , eh , Pratt ? " said Clinton , in a commiserating tone , as he filled Arthur 's glass , and shoved the bottle to Quirk ; " if so , here 's to the end of it . " They touched glasses , and drank off the sparkling draught . " Now for the story , whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , only a little affair that happened after I left you this afternoon , " returned Arthur . " Indeed ! after you left me ! I am all impatience , my dear fellow , let 's hear . " In as few words as possible , dwelling as lightly as he could on what Mr. Delancey had said to him , Arthur told it all as it had happened , his companions listening attentively meanwhile . " Why , my dear soul ! " cried Clinton , clapping his hand on Arthur 's shoulder , as he finished speaking , " your pocket must have been picked . There 's always a crowd in the street at that time of day , and somebody has just been cute enough to rob you . " " So Mr. Delancey thought , and he said probably you did it , " returned Arthur , though in the tone of one who tells what he feels assured is false . " The deuce he did ! " exclaimed Clinton , filling the glasses again , and holding up his own to conceal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too bad anyhow , " said Quirk , with returning good nature . " You do n't get any credit for honesty , and have to bear the loss besides -- outrageous ! " " How did the old man know anything about me ? " said Clinton , with an indifferent air ; " I 'll have to call him out , if he touches upon my character in this style . " Quirk laughed , and Arthur hastened to explain to Clinton how the remark had been made , and how light a bearing , after all , it had upon himself . Clinton received it with a careless bow , as if , at best , he considered it a matter of no consequence . " And so he actually insinuated that you had it , eh , in the end ? " " Yes -- and that 's the most I care for ; if he had believed me honest , I could have borne the rest unmurmuringly ; but to be thought a thief ! " " It seems hard enough , do n't it ? " said Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win on the trusting heart beside him , and laying one hand familiarly on Arthur 's knee . " It 's a deuced piece of business , that 's all about it ! " cried Quirk , growing excited with the wine he had swallowed ; " it 's an insult I would n't take from any man -- old or young , or little or big ; I 'll be dem 'd if I would . " An insult ! that was a light in which he had not exactly placed it before , and Arthur 's blood rose at the thought . Clinton remarked it , with a twinkle of gratification in his keen eye , which he strove to conceal from Arthur 's observation . " It 's enough to drive one desperate ! I scarcely know what I should do under such circumstances , " said he , suddenly , with his eyes fixed keenly upon Arthur 's flushed face . " There 's no way for me to do but to put up with it , " returned Arthur , doggedly ; " I 've got to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well do it quietly as to make a disturbance about it , because it 's got to be done . " " It 's enough to tempt one to try the strength of the old adage --  --  , " continued Clinton , thoughtfully , and pausing in the midst of his sentence . " What 's that ? " asked Arthur , without looking up . " Why , to take the game as well as the name , " said the other , with a short laugh , and without taking his eyes from Arthur 's face . " True enough , " cried Quirk , " you might as well be a thief as to be called one , according to my opinion . " Arthur placed his elbow on the table , and looked into the lamp-blaze thoughtfully , with his head on his hand . " You are both ready to advise , " said he , after a moment 's silence , " but I doubt if either of you know what you 'd do in my case , after all . " " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you are not me , and I do n't ask you to do as I would . " " That 's just the thing ! " cried Quirk ; " and if you can hit upon a plan , carry it out ; there 'll be some satisfaction in that . " " Revenge ! " said Arthur , bitterly ; " how can I be revenged ? It would be a sparrow struggling against a vulture . " " You admit you have been wronged ? " " Most unjustly so . " " And you would be avenged , if you could ? " " Yes , if I spilled my heart 's blood . " Arthur had drank deeply of the wine , and his blood was heated with it , and his worst passions aroused . He had been goaded into the belief that he had been grossly insulted and had taken it submissively , and that revenge was his only resource . He threw aside his chair , and strode back and forth across the narrow room , with the excited tread of the caged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , then rising , linked arms , and leaned toward him in a confidential manner . " My poor friend , I pity you from the bottom of my heart ; count upon me whenever you are in want of a friend , will you ? " " Always , Clinton ; thank you . " " And if I should try to think upon some good plan , lay some good plot , by which you could gain retribution for this great wrong , would you then be courageous , and carry it out handsomely ? " " Would I ? Never fear me there . I 'll show you that I 'm not one to bow my neck to the insults of a money-holder . I 'll carry out anything you say . " " Bravo ! my boy ; you 've got the right kind of spirit in you ; that 's what I like to see -- you 're a man of pluck . " " About when do you think you 'll have this grand plot ready for me , eh ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk of the we-weather as to when that is c-coming , eh ? " " I suppose so , " said Clinton , laughing . " Meanwhile , come down to my house the last of the week , say Friday night , and I 'll have all things in cap-a-pie order for you . " " How do I know where to find you , my more than brother , " said Arthur , clasping Clinton 's hand closely . " Quirk knows the way . You 'll come ? " " Depend upon it . " " Good ! that 's settled ; now for a bumper on it . " " Well , I do n't know , Clinton ; I -- I -- declare I 'm afr-afraid I 'll be ( hic ) drunk if I drink any more . " " Nonsense ! down with it ; let 's finish the last bottle . " The wine was swallowed , and Clinton , taking Arthur 's hand in his , shook it heartily . " Ah ! my boy , you 've proved yourself ' one of us ' to-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in want or trouble , signal the b-hoys , and you 'll be helped out of it . It 's a better society than any of the Odd Fellows or Free Masons can ever be , and costs you nothing besides . What say you now for a stroll ? " " Agreed ! for my part , I am ready for anything . " " Then hurrah , boys ! " cried Clinton , beginning to sing a lively air ; and lighting their cigars , they passed out into the saloon . " Put all this in my bill , Quibbles , " said Clinton , as he passed that gentleman , on his way to the door . " That 'll do , sir -- all right . " With noise and laughter , and rude jest , the drunken trio went down the street . It needed but a glance to show that the younger of the three , he with the bright complexion and jetty hair , was but a novice in dissipation , and more than one felt a glow of pity , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Royal-street . Alas ! alas ! Arthur ; where was the ghost in your heart now ? that haggard figure , pointing ever with its skinny finger backward ! They kept on until they reached St. Ann-street , into which they turned ; as they did so , their attention was attracted by the appearance of a slight female figure , with a short cloak about her shoulders , and the hood drawn over her head . The moment she heard the unsteady steps behind her she hurried her pace , which was already rapid , and sped along with feet winged with fear . " By Jove ! that 's a graceful little minx ! " exclaimed Clinton . " She 's inclined to lead us a chase , too , " said Quirk . " Let 's after her . " " Agreed . " And with a shout , the three started in pursuit , scarce conscious , in their excitement , of the object they had in view . With a scream , the light form bounded onward , and fled away like the wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lightly clad , and with the hood falling from her head , and hands clasped upon a parcel she carefully carried , she seemed almost to fly before her pursuers . With a cry of delight , she saw the gleam of a lamp come through an open door , a little beyond , when , as she attempted to spring an intervening gutter , her foot struck the curb-stone , and she fell to the earth . In an instant she was lifted in the arms of Quirk and Clinton . " Oh , grandpapa ! grandpapa ! " she shrieked , in thrilling accents , " what will become of your poor , poor Blanche ? Help ! help ! " Her cries were unheeded by her merciless captors , and they bore her down an adjacent street . CHAPTER XX . " Oh ! Clifford , how thy words revive my heart ! " King Henry VI . " Villains ! " cried a deep , powerful voice , as a huge form met them , in full career , staggering through the darkness ; " villains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll rue the hour you ever placed a finger on her . " " Help ! help ! " " And who are you , I 'd like to know , that dares to put his finger in our p-p-pie ? " returned Quirk , trying to dash past the tall figure with his burden . " I am one that dares to protect defenceless virtue , whenever I see it thus assailed . This girl is not what you take her for , or she would never cry for help ; and I tell you to put her down , or I will make you , " returned the other , lifting his strong arm , and still preventing them from passing . The girl struggled in the grasp of her captors , and moaned . The new comer sprang forward with a bound , and clasping his arms about her , strove to draw her from their hold . " Not so fast , not so fast , " said Clinton , placing one hand over the girl 's mouth ; " remember we 're three to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke , you 'd better keep away . " " That 's the kind , " said Arthur , coming forward ; " hold on to her , Clin --  " The words were no sooner spoken , than the speaker fell to the pavement , leveled by a heavy blow from the arm of the intruder , and a second blow sent Quirk , staggering , into the gutter , while at the same moment the girl was snatched from the now yielding arms of Clinton . As she gained her feet , she flung back her hair from her eyes , and looked up in the face of her rescuer . " Monsieur Wilkins ! " " Good Heavens ! is this Blanche ? " At the mention of Wilkins ' name , Arthur and Quirk sprang to their feet , and started on a run down the street , followed by Clinton . " A devilish muss this , " cried Quirk , as they paused on a corner , a few blocks from the scene of their discomfiture . " It was too dark for him to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had n't been for the lamp gleam coming suddenly through that window , she would not have known him . " " I hope he did n't know me , " said Arthur , rubbing his forehead , which had struck the pavement as he fell , and feeling considerably sobered by his fall , and the recent flight . " I do n't want this scrape to go back to Guly . " " Who 's that ? your young milk-and-water brother ! Pshaw ! what does he know about the fun of such things ? If you want to enjoy yourself , I advise you to keep your sprees a secret from him ; he has no soul to appreciate such affairs . " " You are more than half right there . " " He 's the kind of character I ca n't bear to be near , " said Quirk , emphatically . " You could n't pay him a higher compliment than to say that , " returned Arthur , warmly . " Well , well , do n't get into a miff about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " " I shall go home , I reckon ; my head aches , " said Arthur . " No , you wo n't go home either , " replied Clinton , pulling him along with him , good-naturedly . " Let 's make a night of it , now we have begun . What do you say for the Globe ball-room ? There 's a high affair there to-night , and ' We 'll dance all night till broad daylight , And go home with the gals in the morning . ' " " Agreed , " said Quirk ; " come along , Pratt . Your foot 's in , and it 'll be dirty , whether you pull it out first or last ; you may as well have the good of it . " With a heart responding to this idea , Arthur suffered his companions each to take an arm , and went on with them to the Globe ball-room . The haggard ghost , the pale figure of warning and remorse , was gone for ever from Arthur 's heart . Wilkins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave scarce a thought to the flight of those who had opposed him ; but , with a gush of thankfulness in his heart , he drew Blanche 's arm within his , and led her back toward her own house . " How came you to be in the street at this hour , Miss ? Do you know it is after midnight , and young girls like you are never safe in these streets at such hours ? " " Oh , sir , " said Blanche , bursting into tears , " my grandpapa was taken very ill . I had no one to send , you know , and of course I had to go for assistance myself . I looked all up and down the street , and saw nobody , not even a watch-man ; so I put on my cloak , and ran for the doctor . He was n't home ; so I went a little further to see old Elise , who always gives me medicine that helps grandpapa , and she detained me a little while preparing it ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried my very best to run away , but I fell down , and they caught me . Oh , Mon Dieu ! Monsieur ! what if you had n't come just as you did ! " " You would have been a most miserable little girl , without doubt , Miss Blanche . " " I can never thank you enough , Monsieur . " " You can repay me by never going out at such a time again . " " And when another case comes just as extreme , Mr. Wilkins , what can I do ? I could n't let poor grandpapa die , could I ? " There was such an earnest intonation of voice in these words , and such a simple innocence of manner , that Wilkins could n't repress a smile . " If I furnish you with a tidy little black girl , will you take good care of her , Miss Blanche , and let her do your errands ? " " Oh , Monsieur , that would be too much for you to do . " " No ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of them is too young to be put out to a place , and is just old enough to work for you . " " You are so very kind ! " By this time they had reached Blanche 's home , and as she tripped up the steps , she said :  --  " Come and see grandpapa to-morrow , Mr. Wilkins ; and let him thank you for his kindness to his little house-keeper . " " I will come , Miss Blanche . " " And , Monsieur , " she added , coming out again after she had passed into the door , " bring Guly with you , wo n't you ? " " Oui , Mademoiselle . " The door closed , and Wilkins passed on , thoughtfully , towards Royal-street . In the excitement of the recent adventure , he had almost forgotten what had called him forth at that time of night , and now walked on , like one who wanders forth purposeless , into darkness and solitude . But suddenly , in passing a brilliantly lighted cafe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , the idea flashed upon him , that he might have been one of those concerned in the capture of little Blanche . He stopped short , and was about to turn back , to endeavor to trace the fugitives , when he remembered that Arthur had as yet but just commenced the downward path , and that he could not already have become so fallen as to commit so base an act as that which he had just witnessed . It had been too dark to recognize faces , and his own excitement had prevented him from thinking to notice the voices ; and the more he thought of it , the more convinced was he that Arthur was not among them . He had sat with Guly by the fire until the midnight hour had passed , waiting for Arthur 's return ; but when the fire died out , and the lamp faded , and he still was absent , he persuaded Guly to go to bed , promising that he would seek his brother before he slept . Guly would fain have accompanied him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to familiarize the pure heart of his boy-friend with the scenes in which he felt convinced he must look for the wanderer . Wilkins faithfully kept his word , and left no place unsearched wherein he thought it possible to find Arthur . He believed he would find him in some one of the popular places of resort , standing ever open , with their false glitter and dangerous splendor , to lure their victims to destruction . But ' the wee small hour ayont the twal ' found him still searching , and still unsuccessful . Disappointed , with lingering steps he turned toward the store , but , as he stepped upon the sill , a slender figure darted from the alley-way , and laid a chill and trembling hand upon his arm . " Bernard ! " " Heavens , Minny ! what brings you here ? " " Hopes and fears , and memories , and sorrows , which will not die . " " Pshaw , girl ! harping on the old string yet ! What of your mistress ? " " She is well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And did she send you to me ? how came you here ? " " I came here with the pass , which gives any negro a right to the highway ; and though I forged it , it served me well . " Minny stepped back into the shadow of the archway , and Wilkins , obeying the convulsive grasp of that delicate hand , followed her . " Bernard , " said she , dropping her voice almost into a whisper , which echoed deep and clear through the dark and narrow alley , " I have come to you to-night , for the last time in my life , to stand before you for a moment in the light of other days . " She paused , as if some smothered emotion overcame her ; and the trembling hand upon his arm slipped down , and was clasped an instant in Wilkins ' grasp . It lingered there but a moment , one wild sad moment to Minny , and was withdrawn hastily , with a gush of tears . " I can not tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching sadness , and speaking every word with impressive distinctness , " I can not tell you what came over me to-night , as I sat by the tall window , looking up at the pale stars , and listening to the night-wind , but it seemed to me like some vivid dream , or some shadowy vision of the past , and as my mistress fell asleep , I sat there still , looking up at the stars , with my vision between me and them . Listen , Bernard , and let me tell you what it was . " Wilkins ' heart was touched by the soul-reaching sadness of the girl 's manner , and he folded his arms patiently upon his breast , and leaned back against the brick wall of the archway , with his head bent forward to listen . " I saw myself , Bernard , at first , as I was when first you came here . I knew none of the sorrows of my situation then , if there were any ; at least I did not think it was anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and very happy . I saw myself tripping along with my basket in my hand , as I so often used to do in my frequent errands to the store , and I met you , and at last , one moonlight night , you started with me from the store , and talked with me kindly and gently , and left me only at the gate of the great house where I lived . Bernard , do you remember ? " " Yes , Minny , I do remember . " " And the next night , and the next -- and still the next -- they all came before me to-night so clearly . You were by my side , and talking sweetly , gently , lovingly . Yes , you told your love to me , Bernard ; I saw you in my vision to-night as plainly as I saw you in reality then . On your knees before me , me the quadroon , clasping my hand , kissing it , blessing it , praying , imploring , beseeching me to be your wife . You were younger then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wildly -- Oh ! my God ! with what intenseness -- and I told you so . To-night , looking up at those stars above me , I seemed to hear the old cathedral bell , I saw the doors swing slowly open , I heard the solemn service , you clasped me to your heart -- your own . " " Girl ! girl ! " cried Wilkins , striking his hand upon his brow passionately , " why do you come to call all this up now ? " " Hear me , Bernard , " said Minny , laying her hand again upon his arm . " You must hear me out . My lips shall never call the past to your mind again , never ; but hear me now . I kept my place , and you kept yours . We met clandestinely , when we could , and where we could ; and when I found that bondage kept me from your side , and that you had neither the gold to buy me , nor the courage to have it said you bought your wife , then , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was as white as you , as free in heart and motion , with high and good impulses , and a cultivated mind ; and yet I had no liberty to go abroad , and make my home with him I loved , and , for the first time in my life , I cursed the fate which rendered me a slave ! A little time went on , and what a change ! Oh ! Heaven ! that I should e'er have lived to see it ! you grew cold and distant as you rose in life , and when you gained the position you now have here , I saw , because my very love made me see , that an ambitious heart had turned your thoughts higher than the poor quadroon , the beautiful but wretched slave . You loved my mistress ! my master 's daughter ! She whom he would rather this day bury in the Potter 's field than see your wife -- and you know it ! Oh ! what agony then was mine ! It was my turn then to weep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , your own ? Ha ! what answer did you give me then ? That our marriage was a mere form , that it was illegal , and I was -- what ? No marriage could be performed lawfully , you said , between a white man and a woman with the blood of my race in her veins . I wonder that I did not go mad then ; I was taken terribly ill , but it was my fate to live on in misery . I lived to see you and Miss Della meet often , after that first meeting at the masked ball , and I lived to see her love you . When I found her secret out , I gave you up for ever ; and from that moment my love froze up , and has hung in my heart like an unthawing icicle ever since . " " Have done , girl ! " cried Wilkins , suddenly laying his heavy hands on her shoulders , as she stood before him with the starlight she so loved , just making her pale face and glittering eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will curse you . Hence ! I have heard enough of this ; why do you come prating here , to tell me what I already know too well ? out upon you ! " In his impatient anger , Wilkins threw her from him , and strode hurriedly , up and down through the narrow alley , where they stood . Minny waited until his excitement had in a measure subsided , and he stood once more with folded arms before her , and his dark eyes looking into hers . " Now , " said he , speaking half in mockery , half in awe of the firm-hearted girl beside him , " now , my sin , my concentrated lightning , my beautiful passion , my quintessence of gall and bitterness , go on . I 'll stand and listen now till doomsday , if you will it , though your lips drop burning coals into my bare bosom , and scorch my soul . Go on , I say , I 'll listen . " Minnie drew herself up proudly before him , as she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her keen eye fixed upon him , unwaveringly . " Had you possessed a soul to burn over a woman 's woes , and a woman 's wrongs , it would have been scorched out long ago , Bernard ; but let that pass . I came to you this night , not only to tell over my own wretchedness , a reviewal of which had risen up so forcibly before me , but I came to you anew as the spirit of the past , to call up in your breast the memory of what you have been , and to ask you if the future brings a change . And now , Bernard , on all your hopes of happiness , here or hereafter , answer me truly . Do you sincerely love this girl , whose guileless heart you 've won ? " " And whether I do or not , girl , is it you I must make my confessor ? No , never . It is a matter which concerns you not at all . Whether my heart be black as hate , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare to no one . Whatever my feelings or intent in this matter , they are my own . " " Not so , Bernard . If ambition has prompted you to gain her affections , if love of wealth has sent you a wooer at that shrine , having in your breast no faithful heart to bestow in return for hers , let me beg , let me implore you , to stop where you are . Be merciful , compare the home which you can give , to the home from whence you take her . Compare the happiness which you can bestow to that of which you rob her , and feel , that if you take her , with all this , to a loveless breast , you take her to misery , to desolation , and death ! " " Do you deem me a villain , woman ? " " What you have been , you may be again . " Wilkins mused a moment ; then , in a softer and more subdued tone , said :  --  " No , no ; oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh never ! " " Bernard ! my mistress is dear to me ; her happiness more sacred to me than my own . If I believed that you would ever play her false , if I believed that a sinister motive led you to accomplish this end , as I stand before you here , I would expose you as you are . I would lay bare to her the secrets of the past . I would warn her to recall the love which she has lavished on you , though the next hour should be my last , in consequence . Her happiness shall never be wrecked while I have the slightest power to guide it clear from danger . " With his impetuous spirit growing calm , as Minny became more excited , Wilkins looked upon her , as she confronted him , with her soul in her face , and his eyes kindled with the admiration his impulsive but generous heart could not but feel . " Most nobly spoken , Minny ! " he exclaimed , earnestly , " and now , as Heaven hears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a first love , a wavering , flickering , effervescing sentiment of youthful hearts , faithful and enduring in some instances , but not in mine , and this , God forgive me , I gave to you . True , I believed then I could never change ; but the change came , with the exhalation of my heart 's first passion , and though I never hated , I found I could no longer love you . Our marriage was illegal ; I did not know it when it took place , but I learned it afterwards , when my love had chilled , and with perhaps a cruel , but a just hand , Minny , just to us both , I severed the cord which had bound us so sweetly , and our parted hearts drifted out of each other 's sight , on the billows of life 's ocean . " " Aye , Bernard , the one , a torn and shattered wreck , cast helpless on the desolate shores of sorrow and despair ; the other , strong and uninjured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of a sad memory following it . " " Too true , Minny , too true ! alas for the restless impulses of my misguided spirit . Alas for the trusting hopefulness of thine . But , Minny , as I stand before you now , with my whole heart open to your sight , I can most truly declare , that my love for Della is all that you would have it . She is trusting and innocent . I will never blight the one , or betray the other . I will hold her to my strong heart as some tender flower , which needs protection from a wintry blast , and from the world 's cold breath ; I will shield and guard , and cherish her with my life . God help me so to do ! " " Amen , Bernard , amen ! " " Minny , are you satisfied ? " " Yes ! my heart trusts you once again . Even more hopeful for its trust for another , than even for itself . " " Bless you , Minny ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . I will see you safe to your own gate , and then good-night . " Minny suffered Wilkins to draw her hand within his arm , and lead her forth once more beneath the starry skies . They walked on silently , each engrossed with their own reflections , with only the occasional interruption of the watchman , or the rattle of some noisy vehicle , hastening along the stony streets . Minny at last stopped at the entrance of the vacant court , leading to the secret garden door . As she was about to withdraw her hand from his arm , Wilkins retained it , firmly , yet respectfully , in his own . " I have been thinking , Minny , more deeply than I ever thought before , of the great wrong which I have done you . The time may never come again when we shall meet as to-night we 've met , and before we part , I must hear your lips pronounce my forgiveness . " " From the bottom of my heart , Bernard , I forgive you all that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or thought , or deed . " " I have been a wretch , Minny . " " But , " continued the girl , without heeding the interruption , and speaking in an earnest , thrilling tone , " by the Heaven that is above us both , Bernard , I here swear , that if you are ever cold or cruel to the new bride you are winning , as true as there 's a heart in my bosom , I will be her avenger -- mark my words ; though I should have to follow you to the ends of the earth , that revenge shall be mine . " A moment of silence ensued , and Minny stood like a breathing statue of retribution , with her glittering eyes fixed upon the face before her . " Ah , Minny , the chill breath of desertion and sorrow has extinguished the last spark of affection which once glowed in your breast for me , or you could never speak thus . But fear not ; your young mistress shall be to me as the apple of my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Enough , enough . Good-night . " " Stay , Minny ; can you learn to think of me kindly ; and , in coming days , to witness my affection for another unshrinkingly ? " " I have already learned to do so . " " And you will not let these gloomy visions of the past rise up between you and the far-off stars ? " " Never again , never again . " He pressed the trembling hand he held between his own , and touched it to his lips . It was drawn quickly from him ; a stifled sob fell upon his ear , and he stood alone . Slowly he turned his steps homewards , and with every echo of his solitary footfall , with every sob of the passing night-wind , came back upon his troubled heart , with thrilling sadness , Minny 's last mournful words , " Never again , never again ! " Again he reached the store , and the lock , obedient to the ponderous key , turned noiselessly , and Wilkins entered . It was dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastened the door , and groped his way along between the deserted counters . The scene through which he had just passed had called up bitter and unpleasant memories , and there came over him a sense of lonely desolation , such as he could not endure to experience . He stopped a moment as he reached the high desk , and stood there , silent and thoughtful . " I will go to him , " he muttered ; " there is something holy in his presence , which will make me happier . " With cautious steps he mounted the winding stairs , and sought the room where Guly lay . The moment he approached the bedside , the boy started from his restless pillow . " Arthur , is it you ? " " It is me , Guly , " returned Wilkins , in a low voice . " You ! and you come without him ? " " I come alone , Guly . " " And has anything happened -- oh ! do not keep it from me ! Is Arthur hurt ? What brings you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I came here , Guly , with my own troubled heart , to look upon you as you slept , and to go away happier . I have no news , either good or bad , of poor Arthur . " Guly was silent a moment , then taking Wilkins ' hand , he said :  --  " I can not tell you how much I thank you for the long and dreary walk you have taken for my sake . Some day I hope to be able to repay your kindness . " " Do n't mention it , Guly ; a mere trifle . " " It was a great deal to me ; and now , Wilkins , would you just as soon lie down by me as to sleep in your own bed ? It must be nearly morning , but this is a gloomy place to lie in alone , with only a troubled heart for company . " " True , Guly ; I will be with you in a moment . " They lay down together , and soon slept , side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's fair head was pillowed on the man 's breast , rising and falling there like a golden shield , resting on the bounding heart , " keeping the evil out . " CHAPTER XXI . " ' T is done ! I saw it in my dreams . No more with hope the future beams ; My days of happiness are few . Chilled by misfortune 's wintry blast , My dream of life is overcast . Love , hope , and joy , adieu --  Would I could add , remembrance too . " Byron . Arthur was at his place in the morning , almost as soon as Jeff opened the door . His face was pale and haggard , and wore upon it a look of unbroken gloom , and his eye wandered restlessly , as if dreading to meet another 's gaze . He had arrived at his post so early , however , that no clerks were yet in the store , and for some time his only companion was the busy negro . " Jeff , " said he , at last , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , sah . " " Did you sleep here behind the store-door last night , as usual ? " " Yes , massa , ob course . " " Did my brother go to bed early that you know of ? " " Well , no , massa , he did n't . He and Massa Wilkins sat back dar by de fire pretty late , sah ! " " Indeed ! what could they have been talking of to keep them sitting up ? " " Well , massa , I do n't ' spect ' t would be berry hon'ble in me to tell , case I know dey taut I was sleepin ' , and did n't know I could n't help hearin ' ebery word dey sed . " Arthur blushed as the thought crossed his mind , that the negro 's sense of honor was higher than his own ; but his curiosity overcame his scruples , and he went on questioning Jeff , as he rubbed up and trimmed the lamps for evening . " Perhaps you heard my name , Jeff , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spect I did , sah . Bery common ting for brudders to talk of one anudder , " said Jeff , rubbing away on the lamp he held with redoubled earnestness . " Did Mr. Wilkins leave the store , that you know of , after it was closed ? " " Well , I bleeb he did , sah ! He could n't a come in widout he 'd been out , and I know one ob my toes got pinched in de crack ob de door by his coming in when ' t was most mornin ' . " " My brother was not with him then , was he ? " " Well , I had my eyes shut , sah ! and it was too dark to see if I 'd a had ' em open . ' Alus de darkest hour ' fore day , ' you know , sah . " " You do n't know whether my brother asked Mr. Wilkins to go out , or not , I suppose ? " " Really , could n't tell anyting ' bout it , sah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and taking down another lamp carefully . As he gained the floor his eyes met Arthur 's face . " Bless de Lord , young massa , how came you by dat offal bump ' long side ob your head ? " Arthur drew his hat hastily over his brow , and turned away with a dissatisfied air , without giving any reply . He stood in the door , half-angry at the unsatisfactory answers he had received , but ashamed to show , even to the black , that he felt any real interest in the matter . Preferring , too , to continue the conversation in any way rather than be left to silent communion with his thoughts , he turned suddenly , and said :  --  " Jeff , would n't you like to be free ? " " Free , massa ! " exclaimed the negro , rolling up his great eyes at his questioner , in earnest wonder ; " why , what de debil put dat in your head ? No , sah ! I would n't be free for nuffin .

Yah , yah , I fixed de ole feller dat time , Massa Pratt , I ' sure you . " Arthur could not help smiling at Jeff 's enthusiastic relation of the circumstance , and at the same time he saw it was useless to carry on a conversation upon this subject with one of his quick wit ; so he only remarked to the negro , who seemed waiting for some encomiums , that he " served him right , " and then turned away , and began arranging the goods in his department for the day 's sale . Steps were now heard upon the stairs , and Wilkins , followed by Guly , came down into the store , the latter looking pale , and half-sick , from the previous night of lonely and anxious vigils . Wilkins passed Arthur with a cheerful " good morning , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the attempt was futile , and he gained his side , and took his hand , silently . Arthur 's heart had not become so hardened , in so short a space of time , as to lose all its generous impulses , and he was deeply touched by the expression of his brother 's face , so full of grief , yet with such an apparent effort to conceal all sorrow from him . Wilkins was engaged with his books , and Jeff was busy in the back part of the store ; and , assured that he would not be observed , he threw an arm about his brother , and drew him close to his side . Guly lifted his large blue eyes , sad and moistened , to Arthur 's face . " Dear Arthur , " he whispered , " could you but know how much I loved you , you would never -- never --  " he could get no farther , and stopped suddenly , struggling to keep down his rising emotion . " I would never go astray thus , you would say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate ; I can not turn aside from it , nor avert it ; when I would stop and struggle , on this slippery , downward path , I find it impossible , and I rush on , like one who must keep moving , or fall . " " You do not call upon One to aid you , who would surely hear your cry . " Arthur was silent . " If we knelt oftener , side by side , as we used to , dear brother , do you not think that your heart would grow more humble and more submissive ? and that we both would be happier far ? " " Guly ! do not charge me with having totally neglected those duties . The past night must , indeed , have been a long one , if you can believe that we no longer do as we used to do . Night before last , remember , Guly , I was by your side , looking over with you the pages of the Holy Word , and kneeling to Him who bids us obey it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seemed to me almost interminable . It is very lonely without you , Arthur . " " I am not sorry you miss me , Guly ; it seems to whisper of so much love ; and your love is very dear to me . Remember what I told you the other night upon the step , and always try to feel this affection for me . " " Always , Arthur . " " There is a terrible weight upon my spirits this morning , " added the elder brother , speaking huskily ; " I have never felt such a heaviness of heart before . All that was ever bright in my past life , comes up to my memory with a pall wrapped around it , and the future shows no fairer scene . In truth , I have witnessed more vice since I parted from you , Guly , than I have ever imagined the world contained . " " Do n't you feel ill , Arthur ? If you will lie down , I will see that your place is taken care of . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; I require no rest now ; and I may as well bear up , after a night 's dissipation , first as last . " " I beg you , Arthur , not to talk in this way . Surely you do not mean to continue this course ; you will not , you can not , I am sure . What would I ever do , dear brother , left utterly alone and friendless here ? " " My poor Guly ! alas , I dare not promise myself to make another attempt to do better ; my pride is my misfortune ; and I feel as if the hopes and promises of all my young life were dead . I am wretched , wretched ! " At this moment Quirk entered the store ; and as Arthur looked up , he caught the leer of significant meaning , sent from a quick wink of the eye , and a momentary elongation of the visage , of his late companion . He smiled in return , but at the same moment blushed deeply , as if ashamed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also gently withdrew the arm which was about his brother , and moved a little away from him . The clerks now began rapidly to fill their respective places , and the brothers started forth , accompanied by Wilkins , to the restaurant . Wilkins observed , that at breakfast Arthur helped himself freely to claret , and drank heartily , as if to satisfy a burning thirst . He made no remark upon it , however , and the meal was altogether a sad and silent one . All were reflecting upon the events of the past night , a subject which each felt a peculiar sensitiveness about broaching , and with the mere table ceremonies , which even in such a place the brothers did not fail to observe , the breakfast was finished . As was frequently the case , Wilkins was the first to be through , and as soon as he had taken the last mouthful , he took his hat and started for the store , as if there was something painful in the silence which had fallen over them . Though left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been discussing before Quirk 's appearance , and though Guly longed to ask about the bruise standing out blue and prominent on his brother 's brow , he could not frame the words with which to ask the question . He felt , too , that the knowledge might bring him much more trouble and uneasiness , than the unexplained sight of the blow , and they passed forth into the street , with linked arms , but divided hearts , and turned their steps toward the store . They had gone but a short distance , when Guly 's attention was attracted by a gathering crowd upon the opposite side of the way , and , with a natural feeling of curiosity , he hastened across the street , accompanied by Arthur , to discover the cause of the excitement . What was his astonishment , to see extended upon the pavement , face downwards , while with his long arms he swept his crutches around him , like a pair of oars , to keep his tormentors , the boys , away , his old acquaintance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his descent had dropped his greasy cap , from which had rolled a few of his precious picayunes . He either was unable to rise , or else would not do so , lest while he was engaged in righting himself , the boys should rob him of his scattered silver . They had gathered about him at his fall , but he had swung his long crutches so dexterously around him , keeping his one eye fixed gloatingly upon the bits of change meanwhile , that not one dared to approach him closer . The moment Guly 's eye fell upon him , he hastened forward with an exclamation of pity upon his lips , and in spite of the crutches , he stepped behind the unfortunate old man , and raised him to his feet . Without hesitation he commanded the boys to leave the picayunes untouched , placed the cane properly in the dwarf 's hand , then restored to him the cap , and its scattered contents , at the same time adding a trifle from his own purse , to the little stock . " Hih @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time looking up , as he received his treasure ; " hih , hih . " His one eye , with its odious expression , lit suddenly upon Guly 's face , and became illuminated instantly with a new light . It regarded him earnestly , and though he stepped back to avoid the gaze , the immense head , with that one eye burning in it , turned still toward him , on the slim , wrinkled neck . " You pick me up , Monsieur ? " Guly smiled , and nodded . " Hih , hih ; I am obliged to you ; will you keep the boys away till I get started ? " " They shall not touch you . " Taking one more earnest look of Guly , he threw his weight upon his long crutches , and swung away between them , with the skirts of his coat , as usual , trailing behind him . " You have met this miserable object every morning , for more than a month , now , Guly , and he has always begged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know whether he is worthy or not ? " said Arthur . " His deformity is sufficient to testify to that , brother . " " With your salary , I ca n't imagine how you can afford it . " " A picayune a day is a mere trifle ; I save for him what I might otherwise spend in selfish indulgence . " " Well , charity begins at home . I ca n't afford to be so benevolent . " " Whoso giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord , " replied Guly , with a smile , as they entered the store . CHAPTER XXII . " I love that soul so nobly proud , That misery can not blight ; The soul that braves the jeering crowd , And sternly claims its right . " Anon . Guly took his place with a more cheerful heart than the early morning had promised him ; for the consciousness of having performed a kindly deed , imparted a buoyancy to his spirits , which on the previous night he had almost fancied he could never experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few moments , when a lady entered to purchase some embroidery . The article she desired was an expensive one , and the contents of the whole box were searched before she found it . As Guly was folding it for her , he perceived , as he held it between him and the light , that there were several threads broken here and there between the delicate fibres of the work , as if it had been eaten by an insect . He immediately pointed out the defect to his customer . She examined it , and finding that the piece had suffered in the same way throughout , she expressed her thanks to him warmly for having made her aware of the imperfection , and also manifested her regret at not being able to take the article under such circumstances , for she had intended it as a bridal gift to a young friend of hers , and would have felt deeply mortified if the discovery had been made after the presentation . After a few more trifling purchases , she turned away , and Guly restored the rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box upon the shelf . As he turned round , his eye fell upon the face of his employer , who stood bolt upright on the opposite side of the counter . Guly bowed politely , and wished him good morning ; but the hard face before him relaxed not a muscle , and stared straight and rigidly into the boy 's eyes . It needed no second glance to show that Mr. Delancey was very much enraged . " Did I see you , sir , " he demanded , at last , in a tone far from being inaudible , " point out to a customer a defect in her purchase , and so lose a sale ? " " I certainly did so , sir ; you would not have me sell an imperfect piece of goods , knowing that it was so , for perfect , and take the full price for the same , would you ? " " What was it to you , I 'd like to know , after she had examined the piece , and declared that it suited her , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not discovered it ? " " She might have discovered it afterwards , and would no doubt have thought I meant to deceive her , and , in all probability , I should have lost her custom altogether . " " Nonsense ! young man ; she would have sent it to her milliner to make up , and in an hour the imperfection would have never been discovered . The next time I see you do a thing of this kind , you lose your place . " " Then I must , sir , " returned Guly , firmly ; " I can never sacrifice principle to profit , under any circumstances . " " You 're a fool , " said Delancey ; pale with anger at the firm but mild demeanor of his clerk . " How much would the sale have amounted to ? " " Thirty-five dollars . " " It shall be taken from your salary . Teach you better another time . " " Very well , sir . Wilkins , be kind enough to mark my salary thirty-five dollars less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his part of the conversation in so loud a tone , that it was audible to a number , who were not too busy with their own affairs to pay heed to it ; but Guly felt deeply chagrined to observe , as Mr. Delancey turned away , that his late customer had been standing just behind the merchant , examining some goods at another counter , and had probably heard all that had passed . As she left the store she looked up at Guly , with a smile , bowed to him , and passed out . As small as Guly 's salary was , he looked upon the loss which he had suffered as a mere trifle , when compared with the pleasure he received from an approving conscience . Ho felt that he had acted right , not only in exposing the defects in the desired article , but in remaining firm to his sense of duty under the anger of his employer . The incident awakened in his breast a wish to know the name of the lady who had looked at the goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood next to him , to make inquiry . Hull informed him that he knew little of her except as a customer ; that he had never learned her name , as he did those of most of his customers , by sending goods to their houses , for she always came in her carriage , and brought her own servant . He added , that her affability had won the esteem of all the clerks ; more than this he could not tell . When the dinner hour arrived , Quirk sauntered down past Guly , looking at him with an impudent stare . He turned back , as he reached the door , and stopped at the counter . " Anything you will have , Mr. Quirk ? " " No , I reckon not ; when I do , though , I 'll know where to come to find an honest chap to deal with , " and he curled his disagreeable mouth into a sneer . Guly was silent ; not wishing to prolong the conversation with one for whom he felt such an aversion . Quirk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manner ; and drawing out his tooth-pick , he began using it among his huge masticators , and continued :  --  " I s'pose you thought the boss was of the Puritan stamp , and would perhaps promote you for that nice little affair of this morning , eh ? You found yourself mistaken , I reckon , when you had the thirty-five charged over , ha , ha ! " " I thought , sir , of acting honestly , only ; and since you happened to overhear the conversation , let me tell you that I should have done the same thing the next moment , under like circumstances . " " Well , you 're a precious ninny , that 's all I 've got to say about it . " " If so , perhaps you 'll be willing to lounge on your own counter instead of mine , Mr. Quirk . " " No , " he replied , at the same time changing his position , " I 'm comfortable enough here ; so long as the boss do n't see me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no reply . " Well , say , " said Quirk , again wheeling round so as to face Guly , " what 's the reason you ca n't be a little sociable with a feller , when he comes and tries to talk with you . Pshaw , your brother is worth two of you . " " I prefer devoting business hours to business , " returned Guly . " And paying for lost sales out of your own salary . Let me advise you , if you are going to stay in this place , to let the customers find their own blemishes , and take the responsibility . " " I shall always act according to my own judgment in such cases , Mr. Quirk , " replied Guly , taking his hat , and leaving the young gentleman to pour out his advice to an unoccupied counter . Arthur had gone to dinner before him ; so Guly trudged on alone , and , on entering the restaurant , found Wilkins seated at the little table , which the three so frequently shared together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guly , anxiously . " He finished before me to-day , for a wonder , " returned Wilkins , smiling , " and went out some time since ; you probably passed each other on opposite sides of the way . " This last suggestion quite comforted Guly , whose apprehensions for his brother had , of late , become most painfully awakened , and he fell off into conversation with his companion , upon the various topics which chanced to present themselves to their minds . Suddenly Wilkins looked up , and remarked :  --  " I have an engagement for you to-night , Guly . " " For me ! what is it , pray ? " " Guess . " " Oh , I never can . You must tell me , if you ever expect me to know . " " What would you say , if I told you ' t was a visit to Blanche ? " " Can it be possible ? " Guly blushed very deeply , which Wilkins observed , and commented upon with mischievous delight . " Did the invitation come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure it did . " " And you accepted in my name ? " " Certainly . " " Thank you ! I shall be delighted . " " At eight o'clock , then . " " Very well . " And so they parted , and Guly was left alone at the little table . It was an hour when the restaurant was pretty well filled , and the numerous inmates busily discussed the news , foreign and political , and affairs private and public , in their various languages and different manners . Guly looked round from his solitary table , an amused spectator of the scene . But suddenly his attention was attracted by a sound of shuffling steps upon the floor , and turning , he beheld his friend the dwarf , making his way in between the tables , with a dexterity which his long canes would scarcely warrant . Though surprised at the presence of one so poor in such a place , Guly advanced , and placed a chair for him at a table near his own , and helped him to mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are very good , " puffed the little man , quite out of breath , without looking up at his kind assistant . " Give me a little bean soup , if you please , Monsieur . I am very poor , and very hungry to-day . Must spend one picayune for one cheap dinner , or else must have one cheap coffin made for me at the expense of the corporation ! Hih , hih ! " Guly smiled at this odd speech , and rang the little bell for the waiter . As he did so , the dwarf suddenly wheeled his head round on his slender neck , and tipped his one eye curiously up at the face beside him . " ' T is you , Monsieur . Be gor , I thought it was one waiter . Hih , hih ! I am very hungry , Monsieur . " " Here is the waiter . What will you have , my friend ? " " One cheap dinner -- bean soup -- I am so very poor . Ah , Monsieur , ' t is hard to be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the old man 's frugal repast , and then returned to his own table to finish his dinner . The dwarf seemed to dispatch his meal with a fine relish , though interrupting himself in the process of eating , every few minutes , by twisting his crooked body half-way round , and turning his one eye up at Guly , as if to make sure he was there . The singular appearance of the dwarf , and the ready and gentle assistance rendered him by Guly , had attracted considerable attention , from those who yet lingered over their viands ; and when Guly took his seat , a young exquisite , who occupied a table just at his left , and who had been obliged to use two of his fingers to part his glossy moustache , while he passed in his food with his other hand , now turned round , and regarded him with an impertinent stare . " I say , Mistar , is that gentleman with crutches yondaw , a brothaw of yours ? " " By the laws of humanity he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find there 's no closaw tie , so I can express my opinion of him . He is a scamp , sah ! " " Indeed ! why so ? " " Because he is , sah ! " " You know him ? " " Perfectly well ! " " And he is a scamp ? " " If he 's no relation of yours , yes , sah . " " Does he tipple ? " " Not zat I know , sah ! " " Steal ? " " No , sah ! " " Meddle with other people 's affairs ? " " Yes , sah ! zat is , every day he puts his disgwusting digits on my spotless cassimeres , and asks for money ! " " You of course grant his request ? " " Not I , sah ! I feel always like touching the twip of me pwatent leather gaitaw just beneath the lowermost extreme of his spinal column , and elevating his dangling supporters a few feet in the air , before pwopelling him into the nearest guttaw . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vewy true , sah ! " " Yes , sah , especially when you know your stwaps are too tight to admit of any such use of your unmentionable members , " squeaked the dwarf , mockingly , who had sat unmoved within hearing distance of the whole conversation . A roar of laughter followed this speech , through which the dandy sat frowning darkly . When it ceased , he sprang near the dwarf , shouting : " You mean to insult me , do you , eh ? " " Hope you would n't notice such a scamp as me , sah ! " squeaked the dwarf in answer . " I will pwummel your cwooked legs , sah ! " " Wipe that off of your own , sah , first , " cried the other , dexterously turning a fresh plate of bean soup over the dandy 's " spwotless cassimeres . " Another roar of laughter followed this act , amid which the exquisite made his exit with his pocket hankerchief spread over his lap , swearing he would " go stwaight and sue for dwamages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dem beggar , and he would have revenge for his ruined trousers , be gar ! " Guly , after assisting his helpless friend to his crutches and a firm standing , was about to leave ; but the dwarf detained him by twitching the skirt of his coat , then exclaimed : " Hih , hih ! monsieur , I lost my bean soup but I saved my head , hih ! hih ! bean , soup 's good , but ' t was spilt in a glorious cause ; paid for monsieur ? " This last question was put in such a comic manner , with that one eye tipped up towards him , that Guly could not repress a smile ; but he cordially satisfied him on that point , feeling still able , in spite of his diminished salary , to pay for a beggar 's dinner , which is more than many , with their well filled purses , can make themselves afford to do . Freeing himself from the companionship of his singular friend , Guly hurried away to the store ; with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself one word , which fell upon his thoughts in the midst of the crowd and din through which he hastened , like the tinkling music of a waterfall in the midst of a broad desert , " Blanche ! Blanche ! " CHAPTER XXIII . Pure thoughts are angel visitants ! be such The frequent inmates of thy guileless breast ; They hallow all things by their sacred touch , And ope the portals of the land of rest . At eight o'clock precisely , Wilkins stepped down from his desk , gave orders to have the store closed , and told Guly he would be ready in one moment . The clerks , most of them , dropped the curtain of linen over the goods , and went out , not sleeping in the store and having no pass key . While Jeff was putting up the shutters , Guly went to Arthur and told him he was going out to see one of Wilkins ' friends a little while , but would be back soon , and begged him to go to bed and try to sleep that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur said , he had no doubt but he needed rest and would try to gain it ; and shaking hands they parted . Wilkins seemed waiting for the two or three clerks who yet remained , to go away before he left , but as he stood drawing on his gloves , Quirk came up and whispered something in his ear which Guly did not hear , but to which Wilkins answered aloud , saying : " I ca n't leave the key with you , but I 'll lock you in . " " And how long will you be gone ? " " Only an hour or two . " " All right , then . " Wilkins and Guly went out and locked the door , leaving the young men in there . They walked on , through the busy streets thronged with pleasure seekers , some on foot , some riding , all gaily dressed and full apparently of bright anticipations and buoyant life . Sometimes a lamp gleam would fall through the plate-glass windows of some princely structure , where light forms of beauty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mazy dance or listening to music 's enrapturing strain . As Guly walked on , noting the panorama of life which passed by him , he fell into a fit of musing from which he was unable to rouse himself , until they turned into another street , and Wilkins remarked quietly that it was the one in which Blanche lived . Then his whole attention was awakened , and there was no more musing , no more lack of conversation till they paused to rap at the door of the little house where Blanche lived . She opened it herself , and held out a hand to each of the new comers . " I am so happy to see you , " said she earnestly , as she permitted them to enter . " Guly , this is grandpapa , you will soon be acquainted with him , for we have been talking about you all day , and I have been describing you to him , so that he might know how you looked , and could know just how you would always act when I was giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The old gentleman was very venerable in appearance , and sat in a large stuffed chair with his grey locks floating over his shoulders , and his hands clasped upon a staff he held before him . His sightless orbs were turned in the direction whence came his good child 's voice , and when she mentioned Guly 's name he held out one trembling hand , and expressed , in a feeble , faltering tone , his pleasure at " seeing " them . Guly took the extended hand , shook it cordially , and sat down near the old gentleman and entered into a brisk conversation with him , leaving Blanche to be entertained by , and to entertain , Wilkins . " She called you Guly , this child of mine , " said the old man , suddenly breaking a slight pause which had occured in the conversation . " Blanche , my love , when will you ever learn to be polite ? " " Dear grandpapa , " returned Blanche , approaching him and stroking down his snow-white locks with her soft hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too thoughtless and informal , grandpapa . " " Thoughtless and informal then , my dear ; but I could wish you not to address young gentlemen by their given names . " " Well , grandpapa , I always say ' Mr. ' to Monsieur Wilkins , because he is twice as tall as I , and looks always as if he expected to be mistered ; but , grandpapa , just feel of Guly -- he is nothing but a boy , only a little taller and a little older than I. Do let us be Blanche and Guly to each other . " There was no withstanding the simple and artless manner with which these words were spoken , and Blanche hung fondly over her grandfather 's chair . The old man smiled as he listened to her , and , turning to the side where Guly sat , he said , in an apologetic manner : " Blanche 's reasoning springs from her heart ; she studies no etiquette save that which nature teaches . " " Which will carry such a spirit as hers through the world more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair also to the side of his blind friend . " Still , " said Guly , blushing as he spoke , " it may make her heart so rare a gem that too many will covet it . " A shade of anxiety crossed the blind man 's features as he heard the words , and he turned his dim eyes toward Guly as if he would give worlds to read the expression of face with which the sentence had been spoken . " Lately , " said he , leaning forward more heavily on his staff , " I have such thoughts myself . I am a weak , powerless old man , already bending over the grave into which I must so soon drop . When I think of this poor , dear child , left unprotected and alone in this great city , I am very unhappy , very miserable . " Guly saw a tear sparkle , and trickle down through the wrinkles of that aged face , and his own heart yearned sorrowfully . " Blanche will never be without friends , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack for one while I live . " " Or I , " exclaimed Guly , earnestly . The old man shook his head , and smiled sadly . " Two young men , however worthy and noble they may be , are not exactly the ones to offer their protection to an orphaned and beautiful girl . Such things I do n't doubt may be done uprightly and honestly ; but the world , the suspicious world , is ever ready to cast the blight of shame and slander on such things . " Blanche suddenly left her grandfather 's chair and hurried away to a distant corner of the room , from whence she brought a little stand containing a work-basket and the lamp . She placed it just in front of her grandpapa 's chair , and between Guly and Wilkins . With a smile she seated herself at it , and began to embroider a strip of insertion ; nimbly plying her needle among the slender vines and tendrils she was working . " Are you there , darling ? " said the old man , stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , grandpapa , right here in my old place . " He withdrew his hand with an air of pleased satisfaction , and resumed the subject he had just dropped . " Blanche needs a mother -- some female friend to guard and protect her , when -- when her old grandfather shall be gone . I am afraid I shall drop off suddenly one of these days ; I have sudden turns of illness which are very severe . I was quite sick last night -- ah , she told me of your kindness to her , Mr. Wilkins ; God be praised -- and I could not help feeling then that my thoughts turned more upon my poor desolate child here , than on that other world to which I might be hastening . " Blanche dropped her head lower and lower over her work , till her short glossy ringlets shaded her soft brown eyes . " This world , " continued he , with that love of pursuing the prominent subject of thought so common with aged persons , " has , of course , lost its fascination for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending from the summit of life 's mount , and must soon drop from its base into that vast eternity of which we know so little . Poor Blanche ! I am of course a trouble , so helpless and blind , but she will miss me when she 's left alone . Poor child , poor child ! " Blanche lifted up her head quickly , and showed her cheeks wet with streaming tears . She rose from her seat , took the staff from the old man 's hands , and threw herself sobbing aloud upon his bosom . He folded his aged arms around her and drew her to his heart , while he bent his head , and his white hair , so silvery , floated forward and mingled with the raven blackness of hers . Thus they sat , a touching picture of youth and hoary age , of life 's spring-time and the calm tranquillity of its withered autumn . " Oh , grandpapa ! " exclaimed Blanche at last , lifting up her face and looking tearfully into those dim eyes as though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never talk any more about dying and leaving me here alone , unless you wish to break poor Blanche 's heart . You are all that God has left me on this earth to love , and if He takes you , I want to go too . And you said you were a trouble ! Do n't ever , ever say that again , dear grandfather , if you love me dearly , as I know you do . " " But I wish to prepare you , darling , for the change that must surely come . " " Do n't say so . You never could prepare me for such a dreadful thing , and please do n't try to . " The old man drew a long shivering sigh , and leaned back in his chair . Blanche sat up , smoothed his thin locks , kissed his brow , and soothed him once more into a placid calm . She slid from his arms , then placed the staff in his hands , and he bent forward on it as if already forgetful of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this simple occurrence , and the former had looked on , with difficulty keeping the answering drops from his large blue eyes . There had been something so natural in it all , yet so affecting and heart-touching . There had been no attempt to check the heart 's first impulse , no struggle of affected prudery , but the free gushing forth of her warm affection , forgetful of everything save the strong love for her blind grandfather . " Now , Guly , " said Blanche , playfully , breaking the sad pause which had followed the recent excitement , " I am anxious to finish this piece of work this evening , and you must thread my needle for me . That will help me . " Guly expressed his willingness to obey , and drew his chair closer to the little table for the purpose , as he said , of receiving instructions . Blanche gave them , and he sat watching her taper fingers , and waiting impatiently to see the thread used up that he might proffer another . The old man talked pleasantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them all in a general maner , yet watched , with a pleased expression of countenance , Blanche and Guly as they sat side by side at the little table , the blue eyes looking into the brown , and the locks of gold lending a tinge of additional brightness to the curls of jetty black . They rose to leave at ten o'clock , and the old man took Guly 's hand , expressing a hope that he would repeat his visit ; the boy uttered what his heart at the moment felt , that it was the pleasantest evening of his life , and his memory of it would not fail to induce him soon to seek a like enjoyment . Guly walked home like one in a dream . A seed had fallen on his heart 's rich soil , to spring up in time into fragrant bloom . In the holiest niche of his heart a new lamp was lighted , and it burned before the image of a Virgin ! CHAPTER XXIV . " Never more Shall hope 's bright chain be gathered from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strong and unsullied by corroding dust . " When they reached the store door , Wilkins rapped before entering , and Guly , remembering that Quirk was within , and not wishing to meet that young gentleman , told Wilkins he would go to his own room by the alley-way . He had the pass-key for the small door ; so they shook hands and parted , just as the front door was being opened . In a few moments Guly stood in the large old room , which was the only spot he could look upon as home . All that surrounded him was darkness and gloom ; for he had no lamp , and the night-light of heaven never entered there . But Guly was happy , and the bare floor had lost its hardness to him as he knelt to pour out the fervent prayer of gratitude gushing from his heart . He had forgotten to listen for his brother 's breathing , from the lowly bed in the corner ; the throbbing of his own glad heart was all he heard , and for once in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself upon his pillow , he became conscious that he was alone ; there was no gentle hand , half-roused from slumber , to creep about him with a brother 's love , and there was no half-escaped sigh or murmured word of half-awakened welcome . Arthur 's pillow was cold , his place deserted . As soon as he became conscious of this fact , the glow of happiness and delight went out in his heart , like a suddenly smothered lamp . He had expected Arthur would return as soon as he left him , but he had not done so , and Guly grew restless and anxious in wondering where he could have gone , and in what way he might be occupied . Never in all the hurry and excitement in which he had been thrown , never in all the trouble and apprehension which had so early burdened his young heart , had Guly forgotten his mother 's parting injunctions , her tears , her sorrow , or her counsel . Their memory had burned in his bosom with a steady beacon blaze , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancients their sacred fires . Now , as he lay pondering on his brother 's danger , he felt that he could not sleep happily , conscious of a duty unperformed , and he determined to rise and go in search of him . As he crossed the floor to find his clothes , he struck his foot against some light object , which went half way across the room with the strong and sudden impetus he had given it . He remembered that the lamp they had used the night before was left upon the floor beside the bed , and had probably not been removed . Glad to gain a light , he groped about until he found it , struck a match , and the lamp 's feeble blaze illuminated some portion of the surrounding gloom . He was partially dressed when he paused to listen , sure that he heard the murmur of excited voices coming from the store below . He threw a white flannel dressing gown about him with facings of pale blue silk , and cord and tassel of the same delicate hue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scarce knowing what he did , the boy took the lamp in one hand and his Bible in the other , and passed forth from the room ; the door , covered with its gay advertisements , swinging solemnly , shut behind him , as if it partook of the anxious sorrow of that youthful breast . With firm step Guly went down the winding stairs . He descended slowly , and the voices he heard grew more distinct with every step . As he gained the last turn in the staircase , he stood in view of the whole main part of the store , and stopped , looking at the scene before him in sad astonishment . Between the counters , about half way through the store , was a small deal table , containing a lamp , four hands of cards just dealt , and several wine glasses partially emptied of their contents . On one of the counters stood a number of bottles ; some empty , some half filled , and one as yet unopened . Arthur was seated at the head of the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face flushed and excited . Quirk was opposite him , and two other clerks made up the party . Wilkins was standing behind Arthur , attempting with earnest tone and warm entreaties to draw him away ; but with every sentence Arthur answered him insolently , and rudely shook the pleading hand from his shoulder . " Your conduct shall be reported , sir , to-morrow , " at last said Wilkins , hoping to move Arthur by his pride . " Report it then if you choose ; do n't you see I 'm trying to win enough to pay that d --  -- d debt of mine ? " " How much have you won already ? " " One hundred and eleven dollars . " " One hundred and eleven dollars ! well , boys , you must be staking your salaries to-night , I should think ; but , come , Arthur , if you have won that much , stop now ; for you wo n't win much longer , and if you 'll give up this kind of business , I 'll make up the rest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't bear to see a young man of your abilities , and one who has a mother with a heart to break , beginning this practice . It 's awful ! " At any other moment an appeal of this kind might have touched Arthur 's heart ; but he had drained his wine cup several times , and the exciting draughts had already exerted their powerful influence over his young frame to a degree which rendered him deaf to everything beyond the prospect of regaining that sum which he had so unluckily , as he declared , lost . " You are altogether too good , Mr. Wilkins , but I do n't need any assistance when I am prospering as I now am . " " That 's right , Pratt ! " exclaimed Quirk , with an encouraging wink ; " pick up your cards , and show ' em you ai n't to be nosed around by anybody , and that you did n't come so many hundred miles from home tied fast by your mammy 's long apron-string . " " Had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you asked me for the key , you would never have got it I assure you , " said Wilkins , coldly . " Is n't it enough for you to be bad and unprincipled , without dragging those who might do better , if let alone , with you into the pit ? " " ' Taint my fault if he ca n't resist temptation , " replied the other , doggedly . " Come , Pratt , it 's your play . " " Arthur , do n't throw another card ! " exclaimed Wilkins , at the same time arresting the uplifted hand . Arthur struggled to release it , but Wilkins held it firmly , and drew him back from the table as he sat in his chair , and held him fixedly there in his grasp . " Arthur , I treat you as I would a younger brother ; an eye experienced in such matters shows me the danger you are in ; stop now , in mercy to yourself and all who love you . " " Release me , Mr. Wilkins ; you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " " Yes ! " shouted Quirk , seizing an empty bottle with a dreadful imprecation , and levelling it at Wilkins ' head , " release him this minute if you do n't want this through your skull ! " At this instant one of the other clerks caught sight of Guly , who had stood where he stopped , as if spell-bound , through all this scene . " Look there ! " cried the young man , pointing toward the staircase , and dropping the cards he held . They all turned their heads and looked toward Guly , who seemed , standing there in his white robe , with the lamp elevated just in front of his forehead , not unlike some spiritual visitant bearing a star on his brow . The attention which had been called to him , seemed in a measure to rouse Guly , for he came on slowly down the stairs , but with his blue eyes open and fixed like one walking in his sleep . Not one of the startled group before him moved a muscle or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him like persons under the influence of magnetism . He approached the table , put his lamp upon it , and laid his Bible down beside it . He turned his eyes upon Arthur , and stood with his hands clasped , looking at him as Wilkins still held him drawn back from the table in his chair . Still no eye was turned , no lip moved , not a word was uttered . There was something to awe the stoutest soul in the almost unearthly expression of the boy 's face , as he gazed upon his brother with an unutterable hopelessness shining from his eyes . Never , in all his fears for Arthur 's erring steps , had Guly thought of this . Never had the idea of gambling crossed his mind ; and now , as he saw him engaged in it , his heart seemed to grow cold , and he stood looking at him as if he felt the future was but a wild abyss , into which he must inevitably fall , and near the brink of which he had too closely approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ambition for that brother fell on the instant from their throne , and , as they vanished , gave back but the one sad echo --  " Lost ! lost ! lost ! " Arthur had looked up , and met the light of those sad eyes but for an instant , then dropped his head , and sat , with changing cheek , nervously fingering the cards which , at Quirk 's suggestion , he had picked up from the table . The silence which had fallen upon the party was abruptly broken by Quirk , who suddenly bent forward and read the title of the book which Guly had laid upon their card-table . " H -- ll ! " he muttered between his short teeth ; " what the devil did you lay that right in the midst of our cards for ? that 's no place for it . Who ever heard of cards and Bible keeping company on the same board ? " " Had you never neglected the one , you would not now be engaged with the other , " returned Guly , speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an instant from Arthur to Quirk , but immediately reverting them . Arthur flung his cards upon the table , but without once lifting his eyes . He seemed to feel all that his brother looked , without meeting that full , sad gaze of hopeless sorrow . " Come , now , Arthur , " said Guly , at last , laying his small , girlish hand upon his brother 's brow ; " you are tired and excited . It is late , too -- come with me to our own room . " Arthur was ashamed to show any heed of his brother 's words before his present companions , and he drew his head away from the gentle touch of that kindly hand , and remarked that he would go when he chose -- not before ; that he was used to late hours , and he 'd run the risk of all deleterious effects . " That 's it -- I like your pluck ! " shouted Quirk , too excited by the wine he had drank to heed the presence of the head clerk . " Do n't let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a big Bible -- 'hanged if we will . " " You shall not play another round beneath this roof to-night , " said Wilkins , resolutely . " If you do not vacate this place within five minutes , I will turn every one of you out of doors by main force . " " I 'd like to see you try that game once , " replied Quirk , instantly , bending suddenly forward , as if to grasp the book upon the table . Before he could touch it , Guly had caught it in his own hands . " This was my mother 's Bible . Never shall a defiling finger touch its sacred pages . Oh ! Arthur , if there is any brotherly love left in your heart for me , go with me to-night . You well know there is no fear of reproof from me -- I could not give it , if I would . " Arthur rose resolutely , swept the gold into his pocket , and took his brother 's hand . " Zounds , Pratt ! you wo n't leave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Wilkins , firmly , lifting his foot and turning the table , with its contents , over upon the floor . " Ten thousand devils ! " shouted Quirk , madly ; and catching up the neck of a broken bottle , he hurled it fiercely at Wilkins , who was approaching him . It glanced -- turned aside by the head-clerk 's self-defending hand -- and struck Guly upon the temple . With a faint moan he sank bleeding to the floor , clasping his mother 's Bible to his breast . CHAPTER XXV . " Rather will Ellen Douglas dwell A votress in Maronan 's cell --  Rather through realms beyond the sea , Seeking the world 's cold charity , An outcast pilgrim will she rove --  Than wed the man she can not love . " Scott . " Who rang the bell , Minny ? " inquired Della one morning , as she sat looking over a richly-bound volume of engravings , a recent gift from her father . " General Delville , Miss . " " Has mamma gone into the drawing-room ? " " Not yet , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Minny , do you go to her , and tell her that Della says , please not go in this morning , she wishes to see General Delville alone . " " Oh , Miss Della , she would never consent to your seeing him alone in the world . I 'm certain she wo n't ; and there is scarcely any use of asking her . " " Do as I tell you , Minny dear . " Minny went out . Since the evening of the party , the General had been very assiduous in his attentions ; waiting upon Mrs. Delancey and her daughter to concerts , operas , theatres , and every other place which he believed would be interesting and entertaining to them . His bouquets for Miss Della were always selected with the greatest care and taste , and had the fair recipient been possessed of sufficient patience to study out their language , she would have found the General by no means ignorant of that delicate manner of expressing thoughts which lose their chief beauty by being spoken . Mrs. Delancey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the General to remain a moment alone together ; and she triumphantly declared , to her very intimate and confidential friends , that not a sentence of admiration or esteem had the General ever uttered , but what she had listened to , as well as Della ; and that she should , of course , as much expect to be present when he made his declaration , as to have Della herself there . Twice had Della summoned courage to declare , in the presence of both her parents , that if General Delville came with any idea of winning her love she wished his visits to cease ; for marry him she never would ; but both times had she met with such stormy reproofs from her father , and such loud appeals to her pride and dignity from her mother , that she had ceased to argue the matter , and by both parents her acceptance of his suit was considered a settled thing . A man with a title militaire , and , moreover , half a million at his command , was not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his years were many , when he had a fortune to long outlive him , and station , which any woman might be proud to gain ? Surely , Della would be worse than silly , to throw away such an opportunity . Mrs. Delancey was standing before the glass , arranging the folds of her elegant dress , with all the care of a Miss of eighteen , as Minny entered the room , and , standing at a respectful distance , delivered the message her young mistress had given her . To her surprise , Mrs. Delancey merely raised her eyebrows slightly , as she heard her out , then turned round , with a smile upon her lips , and said :  --  " Well , I suppose it would be better so . Matters have gone so far now , it is all as good as settled , and she , no doubt , is aware that he comes to-day to declare himself , and feels timid , poor thing , about giving her answer in the presence of a third person . It is but natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceded to . " Minny left the room with a smile , though it was concealed from Mrs. Delancey . She bounded like a fawn through the shadowy passages to Della 's apartment , and repeated her mother 's answer . " I told you so , Minny ! " " I never could have believed it , Miss ! " With a changing cheek , but firm , resolute step , Della descended to the drawing-room , and gracefully received her visitor , who looked no less surprised than pleased to see her enter alone . General Delville was a splendid-looking man ; and this , united with his wealth and station , could scarcely have failed to win to his heart any maiden whom he chose to address , less frank and upright than Della Delancey . His fine features were lighted up with a beaming smile of pleasure , as he took her hand and led her to a seat , nor did he resign that hand without a gentle pressure of the white and perfumed fingers . For an instant Della sat , with downcast eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same smile upon his lips , but no words . Suddenly Della lifted her eyes , and turned them full upon the face before her . " General Delville ? " " Della . " " Pardon me , sir , for what I am about to say to you , and which I would have said long ago had I only had the opportunity ; and -- and --  " Go on , Miss Della , " said the General , though he moved uneasily in his chair . " General Delville , I , of course , am not unaware of your intentions with regard to myself , or the object of your visits at papa 's house . I would not pain you for the world , sir ; I esteem you , I love you so very much ; but I want to tell you openly , as my heart dictates , that I have not for you the love that a wife should feel for her husband -- only the love that a child should feel for a dear father ; and if I married you , I could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her , looking all the astonishment he felt , but said not a word . Della went on , with flushed cheek and fluttering heart , but with voice calm and steady . " Indeed , sir , I feel for you all the earnest esteem , all the warm , enduring affection , which a knowledge of your character can not fail to inspire one with , especially one so very much younger than yourself as I. But as for that love which would make me truthfully perform the marriage vows , I do not experience it , and never can . I have never , since the first evening I met you , sir , intended in the least to encourage any particular attention on your part for myself . The encouragement , which I will admit has been by no means slight , you must acknowledge has been entirely on the part of my parents . " " And that is where a gentleman looks for encouragement , Miss Delancey . " " Most unfortunately , too true , sir ; but in this instance I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a heart beating always indifferently for you . I set the case before you as it is . I tell you the truth , which I have longed to do long since , but could not ; and now , knowing this , can you wish to make me your bride ? I am sure you can not . Still , if you persist , here is my hand , given in obedience to my parents . " The hand was taken , and held fondly against the stout heart beside her ; and for a moment neither spoke -- the old man looking thoughtfully upon the floor -- the young girl gazing anxiously into his expressive face . " Deep as is my disappointment , Miss Della , I can not but confess that you have acted nobly . You have even won my heart closer in the last half hour than ever before . You have done what I would never have expected you would do ; and , though I am the sufferer , I honor -- I admire you for it . True , I am an old man ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however much the husband I might have felt . I came to-day to lay my heart and fortune at your feet : a heart which , though old , would have been true to you , and loved you dearly . It is , of course , needless to tell you how great is my disappointment . I ask no sacrifice of you , however . May you always be happy ! God bless you ! " Della burst into tears . " General Delville , I knew I could not be mistaken in your noble nature . " " Pardon an old man 's curiosity , my child , " said he , dropping at once into the relationship Della had chosen for them ; " but may I ask if a younger suitor influences you in this matter ? " Della blushed very deeply , but answered , frankly , through her tears , in the affirmative . " You are sure you have chosen one worthy of such a heart as yours ? " " I think so , most truly . " " And his circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth and station he is undoubtedly beneath me ; but in nature , in heart , I am certain he is all I could wish . " " And , knowing this , how could your father sanction my suit ? " " He knew nothing of these circumstances , sir . I have , from necessity , kept it a secret from him . May I trust you to do the same ? " " You may , indeed . I would not sanction duplicity between father and child ; but neither would I have you sacrifice your happiness to a father 's pride . In early youth , had she , who won my first affections , been as true to me , through such a test , as you have been to him you love through this , I would , probably , have never occupied the position of an old and disappointed suitor before you here . " " I would gladly reveal all to my parents , but that I know and dread the consequences . And when they learn the course I have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less fierce . " " Fear nothing , Della ; from this hour I am your sincere and devoted champion , in all causes wherein I believe you to be right . The confidence you have placed in me shall never be betrayed . Your father I will gradually turn aside from the ideas he has cherished with regard to you and myself . It is all better , no doubt , as it is ; this , I must admit , however lonely my heart may throb in saying it . I had hoped to be happy in holding you to that heart , as one of its own rightful treasures . I will now strive to make myself happy in seeing her so I could not win . Whenever you want a friend , my child -- one faithful and sincere , and uninfluenced by selfish motives -- you will ever find one in the old man who has dared to love you , and whom you have this day rejected . " Della placed both hands in General Delville 's , and looked up earnestly and trustfully into his noble face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I may continue to be a welcome visitor here ? " " Always , always . " " Enough , Della . Farewell . " " Adieu , mon ami ! " The General 's tall figure passed into the lofty hall , and Della heard the door close behind him . She hurried to a window , and watched him as he descended the steps and entered his carriage , then , with a feeling of reverential affection for that proud spirit and noble heart which an hour before she had scarcely expected to feel , she passed out of the parlor on her way to her own room . Traces of tears were still upon her cheeks , and her whole face still bore evidence of recent agitation . As she was about to ascend the stairs , Mrs. Delancey 's maid met her , with the message that her mother desired an interview . " Say to my mother , that I beg to be excused for a few moments , but will be with her presently , " said Della , proceeding up the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-taking Della on the stairs , said :  --  " Mistress says you must come instantly , Miss ; that she wishes to see you before you go to your room . " Dispelling , as far as possible , all traces of agitation , Della returned to her mother 's apartment . The moment Mrs. Delancey 's eyes fell upon her child 's features , she held out her hand , with a bland smile , exclaiming :  --  " Ah , Dort , I see how it is , dear ; could n't get through with a proposal without crying a little , eh ? Rather undignified , I must say , but perfectly natural for unexperienced girls , I suppose . Allow me to congratulate you . " Della pressed the hand her mother gave , and made an effort to speak ; but choked , faltered , and failed entirely , bursting into a violent fit of weeping instead . " Really , my child , you surprise -- you shock me ; if you ca n't behave any better now , what will you ever do at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At your age I had received seven offers , and never shed a tear ! " " Perhaps you did n't accept them , Madam ; and so , sever the ties which bound you to father and mother , and home , " said Minnie , who had entered just in time to hear Mrs. Delancey 's last remark . " That 's true enough , " returned the lady , as if she had not thought of the fact before . " Della , you can go to your room till you are more composed ; I will tell your father what has happened , so your timidity will be spared that . " " Oh , do n't tell him anything , mamma ; do n't tell him this , " sobbed Della . " Nonsense , Dort ; worse and worse . Go to your room , and do n't make your appearance again until you can come with a face more composed , and features not all swollen and distorted by weeping . " Della obeyed , and her mother saw her no more that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , as the privacy of her own apartment was gained , and she threw herself , still sobbing , on the quadroon 's bosom ; " did n't you know before I went down that I never would accept him , that I never could marry him , never ? " " Yes , Miss , I knew it . " " Yet you implied to mamma , Minn , that you believed I had accepted him , and you know she thinks I tell you everything . Oh , Minny , you mus n't tell falsehoods for my sake ! " " I told no falsehood , Miss ; I only asked your mamma a simple question , that you might get free , as I knew you wished to be . " " But I know she thought you meant that . " " It is wrong for people , to jump so hastily at conclusions . " " But , Minny , you know you intended mamma should jump at that . " " Well , Miss Della , do n't chide me now about it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very glad , are you not ? " " Of course , if it was n't falsehood . " " It certainly was not , Miss Della ; now dry your eyes , and I will show you something . " " A letter , Minn , from -- from him ? " Minny smiled , and nodded her head . " Bathe my eyes , then , and I wo n't shed another tear . " Minny obeyed ; and Della , with trembling fingers , tore open the letter , and perused it . " Is it good , Miss ? " " Sweet Minny , read it yourself . " The quadroon took it , and , as she stood behind her mistress , the tremor which seized her frame , when she looked upon that handwriting , was unseen and unthought of by any but herself . " Delightful , Miss Della . " " Yes ; now , Minny , put it with the rest . " " You wo n't have it beneath your pillow then , for the first night ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of General Delville , to-night , if I can -- the best and noblest , and kindest man , excepting somebody you know , that ever I knew . " " Indeed , Miss ! I 'm so glad he proved so . " " Oh , yes , Minn , I can never tell you how noble and good he is ; but , Minn , these letters -- Bernard 's letters -- you are very sure you kept them all safe , perfectly secure ? " " As the apple of my eye , Miss . " " I have felt anxious about them sometimes of late , and have thought of offering to take care of them myself ; but there 's Madam Gerot in these rooms every week ; I could hide nothing from her lynx eyes . I think I might do without a governess now -- do n't you , after having had a proposal from a General ? " " Your mamma thinks she perfects your manners , Miss . " " All nonsense ! I never have any grace or manner when she is in sight . Minny , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am right here with you , than I would be with all the French dancing-masters and ornamental governesses in the world . " " Bless your dear heart ! " " Thank you , Minn ; nobody ever blessed me save you and General Delville ; he blessed me to-day in such a beautiful way , it went straight to my heart . Oh , if it is so sweet to be blessed by the rich , what must it be , Minny , to be blessed by the poor ? " Minny was silent . " If ever I get out of fashionable society , Minn , I shall never court it again . It is a heartless sphere ! I would sooner be a stone than human , with no humanity beyond flesh and blood , and that cast in a fashionable mould . " " Your mamma is a fashionable woman , Miss , and seems very happy . " " It is only seeming , Minn . She has more misery over an ill-fitting dress , an unshapely shoe , or an awkward glove , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born out of my sphere , I know I was ; I ought to have been poor . " " You may be , one of these days , Miss . " " How so , Minn ? What do you mean ? " " Disinherited . " " Oh , no ! that will never be , I am certain . " " But you 'd not be unhappy if it should happen ? " " Only for Bernard . " " I am very happy to hear this . " " Dear Minnie , you have so many foolish fears ! " " It is better to think of these things . " " True enough . Good night , Minn ! " " Good night . You are going to sleep early , Miss ? " " So as to have bright eyes in the morning , dear . " Lonely , without her mistress , Minnie also prepared for sleep ; and that night Bernard 's letter was placed beneath her pillow , and her dreams were of him . Della , as she had hoped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble face before her , wearing that radiant expression which had illuminated it when he bade God bless her . Never afterwards , in all her waking hours , whether in joy or gloom , light or darkness , did Della cease to remember him as she dreamed of him there with the halo of that blessing circling him and her . Lightly as he had seemed to give her up , it had cost the General a more severe struggle than Della had imagined . He had truly loved her , old as he was , and had not loved lightly ; but he could not take to his heart the heartless wife which she had frankly admitted she must be if he married her ; and Della had , unwittingly , skillfully touched a tender chord , when she made the appeal to his feelings which she did . He had felt the force of her reasoning , and had been delighted with her frankness and her confidence ; though it pained him to relinquish her , he was too much a soldier to display his wounds ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was never more her lover than when he that afternoon called her his child and bade her adieu . CHAPTER XXVI . Many and sharp the numerous ills Inwoven with our frame ! More pointed still we make ourselves Regret , remorse , and shame . And man , whose heaven-erected face The smiles of love adorn , Man 's inhumanity to man Makes countless thousands mourn . Burns . " Wretch ! " cried Wilkins , striking at Quirk with his brawny fist , as he rose from the prostrate form of Guly --  " Wretch , you have killed him ! " and , seizing the offender by the collar , with the united force of foot and hand he hurled him into the street . The two other young men , who had drunk less freely of the wine , and were less excited , passed out also , expressing to Wilkins their regret at the unfortunate occurrence . Locking and barring the door , the head clerk hurried back to Guly 's side , and lifted him gently in his arms . With the tender care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoothed the golden curls from the wounded temple , as he laid him softly on the pillow . The old gush of love had swept back to Arthur 's heart when he saw his brother fall at his side , and with throbbing pulse he implored Wilkins to fly for a physician leaving him to watch by Guly 's pillow . Wilkins acceded to his request , and , going out by the alley door , locked it after him , and dashed down the street in search of his own physician . The sound of his heavy footsteps , as they fell upon the pavement , rang far and near through the silent streets ; and , as he sped on , their echo fell upon his ear fearfully , and sent a thrill of something like terror through his strong frame . He even slackened his pace , and strove to lighten his tread that the desolate sound might not thus sweep constantly after him ; but his anxiety with regard to Guly was so intense that he found it impossible to go at a slower gait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest heaving with the unwonted exertion , and the big drops of perspiration standing out like rain-drops on his brow . Suddenly there came a low hum of voices to his ear , not unlike the murmur of a distant sea . Louder and louder , it came upon the midnight air , till , answering to the echo of his flying steps , came the distant cry of " Murder ! stop him ! stop him ! Murder ! " And the prolonged , terrific cry sent a panic through every limb , as for an instant the head clerk paused to listen . As by instinct , he comprehended all . He felt as fully aware as though he had been plainly told so , that the echo of his hurried pace had been caught by the quick ear of the night guardians , and he was pursued as a midnight assassin . Thinking that the safest course would be to hurry straight to the physician 's office , where he was well known and where the statement he might make would be corroborated , he again struck into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elude the pursuers , whose voices every moment fell more clearly on his ear . He felt in his great heart all the terrible consequences which might accrue to Guly if he should be captured , for there would necessarily be more or less delay in his again obtaining freedom . But , swiftly as he fled , he felt he was no match for the swift-footed pursuers behind him , and the cry of murder , and the sound of clubs upon the banquette , and the sharp , quick watchman 's rattle , fell on his ear more startlingly clear every moment . Suddenly he thought to dart down the first dark street , and at the next block double on his pursuers . But his design had been anticipated , and as he dashed at a headlong pace round the corner , he found himself face to face with a posse of policemen , and a crowd of half-dressed coffee-house loafers , who are always abroad upon the first hint of an excitement . With a shout of triumph , Wilkins ' arms were pinioned at his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hurried away to the guard-house . He begged to be allowed to stop at Doctor C. 's office , and deliver him the message he had brought , assuring them that , would they but give him a few minutes ' time , he could fully assure them of his innocence ; but all in vain . An atrocious murder had been committed somewhere up town , and they had been chasing all night , they said , to find the assassin , who had escaped . They declared themselves " fagged out , " and swore they must " chuck " somebody , and if he was n't the right man he could prove it in the morning , and that was all they had to say ; and , in bitterness of heart and anxiety of mind , Wilkins heard the heavy door shut with a short clang , and knew he was a prisoner ! Wearily the night sped away ; and , tortured with anxiety for the pale young being whom he had left senseless on his pillow , Wilkins walked the narrow precincts of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this man 's strange nature , there were some pure and sparkling gems of good , which cast a radiance , bright and purifying , over the dark traits of his character . This love for Guly was one of these . Springing up , as it did , from among the rank weeds of sin and recklessness in his breast , it proved that he could appreciate the lovely , and knew how to cherish it . Then , his guardian care of Blanche , the brodereuse -- where a thousand men would have but thought of evil , his sole care was to ward it from her . And now , as he walked back and forth across the heavily spiked floor , another ray of glorious and intense light shot from his great heart heavenward . It was a prayer ! breathed there in the midst of the perplexities and troubles which surrounded him , earnestly , hopefully breathed for Guly ; and if ever a prayer ascended to the " Great White Throne , " accepted for its faith and sincerity , that one did , sent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , and he was taken before the Recorder , and though it required but little trouble to prove his innocence , it took time , and it was with a breast lacerated by a thousand fears that he found himself again at liberty , and turned his steps towards the store . As he had left the front door key inside , Jeff had as usual been able to open the store and put things in order . The clerks were many of them in their places , but he scarcely noticed any one ; passing up between them , with long and rapid strides , he struck his foot against the door of his room , and the next instant stood at Guly 's side . He lay as he had left him , on the bed , still wrapped in his white robe , pale and very beautiful . Wilkins bent breathlessly over him , and the blue eyes at that moment opened , and smiled a welcome upon him . Clasping his hands together with an upward look of thankfulness , Wilkins fell upon his knees beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he would fain conceal the too vivid pleasure expressed in his features . A hand was laid upon his shoulder . He started , looked up , and met the gaze of Arthur . " Ah , yes , Arthur , I had forgotten you . How did you manage ? What could you do ? " " Finding you did not return , I suspected something had occurred , and dispatched Jeff after the nearest physician . He pronounced Guly 's wound not dangerous , but recommended quiet for a day or so . You see he is doing nicely ; he was n't hurt much after all . As Quirk says , he is such a weakly affair , that it takes nothing at all to knock the senses out of him . " " Then you have had a conference with Quirk , this morning , have you ? " returned Wilkins , coldly . " Well , your very humane judgment is worthy of both of you ; you can now go to your counter , sir , if you like , or seek rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur took his place in the store . Aided by Quirk 's slurs and inuendoes , as soon as he saw Guly recovering he had experienced another revulsion of feeling , and really cherished a sentiment of anger , when he remembered that he had allowed himself to be so " bullied , " as Quirk expressed it , by a stripling so weak and " curdy " as Gulian . He convinced Arthur , with his reckless reasoning , that in gambling for a little " innocent amusement , " there in the store , they were but doing what all young men with any idea of fashionable pleasure did , and that Wilkins had no right to exert over them the authority which he did . That , as for Guly 's wound , it was Wilkins ' fault he had received it , and , altogether , they ought to have fought it out before yielding so easily . But though he had succeeded in leading Arthur to think that Guly was meddlesome and intrusive , he could not succeed in rousing his ire towards Wilkins ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that Wilkins was his truest friend . Still , there was a restless and undefined uneasiness in his breast , a fancy that his dignity had been insulted , yet so vague was the impression left on his mind by the wily Quirk , that he could scarcely decide from whom he had suffered it , Wilkins or Guly ; but with that unnatural perversity which sometimes enthrals the human heart , he was more than half inclined to think it was his brother , and cherished an indignant feeling against him , which even the memory of his pallid face as he lay before him the night before , with the blood slowly oozing from his wounded temple down the blue-veined cheek , could not dissipate ; and whenever , during that long day , he went into Wilkins ' darkened room to look upon the young form lying there , it was not in sorrow and love , but silence and coldness . When Mr. Delancey came to the store that day , which was at an hour later than usual , Wilkins joined him at his high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The merchant had shown many signs of impatience during its pending , and no slight evidences of anger . As Wilkins turned away , Mr. Delancey sat looking down through the store for some time , leaning stiffly back in his chair meanwhile . The moment he saw Quirk disengaged , he called his name in his sharp , peculiar tone of voice , at the same time beckoning to him with his forefinger . Quirk flung down the piece of goods he was about folding , and a scarce perceptible pallor spread over his coarse cheeks , as , darting a malicious glance at Wilkins , he approached the high desk . " So , sir , you took the liberty to gamble in my store last night , eh ? " " I was n't the only one . " " Hold your tongue , sir . You dare not tell me you did n't propose it ? " " Mallory , Adams and Arthur Pratt joined me . " " You knew the store 's rules better than they . Do you know that I think any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is full of thieves . " " The more need , then , of making an example for their benefit . Take your place , sir ; you have a fortnight 's warning to find another situation , and quit . " With cheeks glowing with anger and fierce resentment , Quirk went back to his place , knowing there was no use in arguing the matter with such a man as Delancey ; who had , in fact , acted entirely upon Wilkins ' suggestion ; whereas the others would no doubt have shared the same fate , had he acted upon his own . The head clerk had laid the whole matter before him exactly as it was , quietly throwing in his own advice and ideas on the subject , and there were reasons why Mr. Delancey did n't choose to differ very materially from what his head clerk said . After he had dismissed Quirk , the merchant every now and then turned his eye upon Wilkins ' room door , as if he fain would enter there could he possibly do so without being seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning missed the bright young brow and gentle eyes , which in all his moods never had failed to show him the respect of an obeisance and a greeting regularly upon his entrance . There was an uprightness and nobleness too , characterizing Guly 's every deed which the merchant had not failed to observe , and which had created a respect and esteem for the boy even in that obdurate heart . Mr. Delancey stepped down from his high desk , and began to traverse the space between it and the long windows . But every turn brought him nearer and nearer to the little bed-room door , and at last , certain that he was unobserved , he laid his hand upon the knob and slipped in . If ever the merchant displayed his awkwardness , it was in a sick room ; the knowledge of which fact , perhaps , made him so rare a frequenter of such places . As he stopped at Guly 's bedside , with his long fingers pressed down among the pillows , the boy opened his eyes , and looked up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Arthur . He was greatly surprised at seeing his employer , but immediately extended his hand and said : " Is it possible ' t is you , Mr. Delancey ? This is an unexpected pleasure . " Mr. Delancey took the proffered hand in his , held it loosely for a moment in his bony fingers , as if unaccustomed to holding friendly hands , then let it drop back again upon the bed-clothes . " Why is my presence so unexpected ? Do n't you suppose I ever look in on sick clerks ? " " I certainly hope so , sir ; I scarcely expected it in my case ; but I am very happy to be disappointed -- sit down sir ? " The merchant seated himself , and said : " So you got in a row last night . " " In trouble , sir ; most unfortunately . I hope that it is the last case of the kind . " " Yes , bad to have your place empty -- want all my men at their posts . Get about as soon as you can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir , God willing . " " God willing ! Do you always put that in ? " said Mr. Delancey , half rising from his chair , then reseating himself . " Yes , sir , always . " The merchant sat for a moment , with his cold eye fixed on his earnest face . " Invariably you say that , eh ? " " Invariably , sir . " " Humph ! I do n't ! " returned the other , rising abruptly from the chair , and , without another word , he slipped out of the little door as cautiously as he had entered , and again took his seat at his desk . The day wore on with an occasional visit from Arthur , a frequent one from Wilkins , and numerous inquiries sent by all the clerks , who could not help but feel an interest in the young sufferer . By the increased darkness of the room , Guly knew the day must be most gone , and he lay looking upon the little table where one night he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night which he had remembered so distinctly and pondered on so much . As he lay musing upon that event , his attention was attracted by a singular noise outside his door , and the next moment it was thrown open , and to Guly 's utter astonishment the dwarf swung himself in upon his long crutches , with Wilkins , looking like a giant , walking smilingly behind him . " Here 's a friend that 's true to you , Guly ; he misses you , you see , as well as the rest of us . " " Hih ! hih ! Monsieur , " chuckled the little man , reaching up and catching hold of Guly 's fingers ; " I have seen you nowhere to-day ; I think you very sick or very dead . I get no picayune to-day , no bean soup . Hih ! hih ! Monsieur , I miss you very much . " " You are kind , to come and see me , my poor friend . It seems very natural to see your face . You are welcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing up with much difficulty into the chair Mr. Delancey had so recently left ; " me welcome , Monsieur ! Hih ! that 's mor'n has been said to me these many years -- hih ! poor deformed little devil that I am ! " Guly heard a sound , a strange sound , something between a schoolboy snivel and a sob , and looking up , to his amazement saw a bright tear rolling down his visitor 's wrinkled cheek , and his one eye , seeming to lie out farther on his face then ever , was glistening with more . " You have never told me your name , " said Guly , hoping to divert his attention . " No , ' cause I never thort you cared to know it , " returned the other , wiping his eye on the cuff of his coat . " The boys call me King Richard , because , as they say , he was stoop-shouldered like me , Monsieur . They dare n't exactly call me humped for fear of my crutches , hih ! hih ! You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose . " " You mus n't talk too much to Monsieur , " said Wilkins , kindly ; " he is too ill to hear much conversation -- hurts his head . " " Hih ! no , I wo n't hurt him . A picayune , Monsieur : I 've had no bean soup , to-day . Pauvre Richard ! " Wilkins dropped a piece of silver in the claw-like hand , and went back into the store . The dwarf sat rubbing the dime on his sleeve , brightening it , and looking curiously at it with his one eye , as if to assure himself it was good -- then disposed of it somewhere about his person . " Are you hungry , Richard ? " asked the boy , eyeing him pityingly . " Oui , Monsieur , hungry and poor and friendless . Oh , Lord ! but I 've got a dime to buy bread now , hih ! hih ! hih ! " " I am your friend , Richard ; never go hungry when you are destitute . I am not rich , but I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread , and you mus n't call yourself friendless ever again . " The dwarf hitched himself round on his chair , and fixed his great raw-looking eye inquisitively on the gentle face looking upon him . " Friend to me , Monsieur , such a horrid little ape as me ? Hih ! hih ! ca n't think that . " " Do n't call yourself such names , Richard . The hand that made me , made you ; and He has commanded us to love one another , " said the boy , sweetly . " And you can love me , you ? Hih ! no , no , no , I was n't born to be loved , only to be kicked round the world like a football while I live , and when I die to be kicked into a pauper 's grave . Hard lot ! deformed , friendless , wretched , poor . Nothing to love , no one to love me , hih ! wonder what I was born for . Monsieur , what hurt you ? " Guly smiled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly that he had been hurt with broken glass . " Hih ! that 's bad . I must get down and go away -- make you talk too much -- 'hurt your head . ' Always hurt people 's heads , I do -- that part where their eyes are . Adieu , Monsieur . " The dwarf , after some labor , reached the floor , and succeeded in tucking a crutch under either arm . " Hope you 'll get well , Monsieur . " " Be round to-morrow I hope , Richard ; thank you . " " Hope so . Adieu . " " Adieu . " He swung away , and reached the door , but hobbled back to the bed again , and raising his red , skinny fingers , took Guly 's hand in his . " You meant what you said , Monsieur , about loving one another ? " " Yes . Truly so , Richard . " " And I may think of you as loving even me ? " " As loving you , Richard . As loving you for one of the Great God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our love , and awaken the dormant sympathies of our nature . " " May that Great God , bless you , Monsieur . Hih ! hih ! Adieu . " Once more he gained the door , and this time it closed behind him , shutting him out . And Guly fell asleep , with the earnest blessing of the poor deformed one brightening his dreams , and the holy words , " Love ye one another , " ringing sweetly through his heart . CHAPTER XXVII . " Nor heaven nor earth hath been at peace To-night . " Shakspeare . The Friday night , which had been set aside by Clinton for his meeting with Arthur , arrived . It came in " clouds , and storm , and darkness , " with darting lightning and crashing thunder , and all the wild fierceness which ever characterizes a thunder-storm in that climate . Arthur had been nervous and ill at ease all day ; a fact which all noticed , but which was attributed to anxiety on Guly 's account , who , contrary to expectation , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store was closed , and all the clerks were out , save Quirk , Arthur , and Wilkins , who still lingered within , talking of Guly , and commenting on the unusual wildness of the storm . Through the day , Quirk had managed to slip a scrap of writing-paper into Arthur 's hand , which had been duly read , and destroyed , and both now waited an opportunity to act upon what it contained . Quirk quietly lighted a cigar , and , seating himself , turned good-naturedly to Wilkins , remarking :  --  " I suppose you know , old boy , that I got my discharge from these premises t' other day . " " Indeed ! " returned the head-clerk , coldly , striking a match to light a cigar for himself . " Yes , cleared out , within a fortnight , bag and baggage ; all on account of that deuced little spree we had here the other night . By-the-by , Mr. Wilkins , I believe you have had a finger in this pie . How could you treat a fellow so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , ' twas n't hardly fair , I vum . I did n't do more than the rest , but I suffer all alone . However , I do n't bear anybody any ill will , and hope when we part it will be on good terms . " " I hope so , I 'm sure . " " I 've a bottle of prime old Port left of the other night ; what say you to taking a drink this stormy time , to our future good friendship ? " " I 've no objections -- most certainly . " Quirk went to the other end of the store , and took a bottle and some glasses from under the counter . He filled three of the glasses , and handed one to each of his friends , and kept the other for himself . " Here 's oblivion to the past , and brightness for the future . " Wilkins smiled , nodded , and the glasses were drained to the bottom . At this moment Quirk caught sight of Jeff , who had just been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his great eyes fixed upon the group before him , with a mixture of wonder and sadness in his glance . " Ah , Jeff ! ought n't to forget you to-night . Have some ? " " Do n't care , massa . " Quirk filled another glass to the brim . " Now , Jeff , you must give us a toast , or you ca n't have the wine . " " Guy , massa , who ever heard of a nigga 's toastin ' white folks , " replied Jeff , showing his whole range of ivories . " Must give us something . " " Well , den , massa , if I must , I must . Here 's hopin ' you 'll never be less de brack man 's fren dan now you am . " The negro 's toast was drunk with a hearty good-will , Quirk only pausing , thoughtfully , to ask if he spoke in general terms of the colored race , or referred to himself singly ; to which Jeff merely said " Yes , " leaving the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Quirk buttoned his coat to the throat , and , taking an umbrella , shook hands with Arthur and Wilkins , and proceeded toward the door . " You might stay , and share Arthur 's bed to-night , " said Wilkins , calling after him . " It 's a dreadful storm to go out in , and he is alone , you know -- Guly being in my bed . " " Thank you , " returned the other , " not to-night . " " I wish you would , " joined in Arthur ; " that 's a gloomy old room to be alone in , in such a noisy night as this . " " Hope you ai n't afraid of spirits , " laughed Quirk . " I would really like to stay , but I have an engagement to meet a friend at the St. Louis bar-room to-night , and I ought to have been there half an hour ago . Good-night . " He opened the door , and passed out , while a gust of wind and rain swept in through the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking to Wilkins , " I believe I am nervous to-night ; I feel as fidgetty as an old woman ; yet I have seen the time when I could glory in such a storm as this , and climb to the summit of old Cro'nest , on the Hudson , in its midst . " " You have been dissipating a little of late , you know , " returned the other , patting his shoulder ; " that makes a difference . Then , you have , no doubt , been anxious about your brother , and that makes a difference . Perhaps Jeff had better take his bed to your room to-night , and lie there . He will be better than no company , with the lightning and thunder on such a spree about one 's ears . What say you ? " " But Jeff is needed here . " " No , he is n't . He only lies behind that door in the capacity of a big watch-dog , " returned the other , laughing , " to bark if he hears any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that since I 've been here . Jeff , take your mattress to Master Pratt 's room , and sleep there to-night . " Jeff obeyed , glad himself to be near somebody during this fierce battle of the elements ; and Arthur told him to go on up stairs with the light , and he would be with him presently . Leaving Wilkins smoking in the store , Arthur stole softly into Guly 's sick chamber . A night-lamp was burning on the table , casting its mellow light faintly through the apartment , and displaying the sufferer 's pale features , as he lay asleep , with his bright hair floating back upon his pillow . Arthur knelt by the bedside , and took one of his brother 's burning hands in his , and bowed his head upon it . He uttered no word , heaved no sigh , but knelt motionless and silent -- so silent that his heavy heart-throbs were audible . When he raised his head , tears were on his cheeks , and , as he bent to press his lips to Guly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow , and glittered there like gems . Dashing away these traces of what he deemed his weakness , Arthur passed out of the room , and shaking hands with Wilkins , as he bade him good-night , mounted the winding stairs , and entered his own chamber . " Massa Pratt , " said Jeff , turning on his mattress , as Arthur entered the room , " you do n't think as how your brudder 's gwine to die , do you ? " " Die ! Heavens , Jeff , no ! What put that in your head ? " " Do n't know , sah ! don ' know nuffin ' ' bout it . " Arthur slowly undressed , and placing his clothes near the bedside , lay down upon his pillow . " Jeff , do you ever expect to get to sleep in such a tumult as this ? " " Guy , massa , guess I does . Neber was so sleepy afore in all my life . ' Spect it 's dat wine dat makes it ; I do n't often git @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on de ebe of lebin de business . Yah ! yah ! " In a few minutes Jeff was asleep ; and his loud breathing was audible , even above the howling of the storm . Arthur lay still for half an hour , restless , and with ear strained to catch the faintest sound coming up from the store below . But all was still , and he rose up , and dressed himself , throwing over his other garments a cloak , which he wrapped closely about him , as if preparing to breast the weather . He laid his hand on the small door , leading down the steep staircase into the court , and was about to pass forth , when , with a sudden impulse , he dropped the cloak from his shoulders , and opened the door leading down to the store instead . Arthur could not go out upon his mysterious errand , without casting one more look upon his brother 's face . Perhaps he felt it might possibly give him strength to resist temptation , or might urge him to forego some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek his side , he obeyed it , and in a moment stood in the door of Wilkins ' chamber . The light of the night-lamp revealed the form of the head clerk lying stretched upon his bed , sound asleep , and breathing heavily ; one of his strong arms encircled Guly , and his broad breast pillowed the boy 's head . Arthur looked at them earnestly , fearless of their waking , for he had seen ( what none of the rest observed ) Quirk sprinkle into Wilkins ' wine , as also into Jeff 's , a few grains of a drug , intended to make their slumbers deep ; and Guly , he knew , slept an invalid 's sleep , heavy from weakness and exhaustion . After gazing at them for awhile , Arthur stepped to the table , and extinguished the lamp , then drew the door close after him , and groped his way back up stairs . Again he wrapped the cloak about him , drew his cap over his brows , and went down into the court . He paused once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turned his eyes back toward the spot he was leaving . The darkness was impenetrable , but he gazed earnestly back as if all were distinctly visible , then closed the door behind him , and went shudderingly forth into the tempest . He had crossed that threshold for the last time bearing in his breast a crimeless-soul , and he felt it instinctively . Gaining the street , he hurried on till he had reached the saloon where he had seen Quirk and Clinton the night after the lost bank deposit . He hastily inquired of Quibbles if either of his friends were there , and on being informed that Quirk had just come in , he desired to be shown to his presence , and found him in the same room they had occupied before , smoking and drinking there by himself . " Come at last , eh , Pratt ? All snug ? " " All asleep -- Jeff in my room , as you suggested . " " Good ! Now for Clint . " " But what was the use of all these preliminaries at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're a little springy as yet ; after to-night you 'll understand more about these things . Clinton will explain everything when we get there . Now , if you 're ready , come along . " They went out together , Arthur first swallowing several glasses of wine , for the purpose , as he said , of keeping his spirits up . The walk to Clinton 's house was a long one , and on such a fierce night as this , particularly disagreeable ; swollen gutters , slipping pavements , and deluged streets , rendering it next to impossible to keep one 's footing . Arriving , at last , at the door of a small but neat domicile , Quirk rapped , and they were admitted by a small black girl , who showed them into a pleasant little apartment , lighted cheerfully , prettily furnished , and tastefully arranged . A table stood in the centre of the apartment , and Clinton was sitting by it when they entered , reading to a young and pretty woman , who was busily engaged with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , with her foot . She rose gracefully as Clinton introduced her as his wife , and received his friends with ease and dignity . Arthur felt not a little astonished to find Clinton a husband and a father , and told him as much . He blushed slightly , and replied that every one knew these facts that knew him well , and laughingly advised Arthur if he wished to be happy to become one too . Mrs. Clinton then rose , and going to the sideboard , set out wine for the guests , and Arthur observed that it was served on a silver salver and in cut crystal -- articles scarcely corresponding with the small house , and very pretty , but plain furniture . " Is the back room lighted ? " said Clinton to his wife . " No , but it shall be , if you wish it . " " I do . My friends have a little business to transact with me . " Arthur noticed that when Clinton said this , his wife looked at him very penetratingly , as if she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright smile he gave her , and lighted the room . " Now , " said Clinton , when they were alone , " let 's at once to business . I had intended this night only for planning ; but we must plan and work both , to-night , for we may not have such another storm in a month . You 've good pluck , eh , Pratt ? " " Same as ever . " " Good . You got my note and fixed the wine , Quirk ? " " Just so . " " And you are sure you 're ready , Pratt , to help to carry out the plan I 've laid for you ? " " Ready for anything short of murder . " " All right , then , there 's no murder in the case , only a nice little game of lock-picking and so on . No backing out now , and beforehand we must all take this oath : that if any one of us is nabbed , and should by any chance suffer the penalty of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's fair , " said Quirk ; " all stand the same chance . " The oath was administered , and each one laid his hand upon the Holy Book , saying : " I swear , " " I swear , " " I swear . " " Now , " said Clinton , " what I propose is this : that we just walk into your boss 's store this night , and walk out of it with goods enough to make us rich men . We can do it easy as guns . " Arthur turned pale and remained silent . " What 's the matter , boy , " said Clinton , laughing , " you ai n't going to play chickenheart , are you ? " " No , " said Arthur , ashamed to confess his dislike to the plan , " but why ca n't you take some other store ? " " Because we hav n't the men drugged in any other store , and , in case of detection , we 're safer there than any where else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that case would be equal anywhere ? " " Oh , no . I 'm somewhat related to the proprietor of your store , and when he found ' t was me , he 'd hush the matter up -- and let it go , " said Clinton , quietly . " Related to Mr. Delancey ! Pray , how nearly ? " asked Arthur in astonishment . " Oh , quite near . But no matter about that now , maybe you 'll find it all out one of these days . Another reason for choosing that particular store is , we can get in with less trouble . Look there . " Clinton , as he spoke , flung down upon the table a heavy brass key , which , to his amazement , Arthur saw was the one he had lost on his Carrollton ride . " How in the world came you by this ? " Clinton laughed --  " If you lost it , I must have found it ; but no time is to be lost , and if we 're all agreed let 's go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Arthur was silent ; sitting with his head bent down , as if closely examining the key , but in fact to hide the emotion he knew was visible in his face . " Well , then , " said Clinton , rising and unlocking an armoire which stood in one corner of the room , " here are some bags for us , which I have had prepared expressly . Each of us will take two ; and with what else we can carry about our persons , they will be enough . Here , Pratt , are yours . What the devil ails you , man , to look so down ? " " Nothing ails me , " replied Arthur , rising and taking the bags , with an effort to look interested and cheerful . " Well , " continued Clinton , " now , my plan is this : all you have got to do is to unlock the door and go in ; for Quirk tells me that early this morning he managed to fill the bolt socket in the floor , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certain Jeff was too fuddled with the wine he gave him to note the difference . If this was so , you can go in without the slightest difficulty , and as you two know all about the store , which I do n't , while you are gathering the goods , I will saw off one of the window shutters , and cut out a pane of glass , so that it will seem the entrance was effected by that means . Here are the implements , you see , " said he , holding up a saw and file . " Aye , " said Quirk , " but you 'll need a diamond to cut the glass . " " I 'll use this , " said he , showing the ring on his finger . " Just as it is ? " " Yes , as good so as any way . Now , the first thing you do after getting in , is to pull out that filling from the bolt sockets if you care to save yourselves , then pitch into the goods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laces , everything of that kind , but avoid the linens , cloths , and all that , as too heavy , and besides might be detected by the stamp . Lock and bolt the door after you when you go in , and you , Pratt , pocket the key ; for no doubt it will be asked for to-morrow . I 'll have a place ready for you to get out . And now let 's be off -- here are dark lanterns for you . " " But the watchman , " suggested Arthur . " Oh , never fear a watchman such a night as this ; he 's snugly asleep somewhere , no doubt -- and if he should come too near , this would ' his quietus make , ' " said Clinton , displaying a glittering dagger . Arthur shuddered visibly . " You promised no murder , Mr. Clinton . " " And I 'll endeavor to keep that promise , Mr. Pratt , " laughed Clinton . " Now let 's be going . " They went out without again seeing Clinton 's wife . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm-in-arm , started on ahead , while Arthur , reluctant , and remorseful , but ashamed to betray his feelings , followed in their footsteps , the suffering victim of his own and another 's pride . The store was reached . The noise of the tempest rendered much caution unnecessary , for thunder , wind and rain were so loudly uniting their forces that almost any noise would but have seemed the natural effect of their fury . But it was with extreme caution that Arthur applied the key to the lock , opened the door and permitted Quirk to enter . The latter instantly stepped to the window , and assisted Clinton in taking down a shutter , and the last named gentleman , with file and saw , soon gave it the appearance of having been taken down by such instruments alone from the outside . He then proceeded to cut out one of the large panes of glass , while Quirk and Arthur , having opened the bolt sockets and fastened the door with lock and bolt , proceeded to collect the goods . Suddenly Arthur stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't go on . Oh , this is awful , awful ! Think of my poor brother , sick , maybe dying , in that room yonder , and I engaged thus ! Oh ! I never , never can go on ! " " Furies ! " muttered Quirk , between his teeth , " this is a pretty time for such thoughts ! The brat in yonder is doing well enough , I 'll be bound ; but if you give him time to come out here and see you , he would die for certain . You may just as well yell out and give us all up to the police as to stop now -- a nice body you are to take revenge . " That one last word acted as a spur , and Arthur again resumed the packing of the bags , and Quirk coming up to him , said , softly :  --  " Now you 're a man again -- ai n't ashamed of you now . Here 's a mask for you , tie it on . I do n't fear detection , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got one for myself . " Arthur obeyed mechanically , and tied the mask over his features and went on with his work . Boxes were rifled , drawers were emptied and shelves left vacant . The bags were filled . Everything light and valuable that could be stowed away in them had been , and Quirk and Arthur passed them up into the window for Clinton to set into the street . He lifted them all out , and wrapped them in oil cloth to prevent the goods from being damaged by the rain . He placed them in a pile beneath the window arch , so that they might be easily lifted away even by two strong pair of arms , and left them there , certain that the raging storm would prevent all chance of discovery . Quirk had crept out also , through the open pane , after having placed the goods in the window , and now seated himself upon the pile and wiped his brow , like one wearied with a long fatiguing task . Arthur had wrapped his cloak around him preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window and vaulted into the store . " I want to see if you have made a clean sweep , " said he , taking Arthur 's lantern from his hand , and passing lightly up through the store with a practised tread and running his eye eagerly over the shelves . " Velvets , " said he , suddenly pausing to read the lable of a large box . " Why the devil did n't you get them ? " and forthwith he drew it down and turned its rich contents out into an immense bandanna handkerchief which he drew from his breast . " Oh , for Heaven 's sake do n't stop for them ! " whispered Arthur , nervously , " let 's be gone ! " " Zounds , man ! here 's a little fortune in itself , " returned the other , carefully tying them up . " I 'd be a fool to leave these . " Neither saw , so intent were they on what they were doing , the door of Wilkins ' room swing slowly open , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . So feeble was the light it held , it scarcely served to reveal the way , and one trembling foot struck against a store stool , making sufficient noise to attract the attention of the robbers . They both turned suddenly , the light of their lantern fell that way , and they stood face to face with Guly . In an instant Clinton 's hand was on his dagger ; it rose glittering high in air , and aimed at Guly 's heart , descended with a fearful plunge toward that pure young breast . " Murderer ! " cried a voice behind him , and a counter blow from a well directed hand , sent the instrument of death clattering upon the floor . At the sound of that voice , though it had come from beneath a mask , Guly uttered a cry of anguish a thousand times more heart-rending than would have been a death cry , and sank senseless upon the floor , the lamp going out in its fall . Trembling with horror , Arthur felt himself pushed forward by Clinton 's strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong within him , he bolted through , Clinton followed , and they once more stood in the street . " We 'll take care of the bags , " whispered Clinton , hurriedly , to Arthur ; " you fly up that alley , get you to bed , and take care of yourself , you 'll only hinder us if you go along -- pull off your boots . " Loaded with their booty , Clinton and Quirk passed away like shadows in the stormy darkness , and bewildered , yet aware of the stern necessity for obeying Clinton 's advice , Arthur drew off his boots and darted like light up the alley , noiselessly unlocked the small door , fastened it , and once more breathed in his own room . Quick as thought he rinsed the mud from his boots in some water he knew where to find , turned the India rubber cloak wrong side out and hung it on the peg whence he had taken it , undressed , all in that to him fearful darkness , and once more sought his pillow , without causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slumbered on his mattress , unconscious of the trouble soon to fall on his devoted head . Clasping his hands upon his wildly beating heart , Arthur lay still to listen for any sound to indicate that life had returned to Guly , or that Wilkins had awakened . For the first time , he bethought him of his mask , and raising his hand to his face found it had fallen off , probably , he concluded , in his hurried flight through the window . CHAPTER XXVIII . " Who hath done this most foul deed ? " It were hard to tell , perhaps , what broke the head clerk 's heavy slumber . It may have been Guly 's wild cry , when he sank quivering to the floor , which reached his ear , even above the tempest-din . It may have been that instinct , which , sleeping or waking , teaches the heart to miss what it loves , or it may have been the natural effect of the drug , which had spent itself , that aroused him . He opened his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden head no longer nestled on his bosom . Alarmed , he sprang to his feet in an instant , wide awake . He reached for the lamp , but found it gone ; and , with nothing but a lighted match in his hand , he started out to look for Guly . The match went out before he was half way down to the store , but he went on , groping in the thick darkness , till suddenly his foot struck Guly 's body ; and with a moan of agony , he stooped and lifted him in his arms , and bore him hastily back to his bed , where he laid him down , in wild suspense , not knowing whether he was alive or dead . After several minutes he succeeded in finding a store-lamp ; but the moment he lighted it the wind gushed through the open pane and blew it out , leaving him again in total darkness . Cursing the luck , he turned to obtain another match , when another gust of wind rushed in , and swept across his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darted through his brain . Taking the lamp to his own room , he lighted it there , and finding , to his joy , that Guly still lived , he immediately applied the restoratives he deemed necessary ; and soon saw the chest heave , the eyelids quiver , and the whole form once more wearing the glow and motion of life . " Oh , Wilkins , such a dreadful dream ! Horror ! horror ! " " There , Guly , compose yourself . Do n't tell me about it till you are better . " Guly obeyed , and lay quite still , trying to recall his wandering senses ; and soon the truth rushed back upon his mind , in all its stern reality , and he felt it was no dream . " Have you been in the store , Wilkins ? " " Only in the dark -- to bring you back . " " Things are in wild confusion there . Oh , could I have only wakened you , it might have been different . " " Did you try , then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thoroughly waken you , all I could do ; you seemed to be in a sort of stupor . But I was certain that I heard a voice , something too human in its sound to be the fury of the storm . It was dark here , and the door was shut . " " The deuce it was ! I left the lamp burning , and the door wide open ; the wind must have done that work . " " It was as I tell you ; and I went out , having lighted the lamp , and saw them in the very act , Wilkins , of finishing their robbery . Had I not been so weak and ill I would have cried aloud to you ; but I came upon them so suddenly -- so unexpectedly to myself , in the faint light , that I was surprised , for the moment , into silence , and then one turned , and raised his dirk to stab me ; but the other , who had on his face a hideous mask , averted the blow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , " said Guly , shuddering , as he rejected the too familiar tones , which , in that dread moment , had fallen on his ear . " I fear , " said Wilkins , kindly , " that this excitement has been too much for you . If you will remain here , and try to get some rest , I will look after the affairs in the store , and will call up Arthur and Jeff to assist me . " At the mention of Arthur 's name , Guly looked anxious , but expressed his willingness to accede to this proposition . So , taking the lamp , the head clerk turned his steps toward the gloomy room at the stair-head , first taking a casual view of the confusion manifest in the store . It was not without some slight suspicions , and many misgivings , that Wilkins went in search of Arthur ; but as he pushed open the door , and looked into the room , an expression of immense relief passed over his features , and with a freer step he approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound slumber . One arm was thrown listlessly above his head , his dark curls , disheveled and tangled , were stroked back from his brow , and his cheeks , though hotly flushed , looked as if bearing the bright glow of some pleasant dream . Wilkins laid a hand upon his arm , and awakened him . The young man started up in bed , impatiently asking the cause of his being thus disturbed . Wilkins told him in as few words as possible , and turned to awaken Jeff , while Arthur hastily proceeded to dress himself . To his surprise the head clerk found Jeff already awake , and trembling like an aspen leaf , as he sat up on his mattress , looking in dismay at Wilkins . " What 's the matter with you , Jeff ? " " Debbil , massa ! Did n't I har you say de store broke open ? " " You did ; and I want you to be up , and stirring quickly . " " Well , if dis does n't beat de witches ! Nuffin dis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dis nigger lef his post . See'f ole Massa do n't say dat . " Wilkins bade him talk less , and dress quick ; and in a few minutes the three descended the stairs together . The fury of the storm was well-nigh spent ; and the flashes of lightning , and loud peals of thunder , came at longer intervals . Faint streaks of light in the horizon , also told of scattering clouds , and approaching dawn . Closing the open pane as well as he could , so that he could carry his lamp without danger of its being extinguished , Wilkins , with Jeff and Arthur , proceeded to examine the " amount of damage done . " Suddenly Wilkins paused , and pointing out a number of clearly-defined tracks upon the floor , distinctly marked , in yet moist mud , he bade them be careful in preserving them as they might possibly give some faint clue to the robber , whoever he was . Jeff 's quick eye caught at that moment what Wilkins failed to see -- he observed that Arthur eagerly inspected the foot-prints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own feet , as if to note if there were any similitude ; and he saw , too , as the youth bent beneath the rays of the lamp , that his black curls , in one or two places , sparkled with heavy rain-drops . Jeff 's ready mouth was open to speak ; when the thought of Guly flitted , like a restraining angel , before him , and he remained silent ; but , with his quick mind , convinced of Arthur 's knowledge of the affair . It was decided , that as soon as it was day , Jeff should be dispatched for Mr. Delancey ; and , waiting for the dawn to break , they gathered round Guly 's bed , to discuss the events of the night , and propose measures for the future . When Mr. Delancey arrived he said but little , going about to see what goods had been taken -- minutely examining the spot where the apparent entrance had been made , and silently drawing his own conclusions . When the foot-print upon the floor was pointed out to him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time closely . There were marks of other feet , but they were mixed and confused , but this had gone higher in the store than the rest ; there were tracks going and returning . The foot was small , elegantly-shaped , and , from appearance , with an instep so high that water might flow freely under without soiling the sole . After examining it for awhile , Mr. Delancey was observed to set his own foot on it , as if to note if there were any similitude . He turned away with a puzzled look , but in a few minutes called Jeff to him . " How came you away from your post last night , eh ? " Jeff explained . " Well , how came this handkerchief of yours , and this jack-knife , that I gave you the other day , lying near the broken pane , in the bow-window , this morning , eh ! you black rascal ? tell me that ! " Jeff trembled in every joint , and caught hold of a chair for support . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , jis ' fore I went to bed ; I remember usin ' ' em ' fore Mr. Quirk went out ; but I'se sure I know nuffin more ' bout ' em . " " Do n't you lie to me , sir ! If you 've had a hand in this business , I 'll have your black neck twisted off , I will . Get out of my sight ! " The expression of poor Jeff 's face was pitiful to behold . He turned away , with his trembling hands clasped before him , and his great eyes looking upward , as if imploring mercy . Mr. Delancey then went into Guly 's room , and listened to his recital of what had occurred , so far as he knew , during the night . " And you are sure you have seen this young man , who drew his dirk on you , before ? " " Positive of it , sir . I caught but a glimpse of him last night , but it was sufficient to show me who it was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will describe him ? " " To the best of my ability , sir . " " Be up to-day , I s'pose , wo n't you ? " added the merchant , putting his head into the room after he had gone out . " Shall try to do so , sir . " " Sure you know nothing of that other scamp ? " " As I told you , sir , he was masked closely , and --  " The door closed without giving him time to finish the sentence ; a fact , which Guly was not sorry for . Mr. Delancey ordered the store to be kept closed until things could be put in proper order ; gave Wilkins orders to purchase and replace , as far as possible , the stolen goods , then stepped into his carriage , and drove home to breakfast . The merchant 's commands were always promptly obeyed . The officer came to converse with Guly -- the broken shutter and window-pane were mended or replaced -- new goods wore purchased , and put in place of the old ones , and by afternoon no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at No.  --  Chartres-street . CHAPTER XXIX . " It requires swift foot . " Timon of Athens . " Fly now , for your life fly , " whispered Quirk , eagerly , to Clinton , as , rid of Arthur , they pursued their way through the thick darkness and pelting storm . " If the cry of that white-faced stripling has roused Wilkins , we 're as good as lost , unless we outstrip him ; for I 'd about as soon have a dozen blood-hounds at my heels as him . " They sped on in silence -- only now and then stopping to change hands with their heavy load -- until they once more stood at the door of Clinton 's house . Here , placing their booty upon the ground , Clinton lifted up a trap-door , concealed just under the steps leading up to the front entrance . With Quirk 's assistance , he placed the bags of goods , one by one , in a sort of cellar , rather large than deep , thus made on account of the thinness of the soil , and closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Closing the door cautiously , once more , Clinton locked it , placed over it some broken bricks , loose earth , and tufts of grass , so as effectually to conceal it , then crept out , and rubbing the dust from his clothes , prepared to enter . Quirk went in with him , and they seated themselves in the little back-room , which they had left two short hours before . " A capital haul for one night , " said Clinton , triumphantly , flinging off his great-coat , and drawing his chair to the grate , where a cheerful fire was burning , rendered necessary by the dampness . " It is n't the first thing of the kind you were ever engaged in , Clin ? " " You know better , " returned the other , with an easy confidence , but at the same time a grave look crossing his features . " Believe me , I do n't want to pry into private matters , but I could n't help wondering to-night , as we came along , if this pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your incomings . " " No , thank Heaven ! " replied Clinton , with more earnestness that one would have deemed him capable of . " No , she has n't a suspicion of such things . " " Glad of it , " said Quirk , " she 's happier ; but I say , old boy , hav n't you sometimes regretted the faithfulness to a poor girl which has deprived you of your inheritance , and forced you upon such deeds as to-night for a living ? " " No ! My faithfulness to Marion has made a better man of me in some respects than otherwise I ever could have been , though it may have made me worse in others . I have in her a noble and excellent wife , with all the sterling good qualities , which , had I married a fashionable woman , I could never have found . As for my inheritance , I would care little had I but some honest trade by which to live -- but that my father thought too plebeian to be introduced in the education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk 's pocket of a few more bank deposits , with my part of our spoils to-night , I 'll do . I 'm not always going to be so bad . If my life is spared till this business is settled , I shall spend the rest of my days in Havana . Even with the memory of my crimes in my heart , I believe I can be happy with such a treasure in my bosom as Marion . My father 's pride has been my curse -- my sins be upon his head . " " And if you 're found out in this business , what do you think will be done ? " " Oh , I shall be bought up , without doubt . The old man 's spirit could never brook to have it said he had a child in prison committed for burglary . " " Well , ' t is as well to be cautious ; for I fear that young Pratt knew you , and he 'll tell all he saw , I 'll be bound . Reckon though if he knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have tried to turn suspicion on Jeff , the negro . I picked his pocket of a knife and a handkerchief , and threw them down there somewhere . I ' spose the boss would almost be tempted to string him up if he thought him guilty ; however , a nigger more or less is nothing -- but when it comes to such valuable members of society as you and I , caution is necessary . " Here Quirk laughed coarsely . " I 'll wear whiskers awhile ; that 'll be disguise enough for me , " said Clinton . " All that worries me is Arthur Pratt 's proceeding -- hope he 's been good pluck . " " Never fear him ; he 's a little too conscientious yet awhile to be much of a b'hoy , but he 'd be ashamed to show he could n't do as well as the best of us . If that nigger did n't wake up when he went in we 're safe enough in that quarter . " " Have as little to say to him as possible , to-morrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burglary . " " Trust me for that ; I shall take proper care of our interests , I assure you . " " As for the disposal of the goods , that , I suppose , comes entirely upon my shoulders . I think I will dispose of this lot to Talbot ; he is the best paymaster , and the first dark night I will get them away from here . After that , call for your dividends . If you are by any odd chance arrested before that , remember your oath -- do n't implicate anybody . Honor among thieves , you know . " " Aye , aye , " returned Quirk , drinking deeply of some wine which stood upon the table . " You 'll live long if you wait for me to hang you . Good night . " " Good night . " They shook hands and parted , and Quirk hurried away to his lodgings , in order to be able to say that he had occupied his own room , etc. , etc. , in case of trouble . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long coat and a tattered old shawl , the better to protect it from the weather , appeared from the shadow of an adjoining building , and swung himself along between his crutches , muttering to himself : " Hih ! hih ! get the reward for these thieves -- watch the papers I will -- know all about ' em -- get the reward , hih ! hih ! hih ! hih ! " and the darkness swallowed him up as it had done him who had gone before . CHAPTER XXX . But , Othello , speak --  Did you by indirect and forced courses , Subdue and poison this young maid 's affection ? Or came it by request , and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth ! Shakspeare . Mr. Delancey sat in his drawing-room conversing with General Delville ; whom he was yet allowed to believe he might one day look upon as his son-in-law . The night was dark , and a penetrating , drizzling rain was falling , which rendered the cheerful scene in that vast appartment all the more bright and pleasant . Suddenly there came a startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent the blood in a hot flush to Della 's temples , as she sat there quietly between her mother and the General , with her thoughts wandering where they chose , though she seemed to be listening to the conversation . A servant entered , saying that a gentleman desired to see Mr. Delancey . " Tell him I am engaged . " " I did so , sir ; but he insisted upon seeing you . " " Perhaps some one bringing you news concerning the robbery , " suggested Madame D. " Ah , perhaps so . Show him into the library and tell him I 'll be with him in a moment . " Excusing himself to his guest , the merchant sought the library . A tall man , wrapped in a heavy cloak , his hat still on and drawn over his brows , was walking impatiently back and forth across the floor . Mr. Delancey turned his cold eyes upon him earnestly for a moment and withdrew them nervously . " Mr. Wilkins , I believe ? " " The same , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " That which has never brought me here before , sir , and never will again -- business of a strictly private nature . " Mr. Delancey looked somewhat disturbed , but drew a chair beside a large writing-desk , and motioning his visitor to be seated , placed himself in front of him . " Nothing wrong about the last load of goods ? No trouble with the boats , is there , Wilkins ? " " Nothing of the kind , sir ; my business , as I told you , is of a strictly private nature . " " Proceed , I am ready to listen . " " And will you , sir , listen to me calmly ; and make no sudden outbreaks or disturbance ? I hate scenes , even with women , but with men , Heaven defend me ! " " I know of nothing you could say , sir , that would call forth any such ebullitions as you speak of ; I am not a man of unnecessary words , as you well know . " " What I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , perhaps , do better to leave it unsaid ; but I wish to repair , with what honor I can , a course , which in itself has not , perhaps , been strictly honorable . Do you know , sir , that I love your daughter ? " Mr. Delancey stared at the head clerk for a moment , like a man suddenly struck dumb ; then every trace of color vanished from his face . " My daughter , sir ! You surely do n't mean Della ! " " Have you , then , another daughter ? I mean none other than Miss Della ; and I this night come to ask your consent to our union . We have loved long and sincerely , and --  " " How dare you utter such words as these to me ? You dare to tell me , that a child of mine has stooped to notice her father 's clerk ? " " Aye ! not only has one stooped to love a clerk , but has not the other wedded a clerk 's daughter ? Mr. Delancey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put away the difference of your wealth , and I am as high as yourself ; as much a man , as high in station , and more honorable than yourself . Thus I dare to seek your daughter 's hand ; and crave her father 's blessing . " " Have a care , sir , of what you say -- more honorable ? you dare to tell me that ? " " You know it to be the truth . " The merchant turned slightly pale . " Mr. Wilkins , you put such a proposition as this you have suggested , merely for -- merely to try me ; you surely do not , can not mean it ? " " I mean it all , sir . I am not given to trifling on such matters , and I have come to you like an honest man to ask your child 's hand , and gain consent or refusal . " " And Della loves you ? " " If I may believe her words , she does ; and I have her sanction to tell this to you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you dared , sir , to steal into my child 's heart , and rob me of her affections ? how have you dared to come like a thief in the night , and steal that heart away ? I had never a suspicion of this -- never thought of it . Brute that you are , thus to abuse my confidence ! " " Beware of what you say , sir . I have abused no confidence . Had you ever made me a guest at your house , ever treated me as if I had been human , like yourself , this might never have been . At least I would have wooed like an honest man , and your influence with your child might have nipped it in the bud . You must put up with the consequences of your own folly . " " Where have you ever met my daughter ? " " Never in this house , as you well know . Abroad , riding , walking , in spite of duennas and guardians , I have wooed , and won her to myself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain she is the betrothed of General Delville , who this moment converses with her in the parlor . " " You , sir , may be the one deceived . Della would not leave you without giving you a knowledge of her love . She bade me come to you , to ask her of you openly , and to tell you all . " " Then , sir , once for all , let me tell you , you talk in vain ; never will my pride permit my beautiful child -- she whom I have educated and trained to grace the home of the first in our land -- to become the humble bride of a hireling clerk . Out upon you , for daring to ask it ! " " And where would be the pride you boast of , should I choose to bruit to the world those tales that I could tell , of long years of practiced deception and guilt on your part -- of wealth acquired by fraudulent means -- of midnight hours of watchfulness , which have brought you ship-loads of contraband goods -- of days and weeks spent in devising means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wilkins stopped suddenly , for Mr. Delancey fell back in his chair , groaning aloud . The head clerk held a glass of water to his lips , and he slowly recovered , and looked up in his visitor 's face with a beseeching glance in his cold gray eyes . " I am in your power , but spare me ! spare me ! Have mercy on an old man , who is weak and erring , but whose withered heart clings to his only daughter ! " " You give me your consent ? " " Ask anything but that . " " And you prefer to have your name go forth to the world branded with shame and infamy , rather than give your daughter to an honest man , who will strive to make her a good husband , and whom she already loves ? " Mr. Delancey moaned , and covered his face with his hands . " Rather would you that men point at you with the finger of scorn -- that former friends despise you -- that the world look down upon you , and speak your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child happy with the man of her choice ? " " Yes ! " cried the merchant , springing to his feet , " if that man be you , a thousand times , yes ! Go ; do your worst ; cast forth my name like waste-paper on the winds , scourge it , brand , blacken it ; do what you will . Though you curse me to the confines of purgatory , my daughter never shall be yours ! " " This is your final decision ? " " My last -- leave my house , sir , and never do you dare to darken its doors again . " " You may regret , sir , what you have said to-night , " said Wilkins , putting on his hat and cloak . " I shall always abide by it . Begone , sir ! Why do you tarry ? " The folds of the heavy cloak fluttered a moment in the door-way , then passed through it , and disappeared down the long stairs . Through those vast halls , with frowning brow and heavy tread , Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first and last time , and he went forth into the silent streets . CHAPTER XXXI . " I do beseech you , send for the lady , And let her speak . " Othello . " Send the girl , Minny , to me , " said Mr. Delancey to Della , as she was about leaving the breakfast-table , to go to her own room , the morning after Wilkins ' visit to her father . Mr. Delancey , as was usual with him , had said not a word with regard to his interview with Wilkins , but he had thought of it deeply , and was now prepared to act . Della flew to her room . " Minny , dear Minny , papa wants you . He sent me for you , and I am certain something terrible is about to happen , his eyes look so strangely . I know Bernard must have come last night , as he said he would , and that is what has made papa seem so silent and angry . He wants to ask you about everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't give up my precious letters -- do n't ! " Della sank sobbing upon a chair , and Minny , pale as a ghost , glided away , and entered the apartment where Mr. Delancey awaited her . " So , girl , you have chosen to play the go-between for your mistress and a worthless fellow ? " Minny was silent . " You who must know all , tell me what you know of this matter . " " Nothing , sir , dishonorable to my master or his daughter . " " No prevarication , minion . Whatever you know of , as having passed between Miss Della , and -- and -- this man , I wish you to state plainly here . " " I can tell you no more , sir , than you already know . " " By what means has this acquaintanceship been carried on ? I know there has been no opportunity for much personal intercourse . Have you letters ? " " If I have , sir , they are the property of my young mistress , and as such , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Fool ! do you forget that you are my slave ? " " As such , my first duty is to the mistress you have bade me serve . " " Are the letters in your possession ? " " They are , sir ; placed there for safe keeping . " " Bring me them instantly ! " said Mr. Delancey , stamping his foot heavily upon the floor . " No , " said the girl , calmly folding her hands on her bosom ; " whatever questions my master has to ask , I am ready to answer ; but I can do no more . " " What do you mean ? " cried the merchant , rising , and laying his hands upon her shoulders . " Go and do my bidding instantly . What did you confess you had them for , if you did n't expect me to get them ? Any other of my negroes would have lied . " Minny 's face flushed crimson . " Your other negroes , sir , might act differently , under many circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more calmly , " Miss Della taught me never to tell a falsehood , and these lips have never lied . " The merchant looked keenly at Minny for a moment , then said :  --  " Do you know that if you disobey me I will use the lash ? You are but a slave , if you have a paler skin . Do you hear ? Either tell me where these papers can be found , or bring them to me yourself , or I will lash you till your back runs pools of blood . " " And I will bear it , sir , though you should make it run rivers . My mistress 's confidence is more sacred to me than any drop of blood that circles round my heart , and I will shed it all sooner than betray her . " Mr. Delancey paused a moment , with a glance of something like admiration lighting up his cold eyes ; perhaps he saw something of his own indomitable spirit in the girl 's firm demeanor , and , perhaps , the thought that nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never entered his mind . With his anger every moment growing more intense , the merchant again laid his hand upon her arm . " No more parleying , girl -- bring me the letters . " " Never , sir . " " Dare you speak thus to me ? I will have them . " " Not while it is in my power to prevent you , sir . " " Fool ! Minny , slave , out of my way ! " Minny moved not a muscle . " Do as I command you , or , by Heaven , I 'll make you . Was ever such disobedience shown a master ? " Minny stood firm , but silent , her back against the door . Mr. Delancey laid his hand upon the bell-rope , and pulled it violently . " Voltaire , " said he , to the servant who answered it , " bring me the heavy whip , with the braided lash . " It was not often that Mr. Delancey punished a slave , but when he did he was very severe . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like revenge , for what he deemed Minny 's obstinacy , spurred him on . The refusal of the letters had made him determined to possess them , and nothing could now have turned him from his course . Reader , he was a father ; and his daughter was his idol ! The servant brought the whip , laid it on the table , glanced pityingly at Minny , and went out with a shudder . Mr. Delancey seized Minny by the arm , and pushed her on before him , until he reached an upper balcony , near the sleeping apartments of the domestics . " Now , girl , down with you . " " No , sir ; if you lash me , let me stand and bear it like a human being , not like a dog , with my face to the dust . " " Down with you , or I will knock you down ! You shall take it , as would any other slave . " Minny threw back her curls , and knelt before her master . " On your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pushed her forward on her face . She lay there , with her heavy curls falling round her like a mantle , entirely concealing the tearless , livid face . Delancey raised his arm , and the heavy lash descended , whirring through the air , telling how fierce the hand that dealt the blow . The tender flesh could almost be seen to quiver through the thin , light dress ; but Minny moved not , uttered no moan , nor raised her head . " How now , girl , does your spirit hold out ? Will you give up the letters ? " " Never ! " Again the lash came down , and this time , across one fair , polished shoulder , gleaming out from among the curls , in her low-necked dress , was marked a braided cut , from which the blood oozed in small round drops , staining also the waist of the dress , where the lash had fallen . " How now ? " There came no answer : Minny lay still and quiet . Again the enraged master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trifle lighter , but more frequent , with no power for questioning . Della sat in her room waiting for Minny 's return . Suddenly a strange sound struck upon her ear . She started , bent forward , and listened eagerly . It came again and again . She sprang to her feet , and darted like lightning down the stairs . She ran hither and thither , scarce knowing whence to trace the sound , when suddenly she met one of the servants . " Voltaire , in Heaven 's name , where are papa and Minny ? " " On the back gallery , Miss , " returned the man . With the speed of thought , Della sped through the long passages , up the stairs , and out upon the balcony . She gained the spot just as the strong arm was upraised to give another blow . " Papa ! papa ! for the love of mercy , stop ! " At that sound Minny slightly raised her head , but dropped it again , and the blow came down . Della sprang wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you into such a demon ! " With an almost superhuman strength , she caught the whip , as it was again descending , in her own jeweled and delicate hands , wrested it from her father 's grasp , and flung it over the railing into the court below . Dropping upon her knees , she lifted the quadroon 's head upon her lap . The eyes were closed , and the pallid face wore the appearance of death . Minny had fainted . Springing to a water-pipe , Della filled a basin , and drawing the girl tenderly upon her breast , rocked her gently , back and forth , as she bathed the blue-veined temples with the cooling fluid . Still pale with anger , Mr. Delancey stood looking on . " Poor child , poor Minny ! " sobbed Della , as the tears rained down her cheeks ; " all this you have suffered for me -- poor thing , poor thing ! " Suddenly lifting her eyes , Della confronted her father . " Not another night ! " she exclaimed bitterly , " shall Minny stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , papa ; you know she is . You might as well have whipped me as to whip her . Oh ! papa , that you should use your own child thus ! " Mr. Delancey started forward . " Who has dared to tell you such a tale as this !  - -  who has presumed to whisper such a falsehood in your ear ? " " It is no falsehood , papa ; it is truth , all truth -- would it were not ! It requires no talking to see it . Has she not your look , your spirit , much of your pride ? But none of your cruelty . No , no , poor Minny , you have indeed been a sister to me . Look , papa , at this poor bleeding back , see how this dress is dyed with blood ; blood which you cursed her with , blood which you have drawn forth again with the lash ! The lash -- think of it ; and she your own daughter ! " Untouched by his child 's words , Delancey turned away , every vein swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll teach you both to carry on your private dealings with dastardly clerks . Back to your room , and leave this heap of bloody flesh and rags for the negroes to care for . " " Shame on you , papa . No ! I shall not leave her for a moment . With regard to this poor child , your authority is as naught to me . " " That remains to be seen , " returned Mr. Delancey , in his cold , deep tones ; and , stepping to the stairhead , he called Voltaire to his presence . At this moment Minny drew a long , shivering sigh , looked up , and met her mistress 's tearful gaze with a smile . " They are safe , Miss -- all safe ; he could not get them , " she whispered , faintly . " Hush , Minny , darling . Oh , you have suffered so terribly for my sake ! This is dreadful , dreadful ! " " Anything for you , Miss Della , anything . " Della 's only answer was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , " said Mr. Delancey , approaching them , with Voltaire walking behind them : " now , Minny , up with you , and get yourself out of my sight ; and , mark me ! you may get your back ready for another scourging unless you give me those papers before to-morrow . " " Papa , you know Minny is n't able to walk . Let Voltaire carry her . " " Well , up with her , then . Take her to some of the negroes ' rooms , and let her lie there till she repents of her obstinacy . " " Voltaire , " said Della , stepping forward , " take her to my room , and put her upon my bed . Go ! " The negro obeyed , and Mr. Delancey offered no opposition . There was a look in his daughter 's eye which he had never seen there before , an imperative manner which enforced command , and he allowed the man to pass him , bearing the bleeding and exhausted Minny in his arms . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , " follow her . Until I can get this vile piece of romance out of your head , you shall remain a prisoner in your own room . Shame on you for your want of pride ! " " Thank Heaven , papa , that I have no more . " They parted -- father and daughter there -- both turning their heads , as they passed , to look back upon each other ; then went from sight , silently and coldly . CHAPTER XXXII . " All the world 's a stage . " " Oh , Massa Gulian , " said Jeff , one day , following Guly , who had entirely recovered from his illness , to his room , " what shall I ever do , Massa Gulian , I'se so berry mis'ble ? " " And what has occurred , my poor fellow , to make you so unhappy ? " " Why , it 's ' bout dis robb'ry , young massa . Don ' you see dat old Master s'picions me ? Tudder day , he said he bleeb 'd I know 'd suthin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine dar in de winder ; and the Lord knows I'se innocent as a lamb , ob eben tinking such a ting . " " Mr. Wilkins , I think , convinced him of your innocence , Jeff . He told him every fact , concerning you , that he could think of , to prove you guiltless . " " Yes , but -- but I heerd Master mutter to hisself dat he could n't clar me in his own mind till somebody else was cotched , and proved guilty ; and nobody has been cotched , and I'se berry wretched , ' deed , sah , I is . " Jeff looked all he expressed , and Guly pitied him in his heart . " Be of good cheer , and trust in God ; all will yet be well . It were impossible for any one to think you guilty , Jeff , of this . " " Seems to me dat de Lord has deserted me ' tirely . What makes my heart ache most , is Massa 's manner ; you see he allus used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped me in the world , and he used to trust me with so many of his private affairs , and wus allus so kind of confidential like , long o ' me , and sometimes sent me wid money to de bank , and all dat . Do n't do it now ; scowl on his face de minit he cum near me , and look so like a tunder cloud , I ' spects to be struck wid lightnin ' ebery minit . If he 'd tie me up , and whip me , and den be hisself agin , I would n't care ; but de Lord knows I lub my Massa dearly , and ca n't bar ' to hab him turn de cold shoulder to me , and show he hab no more confidence in his nigger , ' tall . " Guly tried to say something encouraging ; but , though Jeff listened respectfully , it was very sadly ; and several times he wiped the tears from his cheeks , while his young master was speaking . " Massa Guly , " said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's suthin ' I found in de winder , de morning after de robb'ry , when dey was cleaning up . I ' spect it b'longs to de tiefs , but I do n't want you to open it till some one 's cotched , and then if it finds an owner , well and good ; but if it do n't , I want you to keep it to ' member me . It 's a purty thing , an ' it 's mine if it do n't get an owner , ' cause I found it ; and , as I said , I want you to hab it . " " You are not going away , are you , Jeff ? " " Yes , young massa , berry fur . " " Why , how so ? " said Guly , in surprise , " I had heard nothing of it . " " Well , please not to say nothin ' ' bout it , massa ; ' twould n't do no good , an ' I do n't want it talked of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , an ' he sends all his bad niggers dar . Mebbe I wo n't see you ' gin , Massa Gulian , so good bye . " Gulian gave him his hand , and the negro took it in both of his , and bending over it , burst into a loud fit of weeping . " Oh , Massa Guly , if I'se ever hurt your feelin ' , or done anyting berry wrong , I hopes you will forgive me . De Lord bress you , Massa Guly ; you'se been de light ob mine eyes , an ' de joy ob my soul , eber sin ' you fuss cum here . De Lord bress you , foreber an ' eber . " With a despairing , broken-hearted gesture , Jeff dropped the hand , and hurried from the room ; and , at that moment Wilkins , who still retained his place as head clerk , called Guly a moment to his side . " Guly , " said he , laying his hands upon his shoulders , " do you remember the time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would be that one ? " " Yes , Wilkins ; and will fulfill my promise any moment ! " " Will you be at the Old Cathedral , with Blanche , at midnight ? " " Blanche ! midnight ! the Old Cathedral ? I do n't understand your meaning . " " I want you to meet me at that hour , with Blanche , at the Cathedral . " " Would she go ? " " Oh , yes ; I have it all arranged with her ; Old Elise will stay with her grandfather till she returns . You will be there ? " " Since you wish it -- yes , without fail . You will explain matters when we meet there ? " " They will explain themselves . Do n't forget . " The day wore on , and everything went on in its usual manner , until just before Mr. Delancey 's dinner hour , when , to the surprise of all , the loud report of a pistol was heard , coming from the little court , just at the back part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those clerks not at the moment engaged , rushed to the long windows , and sprang through into the court , to learn what the matter was . Guly was the first on the spot , and to his horror and amazement , found Jeff lying on the ground , weltering in his blood , but still showing signs of life . " Jeff ! " he exclaimed , bending over him , " what have you done ! " " Oh -- Massa -- Guly "  - -  gasped the negro , turning his dimming eyes to the boy 's face , " you'se come with your blue eyes to light me to Heaven . Could n't lib longer , and hab de master dat I lubbed tink me a robber . I'se tried allus to be a good nigger , an ' hope 's I 'll go to de good place . " " God grant it . " " Young Massa , is dis death ? " " ' T is coming , Jeff . " " Let me pray ; I only knows one prayer , an ' it 's so short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay me '  - -  oh , I'se goin ' fast , young massa . " " Go on . " " ' Down to sleep '  - -  Massa Guly dis long sleep . " Guly took his hand . " ' I pray de Lord my -- soul -- to keep ; an '  - -  should - -  I die '  - -  Oh , dis is de wrong prayer -- Bressed Lord , forgive my sins , and take me to dat Heaven where de white folks go , dat I may see Massa Guly , wid his white wings on . Good-bye , young massa . Last at my side in death , I 'll be fust at yours in Heaven . " With a convulsive effort , the dying man turned upon his side , the limbs grew rigid , the death-rattle shook an instant in his throat , and poor Jeff was dead . Guly left the negro 's side , to acquaint Mr. Delancey , who had remained sitting stiffly in his chair , of the facts . The merchant listened unmoved , but ordered the body to be sent to his house , and a longer or better ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that which next day bore poor Jeff to his last resting-place . Whether or not that Master felt he had wronged a true and faithful slave , could not be told ; but all he could do to show he honored his memory , was done ; and as much expense and pomp were displayed in those last rites , as ever were lavished over a white man 's bones . A Footnote A : A fact . " Everything ready now , Minny ? " said Della , glancing tearfully around her sumptuous apartments . " Everything is prepared , Miss . Shall we go ? " " Sure you are able to walk to the carriage , Minny ? " " Oh , yes , Miss ; certain of it . " Once more Della turned to look upon those objects , which use and long association had endeared to her . There were her books , her birds , her flowers , the bed , where she had dreamed so many happy dreams , and the cushioned chair , where she had so often sat listless and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she waved them a fond adieu , and , taking Minny 's arm , crept out upon the balcony , down the stairs , and through the secret garden-door . Here was an outlet Mr. Delancey had never thought of ; and while the guard , he had placed at her door , stood vigilant and wakeful , the bird flew through the window . Once in the street , at night , and in darkness , Della grew timid , and clutched convulsively her attendant 's arm ; but they went on steadily , until arriving at an adjacent corner , a third person joined them , and helped them into the carriage , which stood waiting near by . " Oh , Bernard ! " cried Della , laying her trembling hand upon his arm , as he sat beside her in the carriage , with Minny , and they were being whirled through the almost deserted streets , " no hand can ever come between us again . I am yours at last . " " Nothing shall ever part us more , " returned Bernard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up much for me , but the aim of my life shall be to make you happy . " " I have lost nothing , Bernard , compared to the love I have gained . Only never let that swerve or falter , and I shall be the happiest wife that ever God looked down upon and blessed . " The carriage stopped at the door of the cathedral , and the party entered the church , where a priest was already in waiting . Blanche and Guly made their appearance from a side aisle , and Wilkins introduced them to Della , telling her he had engaged them , as dear friends of his , to officiate in the approaching ceremony . Della expressed her pleasure , and half-crying , half-smiling , kissed Blanche affectionately , telling her she hoped , since she was one of Wilkins ' friends , that she would henceforth be a sister to her , and that they would all be very happy . Then Wilkins drew that fluttering hand in his , and led Della to the altar . Guly and Blanche stepped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pillar , a little in the shadow , behind the marriage-group , stood Minny , the quadroon ; with face blanched to an almost unearthly pallor , she listened to the vows which fell from Bernard 's lips . With chilled heart , again came back the memory of the hour when those same lips , in this very spot , had thus sworn to love and cherish her . But what of this ? her heart had been legally broken , and she had no right to complain ! The ceremony ended , Bernard and his bride , and Minny , started for the lake shore , where , though late in the season , they intended to remain awhile , previous to returning to take up their residence again in the city . They set Blanche down at her own door , and Guly , who was waiting for the adieus to be over , stepped forward , and pressing Wilkins ' hand , exclaimed :  --  " Matters have indeed explained themselves , my friend ; I little thought of this . May you be as happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Guly ; I shall , no doubt , be much happier than I deserve to be . " Then bending forward , he added , in a lower tone , " If the old gentleman is stormy to-morrow , at the loss of his daughter , remember you know nothing about the affair ; you 'll lose your place , I 'm afraid , if you do . " " You surely do n't mean ' t is Mr. Delancey 's child ? " " Aye , the same . " " Can it be possible ! It will , no doubt , be a bitter blow to him ; but I believe you worthy of any man 's daughter , Wilkins . God bless you . " Wilkins smiled at Guly 's warmth , and , waving his hand , the carriage rolled out of sight ; and Della , trustful and happy , laid her head upon the broad breast which had vowed to cherish her , and wept her tears , and smiled her smiles -- a bride . Guly , after seeing Blanche safely to her home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the strange events of the day , and wondering what the morrow would bring . In wedding Della , Wilkins had accomplished two things ; he gratified the love he really felt for her , and , at the same time , in so terribly wounding Mr. Delancey 's pride , he had amply revenged himself for the long years spent in his service in that humility of manner which the merchant ever seemed to exact from his clerks , as though they were but slaves of a whiter hue . CHAPTER XXXIII . " Oh ! that such a son should stand before a father 's face . " Byron . It was early in the morning , the day after Della 's elopement , and Mr. Delancey , who had just risen , was walking back and forth upon the verandah , sipping his cup of strong coffee , nor dreaming of the shadow which had fallen on his hearth-stone . He was interrupted by a servant , who came to inform him that a messenger had just been sent , to say that one of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if he chose to see him , his case would come on the first one ; and he might go early to the Recorder 's Office of the Second Municipality . Mr. Delancey decided to go ; and without waiting for breakfast , which was always served late , he ordered his carriage , and drove directly to the spot . When he entered the court-room , Guly was just giving in his testimony , and the crowd , that had congregated round , prevented the merchant from catching a glimpse of the prisoner . Guly gave his evidence in a clear , concise manner , recognizing the prisoner as the man he had seen in the store on the night of the burglary . " I have here , " he added , drawing a small parcel from his pocket , " something which was found by my employer 's negro , in cleaning up the bow-window , the morning after the theft . He supposed it belonged to the burglars , and gave it me previous to his death , begging me to keep it , unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . I have not opened it , or looked upon it , and do not know even what it is . " He passed it to the judge , who , untying the paper , drew forth a small box , such as is usually used to contain articles of jewelry . Lifting the lid , he held up to view a superb diamond ring , the curious setting of which Guly recognized at once , as being the same as on a diamond ring , of like appearance , he had seen the prisoner wear . While examining it , some words engraved on the inside , caught the judge 's eye , and turning it to the light , he read , in full , clear tones , the name of " Clinton Delancey . " At that moment there was a sudden opening in the crowd , and Mr. Delancey tottered forward , with features ashy pale , and the strong eyes softened almost to tears . " My son , my son ! " A gleam of triumph shot into Clinton 's gaze , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye , father , behold your son ! It was not here I thought next to see you when we parted last ; but it is one of those retributive meetings , which come sometimes , God-appointed . What you see me , you have made me . By your own false pride I was forced to beg or steal . In taking from you , I felt I took but my just due . This shame be upon your own head ! " A dead silence fell upon all , and a glance of sympathy for Mr. Delancey ran round the court and the crowd of spectators ; but , after a strong effort , the merchant drew himself to his full height , and , in a moment , all his coldness and flintiness of manner had returned to him . Turning to the Court , he said , firmly :  --  " Let the law pursue its course , " and passed from the room , striking his cane heavily down with each step , as Guly had often heard him do before . The prisoner dropped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this moment , the strange figure of the dwarf forced itself in through the crowd , and , balancing himself on his crutches , stopped full in front of the judge . " Hih ! hih ! Monsieur , " he panted , turning his one eye up at the grave face of the officer , " I got something to say ; please , sir , may I be heard ? " " Testimony with regard to this matter ? " " Yes , Monsieur ; I hang round the courts , I find out what this man has done ; I understand then something I saw him do . I may tell ? " The Court assented ; and he went on to state where he had seen Clinton deposit the goods , on the night of the burglary , adding , that another man was with him , whom he did not know , but whose name the other had mentioned , and he remembered it was Quirk -- Charley Quirk , he guessed , because sometimes Mr. Clinton addressed him as Charley , sometimes as Quirk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court , you find ze goods where I tell you ; hih ! hih ! you dig um up , an ' give dis poor little wretch someting for his information . " The dwarf was dismissed , but waited to hear the end of the trial ; and had the satisfaction of seeing Clinton , against whom the testimony was so strong , sentenced to five years ' imprisonment ; and the veritable Charley Quirk brought in under arrest , on the strength of his evidence . He then turned to go away , but catching sight of Guly , he advanced toward him , nodding his head , winking his great eye , and chuckling joyfully to himself . " Hih , Monsieur ; not seen you since that day you so sick in bed . Tink of you one great deal -- miss you great deal -- need your picayune a great deal -- love me yet , Monsieur ? " " Yes , Richard , " said the boy , kindly , laying his hand on his great ill-shaped head , as they went out together . " Have you suffered for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor fellow ? " " No , Monsieur ; I have lived on the dime the tall man gave me , in your room the other day . Hih , hih ! but I 've suffered for want of your face , Monsieur . Rare thing for poor Richard to look in any one 's face , and remember he has said he loved such a dismal little thing as me ; hih ! rare thing that , yes . " Guly sighed as he listened to these touching , mournful words , and slipping some money into the dwarf 's hand , bade him good-bye , telling him he would see him soon again , and hurried on to the store . He missed Wilkins ' kind face , as he passed his desk , and felt sad , when he remembered he might never see him there any more . Mr. Delancey was not in the store either , and there was evidence of the want of a presiding mind in the appearance of the whole store ; clerks talking together in knots , while some of the customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains , and counters undusted and unattended . As Guly took his place , Arthur crossed over , and inquired , in a steady tone , but with an excited manner , how the trial had gone . Guly informed him , at the same time telling him the fact of Clinton 's proving to be Mr. Delancey 's son . Arthur started violently , and turned away to conceal the emotion which he could not repress , as he remembered he had unconsciously assisted a son to rob his own father ! The thought brought so much remorse with it , that , seizing his hat , he started away to the nearest saloon , to procure something to drown the unpleasant memory . Guly looked after him with a deep sigh , feeling that what influence he might once have possessed over him , was gone for ever ,  - -  wrested from him by the overpowering hands of an honest pride , unjustly dealt with , and the attendant circumstances of evil society . The memory of the voice , which came from beneath the mask on that fearful night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though he studiously concealed his fears , he could but tremble at the conviction , that Arthur might , at any moment , share the fate of the unfortunate young man he had just seen convicted . But , though Quirk and Clinton both were found guilty , they faithfully kept their oath , and threw no suspicion upon Arthur . Poor Jeff , who had felt convinced of his guilt , had allowed his secret to die with him , for Guly 's sake ; Wilkins had rejected any such idea he may have entertained , the moment he saw Arthur that night in bed , and Guly alone was left to his cruel doubts , with the memory of that familiar voice haunting him , always haunting him . CHAPTER XXXIV . " Is there no constancy in earthly things ? No happiness in us but what must alter ? No life without the heavy load of fortune ? What miseries we are , and to ourselves ! Even then , when full content sits by us , What daily sores and sorrows ! " Beaumont &; Fletcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . He said nothing about what had occurred , to his wife , but , stern and silent , took his seat in the breakfast-room , waiting for the morning meal to be served . " Go to Miss Della 's room , " said he , to a servant , who entered , " and tell her I wish her to fill her place at table this morning . " The servant returned in a moment , telling his master that he had knocked loudly , but received no answer , and he could hear no one stirring in the room . " And has Ruth been by the door constantly , as I bade her ? " " She has , sir ; but says she has heard no sound in the room since the usual hour for retiring last night . " " She ca n't be asleep at this hour , " said Mrs. Delancey , looking up from the morning paper . A sudden thought seemed to strike the merchant , and starting to his feet , he hurried away to his daughter 's apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried the door , but it was locked . " Go , " said he , to a servant standing near , " and bring me the brass key lying on my dressing-table ; it fits this lock . " The key was brought , and Mr. Delancey entered the room , closing the door behind him . All was silence and loneliness around him . He called his daughter 's name , there was no responsive voice ; he rushed to her sleeping-apartment , but the luxurious couch , unrumpled and unpressed , told it had known no occupant during the night . The balcony , the garden , belonging to her rooms , all were searched , but in vain ; and the agonized father threw himself upon the chair Della had so often occupied , with all the terrible truth rushing across his heart . He buried his pallid face in his hands , and wept ; aye , wept hot , burning tears , from those steady eyes that had never wept for another 's woe , and rarely for his own . There was no note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of her flight , but he knew all without ; and bitter , bitter was the crushing weight upon his mighty pride . He sent word to Mrs. Delancey , that she would breakfast without him ; and two hours passed before he again stood in the presence of his anxious wife . None might know what fearful storms , what blighting whirlwinds , what earthquakes of passion , had passed over that strong heart in those two short hours . However fierce had been the struggle , it had been conquered , not by prayer and pleading at that Throne whence all mercy flows , but by the unbending power of that strong , indomitable will . When he broke the news to Mrs. Delancey , the voice was calm and quiet , and no signs of emotion were visible . But with his wife it was different . She shrieked , and screamed , and tore her hair , and wept with a wild violence ; Mr. Delancey looked upon her anguish with those same cold eyes ; and when she went off in a fit of violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own room , and then drove off to the store , as though nothing had happened . But what a hidden fire was scorching up the heart within ! Shame and sorrow , remorse and wounded pride , all struggling and battling there , with their volcanic fires striving to burst forth , but smothered and kept down by the strength of the proud heart they lacerated . Arrived at the store , he seemed to take no notice of Wilkins ' absence , but went straight to his own high desk , and sat there with his eyes looking out of the door before him . Those who knew the result of the morning trial pitied him deeply , wondering at the calmness he displayed ; but Guly , who knew how much more he had suffered by the flight of his only daughter , and sole remaining child , felt for him a deep and earnest sympathy which he longed to , but dared not , express . Suddenly the merchant rose in his seat . " Gulian Pratt , if disengaged I would like to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was with a heart bounding forebodingly , for he remembered he had been chiefly instrumental in getting his son convicted , and he fancied that the merchant was about to discharge him . He saw that Mr. Delancey looked ten years older than when he had seen him in the morning , and with a gush of sympathy in his warm heart , he gained the merchant 's side and extended his hand . Mr. Delancey took it , and for the first time pressed it kindly . " Pardon me , sir , for touching upon a painful subject , but allow me to express the sincere sympathy I feel for you . " The merchant bowed , and for an instant both were silent , Mr. Delancey sitting with his eyes looking down . " I sent for you , " said he at last , speaking very quietly , and in a measured tone , " to ask you if you think yourself capable of filling the -- the vacant place yonder ? " " The head clerk 's . " " The same . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blushing ; " even though I were capable -- which I think I am not -- it might give rise to dissatisfaction among the other clerks . " " As for the dissatisfaction , that is my business . Did you ever study book-keeping ? " " I have , sir . " " Know something about it ? " " Something , sir . " " Then take your place at the desk yonder , and consider the situation and the salary yours . " Guly was utterly astonished . It was something so far from his expectations -- a promotion he had only aspired to in the future ; and to receive such unexpected good fortune was something for which he felt deeply grateful , and he told the merchant so . But , as Guly was moving away , a sudden thought crossed his mind , and with a glance of sorrow , not for himself , but for the bereaved father , he said : " Mr. Delancey , I fear if you knew all you would not feel disposed to do this for me . There are some circumstances I would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still feel thus inclined , I shall take the situation , feeling that I have acted honestly with you . " " Whatever you wish to say , speak ; I am ready to listen . " " Last night I was there , " said the boy , hesitatingly , scarcely knowing how to tell it ; " I saw them married -- in the old Cathedral -- Mr . Wilkins and --  " " Enough ! " said the merchant ; starting violently ; then with an effort regaining his calmness , " do n't speak that name in my presence , ever . How came you , young man , to be present at a ceremony you knew was without my sanction or knowledge , and utterly against my will ? " " I knew nothing of the circumstances , sir , before hand ; not even aware I was to witness a marriage ceremony till after I reached the Cathedral . But I like Mr. Wilkins -- have been a warm friend of his since I 've been here , and when I found he was to be married , I officiated with pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? " " No , sir , not till afterwards -- just as they were about to leave ; but when I found out the truth , I did congratulate my friend most heartily , for I deem him worthy of any lady in the land , and rejoiced to see him happy . " " And they seemed happy . Oh , curses on them ! " " Nay , do not curse them . Your daughter 's view of happiness was but different from your own , and she has seen fit to follow it out . She shed many tears , no doubt , for her father ; but she smiled also many times upon her husband , and I know must have felt much sorrow mingled with her joy . Had she but gone with her father 's blessing , how unalloyed would her happiness have been . " " He took her for her fortune ; curse him , I say ! Not a cent of mine shall he ever touch . When poverty falls upon her head , she 'll think of what she 's lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fearful thing , " said Guly with a shudder . Mr. Delancey suddenly drew himself up as if just aware that he had been betrayed into saying a great deal more than he ever intended to , and at the same time cast a look of mute wonder upon Guly , who stood with his eyes fixed upon his face . It was rarely that any one dared to approach the merchant , ( at least any of his subordinates , ) as , cold and stern , he sat at his high desk during business hours , and none ever thought of differing from his opinions , or advancing any of their own . Guly 's courage astonished him . " Go to your place , young man . " " My old place , I suppose , sir . " " Did n't I tell you to take the head clerk 's ? what I say I mean . Do your best , and I shall be satisfied . I have no more daughters to lose , " he muttered as he looked after Guly 's retreating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blush , Guly took his place at Wilkins ' desk , to the no small surprise of the clerks , but the first moment that the store was clear of customers , Mr. Delancey rose up , and formally stated that henceforth Gulian Pratt would occupy the situation of head clerk , and he hoped that all would look up to and respect him as such , and having delivered this speech in his peculiar formal manner , the merchant left , and drove home to dinner . Guly 's promotion gave general satisfaction , and as he sat there with his young face and golden curls bent over the great books , not an eye sought his , but had a warm glance of congratulation in it , and many pressed forward to express in words their gratification at the new arrangement . Now that Quirk was gone , not one in the establishment but loved and respected Guly ; and , though there were many there older , who might perhaps more fitly have filled the important vacancy , all felt that it was held by one whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform the onerous duties resting upon him . Guly , henceforth , occupied Wilkins ' room with Arthur . Mr. Hull took Guly 's old place , and a new clerk filled his own , and soon everything was again smoothly jogging on at No.  --  Chartres Street . CHAPTER XXXV . " ' T is but the just reward of merit that I give . " Old Play . It was New Year 's eve , and the brilliantly-lighted shops were thronged with purchasers of the innumerable articles exposed to tempt the purses of those able to buy . Any one who has been in New Orleans during the winter season , knows what a scene the thronged streets present on this night of nights . Guly stood in the store-door , looking out upon the crowd of passers-by , when suddenly a liveried servant approached him from the mass , looked at him a moment intently , then thrust a small box in his hands , and disappeared . Surprised at the occurrence , Guly turned away , and waiting until the store was clear of customers , opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought and elaborately finished . Puzzled to know what it could mean , Guly was about to restore it to the box , when a small folded paper in the bottom caught his eye . It was directed to himself , and on unfolding it , Guly found but these simple words : " To him who never sacrifices principle to profit . " Guly immediately remembered that the lady to whom he had pointed out the blemishes in her purchase , and thereby lost a sale , had never been in the store since ; but that she remembered the occurrence distinctly and gratefully was evident . The boy had noticed the servant 's livery and now recognized it , and hoped that this might afford him some clue to the name of his kind friend . As soon as the store was closed he put his present in his pocket , and started forth to show it to Blanche . Arthur was so rarely in the store any more at evening , that he could not talk it over with him , and with light steps he hurried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the boy 's existence , and he could dream of nothing else . He was young to love , but his heart was older than his years , and it gave out its affection with the strength of manhood . " Oh ! grandpapa , if you could only see Guly 's gift , his New Year 's gift ! " said Blanche , enthusiastically , after examining it herself . The old man smiled , and taking it in his hand , held it for awhile and returned it , saying it was very beautiful . " And have you no clue to the giver ? " said Blanche . " Only what I told you . " " What did you say was the servant 's livery ? " Guly described it . " I remember a lady , " said Blanche , musingly , " whose servants used to wear such livery as that . She was a dear friend of mamma 's when we were rich , and they used to be just like sisters . Her name was Belmont -- Mrs . Belmont . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , she went to France just before all our troubles came upon us , and I suppose she is there still . She wrote once or twice to mamma , but she was too ill to answer the letters , and so it all dropped . " Guly put up his watch , and sat conversing with Blanche until the clock struck ten , when he took his leave , telling Blanche , as he pressed her little hand at parting , that it was the most delightful New Year 's eve he had ever spent . Blanche replied that she could say the same , and added that she supposed he knew Della and Bernard had returned . Guly informed her he did not . " Oh , yes , " she said , " returned yesterday , and have taken a house in Esplanade Street , and are very happy I think . Della visited me , yesterday . " Guly expressed his pleasure at the good news , and left her , and returned home to dream of the mysterious donor of his New Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly away ; summer passed , and winter came again . Fortunately for the brothers , the first summer of their stay in the Pestilential City was free from epidemics of any kind , and they escaped all sickness , with the exception of a slight acclimating fever . All that Guly had to weigh upon his heart was Arthur 's dissipation , which gradually grew worse and worse , and he dreaded lest one day he should have the pain of seeing Mr. Delancey discharge him . Guly had retained the new situation which had been given him , and discharged its duties with honor to himself and to his employer . There was not a clerk in the store but what looked up to him with respect and affection , and since he had become head clerk there had never been a bottle of wine uncorked or a game of cards played under that roof . Mr. Delancey himself , with all his natural coldness and harshness of manner , could not conceal the high esteem in which he held him . Guly frequently spent his evenings at Wilkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not conceal from himself that those evenings that Arthur went with him were not the pleasantest , there being always a restraint in his presence , which was not felt when he was not there . Wilkins had always rejoiced at Guly 's good fortune in obtaining his vacant situation , and loved to sit by him and talk over the past or chat about Blanche and the happy future . The evening after the brothers had been visiting at Wilkins ' , Arthur passed his arm through Guly 's , and said : " I have quite lost my heart , Guly , with a pair of the brightest black eyes that ever shone ; she 's a pretty little witch , but I am afraid some one has stepped in before me , for I ca n't contrive to make myself agreeable , and every time I call she grows more and more distant . She lives but a little way from here ; what say you to making a call with me ? perhaps you could assist me immeasurably . What say you , will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a confidant of Guly , and the younger brother was surprised to find him in such a mood to-night . He had , on his part , with a caution he could scarcely define , always studiously concealed from Arthur his visits to Blanche , and had not sought his confidence lest he might see fit to ask for his own in return ; and he answered almost coldly : " No , Arthur , not to-night . It is already late , and I hope you would n't think of calling upon any young lady at such an hour as this . " " Well , what can I do to pass the time between this and bed-time ? " " It is bed-time now , Arthur ; but I 'll tell you what to do . Mr. Hull has gone out to the opera to-night , and if we go back to the store we can be there by ourselves . Let 's go and do what we have not done in a long , long time -- sit down together like the two brothers we once were , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ; will you do so ? " After a moment 's hesitation , Arthur signified his consent , and they went into the store together . Guly raked up the dying coals in the stove , threw on some fresh anthracite , and they sat down side by side . " Oh ! " exclaimed Guly , laying his hand upon his brother 's , " Arthur does n't this make your heart bound ? There is such a glow of home about it , such an air of other days . " Arthur sighed deeply . " There is , indeed , Guly ; this is a socialness which we have not shared before for months , and never may again . " " Why do you speak so despondingly , Arthur ? The brightness or blackness of the future lies with ourselves , I am inclined to think ; and since we can be so happy in each others society , why should we do ought to prevent our constantly having this enjoyment ? " " You never will , Guly ; it is me , all me -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear myself away from the bonds which are dragging me down to destruction ; evil companions , strong drink , and exciting play . Excitement is now necessary to my existence . I can not live without it . This is why we have no more of this kind of enjoyment . To-night I relish it because I 'm in the humor ; but as a general thing it is unbearable -- too tame and prosy . " " Oh ! " exclaimed Guly , " I have so often felt that the day we left the Hudson home was a fatal one for us . I had rather have staid there and toiled in the most humble manner , than to have ever heard such words as these pass your lips , and in my heart be forced to feel their truth . " " It is useless to repine , Guly . Perhaps ' t is all for the best . Sometimes when I have looked upon your calm and tranquil face , and noted the high principles which have governed your every action , I have felt as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but again I have thought , perhaps you could not have been thus sustained had it not been for my fearful example , such a terrible , terrible lesson in itself of an undisciplined and erring heart . " Guly was silent . If this thought could afford his brother any consolation for the downward course he had been pursuing , it was not in his heart to deprive him of it , however much he might feel the reasoning to be false . " I can never go back again , " continued Arthur , " to what I once was . If this were possible , I might , perhaps , endeavor to reform ; but I am so deeply steeped in sin , that its memory will be haunting me always , always ; and it is useless for me to strive to do aught but drown life and memory in the same cup . " " Wrong reasoning , my brother , wrong reasoning , " said Guly , impressively , laying his hand on Arthur 's arm ; but he could say no more , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sat looking into the coals , struggling to keep down his rising emotions . Reaching out his hand , Arthur clasped Guly 's in his and held it closely . Thus they sat side by side once again , heart to heart , and hand in hand . The bright fire-glow played and flickered on their thoughtful faces as they called up old memories and thought of old scenes ; while the coals faded and died out -- fit emblems of the dreams they were dreaming . CHAPTER XXXVI . " Oh ! how this tyrant doubt torments my breast ! My thoughts , like birds , who , frightened from their nest , Around the place where all was hushed before , Flutter , and hardly nestle any more . " Otway . From this night , Arthur 's course was more swiftly downward than ever it had been before . It seemed as if the last redeeming moment of his life was passed , and that some strong arm was hurrying him fiercely forward into the blackened pit of which he had dreamed one night long ago , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his hand ! Every succeeding night plunged him deeper beneath the waves of that sea of dissipation upon which he had thrown himself . Theatres , dissolute balls , the gambling saloon and billiard table , each with their attendant quantity of exciting drinks , were his constant places of resort ; and though Guly pleaded , and prayed him to renounce them forever , and come back to his old ways , ' t was in vain . The Demon of Remorse was gnawing at his heart-strings for the crime he had committed , and pride , that fatal pride , was stinging him into silence and misery , withholding him from confessing , even to his Maker , his sorrow and repentance . He had given his right hand to the Evil One , and his left there was none to take . Every morning , as Mr. Delancey 's keen eyes searched that haggard and bloated face , Guly expected to hear him dismissed ; but as yet that trial came not , and Guly felt that it was for his sake the merchant spared his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never to be forgotten . One night after the store was closed , Arthur sauntered up to Guly , and , laying his hand upon his arm , said : " You remember the little black-eyed Creole I told you of one night some time ago ? " " The one you fancied had got your heart ? " said Guly , kindly ; " yes , I remember . " " Three nights ago , I proposed to her , offered her heart and hand , and told her , what was truth , that I loved her dearly , and , do you believe , she refused me flatly . " " She proved herself more prudent than you , Arthur . You should have known better than to ask a young girl to be your wife , when you have nothing , and will keep nothing , to support her . " I 'll risk the support , " returned Arthur , with a short laugh , " if she had consented we could have managed to live , I fancy ; and had we failed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur cast a meaning , but half-mirthful glance at Guly , who , seeing that even then he was half intoxicated , shrunk away , not wishing to prolong the conversation . " Do you know what I am going to do ? " continued Arthur , again looking up . " Nothing wrong , I hope , Arthur . " " You may think so . Since I ca n't get her by fair means , I 'm bound to get her by foul ; that 's what I 'm going to do . " " For pity 's sake , my brother , if the girl is good and innocent do not wrong her ; there are enough ready to gratify your idle whims , without robbing the pure and happy of their peace . Where does she live ? " " Perhaps you think I 'll tell you that , and have you play the defender ? Ah , I 've got my senses yet . " " How did you get acquainted , and where ? " " How ? By my own natural conversational powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the first place , where I was so fortunate as to meet her just as she had dropped one of a number of parcels of herb medicine she was carrying . I had the pleasure of picking it up for her , and of relieving her of some of her load . Thus I found out where she lived , and then took it upon myself to call again ; but she has n't seemed to like me from the first -- hang her pretty eyes ; but I 'll be revenged for her refusal -- see if I 'm not . " " Let me beg of you to give up this cruel idea , Arthur . Shame upon you for harboring it for a single moment . " " Pooh ! " said Arthur , scoffingly , " it 's no use talking , I shall embrace the first opportunity . " Guly turned away heart-sick ; he felt it was useless arguing the matter , and knew that had not Arthur been half intoxicated at the time , he would never have given him so much of his confidence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him unless it was when extra draughts of wine had taken all restraint from his tongue . It being the busy season of the year , Guly had of late been so confined to business that it had been impossible for him to slip away and visit Blanche as he had done formerly . Occasionally , he had written her a note and sent it by his friend the dwarf , making such errands the occasion of a round remuneration to the miserable cripple . He would always hobble his way back after performing the errand , although the walk was long , to say to Guly : " Hih , hih , Monsieur , but she 's a beauty , one of her pretty smiles is as good as a picayune to me ; bless her heart ; I think , Monsieur , she make you very happy one of these days when you both get old enough for the priest to pronounce you man and wife ; hih , hih , that I do . " These were honest words ; the dwarf meant every syllable of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , and sometimes an additional bit of silver , had nothing to do with calling them out , however joyfully such tokens were received . The second evening after Guly 's conversation with Arthur , the former stood in the store door waiting anxiously for the customers to leave that he might " close up " and visit Blanche . Arthur had already gone out , and he felt a nervous and anxious dread for which he could not account , and which made him all the more eager to be free . As he stood thus , he felt some one sieze the hand which was hanging at his side , and looking down , beheld Richard the dwarf . " Hih ! hih ! Monsieur , very long walk , very much tired . She looks more beautiful than ever to-night , though she sheds very much tears . She say to me to-day , when I went by : ' Come to me to-night , Richard , grandpapa is very ill ; I may have a message to send by you . ' So to-night I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she come out , cry very much , and tell me give you this . " Guly took the little note the dwarf handed up to him , and hastened up to the light to read it . It merely stated that her grandpapa was very , very ill , and begged him to get word to Mr. Wilkins and sister Della , who were her only friends , beside himself , and old Eliza who gave her medicine for her poor sick grandpapa . After he had read the characteristic and simple little note , Guly slipped a piece of money into Richard 's hand , thanking him warmly for the service he had done him , and the little man swung himself away , talking pleasantly to himself as he went . It was late before it was possible to shut the store , but the moment he could do so , Guly did ; and then with a sinking heart took his way to Wilkins ' house . Della and Wilkins were sitting by the grate when he entered , while Minny sat on a low stool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round arm thrown caressingly over Della 's lap . It seemed too bright a picture to be disturbed , and Guly , who had entered unannounced , stood looking at it a moment before he did so . The moment he told his errand , Della begged Wilkins to go and do all he could , to take Minny with him , and to give Blanche her dear love , and tell her she would have gone herself had she not felt too much indisposed . Minny tied on her hat , threw a light shawl about her shoulders , and started away with Wilkins and Guly at a rapid pace . The moon was shining brightly , and as they walked briskly on , their shadows fell long and slender , marching on before them . They had approached within a few blocks of the house , when Guly 's attention was attracted by the appearance of some dark object on the opposite side of the way , going slowly along in the shadow of the buildings , and evidently seeking concealment . With his curiosity awakened , he pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter of an adjacent doorway , they crossed the narrow street to discover if possible what it was . As they approached , the object moved more quickly , but they soon drew near enough to see it was a female form , borne in the arms of a stout negro , and Arthur . As they passed an opening between two houses , the moonlight streamed down full upon the upturned face of the girl they were carrying , exposing her features clearly to Wilkins and his companion . " Blanche ! my own Blanche ! " Uttering these words , Guly sprang wildly forward . Arthur , finding he could not escape , turned short round and met him face to face . The brothers grappled ; all of Guly 's meekness and forbearance was merged in the base insult which had been offered her he loved , and he seemed for the time gifted with almost superhuman strength . The struggle was brief ; and Arthur was flung heavily upon the pavement . In an instant Blanche , whom Wilkins had released from the negro 's grasp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur managed to pick himself up , and slunk away into the shadows , leaving Blanche with her defenders . From that night the bonds of sympathy were broken between the brothers ; and each trod his chosen path almost unheeded by the other . " Tell me , Blanche , " said Guly , as , rejoining Minny , they proceeded to her grandfather 's house , " how this happened . What took you away from the sick-bed to be exposed to the craft of bad men ? " " Oh , I was so anxious and so unhappy , " said Blanche , weeping bitterly , " I feared grandpapa would die before any of you came . I left Lilah , the little girl you sent me , Mr. Wilkins , to watch by grandpapa while I ran down the piazza steps to see if you were coming . The moment I reached the last step , that horrid negro threw his arm about me . I struggled and tried to scream , but the other forced a gag in my mouth , and carried me off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent you , dear Guly , to save me , and you , Mr. Wilkins , for the second time . This same bad man has hung about here for a week or more ; but I have always tried to elude him , because I believed him wicked , though he pretended to love me and all that . " Guly shuddered as he felt it must have been Blanche of whom Arthur had spoken a few evenings before ; but he said nothing , and stood once more in the little room where many times they had been so happy together . The old man 's easy chair was empty now , and from an inner room came low faint moans of suffering . Blanche hurried to the bedside , and stood bending over her grandfather , weeping bitterly . It was evident his hours were numbered , and they all gathered round , silent and tearful , to see the old man die . Blanche stood on one side of the bed , with Minny by her side , and Guly and Wilkins directly opposite . Slowly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his effort to get air , the dying man threw out his arms upon the coverlet . His hands met those of Blanche and Guly , as they rested on the bedside . It might have been accident , but the trembling fingers clasped them tightly , and with a last effort folded them together above him . There came a shiver , a faint moan , and the grandsire was dead , with his chilling fingers still folding those two young hands together . There seemed to be no bounds to Blanche 's grief , and it was with the greatest difficulty she could be persuaded to leave for a moment the corpse of her grandfather . When she was at last induced to do so , Wilkins sent for an undertaker and had the body fitly prepared for its last resting-place . Finding that Blanche would not think of taking a moments rest , or of remaining away from the corpse , Wilkins , and Guly , and Minny remained with her in that lonely and desolate room , where the shadow of death hung so darkly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows , robbing the chamber of some of its darkness and gloom . It was not thought advisable to keep the body long , and the next afternoon the funeral took place . Guly attended it , as did Wilkins ' family , and a few of Blanche 's Creole neighbors . When the last sad rites were over , Guly attended Blanche back to her lonely home . Wilkins kindly offered her a home in his house , an offer which Della warmly seconded ; but Blanche had sufficient tact to see that Wilkins was poor , and had no little difficulty to support his own family comfortably , and she gratefully declined his invitation , stating there was much that required her attention for the present at home , but that she would soon visit them . When she returned to the old spot , endeared to her by so many fond associations , her grief again burst forth , and Guly drawing a chair to her side strove to soothe and comfort her . He could not leave her there without telling how deeply and truly he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how earnestly he desired that love should be returned . Placing both her hands in his , Blanche told him in her own frank , innocent way , how dearly she loved him in return , and how fondly she had thought of him since the first day they ever met , and that she would never love any one else , never , never . " And one of these days when I am a man , and have a nice little home to offer you , you will be my own dear little wife . Blanche , you promise ? " " I promise , Guly , I could never be happy as the dear little wife of any one else , and when you say , ' Blanche , I want you now , ' then Blanche is yours . " Guly pressed her to his heart and they plighted troth . This was but boy and girl love , but it was a love which decayed not , neither did it fade , but flourished and grew , even with the hand of sorrow and trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will fortune never come with both hands full , But write her fair words still in fairest letters ? She either gives a stomach and no food --  Such are the poor in wealth ; or else a feast , And takes away the stomach -- such are the rich , That have abundance , and enjoy it not . " Shakspeare . Della sat rocking by the fire , looking pale and ill , and Bernard was fondly hanging over her chair . Minny sat a little way apart , holding upon her lap the first-born babe -- a boy --  " the darling of their een . " Never was a happier father , never a prouder and more delighted mother . " Bernard , " said Della , looking up in her husband 's face , " I have a plan to propose . " " What is it , dearest ? " " Will you grant it ? " " Perhaps . " " Well , I think that now little Bernard is old enough to do a little while without me , and what I have to propose is , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to regain my health , which you know is sadly impaired , while Minny stays home , and takes care of you , and plays mother to baby ; what say you ? " " And leave me a widower ? " " Just a little while . " " And why not take the boy and Minny with you ? " " Oh , that would never do . Must leave my cares behind , when I go for my health , you know . " " Poor child ! it seems strange to hear you talking of cares , you who were born to so much wealth and luxury . " " Hush , hush ! you mus n't talk so . Happy cares mine are , and you know it , though not just the ones to take with me on a visit . Now confess , that you never knew a happier little wife than yours , or a more joyous little household than ours . " " True , in spite of our poverty . " " Yes , in spite of everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the possession of it . " " Yet you want to run away from us all ! " " Yes , since you will have it so ; do you consent ? " " Submissively . " It was so arranged , then , that Della should leave on one of the evening up-river boats , and the rest of the day was spent in the hurry and bustle of preparation . Though Minny had felt really unhappy at the idea of being left alone with Bernard , toward whom she stood in such a peculiar relation , she studiously concealed her feelings from Della , not wishing to mar the bright anticipations in which she was indulging ; and , smothering her own forebodings , hoped for the best . The parting hour arrived , and with many charges , and tears , and warnings , Della clung to her husband and her baby , regretting , even at the last moment , that she had made up her mind to part with them . " Dear Bernard , I leave Minny in your charge ; take precious care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave with you , dearest -- my boy and dear Minny . You must be mother and sister till I come back . " " I will , love ; truly is my charge a sacred one . " " Good-bye , my treasures . " " Good-bye . " She passed out to the carriage . " Send Minny to me once again , Bernard . " Minny came . Della threw her arms around her , and pressed her to her heart . " I never parted from you before , dear Minny , and I can scarcely give you up . Were it not that health demanded it , and a narrow purse forbade our both going , this would have never been . There ! do n't cry , Minny ; when we meet , it will be never to part again . " Was there prophecy in those parting words ? As the carriage rolled away , Minny stood holding the heavy black curls from her brow , gazing earnestly after it as long as she could see Della 's white handkerchief waving her adieu ; then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babe from its father 's arms , and entered the house . Bernard was a good husband to Della , and loved her as dearly as it was possible for him to love . But his marriage with her had not bettered his fortunes , and he was a poor man . This sometimes induced him to indulge in his old habits , in spite of Della 's remonstrances , and tearful assurances that they were rich enough , and surely very happy , if he would n't follow these bad practices . He occasionally played high , in the hope of mending his purse , and then drank deep , to drown his disappointment . Several times since their marriage , he had gone home in such a state as this ; but , every time , Della 's unfeigned distress had called forth an earnest promise of amendment , which at the time he had faithfully meant to fulfill . But now Della was gone , and her restraining influence gone with her . She had been absent but a few days , when one night Bernard stayed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , arranged the latch-key so that he might enter , and taking the baby in her arms , retired with him to her own room . She had but just laid the child upon his pillow when she heard his fathers step upon the stairs . She knew instantly , by its unsteadiness , that he was intoxicated . She did not disrobe , but , sitting down beside the bed , listened with painful anxiety to hear him go quietly to rest in his own room . She sat almost breathless , while a thrilling and undefinable dread crept through her whole frame . The steps went slowly on , she heard them pass into Della 's chamber , linger there a moment , and then , oh , horror ! they were directed straight toward her door . They came on , in their wavering unsteadiness , and , with a sudden impulse , Minny sprang to the bed , thinking to catch up his sleeping son , and meet him in the hall ; but ere she could carry out her design Bernard had reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His blood-shot eyes , his flushed face , and trembling hand , as he held the lamp before him , all bore evidence of the excitement under which he labored . " So , so , pretty one , how do you progress in playing mother , eh ? " " Very well , " replied Minny , with forced calmness . " Did you come to look after him ? " " Look after him ? no , I did n't ; I knew he was doing well enough ; I came to look after you . " " Is there anything you want , which I can get you , " said Minny , approaching the door , and laying her hand on the knob . " No , my beauty , " returned the other , placing his back against the door , and turning the key in the lock , while he placed his lamp on the table beside him , " there 's nothing I want which you can get me , but there 's something I want which you can give me , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , and motioned for her to come and sit upon his knee . Minny grew deathly pale , and laid her hand upon her heart , to still its tumultuous throbbing . There was no way of escape ; the window was too high from the ground , and the door was locked , and her persecutor had the key . Striving to conceal her agitation , she said , as quietly as she could :  --  " I can not give you that , Bernard ; such manifestations on your part , you should remember , belong to your wife and child . " " And is n't the mother of my boy my wife ? and did you not just confess you were his mother ? " " In the absence of his rightful mother , I have striven to fill her place ; and if you choose to look upon me in such a light , show me the respect which is my due . Leave my room , sir ! " " By Jove , girl , you are saucy ; come here , and sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , but all the prettier for that . Come . " Minny rose up , with her face ashy pale , and stood in her calm womanly dignity before him . " Are you not ashamed to show a defenceless woman such an outrage , in your own house ? I have seen the time when Bernard Wilkins would have scorned so cowardly an act as this . " " That was when he had drank less wine , and lost less gold ; come , there is no use in parleying , come here by me . " He started forward , and grasping her rudely by the wrist , drew her toward him . Minny struggled wildly , but his hold was firm . " Oh ! " she exclaimed , as with a violent effort she wrenched her wrist from his grasp , " for Heaven 's sake , Bernard , remember what is due to your absent wife , what belongs to yourself , what in duty bound you owe to me . Think of your innocent babe , and be a man once more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonsense , girl ; have n't I a right here ? Did n't I marry you once , and does n't that make my presence here proper and right ? Have you forgotten that ? " " No , never ! but you forgot it . You made the bonds , which united us , illegal , and took to your heart another bride . You have forgotten this , too , it would seem , or you would not thus insult me . I am no more to you now than if those days had never been . " " Zounds ! my pretty one , we think differently on that score , " said Wilkins , throwing his arms about her slender waist . " Let go your hold this instant ! " cried Minny , " or I will shriek for help , and expose you to the neighborhood . " " Shriek as loud as you choose , " returned the now determined man ; " who , do you suppose , will hear ? Scream , and let me see how well you can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung herself upon her knees before him , and clasped her hands upon her breast . " Oh , Bernard , have mercy ! " " Yield , then . " " Never ! " " By Heaven , then , I will make you . " Tightening his clasp about her with one arm , with the other he drew a pistol from his side-pocket , and presented it at her forehead . " How now ? " " Oh , Bernard , is this the sacred charge that Della left you ? " " Do you give up ? " " No , no ! with my latest breath , no ! " " Then I shall fire . " " Fire , then ! here is my heart , fire ! I would sooner die a thousand deaths , than have my mistress think I was so base a thing as you would make me . You never shall dishonor her while Minny has power to prevent it . " Surely a demon had crept into Bernard 's heart , as he stood an instant , with fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt in all her fearful beauty before him . He seemed to have lost entirely all control over himself , and with excited mien listened to the echo of those last words . It was but a second 's pause , yet it embraced an eternity ; the fatal trigger was drawn , by an impulse he could not withstand , and Minny fell backward on the floor , with her long curls falling round her like a pall . The ball had entered just beneath her chin , glanced , and lodged in her right side . It was a most ghastly wound , and as the blood poured from it , over the snow-white dress , and trickled slowly along the floor , Bernard stood gazing upon it like one petrified . His eyes opened wide with horror , his limbs grew rigid , his very hair seemed to rise up , in the intense agony of the moment . The pistol dropped from his extended hand , and he fell upon his knees beside his victim , completely sobered , and awakened to the full magnitude of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minny ! I have been the curse of your life-time ; a shadow , mingling with all your sunlight ; fearful , fearful is the retribution cast from your dying spirit upon mine . Forgive me , oh , forgive me ! " Suddenly , with the last remnant of strength gathered to speak once more , her small hands were raised convulsively , and placed in Bernard 's , while her dark eyes , softened , and even more beautiful in their death-hour than ever before , sought his face . " God forgive you , Bernard , as I this moment forgive you all , all . To your wife , Bernard , your Della , henceforth be faithful ; be true to her , love her , cherish her , guard her as your life . Do this , and the shadow of this hour will rest ever on your heart holily . " " I promise ; as God hears me , I promise . " There was a faint pressure from the hand he held , the lips moved , but gave out no sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clasping in his own the cold hands of the murdered Minny ! CHAPTER XXXVIII . " Adversity , sage , useful guest , Severe instructor , but the best ; It is from thee alone , we know Justly to value things below . " Somerville . Roused at last from the stupor in which he fallen , Wilkins rose from the floor , and taking his infant son in his arms , went out and told the neighbors what had occurred . Leaving his child with a friend living near by , he next went in search of a coroner , and returned with him to the house . All this Bernard did calmly , quietly , almost like one in a dream , with no thought for his own safety , no idea of danger to himself . The coroner was a gentleman well known to Bernard , acquainted with both the good and bad traits of his nature . In looking upon the corpse he readily understood the whole matter , and pitied the unfortunate murderer , even more than the beautiful victim . A jury was summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accidental discharge of a pistol , in the hands of Bernard Wilkins . " The sincere and unaffected sorrow which Bernard evinced , served to corroborate this statement , and if any guessed , none knew , the real truth . Della was sent for , and came hastily . Though almost overwhelmed at the terrible death of her favorite , she spoke no word of reproach , uttered no sentence of reproof , to that husband , who , it was plainly evident , suffered immeasurably . Della 's own hands prepared Minny 's body for the tomb . She robed her in one of her own dresses -- an India mull , of spotless white , and folded the tiny hands below the exquisite bust , clasping a few pale flowers . The fatal ball had left the face uninjured , and the wound beneath her chin was skillfully concealed . The eyes were closed perfectly and naturally . The lips , yet red and full , slightly parted over the pearly teeth , as if with a smile , and the long black curls floated gracefully down the fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one would have deemed her sleeping . As long as it was possible , Della kept the body unentombed . The news of the fearful death had spread over a goodly portion of the city , and hundreds came to look upon the corpse , and turned away with wet cheeks , declaring it the loveliest sight they had ever looked upon . The day of burial arrived at last , and , bending over the coffin , Della , with raining tears , pressed her lips for the last time upon the brow of that being , who had been faithful to her , even to death . The long concourse moved slowly away . Guly walked at Wilkins ' side . As the boy glanced upon that pale face once more , before the tomb closed upon it for ever , the memory of the first time he ever saw her , came back upon his mind -- the time when , with the wild glitter in her eye , he had seen her strike Wilkins that fearful blow , and rush shudderingly past him into the darkness . On returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door , and its owner within , conversing with his wife . She had not gone out to the burial on account of her child , who was not well . The General seemed overjoyed to find Della the happy wife and mother , which , under such sad circumstances , she appeared . He told them how eagerly he had searched the city over , in the hopes of finding them , since their marriage , but had signally failed , until the papers , in recording the fearful event which had just passed , had given him some clue to their whereabouts , which he had immediately followed up . " I am now , " said he , " on the eve of starting for Europe . America has no tie of kindred for me ; I 've not a relative living in all this broad land , and I shall launch myself upon the waves of the Atlantic to-morrow , no doubt for the last time , before sinking into the vast ocean of eternity , whose waves are ever loudly beating on the shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic ground ; and to have my grave swept by those breezes which have fanned the brows of the great masters , whose works I have loved . Thus , I shall die happy . Sometimes , " said he , taking Della 's hand , and smiling upon her the same smile which had so lightened her heart months before , " sometimes give a thought to the old man , whose bones will drop to dust in foreign lands , but who , to the latest hour of his existence , will cherish his love and fond remembrance of you . " With one more earnest pressure of the hand , he bade them farewell ; and with sad hearts , Della and her husband waved back his last adieu , and saw him pass from their sight , for the last time , for ever . Upon turning to re-enter the house , a folded paper , lying on the table where the General 's hat had stood , attracted Della 's attention . She found it directed to herself , and upon opening it found it contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city banks , left for her as a parting gift from him , who , though he could not be her husband , had proved himself her friend . " Oh , Bernard ! " exclaimed Della , as she realized the fortune which had so unexpectedly fallen to her lot ; " let us at once leave this place . We have no friends here . My parents , who have disowned me , I have n't even the claim of love upon ; and there are no ties , save Minny 's grave , and the friendship of a few constant hearts , to bind us here . These , sooner or later , must be broken at last , and I would rather seek some home , wherein to spend the residue of our days , free from the sad associations which cluster here . " To this proposition Bernard consented ; and immediate preparations were made to depart for the Isle of Cuba , that gem of the Antilles , whose sparkling lustre has won the admiration of the world . Before their departure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's remains . The design was simple and elegant , and the marble as pure as the cold young heart it covered . It bore the simple inscription :  --  " MY SISTER . " Della proposed to Bernard , now that they were so abundantly able , to offer a home to the friendless Blanche , and let her be as a sister to them . Accompanied by Guly , who was still Wilkins ' warmest friend , they went to the little house , to offer this proposition to the beautiful brodeuse . To the utter astonishment of all , and to Guly 's chagrin and despair , they found the house deserted , the door closed , and the familiar card , " To Let , " swinging from the upper balcony . Blanche was gone , none knew whither . Della and Bernard waited several days , in the hope of hearing something of their young friend ; but thwarted in their generous desire , they at last left the city , bidding an affectionate farewell to Guly , who stood upon the levee , watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till lost to his aching sight . They bought a delightful country residence , near the city of Havana , and established themselves there , in the heart of a pleasant neighborhood , and were soon surrounded by warm and faithful friends . Bernard Wilkins became an altered man . His habits of dissipation were broken for ever ; and he remained a faithful husband and happy father . Thus , performing his promises to the dying Minny , her departing words were fulfilled ; and the shadow of her last hour rested on his heart ever holily -- holily ! CHAPTER XXXIX . " And there we shall have our feasts of tears , And many a cup in silence pour ; Our guests , the shades of former years , Our toasts , to lips that bloom no more . " Tom Moore . Weeks passed away , and Guly , in spite of all his earnest endeavors , heard nothing more of Blanche . A strange mystery seemed , as it were , suddenly to have swallowed her up , and left no trace . Summer came again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequent in that ill-fated city . Cholera was spreading itself broad-cast among rich and poor , the humble and the high alike . Hundreds were weekly being swept into their yawning tombs , and it seemed as if the city most surely must be devastated . Nurses could not be procured to care for the sick ; and the dead-carts went gloomily through the silent streets , groaning beneath their fearful load of death , all the day long , while the grave-yards yawned constantly , as though their hunger never could be appeased . Several of Mr. Delancey 's clerks had died , and others had fled the pestilence , but Arthur and Guly still remained ; the one , in order to gain enough to carry on his career of dissipation , the other , from a high sense of duty , which , though in the midst of danger , kept him faithful to his post . Mr. Delancey had been more lenient with Arthur than with any other clerk of like character he had ever had . Although he could not but note in his countenance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the brothers still lived , side by side , beneath the same roof . Though his receipts were spent in debauchery , Arthur managed , as a general thing , to fill his place through the day faithfully ; and since the sudden demise of clerks in the establishment , it had become absolutely necessary . But one morning , Guly noticed that Arthur looked pale , and suffering , though resolutely remaining on duty . Alarmed lest he should be taken with the prevalent disease , to which his habits rendered him peculiarly liable , Guly questioned him , and finding that he was really unwell , turned to his employer , and said :  --  " Mr. Delancey , Arthur is too ill to remain longer in his place ; he must give up until he can get better . He has remained here too long this morning already , with the symptoms of cholera about him . " " Well , he 's a fool for that , " muttered the merchant , in reply , with much of his old manner ; " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up when he 's sick . I 'd whip a negro of mine that worked round , and did n't tell when he was sick . Let him lie down here in your room . " It was the old room which Wilkins used to occupy ; and Arthur , every moment growing worse , hastened thither , and threw himself upon the bed . Guly immediately sent for a physician , and put aside all his business , to attend upon his sick brother . Slowly the hours went by . Everything that could be done was done , and , in fearful anxiety , Guly hung over the form of that brother -- now , in this dark moment , forgiving him all his sins and unkindness , and loving him , oh ! how tenderly ! The sun went down , and Guly had no brother ! In fearful agony he had yielded up his strong spirit , and now lay pale and still in the fond arms which encircled him . The dead-cart stood waiting at the door , and with tears , which he did not struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habiliments of death , and placed within the coffin . Those were times which permitted of but little delay , and bodies were often beneath the turf before they were fairly cold , and even while Guly bent to take a last adieu of the still form before him , the cartman , a burly negro , was loudly vociferating for " the body , " declaring it would be dark before ever he could get his " load dumped . " The coffin was placed upon the top of a number of others , and Guly , too overcome by the grief and anxiety he had experienced , to be able to follow it to the cemetery , stood in the door-way , watching the dismal cart , as it rattled along , bearing to its last resting-place , all that remained of the once proud and happy Arthur . The negro sat upon his pile of corpses , and jogged along over the uneven streets , whistling as he went ! It was late when he reached the graveyard , and the stars were beginning to peep out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only cart at that time depositing in the cemetery , and , accustomed as he was to such things , the man 's hand trembled nervously as he moved about among the tall monuments , and at last stopped in an open space to deposit his load . He ceased whistling as he drew the bolt from his cart box and slid the contents out upon the ground . As they struck , there came a crash ; a sound which fell fearfully upon the ear in that silent place , and the cartman righted the box hurriedly , and hastened round to see what was the matter . While peering into the dusky light , he felt a cold hand grasp him about the waist , and suddenly turning his head , saw that the last coffin he had taken , from being placed high , had split in its fall and burst open ; and , oh , horror ! its occupant was creeping forth with its ghastly face peering up into his ! With a mad yell the negro bounded to his cart . He leaped wildly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheeted figure sustained itself behind him . With shrieks of terror , which echoed fearfully in and out among the tombs , the man plied the lash to his affrighted horse , and they dashed away through the dim streets at a mad pace , the negro , with eyes starting from their sockets , and mouth wide open from fear , ever and anon turning his head , but always meeting that ghastly face close to his , and seeing the grave-clothes floating backward in the wind ! Then the whip fell more heavily on the poor horse , and the screams of mortal fear rang out more startlingly clear ; but the fearful scourge had rendered the streets almost deserted , and the ghostly form still clung to the affrighted negro , sometimes sinking as if from exhaustion , upon its knees , sometimes again drawing itself upon its feet ; but holding ever on with the pale shroud floating backward in the wind . B Footnote B : A well authenticated fact . Suddenly , in turning a corner at a slightly relaxed speed , the cartman felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found that his frightful passenger had vanished , when or how he knew not , but then and there he drew up his horse , and vowed never to take another cholera subject to the grave-yard , and so run the risk of having the ghost ride home with him ; and he kept his vow . Guly lay upon the bed in the gloomy room up stairs , himself suddenly smitten with the fearful disease . He was alone , his only attendant having gone out to procure medicine . His thoughts were dwelling upon the sad events of the day , when suddenly the door opening into the alley was swept back with a hasty hand , and the pale figure of Arthur , robed in a dampened shroud , sank down at Guly 's bedside . The boy started wildly up in bed , with a natural pang of terror darting through his heart . But the next instant , the panting voice of Arthur , faint , but in its old accustomed tones , fell upon his ear , and Guly listened in mute wonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold me thus strangely cast back from the grave which was yawning to receive me . I thank God I was spared the fearful doom of being buried alive ! The coffin burst , the shock , the sudden rush of air restored me , and I found myself awakened from a fearful trance , sent back to life and earth . The lesson has been fearful . But my close approach to death may yet prove my salvation . Give me my clothes to robe myself while I talk to you . " Guly pointed silently to the clothes which hung upon a chair , where they had been placed never to be worn more . He also extended a bottle of cordial to Arthur , bidding him drink and be strengthened . " Now , Guly , " said the elder brother , as , once more robed , he bent above him , " Let me remain as one dead to you , I am going far from you ; but I am a changed being ; fear not for me , I shall commence a new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to blush for me . Guly , farewell ! " Guly threw himself into the extended arms , completely overcome with his emotions . " Oh ! Arthur , I can scarcely realize this strange and sudden restoration ; but now that God has given you back to me , do not leave me , do not desert me , stay with me ; let us learn to be happy in our old love and our old ways . " " Nay , Guly , it may not be , I might but fall again . Let my former self -- what I have been to you for the past few months -- be remembered only as the dead ; think of me but in the light of our early days , and in that light I will once more come back to you . " " And , Arthur , you will remember me with love and kindness , letting all the bitterness of the past drop into oblivion ? " " I will , I will -- and you ? " " With love , always , with love , dear Arthur , shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " God bless you ! God keep you till we meet ! " There came one long , tender , tearful embrace , and once again the brothers parted ; Arthur 's footsteps falling gently on his ear , as he stole out through the arched alley way below . Thus they met , and thus they parted , in the same gloomy old room where they had experienced so much joy and so much sorrow at their first outset on life 's troubled ocean . CHAPTER XL . " I may not love thee ; For thou art far as yon star , above me . " Guly 's attack had not been a severe one , and he was once more performing his usual duties . One day as he sat writing , the dwarf with a chuckle made his way to his side , and stood there on his crooked legs panting heavily . " Hih , hih , Monsieur , God spare you yet ? God spares the good . Long time , Monsieur , since I saw you . " " Long time , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ; I am glad to see you among the living . " " Mean that , Monsieur ? " " Every word of it . " " Miss me , Monsieur ? " " Truly I have . " " Good ! " " And now where have you kept yourself so long , Richard ? " " In one little hovel down town ; I no put my nose out de door , fear dey chuck me into ze ground . Bury folks dis summer sometimes all warm and limber . I want to live till I 'm dead , so I keep down . Life 's as sweet to me as others , though I am misshapen , and lame , and poor , and miserable to look upon . Hih , hih , Monsieur , yes , life is sweet . " " And how come you to be out to-day ? " " I strolled out for one walk , hih , hih , one walk for the health of my crutches and myself ; and as I passed along , some one give me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodbye ! I must be going , or the undertaker will have me stuck two feet in the ground before I get back . Goodbye . Take care of yourself , hih ! " " Goodbye , Richard . " " Monsieur , you remember what you told me one day , long time ago ? " " What about , Richard ? " " About loving one another . Hih , hih , you forget ? " " No , Richard , never forgotten . " " Mean it yet ? " " Yes , in my heart I do . " " Hih , that 's good -- adieu ! " Turning up his one eye at Guly to give a parting glance the dwarf swung himself away , and the clatter of his crutches on the pavement came back with a mournful echo to the boy 's ear . Guly proceeded to read the note which had been handed him . It was simply an invitation for him to come to a certain number in an up-town street , and though neatly written , bore neither date nor signature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some person sick , he having frequently performed such offices during the summer , at the hour designated Guly turned his steps toward the stated spot . It was a large house he found , standing somewhat back from the street , and presuming that it might be one of those wealthy homes which the devastating scourge had rendered desolate , leaving perhaps , one lonely sufferer , he advanced up the steps and gave the bell a gentle ring ; a servant opened the door and ushered him into the drawing-room . Two ladies rose to greet him . One he recognized as the donor of his New Year 's gift , and the other , could it be -- his own brown-eyed Blanche ? Guly felt a wild thrill of joy sweep through his heart , as Blanche , grown , it was true , more womanly than when he saw her last , came forward with her white hand extended to greet him . Oh , how annihilated did all the past , in that one wild moment , become ! and as he bent his lips to that loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale temples , shutting out the bright scene around him , he seemed , for the instant , once more sitting at the little table in the humble cottage of the brodeuse , listening to the trembling voice of the blind grandfather , and threading needles for Blanche . " This , " said the young girl , in her sweet musical voice , as Guly raised his head , " is our mutual friend , Mrs. Belmont ; your acquaintanceship , I believe , however , dates from long ago . " Guly expressed his pleasure at the opportunity afforded of at last acknowledging his New Year 's gift ; and in a few moments they were seated together a happy trio , with the ease and cheerfulness of old friends talking over the events of the past . Mrs. Belmont explained , that she had met Blanche one day in the cemetery , kneeling by her grandfather 's grave , just as she was on the eve of starting away on a long journey . That , struck by her resemblance to her mother , she had addressed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had adopted her to her childless heart as her own , and hurried her away with her , not having time to allow her to communicate the change to any of her friends ; hence the long and hitherto unexplained mystery and silence which had so distressed and harassed Guly . They had returned but a few evenings before , and to-day , Blanche , happening to catch sight of her old acquaintance the dwarf , in the street , had seized that opportunity of communicating to him their arrival , and treating him , she hoped , to a joyful surprise . It was late before Guly parted from his kind friends , and when he did , it was with a sigh of regret for his own fate , though he could not help rejoicing in his generous heart at Blanche 's good fortune . As the pretty and innocent brodeuse , he had hoped to win and wear her as his own ; but as the adopted daughter of one of the wealthiest ladies in the Crescent City , accomplished , rich , polished , and refined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win . It was a height to which he , a poor salaried clerk , could never aspire . With a heavy heart he wended his way through the star-lit streets , dreaming of the days of the blind grandsire , and the little work-table at which he used to thread needles for Blanche , and wondering if those times ever would return . CHAPTER XLI . " Hast thou loved in the good man 's path to tread , And bend o'er the sufferer 's lowly bed ? Hast thou sought on the buoyant wings of prayer A peace which the faithless may not share ? Do thy hopes all tend to the spirit land , And the love of a bright unspotted band ? Are these thy treasures ? "  - -   - -   It was twilight , and Mr. Delancey was sitting at his high desk , with his eyes looking thoughtfully out from under his pale brow . Changes had come upon him , and it was evident that though the strong will was there , the fire of that stern pride that once glowed there was crushed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cholera had taken his wife from his side , and he inhabited the great house on Apollo-street , a desolate and childless old man . " Gulian , " said he , as the boy approached him with a bow , " how is it that you always can succeed in preserving your amiability and politeness under all circumstances ? I can not understand . " " Simply , sir , " replied Guly , with a smile , " by remembering the one great law which God has given us to write upon our hearts , ' Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you . ' " " Humph ! " Guly stood in silence , looking up into the hard , pale face beside him . " I have been thinking of you to-day , Gulian , something for your advancement . You have served me faithfully , and I wish to do something for you . " " You have already done for me much , very much . " " And you have never presumed upon it . I would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Love you , Mr. Delancey ? " " Even so ; I am loveless and childless in my old age ; be to me a son , I will strive to be to you a father . " The merchant opened his arms , and Guly for the first time felt himself held to that proud heart with a cordial grasp of affection . " Be to me a son , " continued Mr. Delancey , " and all my wealth , all that I possess , shall be yours . I am old , and want some one to love me ; some one to miss me when I am gone . Do you consent ? " Guly thought of Blanche , and his heart bounded ; but the next moment his own noble self came back , and he answered promptly : " I will gladly be to you , Mr. Delancey , the son you desire . I will love you , cherish you ; do as a child should do toward a parent . But your wealth I can not take . Let me see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded pride , and I shall be happy and contented in performing those duties which belong to you , from which you so cruelly cut yourself off . " " Children ? my children ? I have none . " " Where is Clinton 's wife and his little son ? Have they no claim upon your kindness ? " " It may be , it may be . " " And Clinton himself , he has been pardoned out , and is wasting his young life to gather a pittance which you could so easily bestow . " " Has he not disgraced and shamed me ? " " Pardon me , my friend ; but was not the primal fault your own ? Was he not driven to his desperate course by a father 's pride and unkindness ? " " It may be , oh , it may be . " " Write their names upon that scroll from whence they have been crossed , and restore them once more to their rights and happiness . " " And leave you poor ? " " I am better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have strength and God 's help . " Mr. Delancey drew some papers from his desk and spread them before him . " Since you so desire , my will shall be altered ; I had hoped to make you happy in the possession of my wealth ; if it will make you happier to see it in the possession of others , it shall be done . Young man , you have acted nobly . " The merchant bent over his desk and wrote rapidly for some time . Lifting his head at last , he called Guly to affix his name , then folded and put them once more out of sight . " There , " said he , " it is done ; if any error lay there , I have done all in my power to repair it now . " " And you will receive your reward . " The merchant said nothing , but sat with his head leaning on his hand . " I can not tell , " said he , " what can have put such thoughts into my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old they come there ; but I have been thinking of the other side of the river to-day , the River of Life . " " My dear friend , " said Guly , turning suddenly and taking the merchant 's hand respectfully in his ; " I am heartily glad that your thoughts have been turned seriously in this direction . It is a subject which ought to frequently intrude upon our minds , and I am inclined to think , that whether our passage across that river be pleasant or painful , lies much with ourselves . We should live to die , even as we would die to live . " Delancey shook his head . " I have lived many years , " said he , with a sad look which Guly never remembered to have seen in that hard face before , " and to-day , for the first time , the thought has forced itself upon me , that I have lived to very little purpose . I have had no aim for life , and the account of my stewardship here below must fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very few , " replied Guly , encouragingly , " who can strike the balance-sheet of life , and be content . Your reflections are , no doubt , the natural effect of the sad season we have passed through , and of your desolate loneliness . " Mr. Delancey leaned forward , and held his hand on Guly 's arm , impressively :  --  " Young man , while you are yet young , let me warn you to beware of a purposeless life ; have an aim , have a mark , struggle for it , grasp at it , and though you may never reach it , you will die happier . " The merchant relapsed again into silence , and Guly turned to a window , to note the fury of a wild storm which was raging without . Suddenly there came a blaze of light , instantly followed by a loud and crashing peal of thunder . " How fearful ! that bolt must have passed near , or struck us , " said Guly , turning toward the merchant . There came no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand upon the old man 's shoulder . He was sitting bolt upright in his chair , with his stony eyes fixed upon vacancy , as he was so often wont to sit . Guly lifted one of the bony hands in his , but it dropped heavily , lifelessly , back upon the desk . Mr. Delancey was dead ! The fearful lightning had borne him across life 's river , without pain and without warning . CHAPTER XLII . " Man wants but little here below . " Mr. Delancey 's funeral was scarcely over , before Guly received a message , stating that his friend the dwarf , was very ill , and desired to see him . The ragged boy , who brought the message , offered to act as guide to the cripple 's hovel , remarking , that Richard said Monsieur would give him a dime for so doing . The money was readily bestowed , and in a few minutes Guly stood by the bedside of his wretched friend . Everything about the place indicated poverty , destitution , and filth , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholera , beneath the few rags which served him for a covering . It was evident no physician had been called , and it was now too late for one to do any good . " Hih , hih , Monsieur , " squeaked the poor old man ; " come , at last , eh ? Look a long time for you ; very cold , Monsieur , very . " Guly took the cramped and chilling hands in his , and strove to warm them there . " Hih , hih , Monsieur ; poor little dwarf 's time 's come at last . Ca n't talk much , Monsieur ; but got very much to say . " " Do n't exert yourself much , Richard . " " Only one little . I must improve my time . Ugh ! Monsieur ; that cramp was very dreadful ! " A moment of silence ensued , broken only by the rattling respiration of the expiring dwarf . " Underneath this bed , Monsieur , and underneath the broad plank in the floor -- when I am gone , Monsieur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It holds a little money -- only a little -- which I have got for little odd jobs and begging . After I am under the ground , that is yours . You are the only one ever really kind to poor Richard , and now that he 's going away for ever , he wants you to remember him kindly . " " I could do it without this , Richard , always . " " No matter , Monsieur ; dat is yours . Ugh ! Monsieur , ' t is so cold . Do n't forget -- under the broad plank . Think I 'll be a straight man in the other world , Monsieur ? " " Yes , Richard . " " Think you will know and love me there ? " " I hope so , Richard . " " So do I ; in my heart , I do . Ugh ! ugh ! how cold . Give me your blessing , Monsieur . " " God bless you , Richard . " " Ugh , Monsieur , I am going . Good-bye . There is a time when life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The poor cripple threw himself over towards the wall ; and , with a shivering moan , died . Guly gave the remains of his friend a decent funeral , and afterwards proceeded to find the strong-box , which his last request had been for him to seek . He found it in the designated place -- strong-box indeed , and very heavy . On lifting the lid , the following words , scrawled on a bit of paper , in the dwarf 's own hand , met his eye :  --  " For Gulian Pratt -- the only man who ever gave me money without seeming to begrudge it . " Just beneath was written :  --  " Love ye one another . " Upon counting the contents of the box , Guly found himself the possessor of forty thousand dollars , the miserly savings of his crippled friend . Verily , " Cast thy bread upon the waters , and after many days it shall be returned to thee . " He had enough to wed Blanche now ! With a bounding heart , the boy hurried to her side , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mrs. Belmont . " It required no fortune on your part , " said the lady , kindly , " to have made your suit prosper with Blanche . To have known she loved you would have been sufficient , for to see her the bride of one whom I know to be so noble and good , is the highest boon I could ask for her . You are both , however , too young as yet to wed ; but if , in two years ' time , you find your love unchanged , you then shall have my sanction and my blessing . " Two years ! dear reader , they pass quickly with young hearts , and they were soon flown . In the softened shadow of the old cathedral windows -- at the altar , where once before they had stood with Della and Bernard -- Blanche and Guly took their places , side by side , with no one to divide them now or ever , in after life . There had come but little change upon them since we saw them last , save that Guly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden about it , and his face grown even more noble in its lofty expression . As the ceremony was ended , they turned to leave the church , but a stranger , tall and dark , stood in their path . There was a moment 's doubtful pause , then the brothers were clasped in each other 's arms ! Those who had filled the building , to note the marriage ceremony , filed slowly out ; and the wedding-party still stood in the dim and shadowy aisles , forgetful of all about them in this new joy -- the delight of this unexpected meeting -- and the hurried explanations which , even here , Arthur was induced to give . He told of long and lonely months in distant lands , of weary hours and heavy days , of fierce struggles with his rebellious spirit ; of battles with his stubborn pride , and resistance to the force of evil habits . He told , too , with his handsome lip quivering with emotion , how the wild struggle ceased at last , and " the peace of God , which passeth all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , " continued he , " with my love and trust in ' Him who doeth all things well , ' once more restored to my rebel heart , I found myself possessed of renewed energy , and an indomitable spirit of perseverance , which seemed to conquer all difficulties . I made many friends , and acquired much wealth , and then started for my native land . I rfeached it ,  - -  a crowd about these doors drew me hither , and you know the rest . The old times at No.  --  Chartres-street hang over my manhood only as a finger of warning , and I have learned that they alone can tread a prosperous path in this life , who follow God 's Guide-board , which is the Bible , and trust to His finger to point it out to them . " The joyous party left at once for the shores of the Hudson . There Arthur re-purchased the old homestead for his mother , and remained " a single man , " the comfort and blessing of her old age . And every summer sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks out upon the lawn , watching the bright figures flitting among the trees , and smiles to see the shadows falling by them , as in the olden time .
