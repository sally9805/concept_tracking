txt ART . IX . - A Treaty extending the Bight of Fishing , and regulating the Commerce and Navigation between her Britannic illicijesty 's Possessions in North America and the United States , concluded in the City of Washington on the fifth day of June , Anno Domini 1854 , between the United States of America and her Uia*esty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland . State Paper . Washington . 1854 . WE believe that this journal may claim the credit of having led the way in preparing the public mind for the great measure which has been consummated by the ratification , on the part of the United States , of the MARCY AND ELGIN TREATY , and by the passage through Congress of the Free List of articles enumerated therein . In our January number of 1852 an elaborate argument was presented , exhibiting the benefits that would flow from such an arrangement . At the moment when the Treaty went before the Senate of the United States , at its recent session , our article was republished in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , to mention these facts , in justice to the quarterly journals , which , in this instance at least , instead of bringing up the rear , in the venerable guise of Old Fogyism , actually took the lead , from the start , in the most dashy style of Young America , in one of the boldest progressive movements of the country and the age . We propose , in the present article , to state the grounds of // our conviction that the Reciprocity Treaty between this country and Great Britain , in reference to the North American Provinces , is one of the wisest arrangements ever made between commercial states , alike honorable to both negotiators , beneficial to all parties , and most auspicious of a better and brighter day in the trade and intercourse of nations . We approve of the Treaty , in the first place , because it can not but tend , in its general and ultimate results , and especially in its influence upon the public sentiment and habitual usage and practice of the two great powers concerned in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Freedom of the Seas . That doctrine is not at present entertained , in its primitive , legitimate , and comprehensive sense , in this country , any more than in England . A narrow , illiberal , and unphilosophical heresy has usurped its place , - a heresy the accidental result of a most artificial state of things in modern European history . Circumstances happened to give to several nations , possessing each a very limited territory , at successive periods , a commercial ascendency amounting to all but a monopoly of the navigation of the world , and they were tempted , in turn , to arrogate the exclusive dominion of the ocean . Spain , Portugal , and even Venice , severally , in their day , put forth the pretension . So also Holland , with a territory scarce larger than some of our American counties , - a submerged mud-flat , rescued by dikes from the ocean , - in the pride of her wonderful commercial supremacy , brandished a broom from the mast-head of her flag-ships , proclaiming in vaunting significance that her power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having triumphed over Holland after a struggle closely contested and long continued , asserted the same monstrous pretensions , and , by her influence upon public law , succeeded to some extent in giving a legal force and authoritative interpretation to her proud boast of being the mistress of the seas . Although occupying , in her realm proper , but a small , rockbound , storm-beaten , fog-enveloped island in the North Atlantic , she has claimed , in no equivocal language , to rule the waves of the whole globe . Out of these pretensions of successive ambitious maritime states arose the famous controver .. 40 // sies between " Mare Liberum " and " Mare Clausum , " in which the various combatants ranged themselves respectively under the lead of Grotius and Selden . Notwithstanding , however , the fact that these grasping claims have been put forth by a series of powerful nations , each at times controlling the commercial world , so repugnant are they to reason and the nature of things , that they never could prevail in embodying themselves , to any great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . The bull of Pope Alexander VI. , which conferred upon Ferdinand and Isabella half the globe , by a line running from the North to the South Pole , a hundred leagues west of the Azores , granted only the " lands and islands ) ' The early colonial charters by which British monarchs gave the North American continent in strips " from sea to sea " to favored companies of their subjects , did not pretend to convey any part or portion of the deep ocean or open sea . They did not assume , as Great Britain has of late , to strike a line from distant capes across bays and gulfs hundreds of miles in width . The nearest approach in the original colonial charters to extravagant pretensions is one in which jurisdiclion was asserted in the Bay of Fundy , from Cape Sable round to Sagadahoc , following the shore , and extending over the intra-insular waters where the islands were not more than thirty miles from the mainland . This instance , by the way , is itself a direct and unanswerable refutation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recognized and acknowledged pretensions of any of the modern nations at the present day to countenance such a doctrine , unless , perhaps , the Elsineur toll ; and even that is felt to be an outrage , and our government , we trust , will persevere in the efforts it is understood to be making , until this nuisance is abated and the Baltic made free . Upon the whole , we repeat the declaration , that , notwithstanding the pretensions put forth in various forms and at different times by grasping and monopolizing naval powers , the public law of nations has never been made to receive , to any considerable extent , their extravagant interpretations . A careful examination of its highest authorities , such as Grotius , Puffendorf , and Vattel , will lead to the conclusion of Sir Wil // ham Scott , that " the general inclination of the law is against the claim of territory to contiguous portions of the sea . In the sea , out of the reach of cannon-shot , universal use is presumed . " The principle seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so far only as they can control or profitably use it from the shore , - control it by cannon-shot , and use it for nets and in boats , or by getting shell-fish from its beaches , rocks , and flats . A marine league is a reasonable and just measure of both the control over the sea and the profitable use of it from the shore . Mr. Jefferson , in a letter to Genet , November 8th , 1793 , mentioned twenty miles , being the measure of vision , as the utmost that could be claimed , and announced that this government was satisfied not to claim jurisdiction beyond a marine league from the shore ; and on the 30th of March , 1822 , John Quincy Adams , in a letter to the representative of Russia , repudiated the claim which that government made to the North Pacific from Behring 's Straits to the fifty-first degree of latitude , on the ground of its being a " close sea , " in consequence of Russia 's owning both shores down to that parallel . Mr. Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always navigated those seas , and that a right to do so was " a part of our independence . " The Marcy and Elgin Treaty sets aside the monstrous " headland " doctrine , recently enforced by Great Britain in our Northeastern seas , and virtually abandons even the " marine league " doctrine . We hail it , therefore , as re-establishing , with the high authority of the two great , first-rate powers who are parties to it , the original and true principle of the Freedom of the Seas . That principle is founded upon reason , instinct , nature . The ocean is the great highway for all mankind . It is incapable of being distributed by demarcation , or laid out to different proprietors by metes and bounds . No walls of partition can stand against its mighty swell . Wherever it dashes its waves , their voice welcomes all dwellers upon its shore to launch freely upon its open bosom , and traverse , without let or hindrance , its illimitable wastes . All that it contains is // the common property of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that ( arved a continent into slices from sea to sea , and the bulls of popes , that conveyed away a hemisphere by a dash of the pen , never pretended , even in the monstrousness of their assumption , to exclusive right to the deep seas , or their occupants . They claimed no monopoly of the leviathan , the porpoise , the cod , or the mackerel , whether within three or three hundred miles from the shore . However narrow the territory that abuts upon the sen , that territory has a full and perfect right to its use . Wherever there is room to launch a keel upon the ocean , to that spot a right to navigate it , from pole to pole , at once enures . You can no more appropriate to a private and exclusive possession the fluctuating and tossing seas , or the eternal currents that sweep through them , or the tides that rise and fall along their shores , than the storms that howl over them , or the tradewinds that pursue their long and constant paths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mariner . It is as absurd for any state to claim a property in shoals of fish that perform annual migrations along its coasts , as it would be to claim a property in flocks of wild-fowl , that " In common , ranged in fi are , wedge their way , Intelligent of seasons ..... high over seas Flying , and over lands . " We approve and support the Treaty , in the second place , because it resto*s to us the Freedom of the Fisheries in American seas . The importance of the fisheries , in a national point of view , is not adequately , and can not be too highly , estimated . They have been , in modern times , the only basis upon which a really solid and permanent maritime or commercial strength has been achieved . Holland reached her amazing wealth and power , in the middle of the seventeenth century , by her fisheries . Amsterdam was spoken of as " the city built upon herring-bones . " England could command success over Holland , in the memorable and protracted struggle between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fountain of national power . The Gulf of St. Lawrence has done more t ear France and England into greatness , // than all the mines in Mexico and South America ever did for Spain . It might easily be shown that the commerce and navigation of America , from their earliest beginnings in the first colonial age to this hour , have been derived from the fisheries . The present produce , in value , of the Northeastern American fisheries to th' United States , the British colonies , and France , can not fall short of $ 30,000,000 annually . They have been yielding up their treasures , without intermission and without diminution , at a not much less rate , for more than two centuries . In a merely pecuniary view , without taking into the account their bearing upon naval strength , and all the other elements , commercial and moral , of national power , the Northern fisheries have been worth more than all the diamonds of Golconda and mines of Peru . They have poured into the treasuries of the great maritime states a perpetual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can hardly hope to continue for an equal length of time without exhaustion . The Banks of Newfoundland are , ever have been , and ever will be , worth as much to the commercial world as the valley of the Sacramento , or the auriferous quartz ledges of the Sierra Nevada . Besides the value of the article of fish , when we take into the account the number of men employed , the amount of tonnage , the courage , hardihood , nautical skill , and patriotic enthusiasm fostered by the pursuit , and the whole salutary influence of the business upon the sustenance , strength , enterprise , and wealth of a nation , we need not shrink from the assertion , that no interest can outweigh the claim of the fisheries upon the earnest and , energetic support of legislators and statesmen . This support the Northeastern American fisheries have not received . The fishermen feel that they have been wronged by the course of events . They impute no blame to the government ; they are the last men in the world to indulge resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public affairs of their own country . history records this noble trait in their character . But they feel that their rights have been sacrificed by untoward diplomacy . The view they take of the subject is substantially as follows . The freedom of the fisheries rests upon the strongest possi // ble grounds of acquired , as well as natural right . To this right the seas and shores of the North American continent were dedicated , from the first . All the maritime nations frequented those seas , and all participated in drawing its treasures from the bosom of the deep . It was in connection with the free fishery of the ocean that the earliest settlements were made in North America . Through the fisheries , all the other branches of American commerce and navigation have been successively introduced . By fish drawn from the Atlantic along the shore , or on the Great Banks , and exported to Virginia , the West Indies , the South of Europe , and other foreign parts , our ancestors were enabled to open the spring from which the ever-swelling stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish all around the shores of the continent , resting upon early usage , reason , and the nature of the case , was confirmed by conquest , and sealed in blood . The right has been vindicated by heroic achievements , from the Kennebee , around the rugged and fearful shores of the Bay of Fundy , at Port Royal , and elsewhere in the Acadian peninsula , at Louisburg , and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence . New England valor won the fisheries , at these several points , before the war of *independence broke out . On all these grounds we claim that they are ours by a right which no treaty can surrender , and no temporary conflict disturb . If those who now rejoice in the privileges and blessings allotted to the favored inhabitants of the New England shores should be conquered , or cut off by pestilence or famine , the right would still adhere to the coast on which they dwell and enure to its next occupants . A convulsion of nature throwing up a new continent before us , and shutting us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our right to the fisheries . Nothing else can . While the ocean raises its anthem-notes within the hearing of our ears , and its wild waves break at our feet , and we remember the daring exploits of our fathers over all those waters , from Cape Cod to Labrador , we feel within us a title to launch forth upon their bosom , to roam over their surface , and to gather our harvests from their living depths . The bold New England fisherman , under sail , feels as free on the ocean // as the bird in the air , - as free as the winds that waft him on his way , - and he will pursue his prey wherever it can be found . Any attempt to obstruct this freedom will be fighting against nature , and will be met by a resistance that can never be subdued . A right claimed to land may be fixed and defined , may be disposed of , restricted , reduced , or cut off by exclusion ; but how can a right , or claim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or defined , or disposed of ? No boundaries can be traced , no walls erected , no monuments raised . The currents , the winds , and the free heart all repudiate the pretension , and welcome us to follow where they lead . The statesmen of the Revolutionary age , Southern as well as Northern , understood this subject well . They well knew that the freedom of the fisheries was an inseparable , inherent , vital element of independence and nationality , - that its abandonment should never be thought of , nor its deprivation endured for a moment . Ralph Izard , of South Carolina , writing from Paris , Sep .. tember 24 , 1783 , says : " Since the advantages of commerce have been well understood , the fisheries have been looked upon by the naval powers of Europe as an object of the greatest importance . The fisheries of Holland were not only the first rise of the Republic , but have been the constant support of all her commerce and navigation . This branch of trade is of such concern to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to request the Supregie Being that it would please him to bless the government , the lords , the states , and also their fisheries . ' The fishery of Newfoundland appears to me to be a mine of infinitely greater value than Mexico and Peru . It enriches the proprietors , is worked at less expense , and is the source of naval strength and protection . " " No peace without the fisheries " ! was the stern declaration of Samuel Adams . " The right , the right , or no treaty , " was the unalterable determination of John Adams . This was the ground taken at the most exhausted moment of the Revolutionary sfruggle , and it can not be doubted that , in taking it , those great patriots and statesmen were sustained by the universal heart of the people . The country would have utterly perished // in the ( contest , before it would have yielded a right which it knew to be a necessity of nature , and essential to the independence , prosperity , and welfare of America . Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fisheries were declared to be ours for ever . The following is the provision relating to the subject in the treaty of 1783 - " That the people of the United States shall continue to enjoy , unmolested , the right to take fish of every kind on the Grand Bank , and on the other Banks of Newfoundland ; also , in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , and at all other places in the sea , where the inhabitants of both countries used at any time heretofore to fish ; and also , that the inhabitants of the United States shall have liberty to take fish of every kind , on such part of the coast of Newfoundland as British fishermen shall use , ( but not to dry or cure the same on that island , ) and also on the coasts , bays , and creeks of all other of his Britannic Majesty 's dominions in America ; and that the American fishermen shall have liberty to dry and cure fish in any of the unsettled bays , harbors , and creeks of Nova Scotia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same shall remain unsettled ; but so soon as the same , or either of them , shall be settled , it shall not be lawful for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish at such settlement , without a previous agreement for that purpose with the inhabitants , proprietors , or possessors of the ground . " This language is perfectly clear and unambiguous . It acknowledges , not the liberty or privilege , but the right , the inherent and inalienable right , of Americans to take fish of every kind , on the Grand Bank and on the other Banks of Newfoundland , also in the Gulf of *St . Lawrence , and at all other places in the sea where the inhabitants of both countries used at any time heretofore to fish . All this it acknowledges to be ours as a matter of right . Then the provision goes on to concede to us , in contradistinction to right , certain liberties . We arc to have liberty to take fish of every kind from such part of the coast of Newfoundland as British fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and creeks of all other of his Britannic Majesty 's dominions in America , with these exceptions only , - that Americans are not to dry or cure fish on any part of the island of Newfoundland , nor on any settled bay , harbor , or creek of Nova Scotia , the Magdalen Islands , or Labrador , without the consent of the inhabitants , proprie // tors , or possessors of said settled part . The liberty of drying or curing fish is conceded , by necessary inference , in all unsettled bays , harbors , or creeks , in all parts of his Britannic Majesty 's dominions in America , except the island of Newfoundland . Now we maintain that the right here acknowledged can not be alienated by any subsequent arrangement whatsoever . In the language of the Adamses , there can be no treaty without , or that does not carry with it , that right . What is conceded as a liberty may be revoked , resumed , and denied . It is for the time , and depends upon grace and sufferance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dependent upon the favor of another party , but absolute and perpetual . And here let us say , in reference both to the liberty and the right , that the Treaty of 1783 , between Great Britain and her triumphant revolted colonies , stands on somewhat different grounds from ordinary treaties , or international arrangements . It possesses the character of a compact . By that instrument Great Britain agreed to the relations for ever afterwards to be maintained between herself and the United States of America . The agreement was final . It was made in the presence of all nations as witnesses ; it defined , for their information and guidance , the attitude of the two parties towards each other . It was an extraordinary and most solemn procedure , without precedent in the history of the world . A great empire , bowing to an inexorable necessity , submitted to dismemberment . A proud sovereign , having failed to subdue a rebellious territory , was compelled to introduce it into the family of nations , and in so doing declared , in the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries and the rights of this new member of the family . What Great Britain at that moment , in that crisis , and by that instrument , acknowledged and proclaimed to be a right , must be allowed by all , and certainly held against her , as inalienable and inseparable from our national existence . As well might a parent , who has deliberately conveyed an estate , by a voluntary transfer , in fee-simple , and by a full and unconditional title , to a child , afterwards undertake , in a fit of // caprice or resentment , to revoke the title . The public law of the world would forbid the transaction . By the same Treaty of 1783 , Great Britain acknowledged the independence of each and all of the United Colonies or States . The acknowledgment was absolute and final , equally in reference to the States severally and collectively , and to the fisheries . A subsequent treaty can no more rightfully surrender the fishery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , than it could reconvey Massachusetts , or any other of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a principle to which our government must be held bound in all its diplomacy , to which its treaty-making power must be for ever subject , that it has no right to relinquish any part or item of what was gained and established by the Treaty of Independence ; and that it transcended its legitimate power by surrendering our right to the fisheries , as much as it would have done by conveying back New York or Virginia to colonial dependence . The Treaty of 1783 was , in its very nature , irrevocable in all its features and provisions , and a relinquishment of any right acknowledged by it is , to that extent , a surrender and betrayal of our independence . The war of 1812 did not , accordingly , disturb the basis upon which our fishing rights had been admitted to rest by the Treaty of 1783 . It could not have been terminated , any more than the war of the Revolution , - peace could not have been made ,  --  on any other basis . Had the Commissioners yielded the right , the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their ancient , bloodbought right , to the last extremity . John Adams was still living , and he proclaimed over again , in language such as he only could use , the doctrine of the Revolutionary age . In a letter to President Madison , relating to the negotiations then going on at Ghent , he emphatically insisted once more upon " the right , - the right , or no treaty . " These are his words : " Al I can say is , that I would continue this war for ever , rather than surrender one acre of our territory , one iota of the fisheries as established by the third article of the Treaty of 1783 , or one sailor impressed from any merchant-ship . " Then came the Convention of 1818 . The article relating to the fishery question was as follows : - // " Whereas differences have arisen respecting the liberty claimed by the United States for the inhabitants thereof to take , dry , and cure fish on certain coasts , bays , harbors , and creeks of his Britannic Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high contracting parties , that the inhabitants of the said United States shall have , for ever , in common with the subjects of his Britannic Majesty , the liberty to take fish of every kind on that part of the southern coast of Newfoundland which extends from Cape Ray to the Rameau Islands , on the western and northern coast of said Newfoundland , from the said Cape Ray to the Quirpon Islands , on the shores of the Magdalen Islands ; and also on the coasts , bays , harbors , and creeks from Mount Joly , on the southern coast of Labrador , to and through the Straits of Belle Isle , and thence northwardly indefinitely along the coast , without prejudice , however , to any of the exclusive rights of the Hudson 's Bay Company . And the United States hereby renounce for ever any liberty heretofore enjoyed or claimed by the inhabitants thereof to take , dry , or cure fish on or within three marine miles of any of the coasts , bays , creeks , or harbors of his Britannic Majesty 's dominions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Provided , however , That the American fishermen shall be admitted to enter such bays or harbors , for the purpose of shelter , and of repairing damages therein , of purchasing wood and of obtaining water , and for no other purpose whatever . But they shall be under such restrictions as may be necessary to prevent their taking , drying , or curing fish therein , or in any other manner whatever abusing the privileges hereby reserved to them . " In speaking of this arrangement , we desire to treat the subject with fairness and candor . We acknowledge , that , at the time , its real operation , as recently disclosed , was not understood by the fishing interest . Those statesmen , too , who more than others in our recent history had turned their attention to it , such as John Quincy Adams , seem to have regarded it as a beneficial arrangement . It did , indeed , give us the liberty to take fish , without restriction or limitation , from a certain point indefinitely to the north , and also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere else , on all the coasts of British North America . The only explanation to be given of the favorable reception of the Convention of 1818 is , that no one then dreamed that such a monstrous interpretation would ever be put , or for a moment suffered to be // enforced , upon the " three-mile " restriction , as Great Britain has asserted for the last thirty years , under the name of the " Headland " doctrine . There are two points in the article of the Convention of 1818 just quoted , which vitiate its authority , and would have made it impossible to bring American fishermen much longer to submit to it . In the first place , it is deceptive and disingenuous , because , while it professes to confine its application to the removal of " differences respecting the liberty " claimed by the United States , it actually cedes away what , in contradistinction to a liberty , was acknowledged to be ours of right . In the second place , it is fraudulent in its terms . As a consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reconcile us to the surrender of our rights , it says that the " inhabitants of the United States shall have for ever , in common with the subjects of his Britannic Jllajesty , the liberty to take fish of every kind " on certain specified coasts ; among others , " the western and northern coast of Newfoundland . " In point of fact , the subjects of his Britannic Majesty did not then , and have never had since , any right to take fish on that coast ! The Treaty of Utrecht , in 1713 , gave the French a right to use that coast , which gradually , by successive intermediate treaties between England and France , got to be an exclusive right . The Treaty of Paris , in 1815 , distinctly and formally reiterated the concession to France , as exclusive of British fishermen , of a monopoly of fishing on that coast , which continues , we understand , to this day . The deception , or oversight , whichever it may have been , in this particular , gave to our government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Convention of 1818 , - a demand which an injured , indignant , and gallant people will compel this government to enforce , at no distant day , should the present treaty fail to be consummated . But we have ever protested against the three-mile restriction established by the Convention of 1818 , because it can not be enforced but by means that can never be tolerated . The sanctity of our flag was maintained and vindicated by the late Daniel XVebster , with his usual ability , in reference to vessels bearing it at their mast-head , even under the most sus // picious circumstances , on the coast of Africa . Surely that flag ought to afford as effectual a protection to the brave and patriotic fisherman pursuing his manly and honorable avocation . It must and it shall protect him . If this treaty fail to be ratified , we shall call upon our government to restore to our fishermen the protection of their flag . No foreign official shall tread the deck over which that flag waves . If British cruisers find our vessels fishing within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but while the stars and stripes are floating at their peak , the voice of the country must forbid the intruders ' approach for purposes of search . We protest against either imperial or colonial cruisers seizing and searching our vessels , while under way , on the open sea . No country , of the least pretension to independence or nationality , can suffer it . The utmost that can be asked of an American sailor is to suffer his vessel to be ordered to , and his deck invaded , by an authority emanating from his own flag . To the revenue-cutter or the man-of-war of his own nation he will submit , but never , without the deepest resentment and indignation , to a foreign official . A domestic police the free American is willing to endure , but never a foreign police on the open sea . The profoundest passions of the human breast - all the peculiar sentiments of the American heart - are sensitive and hostile to such high-handed procedures as Great Britain has been suffered to practise upon our fishermen . The slumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people along the Northern sea-shore . If such a state of things had been continued , the last extremity would soon have been reached . The historian will find it difficult to believe that such things could have been borne for such a length of time by our fishermen , or by their government . When he collects and reviews the provocations , aggravations , insults , and outrages to which they have been subjected , - driven from shelter , and compelled to keep the sea , at the approach of storms , on the most dangerous waters of the North Atlantic , - forbidden to enter ports in quest of relief for sick and dying men , - pursued and boarded on the slightest pretences , - their decks invaded and desecrated by insolent foreign subordinate offi-41* // cials , their quarters searched , their shipping-papers seized and scrutinized with evil eyes and contemptuous comments , and then recklessly blotted over , or crumpled up , or thrown down and trodden upon , - captured on frivolous charges , - fares broken up , whole seasons lost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials , - such outrages could not indeed have been endured much longer . We were on the eve of collision , violent resistance , bloodshed , and war . From all this the treaty saves us . It rescues the gallant fisherman from wrongs and abuses , most difficult for his heroic spirit to bear , and restores to him the unassailable sanctity of his flag , and that freedom of the seas which is his right , and which every instinct of his soul and every habit of his life demand . In this point of view the Marcy and Elgin Treaty confers an inestimable boon upon the fisherman . And does lie not deserve protection and favor ? What class or description of our people deserves more at the hands of the country and the government ? Besides laying deep and broad the foundations of our maritime and commercial power and wealth , fishermen have been a wall of fire around us in every hour of danger from abroad . With a population of not more than six thousand , the fishermen of Marblehead raised a regiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that served through the war of the Revolution . They were the men whom Washington selected to lead the way in the passage of the Delaxvare , on that bitter winter night , whose morning beams , at Trenton , shone upon the rescue and redemption of the country . From the same heroic people went forth the most active and effective defenders of the cause on the seas , among them the immortal Mugford , the earliest naval hero and protomartyr of the Revolutionary contest . In the war of 1812 , Marblehead gave over seven hundred of her gallant men and youth to the service of the country , in public and private armed vessels , and five hundred of them were in Dartinoor prison at the time of the massacre . A similar story might be told of all our fishing towns . When the Constitution took the Cyane and Levant , one half of her crew were from the shores of the northern cape of Massachusetts Bay . Such facts as these are becoming // known to the country at large , and the extraordinary unanimity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it required went through both houses of Congress , at the close of the recent session , may be considered as evidence that the claims of American fishermen upon the goodwill of the government and people are appreciated at last . The last , but by no means the least , cause of congratulation on the ratification and establishment of the Marcy and Elgin Treaty is , that it is the harbinger of Freedom of Trade . Time is the great solver of problems . In its perpetual progress it settles all questions , and evolves all just results . The theory of commerce , in its universal comprehension and absolute truth , has always borne its testimony in behalf of Free Trade . But the necessities and the requisite independence of a new people rising into greatness in a new world , inexorably demanded protection for its infant industry , and the aid of government in support of the various arts and manufactures during the period of their weakness and immaturity . The friends of a protective system have declared , all along , that the aid they sought from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after a while the industry of the country would be able to stand on its own feet , work its own way , and bear up with its own strength against all competition . The passage of the Reciprocity Treaty - all sections and all interests conspiring , borne onward by every current , favored by every breeze , of popular feeling and general conviction - fulfils the predictions , redeems the pledges , and discharges the obligations of the Protectionists , and at the same time realizes the visions of Free-Traders . The system of the former , applied more or less energetically to the legislation of the country , has reared the industry and business of the people into a condition to meet , welcome , and flourish under , the fullest development of the speculative and Utopian theories of the latter . There may be , and in our judgment undoubtedly are , articles of natural production and manufacturing processes which continue to need , and therefore ought to receive still longer , the protection of government against foreign competition ; but so far as our business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the circumstances connected with the consummation of the Reciprocity Treaty prove that all is ripe and ready for Free Trade . Every interest seemed at last to unite in welcoming it . The fishing interest , of course , for the reasons we have given , felt at once released from an odious and intolerable restriction , and restored to its natural and rightful condition . The manufacturing interest wisely discerned , in quickened and multiplied trade with the Provinces , an enlargement of its home market . It is true that the treaty does not , in its express terms , extend its benefits to our manufactures ; they are still to be subject to duty in crossing the border . But that duty , after all , really amounts to nothing . By a settled policy , resting upon a basis fixed by Great Britain herself , no higher duty can be laid , in her colonies , upon our manufactures than upon her own . We meet our only manufacturing competitor , in the Provincial markets , on equal terms . It is the same to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fabrics . It can not be doubted that we shall command a constantly increasing share of their whole consumption for our manufactures . The anthracite-coal interest was assuaged in its opposition , and all but subdued to the support of the measure , by finding that the product of Pennsylvania mines was already winning its way to consumption in the Provinces . The fact , that , although Cunard himself is a proprietor of Nova Scotia collieries , he actually supplies his steamers at Halifax with Pennsylvania coal , broke down resistance from that quarter more than all the arguments of political economists and all the eloquence of Senators . Then , again , it could not be doubted that anthracite from Pennsylvania would , eventually , find its greatest market for domestic consumption in the long and severe Canadian winters . The bituminous and semi-bituminous coal-beds of the United States are , for the most part , too remote to feel much dread of Picton or Sydney competition , and the result was that the coal opposition to the treaty became , in the end , quite paralyzed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be felt at the acquiescence of the agricultural interest in a measure which pours the // vast wheat and grain production of Upper Canada upon our markets , and gives it a quicker and cheaper outlet to foreign markets , in competition with our own breadstuffs . Perhaps , however , it will be found that the agricultural representatives , in making no decisive and earnest resistance to this treaty , showed a far-reaching and wide-seeing wisdom . While it is true that Upper Canada , or Canada West , produces a surplus of grains , it is not so with Lower Canada and the coast Colonies , as a whole ; but , on the contrary , they must constitute , in proportion to their growth in population and wealth , a continually more and more profitable and extensive customer and consumer . Then , again , the free navigation of all rivers , lakes , and bays , and the equal use of all canals and railroads , on both sides , must , on a large , permanent , and expanding scale , be beneficial to agricultural producers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all measures that tend to increase the population and prosperity of the continent , thus multiplying the mouths to be fed and the ability to buy . In some of the most fertile and extensive agricultural districts of the West , the prairie lands for instance , the scarcity of fuel and lumber has always been a great drawback , and it is not strange that a free access to the Canadian wildernesses , and , in consequence , cheapened plank , clapboards , and all other forms of lumber , as well as fuel , should be considered of prime importance to the bordering population of Illinois , Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota . In all the older and thick-settled States , the increasing price of fuel is getting to be regarded with serious apprehension , and it is quite natural that their people generally rejoice in a measure that throws down all obstructing barriers , and opens to unrestricted use and operation all coal-fields everywhere , and the boundless forests of the North . By this treaty we are brought into the closest commercial relations with three millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich in minerals , and her coast all around a fringe of harbors , - New Brunswick , with her inexhaustible woodlands and maritime resources , having already more ships of a thousand tons than the empire of France , - the Canadas , stretching along our border almost from sea to sea , and // extending to the North Pole . These Colonies in the aggregate are the third navigating power in the world , - with 450,000 tons of registered shipping , - their inward and outward tonnage , not including local trade , amounting to 4,000,000 annually , of $ 80,000,000 value . Who can doubt that great results are to flow to both sides , from throwing down all barriers , and making the whole intercourse of life free between them ? Every thinking man , who looks at the subject , without any particular interest , in a comprehensive and philosophical light , can not but regard the Marcy and Elgin Treaty as one of the most beneficial diplomatic arrangements ever made . If we spread out the map of North America and survey the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Lawrence and Chesapeake Bay , on one side , to the shores of Oregon and Washington , on the other , with the broad water-shed that is drained into the chain of lakes from Ontario to Superior , prolonged as it is by railroads and canals to the Atlantic on the east , and to the Rocky Mountains in the west , - if we then extend our eye over those mountains to the Pacific , and take in the whole , including , on both sides , the headwaters of the St. Lawrence , Mississippi , Missouri , and Columbia , thus linked and clamped together , not only by nature , but already to some extent , and in the future to an extent beyond our wildest dreams , by art ,  --  we can not find words to express , or figures to measure , the infinite and ever-multiplying benefits that must ensue from releasing this vast tract of country from all legislative and international impediments , and allowing the arts of peace and the genius of commerce to spread their blessings , unconfined and unrestricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open field and a fair chance , this strip of our continent must , in the full development of the ages , include within its limits more millions of men , and present a grander aspect of humanity , than any other equal tract on the globe . The question of annexation came up at times , during the progress of the treaty through its several stages , in the informal discussions of members of Congress and others interested in the subject . It seems to be taken for granted with us , as indeed it evidently is in Great Britain among all classes , that // the Canadas and the other Provinces will ultimately be annexed to the American Union ; and the question was whether that event would be hastened or retarded by the establishment of free trade between them and us . It was maintained , on the one side , that , as all material , commercial , and business ends would be answered by the treaty , annexation would cease to be desired by either party , and would , therefore , be indefinitely postponed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and moral effects of such a state of things as the treaty will bring about can not but tend to make us one people , and absorb us , irresistibly , although insensibly , into each other . A people so identified , it is argued , can not long remain politically separated , but must be united by annexation . Events will probably justify this last line of reasoning . But whenever annexation comes , be it sooner or later , the operation of the treaty will make it , beyond all doubt , a peaceful , amicable , and altogether salutary transition . The proceedings of our Senate in the ratification of the treaty still remain under the seal of secrecy . It is understood , however , that some of the Southern Senators attempted to alarm their associates from the Slave States into opposition to the measure , by representing that it would lead to early annexation , and thereby deprive the slave interest of that control over the government which it now enjoys . Fortunately there were Southern Senators who , on that occasion , rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their pro-slavery prejudices , and took the ground that annexation may , and perhaps must , come at last , but that the question whether it would be hastened or retarded by the treaty should not be allowed to intercept so great and glorious a triumph of diplomatic wisdom and national communion . There was indeed a most unusual and most felicitous co-operation of adverse elements in carrying the treaty through the Senate . Mason and Toombs , Douglas and Seward , Whigs and Democrats , Free-Soilers and Secessionists , Northerners and Southerners , acted in cordial harmony . The bill to carry its provisions into effect , by making the articles enumerated in it free of duty , was introduced in the House by a Virginian . Gerritt Smith was perhaps the most zealous , as he // was surely one of the ablest , champions of the measure . The administration upheld it with a hearty fidelity . No lisp of partisan opposition was heard . Sectionalism vanished for the time , and the act was swept through Congress with an irresistible enthusiasm , of which our history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost good judgment by both the eminent persons concerned . The American Secretary showed throughout his great wisdom , and combined moderation and caution with boldness and decision . Lord Elgin addressed himself to the work with a frankness and simplicity of procedure , and an energy and directness of manner , that would have astonished diplomatists of the ceremonial school . He went to Washington in person , closeted himself with Mr. Marcy , took hold of the subject in detail , weighed its real merits , on each point ; and the whole thing was at once arranged between them , just as two honest and sensible men would settle any business affair of their own . While the chief glory of a result so important in its bearings upon commerce and diplomacy , and so strikingly in accordance with all the benignant and progressive tendencies of humanity , is due to the administration and the negotiators that accomplished it , we must bear in mind that public opinion has been gradually matured by the labors of others . Many distinguished names occur in this connection . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everett , and that he came near accomplishing it during the brief but brilliant period of his service at the head of the Department of State . It would be unjust to close this article without referring to the services of a gentleman who has done more than any or all other men to bring about the result upon which we have now congratulated our readers . Israel D. Andrews of Eastport , Consul of the United States for Canada and New Brunswick , has been for years employed as a confidential agent by the State Department , to collect information and bring influences to bear for the consummation of this arrangement . His " Report on the Trade and Commerce of the British // North American Colonies , and upon the Trade of the Great Lakes and Rivers " ( Executive Document No. 112 , 32d Congress , 1st Session ) is one of the most thorough , elaborate , and instructive works ever published by our government .
