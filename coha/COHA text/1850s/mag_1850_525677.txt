HINTS TOWARD CONCILIATION . No greater calamity can befal a nation than the death of those men who represent in their persons the dignity and virtue of the people . In Republics especially , the decease of great and worthy citizens , able to sustain the responsibilities of high office , is to be esteemed among the greatest of calamities . The death of President Taylor has cast a gloom over the nation : It has abated confidence : It has cast down the hopes of many : It has dimished security . The favorite of the people , to whom all eyes were turned , in whom all hopes were concentrated for the guidance of public affairs , for the preservation of the Union , and the maintenance of the constitution , is taken suddenly away ; and for a moment , following upon the shock , there is a feeling of uncertainty and confusion . No man can estimate the consequences of so sudden a blow . The venerable character of the President , his popularity , the respect and affection with which he was regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny of the nation , had he lived , in his sole control . The known firmness of his character , and the high constitutional cast of his intellect , strengthened by a life-long allegiance to the Union , and obedience to its laws , left no doubt , in the minds of those who knew him best , as to what course he would have pursued . He came into office pledged to sustain and to execute the laws , as a law-executor and not as a law-maker . He represented the executive principle , and as far as he was suffered , in the mysterious order of Providence , to work out the pledges under which he came into power , he fulfilled them . We are not called upon to pronounce his eulogy : that will be read in the history of the time . Meanwhile the solemnity of the occasion is not unfavorable to a serious examination of ourselves , and the position which we , as a party , entrusted with the defense of certain principles for which our votes are registered , and toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exerted ,  --  occupy at this moment . The safety of the Union is in the hands of the Whig party ; disunion lies not at their door , if it comes . We are entering upon the second stage of that factious war which is endangering , or which seems to endanger , our existence as a nation . It is unwise to shut our eyes to the facts , or to endeavor to conceal from ourselves and others the real posture of our affairs . Two powerful factions are laboring to destroy the republic . A faction in the North , small in numbers , but loud and active , **32;597;TOOLONG by their position as a third party , whose alternative is either a dissolution of the Union or the wresting of the powers of the general government to their peculiar purposes . A faction in the South , also small in numbers , and still louder and more dangerous , ( through the influence they exert upon the Southern population , ) whose alternative is disunion , or the wresting of the powers of the general government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , we need not now enquire . It is the present phasis of the contest which immediately interests us . For the Southern faction there is this excuse , or at least , this appearance of an excuse , - that they are contending for what they conceive to be their rights . For the Northern faction there is no excuse . They have neither right nor interest to offer , but only a theory of what is best for the future ; and for this imaginary best they hesitate not to destroy all that is good and desirable in the present . These two factions have their representatives , who go beyond the wishes of their constituents , and react upon and exas // perate them ; the same ultimate purpose inspires both ; - we confidently affirm it on the authority of no mean witnesses ,  --  and that is , the destruction of the present system of the Union . They are weary of the Union ; it is t.oo great a weight for them to carry ; they wish to see it dissolved , they inspire their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as they are now proceeding , the constituencies , too , will become weary of the Union , and will see nothing but evil in it . There is but one party in the nation that remains sound at heart and unmoved amid the tumult , and that is the original Whig party of the Union . Theirs is the sole doctrine able to unite the extreme divisions of that party , and that is the doctrine of union and nationality . In the full strength and capacity of this doctrine lies the strength of the Whig Republican party . Inheriting from the old Republican party that profound respect and consideration for the rights and equalities of the local sovereignties , which was the guiding light and the actuating spirit of the early founders of the Republic , the Whig party adds to that a genuine republicanism ; a feeling of the integrity of the entire people , apart from all opinions and above all local interests . Dismissing from our thouehts all considerations of the abstract right or wrong of negro servitude , as a question which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present , almost criminal to agitate before the people , let us pause in our career of violence and inquire whether there are not other things , some other things of at least equal moment , to be discussed : let us ask ourselves whether white men were created solely to legislate for the happiness and the multiplication of negroes , or whether a sudden or a gradual change in the political position of a portion of our population , and that portion the most abject and the least valuable of all-whether the accomplishment of such a change is so extremely desirable , so indispensible and divine a thing , we are determined to go to our deaths in order to accomplish it . Whether the hopes of the world and the glory of the universe are to be forever extinguished , and the happiness and prosperity of seventeen millions , an entire people , is to be annihilated , in order that a body of slaves may receive a liberty which it is by no means certain they would not use for their own destruction . Let men reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England weighed carefully the moral , social and physical calamities which must attend the success of those schemes which are on foot among them . Do they believe that the South will yield without a struggle ? Havethey counted the cost ? Have they estimated the ruin and the devastation of civil war ? Have they considered what must follow upon the suspension of commercial intercourse incident to a border war , enlarging to a general civil war , between the two sections of the continent ? The materials of their industry are drawn from those fields which they are ready to over-run and devastate . Those materials are wrought from the bosom of the earth by the industry of the negro , from whose hands these agitations must snatch the impleinents of agriculture and substitute for them knives and fire-brands . Let us yield quietly to the progress of events , and Providence will work out for us our just desires . The tide of population is moving Southward and Westward over all the continent . The gradual influx and interminjing of white populations must inevitably change and ameliorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly emancipate him . Under any circumstances , however , the interference of a foreign power will only crush and rmin what it seeks to ameliorate . Interference on the part of the North is at least as inhumane as it is unlawful . On the other side , what is it that the South desires ?  --  or rather what is it that the nation can concede to that portion of the South who are agitating what they conceive to be their rights . To such of them as demand the dissolution of the Union there is one reply to be made and they know well what that reply is . Every step which they make in that direction draws war after it . Let them estimate their forces ; let them count the numbers they can bring into the field ; let them calculate the cost ; let them imagine them-. selves finally successful and the division made , and the two nations established where there is now but one ; have they secured to themselves anything beyond what they already possess ? // The northern populations , driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds as these , would have planted in their souls an hatred inextinguishable of the institution whose existence gave rise to all these calamities . Were a Northern Republic to be established , the first clause in its constitution would be the first of the Declaration of Independence , and that clause would become a doctrine of action ; and the millions of population who adopted it would be converted into a propaganda for its establishment . The second clause in that constitution would be Freedom and Protection to the last extremity , for every man who sets foot upon Northern soil ; and who can tell how much farther the fury of an enthusiastic and a martial people might urge them ? To what fearful extremities ? The people of New England , peaceful and industrious , and humble in their industry , inherit the rancor and the courage and the invincible steadiness of the puritan blood . Strong friends though they be , and the best supporters , of that constitution which is now the protector of the Southern as well as of the Northern sovereignties , the continuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of universal human right , would rouse again in their minds the smothered fires of fanaticism , inextinguishable , saving in death . And what shall we say for those Western millions , of Saxon and Celtic origin ? Red Republicans and Democrats in their own country , exiles from slavery themselves , what side would they take in such a conflict ? We repeat it : the South may calculate her strength ; she may project alliance with the free-traders and aristocrats of England ; she may annihilate the Northern commerce ; she may destroy the navigation of the Mississippi ; she may arm her slave populations , and with that native valor of which her sons are justly proud , and for which the world admires and extols them ,  --  a valor which is now the pride and the glory and the defence of the Union ,  - -  all this would not avail to save her from inevitable ruin should she first move , and be the confessed and clear mover , in such a war . It would be such a war as has never yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extinguishment of those glorious local sovereignties which are the barriers-we had almost said the creators , of popular liberty . Local sovereignties would fall into disrepute . Nothing so completely breaks down municipal distinction , and so rapidly fuses and nationalizes a people as civil war . In the common cause the separate interests are forgotten . It is our firm and sincere belief that the Northern people have had no hand in those events which have given a free population to California . Gentlemen in the Nashville convention said that it was the masterly inactivity of Congress which gave a free constitution to California , and that this is their grievance ,  --  that this is the insult which they feel so sorely , and which to revenge they call for a dissolution of the Union and alliance with England . It were better for the American people that the Oregon treaty had never been signed , and war with England precipitated then-than that such a word as this accursed one , than that such a thought as this accursed , most infamous thought-alliance with England for the ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is meant by alliance with England ? Subordination is meant ; political dependence is meant ; the conversion of the Southern States into the tributaries ,  --  planting and cotton growing tributaries of England is meant , with Tory influence infecting the counsels of the South ,  --  with English political economy depressing , and suppressing , and plucking out the heart and extinguishing the life of Southern liberty . Remand California back to a territorial condition , or we will remand the Southern States back to a Colonial condition : - that is your project , gentlemen of the Nashville convention ; that is your alternative ! You are mistaken in your estima.te of the North . That the North dislike your institutions is as true as that you dislike theirs . Maintain your institutions , and the Union will protect you . Without it , you have no guaranty . You err in attributing to the influence of the North an effect over which the North had no control . It was free emigration that made California . She was a free State under the laws of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries intolerant of negro slavery . It will be a pathetic passage in human history if you ask to revenge yourselves upon your brothers and fellow- citizens for a con- // summation over which they had no control . It was not by the machinations of abolitionists , but by the love of gold and the spirit of adventure , a free population was poured into California . You were not rapid enough : while you sat quietly upon your plantations , planning new States to be added to your Southern Republic , the freemen of the West had shouldered their rifles , and were on their way across the wilderness . By the time you had risen to your feet , they had stepped across the ridges of the Rocky Mountains . Your institutions encumbered you ; they will always encumber you ; you need protection in them ; you require the protection of a powerful nation ; - powerful in war , and sworn servants of laws and constitutions -- to protect you in that fearful business which Providence has imposed upon you , of governing-one man for ten-your millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the futume , weighed the facts of the past ? Have you forgotten that , under the Union , you have flourished long , protected and fostered by it ? Have you , amongst all your calculations , calculated the force and value of that protection , and measured how much you owe to it ; or , if it were removed , what immense influences hostile to yourselves , now fended from you by the barriers of nationality , striking respect and terror ? - were those barriers removed , might fall with them , and respect and terror no longer be in your defense . It is a time , if ever there was such a time , for dispassionate enquiry . We must stop and consider : we must ask what is demanded ; and , above all things , we must cease from abuse and recrimination . The most important inquiry that can occupy us is , therefore , to discover the extent of injury , if any , that has been inflicted upon the slaveholding States . But before entering upon that inquiry it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflicted by men . The South may rebel against Providence while it supposes that it is rebelling against the Union ; but that were a barbarous and an odious war which punished friends for one 's own misfortunes , and the consequences of one 's own folly . The first cause of grievance , and which was especially dwelt upon by Calhoun , whose great name and greater virtues have given force to the complaint , is the existence in the North of associations for the propagation of anti-slavery doctrines . That the existence of such associations should be a cause of vexation and grievance in the Southern States , more especially among the owners of slaves , is natural : such associations exist also in England ; indeed , they originated there ! the English government is an organized abolition agency with fleets , armies , and the taxes of an empire at its disposal . The imperial government of the British empire has taxed its people to raise a sum of money sufficient for the emancipation of its negro colonies in the West Indies . The people of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are somewhat behind their neighbors of the continent . A revolutionary Great Britain , such as all thinking men expect soon to see ,  --  will not that also be an emancipating and an abolitionary Great Britain ? Your projected Southern Republic then , will be under the protection of a revolutionary British empire , rushing on the wild sea of universal suffrage , forward toward indefinite reform . And will it not be an emancipatory and an abolitionary power , directed first toward the more effectual suppression of the slave traffic ,  --  the pet project of England these thirty years , and which it might easily accomplish , and would long since have accomplished , but for the ingenuity of its rulers , who amuse the people with ineffectual squadrons on the coast of Africa , but who , when they intend in earnest to stop the traffic in Africans will direct their steamships to watch the harbors of South America , and so forever put an end to the trade which they detest :  --  and will not the second step be against the projected Southern Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that equally desirable one for England , the destruction of American manufactures , what step can be taken more propitious than the separation of the South , to be followed by a Southern alliance ? Was not South Carolina first governed and colonized by the servants of the crown ? a circumstance not to be forgotten ! What a piece of statesmanship for an English Premier to draw back these truant colonies to a dependence upon British clemency ! what a scene would that be in the drama of English history for // some future Shakspeare to impersonate the ambassador of Charleston tendering allegiance to a baby king of England ? And i*ith what a beautiful and humane spirit the breast of England would swell , reflecting back upon the suppliant South , the sympathetic strain of abolition ? - abolitionary England advising the suppliant South to emancipate its slaves : gently and kindly urging and advising that great movement  --  the pet movement of English philanthropy . This unheard of grievance and calamity to the South , the existence of noisy abolition societies and newspapers in the Northern States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Puritan common sense , and , in their strife and rage , rending the heavens with their troublous cries , this noise and uproar is , indeed , a dreadful , and intolerable evil ; but can not some remedy be found less violent and heroic than the one proposed , of ruin and annihilation ? Is the voice of the antisyren so powerful that men must rush into their graves to escape it ? That men should differ in opinion , and esteem their own institutions best , is no grievance , but a good . The South approves her institutions and applauds them to the skies . Do the North esteem that a grievance ? The distribution of incendiary pamphlets by a few misguided missionaries , or designing slave-stealers , once a grievance , is no longer so , and ought never to have been so . It lies within the scope of Southern law , and has been , and is effectually prevented . The escape of negroes from their masters is an evil to which all slave countries are equally subject ; it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution exists ; it is an evil incident to every form of apprenticeship and bondage . Were the Northern apprentice the property of his master , what a hue and cry and an advertising would there be after apprentices escaped to the West , or fled to the Canadas . While slavery existed in the British West Indies , who does not know that gangs of slaves occasionally made their escape into the wilderness . Every Southern man who has read the History of Three-fingered Jack , " and the servile wars of the West Indies , knows that the escape of slaves was at least as frequent and as serious an evil in those days as it is at present . That the impoverishment of plantations by a bad system of agriculture , exhausting soils by repeated crops of cotton and tobacco , and thereby impoverishing the slaves and rendering them discontented and unhappy ,  --  that the escape of negroes from this cause into the free States should go on increasing as the poverty of the masters increases , is an evil to be remedied , not by converting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border-land , to be overrun by rangers and slave-stealers beyond the power of the law , but by an improved system of agriculture , and by putting a stop to the additon offresh slave territory , by which the life-blood and the capital of the South is drawn away from the older States , leaving them open and desolate . But , of all the grievances complained of , the most intolerable is the failure attributed to Northern management , to establish new slave States on the southwestern territories . This is the spectre of misrule and revolution , which so horrifies the souls of Nashville Conventionists . The majority of opposition on the part of the North was not a fanatical opposition . It was political in its spirit . The party in the South , who advocated extension , were originally small in numbers , but they made up in activity what they lacked in weicht . Their success exasperated the Northern anti-slavery faction . Southern legislators , of all parties , had warned the country against the policy of extension . They foresaw the difficulties which would ensue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresaw , also , that the older slave States would suffer in their interests that slave labor would become less valuable in then , through the competition of new regions in the South-West ; they anticipated the discontents that would arise upon the efforts to substitute free labor , and to bring about emancipation in the Northern slave holding States ; that there would be a movement southward , of the slave-power , and that that movement would leave open large fields of poverty and discontent . It was their policy not to expand and weaken , but to concentrate , to limit , and to streub then the power of the South ; to foster , to enliven , and to erect. , the slave power , and // not to suffer it to be thinned out and wasted over the wilderness . They wished to introduce new forms of industry , and new and more profitable methods of agrieulture , in order that the labor of the slave might become more valuable , and that with his prosperity might be increased , in still greater ratio , the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise and far-sighted policy of Calhoun , though we believe , in his latter days , he fell away from it . Up to the period of the Mexican war , he sussained it . It was the evil destiny of the South , however , to give birth to a class of political adventurers whose ideas were solely of conquests in new lands , of military glory and of territorial aggrandizement . Ideas with which it is easy to infect an entire people . Southern conservatism gave way before democratic ambition ; and this ambition gave birth to a new political necessity , that of the balance of power . Democratic ambition had its empire in the South . It had two objects-to extend its empire to the isthmus on the one hand , and over the northern people on the other : The one idea was subordinate to the other . Democratic ambition with a leaning toward England , hated the industrial prosperity of the North . With a majority in the Senate , it might control that industry and keep it under foot : but such a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : thus the scheme of conquest worked harmoniously together with the desire of political aggrandisernent : The one supported the other they are the right and left lmnd of Southern democratic policy , '  --  a policy copying Great Britain and leaning toward her as the great example and patron , and which , while it affects to denounce her aristocracy copies them in all respects and will never rest until to mitation it has added alliance and subordination . There was one element which the war faction of the South , the bitter-endists as they are aptly styled ,  --  doubtless in prophetic allusion to that bitter and calamitous end which awaits their present career ,  - -  omitted in their calculations one element of prodigious weight in political affairs and that was the clement of Chance  --  the political name for Providence . Providence had in view quite other objects than theirs . A bitter end was in store-exile and de stitution for the unfortunate who sought fortune in the new territories-exile and deprivation for the sake of gold : The fortunate negro was in this instance spared , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ,  --  to toil and sweat in the gold pits of California under the lash of necessity and the pitiless spur of avarice . It was not then the machinations of Llyod Garrison , mysterious dictator of the nation 's fate , nor the voice of the anti-syren that made unfortunate California a free State , and substituted there white unfortunatas for black ones ; it was a power over which neither South nor North could exercise the least control . They who make war upon the North because the North was inactive in providing a territorial government for California , whose veins are swollen with the spirit of revenge , because the horrible toil of the gold-hunter were spared to the African and inflicted on his master let them spend their imprecations where they belong ; upon the blindness , the folly and the cupidity of man ; and not upon the " masterly inactivity , " absurdly styled , of Northern legislators . Col. Fremont , it is charged , procured the anti-slavery clause to be inserted in the Constitution of California , in order to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and with that intention , he showed but little foresight . california without the clause might have come in , at her first application for admission ; let the Nashville Conventionists revenge themselves on Col. Fremont then-he is a democrat of their own school . And now comes the last and the worst , the grievance of grievances  --  the failure in regard to New Mexico ; they wished to colonize New Mexico with blacks ; they wished to have a territorial government established over New Mexico , which should give sufficient protection to them in their efforts to establish slavery upon that territory . Of Texas they were sure . They had the guarantee of the nation for the admission of six more votes in the Senate , as soon as Texas could send them ; that State has the privilege guaranteed her by the nation , of sending eight senators to the national counsel , as soon as she is able to send them : that is to say , as soon as she is able to divide her population into // August , four States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this procedure , for , as they are a constitutional and a lawloving people , they must abide by the terms of annexation . Previous to the declaration of war with Mexico , the people of Texas , then an independent State at war with Mexico , passed a law by which they declared that the territory of New Mexico , a part of the country with which they were at war , should be included within their own boundaries : It was a declaration founded on a supposed right and preparatory to a conquest . Before the Texans had succeeded in making their pretensions good , they were annexed to the United States . The first subsequent effort on the part of the United States was to find an equitable boundary ; this effort failed through the refusal of Mexico to negotiate . The grounds of her refusal have been elsewhere discussed . The event of the war as was expected , was unfavorable to her ; it was thought desirable to have our territories extended to the shores of the Pacific . By cession and purchase , the territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possessions of the United States . Texas then said to us , Since you made war for us , what we claimed before the war , and which you have conquered from our enemy , belongs to us ; we laid claim to New Mexico , and we reassert our claim ; if our claim was just before the war , it is good after it . We are told by Southern bitter-endists that the beginning of all our trouble , the beginning of the end , is in this quarrel between the people of New Mexico , who wish to organize a separate State , and the Texans who claim to have a right to extend their laws over them . Because a few thousand adventurers in Texas claim to be the governors of a few thousand in New Mexico , are the affairs of a nation of twenty millions to be thrown into hopeless confusion , and a civil war to be begun between the North and South , to end , as it is claimed , in mutual destruction ? Is this the wisdom of our Nashville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wish to make New Mexico a State ? Why , Texas herself is proposing to divide her own territory into States ? If this policy is the legitimate fruit of the institution of slavery , no wonder then that Republicans hate sia very and pronounce it the direfulest curse that ever visited mankind . Why , in such a war as must follow , by the will of our Nashville Conventionists , upon this miserable border skirmish , more men would be destroyed in the space of a year , more capital be wasted in the South , more negroes set free for want of masters , and more courage and fury , idly expended , than would suffice to conquer all Mexico , and colonize half a dozen puny States like Santa Fe . Men enough fell in Mexico to build a new State in the wilderness ; money enough was expended to put such a State under cultivation , and stock it with x*egroes or with cattle . Men threaten war because they think it a brave thing , and patriotic ; but courage is not so very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be so eager to display it : nor is there necessarily any connection between ferocity and patriotism , nor any credit in despair ; and when the desperation is either feigned or foolish , it is even discreditable and contemptible . All men know that Southern men make good soldiers-perhaps as good as any in the world  --  and it is surely not necessary that entire populations should be destroyed and rooted out in order to prove what all men believe , that the South is full of testy and valiant fighting men . The South wishes to have a territorial government established over New Mexico for the protection of slave immigration into that territory , or , as they express it , to give them an equal chance with the North to occupy their share of the newly acquired territory . They demand also the establishment of a territorial government over the lower half of California , and for the same reason . We can discover no objections to the granting of these demands , beyond those which arise out of the Southern doctrine itself , that the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving it to the people of the territories , organized as States , to determine for themselves , whether slavery shall be allowed or suppressed . The South can not fail to perceive that the establishment of a territorial government for the avowed and express purpose of protecting a particular species of emigration , contrary to the wish of the // people who are already occupants of the territory ; - as are the people of New Mexico and California ,  --  would be in violation of the Democratic principle , that the general government ought not to interfere either for the establishment or for the abolition of slavery . It is very possible that by acceding to the wishes of of the people of New Mexico and of Southern California , the South may sacrifice her chance of converting those territories into slave states ; but we hold that she is a gainer thereby , notwithstanding this apparent loss , by the whole extent and value of the rule thereby established . If the South , under pretence of establishing a territorial government , for the better regulating and disciplining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of the general government , a precedent of interference , she gains , perhaps , the introduction of slaves for a brief period in Southern California and New Mexico , without any evident profit to herself , but she loses all the ground for which she has been contending sinee the beginning of this controvercy ; she establishes the right of the general government to use means for the introduction as well as for the suppression of slavery ; she also precipitates the creation and annexation of New States on the Northern side , created and annexed merely to maintain the balance of power ; an operation by which nothing is gained , and a great deal is lost as it is better not to begin the battle rather than to conquer first merely to be conquored again . If on the other hand , the people of the South coneede freely to the people of Southern California the right of judging for themselves in this matter , and to the people of New Mexico the same right , they have established for themselves a preeedent of infinite value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually and forever abolished , and the freedom of local sovereignties established beyond the possibility of disturbanee . If the power of a local sovereignty is conferred upon it by the general government , there is some shadow of an argument that the general government might , upon occasion , resume the power it had conceded . If on the other hand , the demoeratic prineiple is allowed , that the local sovereignty is indigenous , and inheres in the citizen , potentially at least , from the moment of his becoming an occupant of the soil , not only are the rights of the people of New Mexico to defend their territory established , and those of the people of Southern California , but those also of the inhabitants of every state of the Union , and of every territory . Local government begins , and local soverei* , nty is conferred , as soon as the people have assembled in such numbers and force as to organize a state . From that moment their rights in regard to domestic institutions are not to be disputed . Of what incalculable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become , when the admission of new states on the Southern side of the Union begins to be agitated . The present generation will probably behold the disintegration of the Mexican Republic ; the independence of the West Indian Islands , or at least of Cuba and Porto Rico . New states will be formed out of these territories , then become independent , which will apply for admission to the Union ; the application will be voluntary ; these new states will seek protection at our hands ; - protection against their own internal disorders . Let the principle be once established that the right of local legislation shall be acknowledged from the beginning , independently of all preparatory and territorial government , the dangers of civil war and of a second crisis like the present , will be forever averted . But that is not all . By making this concession , or rather by establishing for themselves this immovable precedent , the Southern states will have built for themselces a wall of protection and a foundation of security for all time . They will have established the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereafter , nothing but revolution could disturb them . On mature consideration we can not but admit with Calhoun , that the establishment of a line of compromise is equivalent to the establishment of a fundamental law for the suppression of slavery . A certain degree of latitude is talked of as a line which shall be extended to the Pacific . By its establishment there is a seeming gain on the part of the South , and yet in conceding it , the South will con- // cede also the principle which it involves , namely , that the general government has power to prepare the territories for the reception of a free or slave population . We have hitherto argued that government does possess this power , and we believe it to be congenial to the nature and character of all governments . Under the circumstances however , and with an eye to the future , we feel ready to adopt the policy , though not the argument of Calhoun ; as an argument , we hold it incapable of de-. fense , as a policy we desire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us consider for a moment the tre effects of the establishment of such a line . A portion of California will be cut off upon the north , and a portion of New Mexico , including , of course , Santa Fe ; and by the establishment of this line , as effectually as by any Wilmot proviso , the severed parts will be protected against the introduction of slaves . Southern California and Southern New Mexico , on the other hand , are given over to slave immijation ; that is to say , a proslavery proviso has been imposed south of the line , and a Wilmot proviso north of it . Such must be the effects of this linear legislation , if it is to have any effects ,  --  if it is not a mere tub to the whale . If it has effects , it interferes with the cherished principle of the South , and exhibits a regulative power over the domestic affairs of the people . It is a species of preparatory legislation , creating Northern and Southern interests . As we have before said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line : but always with the reservation , that the effect which it is intended to produce shall be nullified by the speedy admission of the territories into the system of the Union . We are by no means of opinion that it is judicious or expedient for North or South to adopt any extended system of preparatory legislation . We believe that nature and circumstance will sufficiently legislate for the territories , and that the people had better be left to themselves , to adopt such form of government , and such institutions , as they please , that coming generations may thereby escape the horrors of civil war . The Wilinot proviso , instead of adopting a parallel of latitude , adopts an existing boundary . A line of compromise is but a modification of the proviso ; as a measure of peace , we would concede it ; but only on condition that no unfair advantage be hereafter taken of it ; that it shall not impede the admission of the new States ; that it shall not he a shield for aggression ; that it shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of new States after their admission ; that in case the people of Northern *7ai*fornia , or the people of Sante Fe , shall in future see fit to tolerate slavery within their limits , or the people south of the line see fit to exclude it , no proviso whatsoever , nor any adopted parallel of latitude , shall be brought forward as a reason of interference with . them in the free exercise of their sovereign rights as States . Temporizing and partial legislation such as this of a line of division , will not avert evil from the future . Not many years will have elapsed before new difficulties , more formidable than the present , will have arisen to distract us if we temporize with the evils of the present crisis . It is the misfortune of all young governments , that they have no precedents nor principles ; and that is our misfortune . We have a theory , but we have no precedents ; we have a constitution , but we have no governmental policy . Our fault is , that we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the turmoil and the necessities of to-day ; we talk of government as though it were an experiment ; but men can not make experiments with nations ; we might as well put our hand to the wheels of the universe . It is God alone who can experiment with nations . Look at the other side , if you wish to see signs of dissolution ; it is there , if any where , that experiments are tried , and not amongst ourselves . Ours is , at this moment , the most solid government on the face of the earth ; it is an integral member of the commonwealth of nations , and its place in history is already taken and established . The American Republic is not an experiment , it is a divine necessity . While , in a spirit of conciliation , we endeavor to compose the differences which at present agitate us , it is surely wise ,  --  it is becoming  --  to regard also the remote future . The act of union and naturalization has yet to be completed . The theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its // spirit . Every man to whom the helm of state is entrusted , or any part in the manage ment of public affairs , if he be a true Republican , and worthy of the country to which he owes his existence and his liberty , will look upon himself as in some measure a defender of the Republic . He has its principles and its laws at heart ; its glory and its emoluments are his ; its wealth and its prosperity are his . The manly enjoyments of his life , those which flow out of self-respect and conscious freedom ; - these happinesses he derives from it , and for these he returns his love for his country ,  --  his patriotism . It is a day of conciliation . The power of the Republic has passed into new hands , worthy and able to receive it ; the most venerable names of the age are placed by circumstance and by choice of the people over the responsibilities of affairs . For the party now in power it is an epoch of glory and of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is a day of principle , also . The men to whom the nation looks at this moment for pacification and defence against the fury of faction , have earned for themselves already the highest honors of statesmanship . To their reputation nothing can be added , save the honor of presiding successfully over the present crisis . Premising so much of the spirit and principles which actuate us in this controversy , we propose , for the serious consideration of our readers , the following hints toward a plan of conciliation : Since , as far as we are acquainted with it , the feeling of the North is less than ever ready to concede anything of the ground it has taken , and the adjustment of the affair by the withdrawal of opposition on that side or on the other , is quite hopeless , let us a.gree upon an armistice , and for a time declare a truce to all hostilities . If the truce be only for a day , it will give us time for reflection ; in that brief interval there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our conquests , and weigh our losses . Perhaps it will be found , when the roar of the conflict is stilled , and the smoke of battle has somewhat cleared away , that we have been wasting our powers to no purpose ; that the controversy is being decided by no effort of ours , but by the silent and irresistible movement of events and farces over which we have no control . The first trace in the outlines of a plan for conciliation , which we submit to our readers of the adverse factions , will be simply the acceptance of that fundamental and well considered rule , I. That the power of protecting , ameliorating , or abolishing , institutions of caste in a State , lies with the people of that State , and not with the people of any other State ,  --  rnuch less with the nation . The people of Massachusetts can not legislate for the people of Carolina , nor these two together for any other State . The representatives of all the States assembled may legislate for interests common to the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local emancip*tion belongs to local sovereignty , and can not be exercised by the imperial or general sovereignty . The States of California , the Mormon State of Deseret , with that of New Mexico , although not admitted to the Union , are , nevertheless , organized in some degree , and have a body of laws . The public domain in these States , excepting such parts as may be conceded to the State of Texas , belongs , of course , to the United States , and they are under the protection of the general government . The claim of Texas being either satisfied , or set aside , as it may happen , it will become necessary to extend the protection of the General Government over New Mexico . That State has population , wealth , to a certain degree ; an old constitution , and one but just now formed to supersede it ; she has , in short , every thing that belongs to a State . She is subordinate to the Union indeed , and had not her people shown themselves organically able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereignty over per*ons in her territory would have lodged in the United States . But as circumstances now are , the imposition of laws by the general government beyond what is necessary for protection , and the accomplishment of the ends of national government over all the States , would be , indeed , a virtual usurpation-an usurpation not within the letter of the law , but certainly within its spirit . We now eome to our second hint toward a plan of conciliation ; which is embraced in the following proposition : II . // tn a State , asking admission to the Union , shall not in future be raised as a bar to its admission . The new States of New Mexico and California are seeking admission to the Union ; other States , formed out of the territory of Texas , will infuture be seeking admission . In accordance with the principle that the power of local emancipation , or of the abolition or protection of castes , belongs to the local sovereignties , let it be understood , that the establishment of a territorial government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forcing the inclinations of the people and imposing upon them an uncongenial constitution . Laying aside , on our part , all pretentions to a general authority or control over the wishes of the rising sovereignties of the South and West , and believing that in future the establishment of territorial governments will rarely or never be called for , we have offered the above hint toward conciliation . Casting an eye over the probabilities of the future , let us see what we have in prospect : and first , there is no probability , should the Canadas seek admission to the Union , of their asking for a territorial government ; - they will come in as States . On the South , should any portion of Mexico or of the West India Islands seek admission to the Union , they will come in as organized States , as in the case of Texas . The extension of a proslavery or of an anti-slavery proviso over the people of these new States , and more especially over those which are to be formed out of the territory of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be utterly impossible to extend any such proviso . Slavery will have been already either established or abolished , previous to admission , in every State that will hereafter seek admission to the Union-wbich brings us to our third hint towards conciliation : III . That our knowledge of the mode in which the people of any new State applying for admission to the Union , intend to use the power guaranteed to them by their admission , shall not be admitted in Congress as an argument for or against their admission . The admission of a State into the Union is an effectual and perfect guaranty to it of protection in the exercise of its local sovereignty . Ought it then , in the process of admission , in the process of establishing its unquestionable powers , to be forestalled in the exercise of those powers ? If a certain authority is lodged with the people of a State applying for admission , and of right belongs to that people , ought they to be forestalled in the exercise of that authority at the moment when they arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them by the nation ? The establishment of a territorial government is in order to assist the people of a territory in the free organization of themselves as a State , and not directly or indirectly to impress them with the sentiments and desires of other States , or to bias them in the adoption of any particular code or fundamental law : therefore , as a hint toward conciliation , we propose , iv . That it shall be understood in future as the established policy of the general government , that while the people of any and of all the States shall be permitted to exert all lawful means of persuasion , to induce the people of new States to establish this or that form of local sovereignty , it shall not be within the power *f the general government to establish a territorial sway jor the direct purpose of influencing the local institutions of the rising sovereignty . We conceive that the extension of slavery over new territories is an evil to be depricated , but , under the circumstances , and in view of all that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer the above hint toward conciliation . If the principle is adopted by the body of the Whig party that no particular system shall , by any political machinations or contrivances , be forced upon any people who may in future seek admission to the Union ; but if that people do voluntarily and of their own accord , exercising therein the sovereignty which belongs to them in common with all other States , tolerate or suppress institutions allowed in other States , they shall not , because of such conduct , be outlawed and excluded from the empire . There will then be a possibility of peace and unanimity in the party of union , and on no other ground that we can at present discover . The imposition of a territoral government , for the avowed purpose of establish- // ing or of suppressing slavery , would be an assumption on the part of Congress of a power strictly within the letter of the Constitution , but which is not in accordance with the general principles of popular and local liberty . In California , the people have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either for the establishment or suppression of negro slavery , was extended over them . The people of New Mexico are in the same position , and have exercised the same liberty . Earnestly as we dread and depricate the extension of slavery , even over countries fitted by nature to receive it , we are , nevertheless , satisfied that all legislative action to prevent it , as well as to establish it , either by territorial proviso or by other measures akin to that , will in future be of no avail . Let us suppose that a general proviso for the establishment of slavery south of a certain line , or within the territoty of Texas , had been adopted , and that afterward the people of a new State formed within that territory should apply for admission , with a general law prohibiting slavery incorporated into their constitution ; - would it be possible for us to refuse them admission ? Or if , on the other hand , a new State , with slavery established by its constitution , were to apply , in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were to apply again , with the obnoxious law erased from its statutes , and it were then admitted , an equal , sovereign State among the rest ,  --  would anything be gained by such a procedure ? Would not this new State , with full powers of sovereignty guaranteed to it by its admission , be on a perfect equality with other States , notwithstanding all provisos ? and would not its people have the power , under that equality and guaranty , to revise their constitution and re-establish slaveholders in their rights - if not over slaves recently emancipated , yet over others afterward introduced ? New Mexico and California present themselves as free States ; - they will perhaps be admitted as free States ; and yet , they have in reserve the power of revising their own constitutions , and in future of tolerating slavery within their proper limits . This power they will exercise on an equality with their sister States . Can anything be more obvious than the fruitlessness and the mischief of all attempts on the part of the general government , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the establishment or prevention of slavery , where the people themselves are already organized and able to regulate their own affairs . Agitation in or out of Congress , in this direction , ought therefore to be indefinitely suspended , since , however desirable or however honest the ends proposed by the agitators , their action can not affect the final issue . As a fifth hint towards conciliation , we propose ; That the people of the Southern States in a spirit oJ conciliation and in sincere amity , do take into consideration and estimate for themselves the probable good which may accrue to the nation by the suppression of the slave trafflc in the District of Columbia . While the people of the South insist upon the continuance of this traffic , they insist upon the continuance of agitation , and the constant deepening of sentiments of hostility on the side of the North . Whatever course they may pursue among themselves , in regard to the traffic in slaves , they can not fail to see , that its continuance in a territory which is common to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerableinsult to the Northern , Western , and Eastern populations ; and that its continuance there , of trifling benefit to themselves , exasperates the entire nation , and k cepsup a feeling which no concession on their part can ever cure . To the stability of their institutions it adds nothing , but rather enfeebles them , by arraying against them the sentiments of the civilized world . Slaveholders know that the traffic in slaves is the worst feature in their institutions , and is injurious in a high degree , even to themselves . Sentiments of decency , considerations of interest , and , above all , of patriotism , should inspire them with the resolution to suppress , as speedily as possible , this great original cause of dissention and agitation . Our sixth hint towards conciliation , touches the quarrel between Texas and New Mexico , a quarrel which is fast ripening into a war between two distinct populations , one recently admitted , the other not yet admitted under the guarantees of the constitution . // The territory contended for by Texas belonged originally to Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cession to the United States . Texas had , indeed , passed a law that tbe territory should be hers ; negotiations were set on foot by the United States for the settlement of the claims of Texas ; these negotiations were rejected by the government of Mexico , and a Mexican army advanced to the line of the disputed territory . That army was met and defeated by the army of observation sent thither by the United States . A general war ensued . Mexico was invaded and overcome . She then , for the first time , entered upon negotiations . It was considered desirable for the United States to possess a larger territory . As a measure of peace and conciliation , Mexico ceded to the United States her territory of New Mexico , an integral part of her Republic . By the same act she ceded California , and the boundary between the United States and Mexico was fixed on the Rio Graude , and other lines convenient for the separation of the two Republics . The treaty of session was not with Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , OOO , ooo was paid , not by Texas , but by the United States . If a conquest was made , it was not made by Texas , and if New Mexico is a conquest , she belongs in right of conquest to the con August , quering power ; and if Texas is to be her possessor , Texas must either conquer her from the United States , or must obtain her by treaty or cession from that power . The United States has power to cede territory to a State , and States may cede territory to the nation ; but the claim of Texas made before the war was not established by conquest , nor was there any bargain between the people of Texas and the nation at large that the conquered territory should belong to Texas . Let New Mexico , with suitable boundaries , , ascertained by the lawful and usual enquiries , be in good time establibhed in her rights , as a Territory ; and if it can be proved that , through any irregularity or misunderstanding , the people of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the treaty , let them receive compensation , double and even three-fold compensation , if that be necessary for a pacification of the Union ; and if a balance of injuries and a compromise of rights must of necessity enter into the settlement of this controversy , let the concession of more thanher ascertained rights to the State of Texas be set off against concessions on the part of the South . With the measure and the extent of those mutual concessions we mean not to meddle . Concession should be met by concession , or it is no concession .
