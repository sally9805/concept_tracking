txt HE other afternoon , as we were slowly plodI ding up Broadway in the drizzle , we heard a loud noise , which apparently proceeded from an angry man . Looking in at the doors and up at the windows we could see nothing , and so supposed that we were mistaken , and that no man was angry . But after the noise had been repeated several times at intervals , and no one had turned to remark it or ascertain the cause , we supposed , of course , that it was a disagreeable ringing in our ears . At length a woman , evidently very weary , stopped an omnibus and stepped off the sidewalk , in th mud and bustle of the street , to take her place . // Then we heard again , and from the inside of the omnibus , the same sudden , short cry , which sounded like an Indian " Ugh ! " hut which really was " Full ! " pronounced in very loud and imperative tones . The weary woman stood in the mud at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omnibus . " Full ! " shouted another passenger with unshrinking firmness . It was raining , and the woman was wet . The omnibus was full of dry men . " Full ! " shouted another chorus . The driver drew the door to with a slam . The omnihus drove oft ; and the woman crept through the mud and rain back to the sidewalk again . Do you suppose if Sir Walter Raleigh , or Sir Philip Sidney , or the Chevalier Bayard , or Sir Roger de Coverley had , been in that stage , that the woman would have crept back to the sidewalk in the mud and rain ? Do you suppose that the members of the chorus inside , who shouted " Full ! " with such unanimity , although they had each a good sixpence in pocket to pay for his seat , and meant honestly to pay , were gentlemen in the sense of the men whose names decorate any page upon which they appear ? It may he difficult for the members of the chorus to see that they will none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any solo part in the consideration and respect of the community , until they have a breadth of style and a generosity of method which they have not yet betrayed . This is the old story . The Easy Chair rememhers very well having preached sermons from this text before . But remember that in this sinful world the churches are open twice every Sunday , and there is a perpetual sermon-hattery against many things which yet are very Malakoffs , and do not fall . Therefore they must be cannonaded until they do . If we act as boors and are not reproved , we may come to imagine that the world does not notice our coarseness and selfishness . The ostrich , von remember , hides its head and believes that it has effectually concealed itself . It is in the details of life that character is shown . A man may go out very bravely to be beheaded if the world looks on in pity or interest , hut he may be a very disagreeable companion if the cobbler has left a peg in his shoe . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests whom he has invited , and has reasons for honoring . How is he to the servant behind his chair ? How was he to the woman who looked into the full omnibus ? It is the opinion of the respectahie Gunnybags , who rides a great deal in the omnibus , that women should not be allowed to stop full stages , or that if the driver is weak and holds up , the woman should be taught that she shall not boidlypresume to turn honest men out into the rain and cold , while the mutton is even now cooking or scorching at home . Gunnyhags suggests separate stages . It is intolerable , in his opinion , that women should thrust themselves in and upset all the arrangements of society . Fat women with babies and bundles and baskets-three or four women , when there is only place for one-fussy women with flounces , and fine women with hoops . Gunnyhags has fully made up his mind to shout " Full ! " at every such invasion . People may twaddle about politeness until they are red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not the women polite ? Why may not a man he as tired as a woman ? Why have women no consideration ? Why do n't they see when a stage is full , and have the decency not to stop it ? Why should we be imposed upon by women ? " Full ! " shouts Gunnyhags , and leans both hands upon the top of his cane , and fixes his mouth like the mouth of Jupiter Ammon , and looking at the piteous woman in the rain shouts again with the austerest morality- " Full Gunnybags has an idea that life is a ledger account and is to be arranged as other accounts are . When he pays for a thing  --  a share in the Gunnybags Screw and Bore Company ( of which he is President , and owns most of the stock ) , for instance , or a seat in an omnibus-he has a perfect right ' to it . But there happening to be other things in the world besides rights , he has not settled the account yet . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humane . If Gunnyhags had been in Paradise he would have answered that he was not his brother 's keeper , and he would have heard it thundered in reply that he was . You can not shake off your duties by shouting " Full ! " to an omnibus-driver . The very fury and resolution with which you do it , shows that in your heart you are conscious that you ought not to do so . It is very Quixotic to step out and give up your place , perhaps to a frowsy woman , red in the face , and with large hands , holding unsightly bundles . It is very Quixotic , but the best things go by hard names . A man who believes that men are not only not brutes but have a touch of the angel , and may be treated accordingly , is called a dreamer and a Utopian . Even the word poet is in bad odor . If a man says something to you , and you reply , " but you are such a poet , " he understands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling him he lies . Besides , the giving up your place to a young and lovely woman is not a matter upon which you can very well plume your politeness . Courtesy is not personal to the object but to the subject . If you would smilingly surrender your seat to Queen Yictoria or to Miss Demesne ( of the first circles , and only daughter of Billion Demesne , E quire ) , and not to Miss Demesne 's washerwoman , ' you are only a snob and a flunky , and not worthy to touch the fringe of the lovely Demesne 's lowest flounce . When Charles Lamb 's friend gallantly handed an apple-woman over the gutter , the act was finer than when Sir Walter Raleigh threw his gay cloak in the mud before Queen Elizabeth . The beauty of Ralei*h 's action is in his character , and we applaud it because we know he would have done the same thing to the apple-woman . Quixotic things are the very things that ought to be done . Utopia is the very country in whose discovesy we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Utopia men are as courteous as women are fair , how do you think it compares ufith a world in which twelve healthy men sit safe in an omnibus and shout " Full !

He pulled out his tablets , and was lost in intricate calculations . " Why , 0 Mumm , this perturbation ? " was the natural question we addressed to the eminent public instructor . " I will tell you why , " said he . " If you were ambling quietly along in your slippers , making your comfortable five miles a day , how would you like to have a great fellow coma swinging by in // his seven-league boots , and securing the hottest steaks and the softest beds at the tavern ? " " We should certainly grumble , 0 Mumm , " returned we . " That is just what I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we little gentlemen , distinguished orators , ' eloquent divines , ' graceful speakers , and men of fine , clear minds , ' loaded our pop-guns and made ourselves ready to startle the quietest villages , than there comes Briareus Thwackaway with a four-headed club , across the sea , which he will brandish up and down the country , felling cities , and villages , and towns  --  and where shall we and our pop-guns be ? However , there is one consolation . I have been reckoning that there must be at least two thousand lyceums in the country ; and , thank Heaven ! as there are not two thousand nights in the year , some of the others of us will have a chance . " Mumm departed , satisfied . But who would not yield to Achilles ? Of all lecturers we have ever heard  --  and in lecturing and be-lectured America are they not many ? - two men , verynnilke each other , please us most . They are Emerson and Thackeray . Emerson is a poet chanting , and Thackeray is a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ' we mean nothing small . Shakspeare was a man of the world in the sense we mean and Fielding , and Raphael . The man of the world is he who sees the facts clearly and takes them . Re does not twist things to a theory , and think it so much the worse for the facts if they do not conform . He has a fine eye and a warm heart . The moral of his life is charity and good-will . His sermon is toleration . His politics are democracy . When such a man lectures upon the world , or upon that aspect of it which is called society , we naturally all want to go and hear . If Robinson Crusoe had lectured upon Desert Islands , or upon Men Fridays , who would not have rushed for a front seat ? There is a satisfaction , too , in seeing the men to whom we owe so much pleasure , so much wisdom , as we do to the novelists and poets . Dickens sometimes goes to Birmingham or Manchester and reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England what Homer did in Greece . Would you not go to the next town to hear Scott read a chapter of Ivanhoe ? When the writers of great and good books , which are printed and read with delight , write little good books which are not printed , but which they read aloud to all who will come to hear , can there be any purer pleasure ? In that way they taste directly the fame they have justly earned , but of which they usually get only a distant and indirect recognition . The aspect of a man , his voice , his manner , help interpret him . You understand his books better when you know him . Perhaps he puts the best part of himself into his books . Perhaps he has personal weaknesses and affectations which he himself sees and despises , and will not allow to taint what he writes . but a man 's personality is always entire . Nobody is purely sincere in soul and a little affected in manner . Manners are not superficial . Their quality is determined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complexion depends upon the healthy condition of the system . If , therefore , a man is dear to us from any cause , it is natural to wish to see him . Thus lecturing has come to be lion-hunting . But hunting lions is princely sport when you can bag a royal one . It is true that a man may write a very good book VOL . XII. - No. 67. -I and a very bad lecture . But let us try them . At least let us believe when a man has written a book full of wit and wisdom , his lecture will be very likely to be witty and wise . The great charm of Thackeray 's lecturing is its simplicity . There is nothing of the schoolmaster about him . The lecture is not a sermon , nor a didactic essay . It is a series of sadly shrewd observations upon life and people . If you can work out of it any other theory than that men are fallible and that we all need to have charity and to try to do better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around which and according to which things group and arrange themselves , trace them . Thackeray seems to say that he has not found such theories-that life succeeds better without themthat it is very dangerous to trust to them . Men and states are wrecked upon theories . The truly wise men are always empirics-always governed by experience . What , after all , are our best specimens of virtue ? There are no standards . It is easy to give alms , easy to pray , easy to build buildings and found institutions , but it is not easy to be charitable , religious , and public-spirited . Thus , again , it is the sweet humanity of his lectures which is so striking . They neither shoot over nor under . They hit us just where we need to be touched . The lectures are not too fine nor speculative . They give us the tunes and the men as they really were : yet as they were in the light of a genial humanity . There are many of our friends who will have the chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them not to lose the chance . Mumm is a good lecturer , but Thwackaway is better . Mumm has what they call a great flow of words-Heaven save us - and the audience labors with him as he soars into the rhetorical empyrean , and then falls with him in a shower of golden rain . It is as good as fire-works to hear and see Mumm  --  a most pyrotechnical orator . Mumm well earns his money . But somehow the stars continue to shine when thefeu-de-joie is over . They were quite extin*uished by the brilliant burst of the rocket . But the stars will be there to-morrow night , and the loftiest and loveliest rockets-where are they ? THERE was generaljoy at the return of Dr. Kane . If " all mankind love a lover , " they do not less love a hero . His ships sailed away blown by warm wishes as well as favorable winds . Hearts went with him that were not catalogued with the crew , and there was a real hope that America should furnish the eyes that were first to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expedition failed . It went to find Sir John Franklin , and it returned without having found a trace of him . Before Dr. Kane could know it , the world knew that Sir John could never return . He had not forced the tern . ble secret of the Pole ; but somewhere in the vast icy solitude his human bones remain a monument of human heroism . If he could not pass the gate , he could lay his body before it , and thus attest the will to do it , and thus certify its final accomplishment . It was the same spirit that sent Dr. Kane . It was less the chance of finding a passage that could do nobody any good , than it was to demonstrate that Nature could not balk man with merely material impediments . Fourier , indeed , held that the defects of Nature would disappear in the degree // that men became better . In a perfectly virtuous world there would be no sandy nor icy wastes-no noisome reptiles , no material impossibility . Virtue was to melt the glaciers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mount Blanc was to lie down with the Yale of Cachmere , and the awful snows of the Himalayas were to gently cool the summer air . There should be no storms at seano violent excess of nature . In a more poetic mood , lie thought that virtue was so to refine the senses that the good man would detect each planet , as it passed , by its peculiar aroma . To Fourier th search for the Northwest Passage would have been a foregone conclusion . The way to find it , he would say , is to stay at home and bring your soul into harmony with Nature . Then the secrets of Nature would be charmed into light by your power , as snakes are charmed by music from their holes . Let men he brought into right relations with each other , and the desert of Sahara is abolished . If a man finds in this only a dream it is still beautiful . The great problems of the material world , whose solution has cost so many lives , so much anguish , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unhandsome victory of dead matter overliving spirit . A daring and poetic soul would necessarily try in some way to harmonize the possible facts with his consciousness of possible powers , and so , as of old the spheres were said to make music as they rolled  --  and the music of spheres is not so ridiculous an idea that we all laugh at it  --  the new philosopher believed that the spheres had cach their aroma-and , as they could be seen and heard , so they could be smelled . The inspiration of Sir John Franklin and Dr. Kane , the instinctive feeling that men could wrest the solution of the vexed question from the icy hold of Nature , was in kind the same instinctive pride and prophecy of the human mind that Fourier expressed . They were but various ways of asserting  --  the one practically , the other poetically-that man is the head of Nature . It is still true , although Sir John returns no more , and Kane looks for him in vain . The sphinx of ice that sits in the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her riddle , shall one day yield and confess . We are here to subdue the earth , and not to be subdued by it . Even the stars can not hide themselves , and he mountains stretch away into the clouds in vain . There is no waste of heroism . Success is not external , but it belongs to the man , or , rather , the real success is internal and consists in the growth and development of character . The success of the Arctic navigators is in their prompt and heroic obedience to a noble instinct ; and although the North will now probably be left to its own solitude , history , as she writes the story of these days , will record the names of Franklin and Kane with no less glowing fingers because they found no passage through the ice . YESTERDAY as I ( for an Easy Chair , although it has four legs , is still only a single chair ) turned out of the Battery , very much as Goidsmi * turned into the Park , the eyes of the Easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a prodigious circumference of skirt . The bonnet was a mere beau-knot of lace and ribbons , the cloak was of brilliant colors , and the whole air was that of the beautiful Miss Peacock , who is perfectly well known to all her acquaintances . HARPER 'S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . The lady sailed in so jaunty a manner along the sidewalk , that the men hurrying about their affairs , still found time to glance at her and at each other , and sometimes there seemed to be a ghost of a smile flitting over their faces . The omnibusdrivers , also , and the carmen , I observed , were gazing very intently at the show , and I could not but envy the father of the beautiful Miss Peacock , whose daughter was the object of universal attention , and especially the lover of Miss Peaco k , who could thus see that draymen were not unconscious of her charms . And so I went on , speculating how many skirts must probably go to such circumference , when , as the lady suddenly stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same moment she resumed her promenade , and turning to make the bow which every old Easy Chair is so happy to make to that b autiful young lady , I was shocked to find that it was not Miss Peacock at all , but only her old aunt , Miss December Jackdaw . Now , what right has Miss Jackdaw to wear the plumage of spring ? Would an honest woman display such false colors ? Would a truly virtuous woman of sixty try to make men , who had not yet overtaken her , believe that she was the young and beautiful Miss Peacock ? The honor of that family is concerned . If the Jackdaw branch is to ho perpetually mistaken for the genuine Peacock , where are we ? as the great statesmen put it-and where , for one , am I to go ? One thing I will not do-because I can not-I will not treat a woman , old enough to be my wife , as if she were young enough to be my daughter . That is reasonable . And if it is reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I can not pay her that kind of homage , ought she to expect it ; or ought she to show that she expects it by dressing as if she did ? Suppose this grave Easy Chair should go skippin* down Broadway in varnished boots , yellow gloves , profuse buttons and watch-chains , and a dashing amber stick . Would not those who loved him be sorry ? Would they not feel the sad incongruity between his years and his dress ? Would they not instantly say , or believe , if they did not care to say it , that he must be related to the immense family of the Popinjays ? What a family that is , and how intimately it is related to so many other families ! My eye has now become so discriminating that I can tell a Popinjay at the first glance , and even in disguise . But it is not easy to disguise the Popisijay air . It breaks out like an accent in *peaking . Nor do the family usually wish to conceal it . It was only the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of one of the poor branches . He gets six or seven hundred dollars a year as a lawyer's-clerk , and has fair prospects of advancement . Now you would naturally expect economy with that income , and you would say that a young man of sense would spare himself elaborate jewelry , and the appliances of a dandy . There are men who struggle along respectably upon that sum , even with families . A youth not extravagant in beets , and gloves , and operas , and cigars , ought to keep himself decent and presentable upon it . But if Otto were coining in to ten thousand a year , he could not be more flashy .. I look on in admiration ; but I wonder . I wonder who pays . I wonder if Otto expects to eat his cake and have it . I wonder if he does not regard the approval of wise men more than the admiration of foolish . I wonder if he // thinks that really lovely women like him better for his buttons and breeches . Of course little Ballerina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they only know men 's cravats and coats , and they never can know any thing more of them . Otto Popinjay is not an honest man . When he walks the street , his appearance says three thousand a year , and he cherishes an appearance that does not tell the truth . There are men who have done so with sinister motives . His cousin , Plume Popinjay , was enamored of a young gentleman who had wealth of waistcoats , and boots , and chains , lie was a distingu* man . He had gentlemanly manners , and melancholy eyes . Miss Plume Popinjay capitulated-only to discover that he had nothing else . " My clothes are my fortune , Ma'am , " he said . He had carried her by a brilliant broadside of waistcoat and varnished boots . I consider him a swindler . Thus it begets disagreeable suspicions when a man or woman dresses beyond his or her means or age . Late at night , in Broadway , I have seen sad parodies of this overdressing-women who are not young , nor fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Street . Also , if so much thought is given to the exterior-if , as the youth ( one of the Popinjays of the English branch ) , says in Peach , " I have given my whole mind to my tie , " you feel instinctively that there is little thought left for any thing else . Whenever I see old Miss December Jackdaw , I feel that all noble women are insulted . She brings woman in the abstract into contempt , for the reputation of the sex always suffers from the foolishness of the individual . And I , who am a lover of the sex , and who perpetually insist , not only that men are as gallant , but that women are as lovely and attractive as ever they were in any period of history , am obliged to retreat hastily from the amiable gibes of my companions when I see old Miss December approaching . I am loth to believe that a woman can do so . We forgive men many absurdities ; but we require of women that they shall maintain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not-if they are coarse , slovenly , or tawdry-if they show any suspicion of a want of self-respect or maidenly modesty-they do themselves and us a greater iujury than they believe . I am disposed to chat a momeut more upon this topic , as you sit about the Chair ; for between our hurry to do every thing quickly , and our partly natural contempt for the pompous insincerity of what is called " the old schools ' of manners , we are letting good manners go . Now manners are peculiarly human . Dogs and cats , and lions and snails , treat each other naturally and sincerely , but they have no manners . Fine manners are , in a way , the poetry of sincere intercourse . The worst manners are an imitation of this . Courtesy is not compliment . Courtesy is not strictly necessary , indeed ; but is to intercourse what fragrance is to a flower . All the uses of a flower are subserved without fragrance ; but the bloom and the odor are the best part of the flower . The main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossom is a development of the seed-vessel whish secures the perpetuity of roses , hut it is in its beauty and fragrance . This makes the rose symbolic and splendid . For although the operation of one may sometimes he beautiful , the best beauty is independent of use . It is the form and color of the cloud that charm us , and they would charm the same were there no bulging fullness of welcome shower . Thus sourtesy is pure poetry . A word from some lips is more than a speech from others . Good manners are only to be fostered by encouraging good feeling . Good feelings do not by any means always produce beautiful manners . Indeed , there is a certain veneer of elegance , a polish which has nothing to do with heart and character , and yet which is courtly , and graseful , and attractive . Bad men have often good manners . But that is only saying that a snake is fascinating . A beautiful woman is also fascinating , and the difference is not hard to detect . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and superciliousness for elegance . Simplicity is the crown of excellence , and there is nothing more simple than truly beautiful manners . The difficulty is , tlsat if you think of it , you become self-conscious and lose it . But if there be any way of getting what is so desirable and lovely , it is by carefully eschewing both the morals and the manners of the Popinjay family . Wimax Sir Walter Scott was King of the Novel , every fresh volume of his was looked for with universal interest , and seemed to be an affair of great public interest . Perhaps some belated reader grieves that he did not livs in those days of grand excitement . But if he will remember that there are now two great novelists in England , and that as one has just finished his story , the other begins his , he may discover that he does not live in so pitiable a year . For my part , I am content to live now . There seems to be as much real interest in the announcement of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in Scott 's day . It is the rap of a friend at the door when Dickens announces a new book . The heart leaps like a girl at her lover 's footstep , and quickly cries , " Come in ! " lie does come in , and how we lau*h and cry ! How various , how affluent , how good he is ! It does not seem necessary to argue elaborately whether he or Thackeray be the greatest genius . The world is very wide . Dickens is a man who must be welcome in all manly , all childlike hearts . If people were glad when Sir Walter Scott published a book , what should they be now ? And , say what we will , a serial is good ; a serial ss very good , as Touchstone would have it . A serial is strictly the growth of modern time , of an improved press , of a diffused education , of a universally reading nation . The great fact about America is that we are a reading people . Foreigners see this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how to dispose of business , and two or three histories , and two or three good novels , at the same time ; novels no more to be missed by a right-minded man , than Pamela , in its day , or Guy Mannering . When Buiwer , and Dickens , and Thackeray , and how many French people , are writing stories and memoirs , how are they all to be compassed ? Easily , in the seriaL You brc*akfast on Thackeray , you dine on Dickens , you tea and toast on Buiwer . That is , you have a spare half hour , an odd quarter , before and after , which you bestow upon those authors . In that way it was possible to read " My Novel , " " Pendennis , " and " David Copperfield . " And yet , when they were completed , what a huge pile of volumes it was // Who could have undertaken that ? Ask your neighbors , and ascertain how many who did not read those hooks as they were published , have read them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serially . They forget who wants to marry whom . Now it does n't make much matter to such people , when , how , or what they read . Books are not written for such intellectual cullenders . If a novel , or any thing else , is worth reading , it is worth understanding . Nobody who lately read " The Newcomes , " was in any doubt whom Olive wanted to marry , and he had a shrewd suspicion where Ethel 's heart was . Readers who complain of serials have not learned the first wish of an epicure  --  a long , long throat . It is the serial which lengthens the throat so that the feast lasts a year or two yearr . You taste it all the way down . You return to it . You have time to look back , to look over . As in life , you can sit , as the number ends , as you sit when the door closes , and muse upon what follows . Your fancy goes on and draws the beautiful result . Or your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A serial novel has the great advantage of drawing the author back to nature . He can not cook up a plot . He can not waste his brains devising arrangements and surprises . The interest must be sustained in the novel as it is out of novels . It must be an interest of character , and that is , properly speaking , the domain of the novel . In fact , it is in our day that the novel has returned to its proper sphere . It had been long lost in the mazes of romance , or the darker realms of moral and political speculation . Do you remember Plumer Ward 's " Tremaine ? " Are you not visited by the vision of a body of divinity when you recall it ? Was ever a lover so won , except when John Buncle won his wives , polemically ? It is as true in literary art as in all other , that the great works are based upon Nature . The men who do the things that are remembered and are full of influence , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy the Greek ? But whom did the Greeks copy ? They copied Natures and therefore they seem excellent to the artists . The modern novel does the same thing . It takes the life of to-day , and builds upon it as the French vaudeville does . And why is the French vaudeville the only living drama ? Because it is studied carefully and closely from life . So , at the beginning , be advised to read the new story of Dickens in serial parts-even in these pages . It will have a freshness of interest you can not otherwise conceive . Besides , it is written so . Each number is intended to end where it ends , and no longer , as in old times , to pause upon a moment of horror , just as the robber was tumbling through the window , or , more breathlessly , just as A*lolphus Augustus was going down upon his knee --  " to he continued . " Now , every number has a certain kind of completeness . Stories , like life , have exigencies . Sometimes it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely - how sail between the Scylla of Papa , and the Mamma Charybdis . That is the natural excitement of life  --  and so it is of the serial story . It is not gotten up . It is not patched up . It is the simple working . If you doubt it , try the experiment with the new story , which is to be commenced in our January Number , and regularly continued , with the *ngraviii'g . Why not be sure of a laugh once a month , or of a tear , if your name is Laura Matilda ? Be well advised , and read the new serial of Dickens . Iv really seems a pity that Mr. Pfeil may not burn the body of Mrs. Pfeil , if that lady desires it , and especially requests it , before her decease .

Why , if she wished to have it burned-as the wisest and most cultivated of nations had long the practice-should it not only not be done , but some newspapers fabricate lamentable complaints of monstrosity and moral delin-quency ? If the papers which have poured out wrath upon a man for a recent effort to burn a body-which to our fancy is much the most agreeable way of disposing of the dead-really wish a good subject of anathema , they may find it in those Black-holes , the Western cars , in winter .

How long are there to be no cars for people who want fresh air and not foul air ? for people who are willing to close the window if your wife is really ill , and requires that it should be closed ; or if you are an emigrant , and your wife has not clothing enough ?

She moves around as quietly as a whale in deep waters . It is a text for a careful sermon , not the motto of a paragraph . An election-day , in a republic , is , ideally , one of the greatest days of history . But facts are so inferior ! There is always such a sad discrepancy between the political enthusiast 's dream of an election and the morning revelation of the booths ! It was so when Hogarth painted ; it is so when the December Number of harper is printed . There is such ardent huzzaing-of men who are desperately angling for the fishes , having long since consumed the loaves . There is such sincere saving of the country by masked assassins . There is such purity of principle-among men who buy and sell voters . There is such patriotism-in the mouth . There is such devotion  --  to one 's own interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

WE are jogging on , through this November weather , toward  --  the end of the world . Nobody doubts the fact ; and it would hardly be worth making a note of , even in our budget of trifles , if our foreign wiseacres-speaking through the papers and otherwheres-had not startled us by saying that we have but a little more space to jog over  - -  only a few more of these rustling Novembersand then the last leaf will fall , and the world whisk away in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you bind the years in couplets , eighteen ) of Her er 's Magazine , and then the Easy Chair will be rolled away , the Drawer stick for aye , and the Table break down ! I At least so says the Rev. Dr. Cumming ; and he is a man by whose opinions a great multitude pin their faith . In the year 1865 , he tells us , the world will have accomplished its tale of years ; the last seal will be unbroken , and the heavens roll away like a scroll . And pray who is Dr. Gumming , who ventures to put this sudden limit to our gossip , and to say that after a single decade of years we can be garrulous from our Chair no more forever ? He is a learned Scotch preacher , who draws on every Sabbath-day , in London , great crowds to listen to his eloquence ; and who , until this eccentricity of belief grew on him , was accounted among the most orthodox of the most orthodox Free Church of Scotland . We remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exeter Hall with his voice , and with such rare art of language-bearing such earnestness of thought , that the crowd listened like an audience of Rachel 's Camile . It would be reasonable to suppose that such a man would carry a greater train of fellow-thinkers after him than our old friend Miller . ( Pray , is Mr. Miller dead ? ) And yet we doubt the fact . It is odd enough , but true , that practical and commonsense people as we are , we follow after strangenesses and newnesses with snore greed and in greater flocks than any people of the world . We recruit Salt Lake cities , and build Mormon temples , and sacrifice to Free Love and Mr. Brisbane , and inoculate ourselves with mores saulticeel or Shanghai . fevers , and entertain moon-hoaxes with more liberality and warmth than any creatures elsewhere . And therefore it is we think it more than probable that the parish of Dr. Gumming will presently be extending itself on our side of the water , and our eager hunters after novelty , tired with repeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace the doctrinal reading of the Scotch divine , and pin their faith to the grand issue of 1865 . At the risk of setting ourselves forward as the inaugurators of the new Millerism on this side of the water , we beg to note down one or two contingent facts , which seem to illustrate the theory of Dr. Gumming . First of all , the great war trails its shadow over Eastern Europe , darkening the Euxine , darkening the great city founded by the Christian Emperor , darkening the far-off households of England , and darkening every where the aims and ends of civilization . We have the battle-murder by thousands ; we have the desolated fields ; we have the conscription rolling off its tens of thousands from the peaceful pursuits of agriculture ; we have the Crescent of Mahomet going down in blood ; we have the twin-crosses of Greece and Rome fighting for the final victory ; we have the sturdy sovereignty of Britain shaking unsteadily in its water realm ; we have the great land of China in fearful ferment ; we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Africa penetrated ; we have the great Arctic mysteries solved ; and lastly , we have our own turbid politics , bigger with threats than ever before . Nor is this all : Death was never busier doing his part for the final consummation . Pestilence is even now knocking at the doors of France . If the war is taking its tens of thousands , the cholera can boast its thousands . And nearer home , the vomit-plague is hanging in the wintry air , floating northward . What shall be said , moreover , of the fail ing crops // of Europe , and of the foreboded deterioration in the productive qualities of all grains ? What if disease is to ravage our wheat lands , as it has our potato fields ? In short , does not enough threaten to make the warning of the Scotch preacher reach widely and loudly ? And yet , setting the prophecy by , who among us can count with assurance on ten years more of life ? There are those alarmists , besides the Doctor , who extend our lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . The year 2000 , when it arrives , will top the history of dates , and none of the living ( it is very certain ) will welcome the year 2001 . It will be an even stopping-point ; and men may close theirjournals squarely with such a round date as 2000 . Meantime , how goes the European world ? Not frightened , surely , by any such prognostics as these , but yet feeling sorely the shortened supplies which the land gives , and peering doubtfully into the war-clouds which shroud the - Eastern horizon . France , mercurial as ever , although her harvests are the shortest and her bank the poorest , is yet meeting adversity with light-hearted hopes . The Eastern venture seems full of promise . The French hospitals are rising fast into the strength of barracks upon the shores of the Dardanelles . The prestige of the Malakoff is not lost upon the weak Osmanlee . Lord Stratford , with his cunning diplomacy , is day by day losing ground , and is making matters all the worse by venting his spleen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to ratify with his presence the celebration of the Te Deum in honor of the Malakofl at Constantinople ; and there are rumors whispered in court-circles , that the Emperor , who manages the war for England , has demanded his recall . But the time has not ripened yet for a severance of the two great Western interests . The spoils have not yet their accumulated weight ; the Turk has not yet withered away utterly , and the Austrian still hangs too threateningly on the Transylvanian mountains . Nay , there is even newspaper talk ( not to be credited over much ) that the alliance is to be drawn closer than ever by the marriage of the Prince Napoleon with the Princess Alice of England . The bare fact that such rumors should be credited for a moment is evidence of a singular union of political ties ; but , to our thinking , the old home character of John Bull will reluctate greatly to add this crowning seal to the war alliance . There is this beautiful feature in British loyalty , that it wraps itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of domestic devotion , and is as tender of their interests , and jealous of their honor , and careful of their affections , as if they formed a patriarchate , with blood-ties to every man and woman in the realm . This home loyalty , it seems to us , would be greatly outraged at the thought of binding the blooming girl , Princess of England , who has found health among the heather of the Highlands , and a pure faith under the arches of Protestant Kirks , to the profligate Prince Napoleon . There would be no rejoicing bonfires for the consummation of such a union . And with our memory resting pleasantly upon the ruddy , cheerful face of the little Alice , as we have caught sight of her upon the Long Walk of Windsor , we prefer to think the story an idle creation of the newsmongers . IN our other-side grouping of news , we inns not fail to note the new action of the European republicans , who , tired at length with their long and fruitless waiting , have issued proclamation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , the existing dynasties . It is a proclamation easier to issue than to act upon . The old Radetsky , though touching upon his ninetieth year , is still watchful of the Lombard fortresses , and there seems no present hope for the republicans of Italy . Manin , who defended so gloriously the little State of Venice , has , it would seem , sacrificed his Venetian pride to whatever may promote the union and prosperity of Italy . He has openly declared his willingness to rally to a Sardinian standard , whenever that standard-whether borne by a king or a republic-shall be raised for the union and the freedom of Italy . It is noticeable , moreover , that his letter to this *ffect has been published without provoking the retributive action of the imperial censors of Paris . It would seem that the Emperor was growing less tender of the feelings and sympathies of his imperial brother of Austria . If the generous impulses and common-sense actions of President Manin were more currently entertained by Italians , there would be far more hope for Italy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which prompts an Italian to declare first of all for independence . Republic or monarchy - Sardinian or Romish ascendance , are issues far inferior in importance to the grand one proposed by Manin , of freedom from Austrian tyranny . BEFORE this will meet the eye of the reader , we shall know what are the verdicts in the great Court of Industry , and how America stands in the list of inventive honors . We can promise onselves , already , the comforting assurance that our country will have merited and received reward in what relates to those commoner arts of life , toward which a new country ought to direst its more constant thought . Our reaping-machine will stand high , if not the highest , and our threshers and plows , if well represented , will certainly bear high place in comparison with those of Europe . We love the thought that our prairies , waving with grain  --  the feeding lands of Europe in their days of adversity-will thus have a voice in the Palace of the Nations ; and for ourselves , we can rest satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best human measure of those grand wants of the race which agriculture supplies . *Ve can readily content ourselves with the thought that our new country has comprehended , best of all , the aids to that patriarchial art , which is the basis of all national prosperity , and which had its beginnings in Eden . We can give up the paintings and the pianos ; we can import them if need be . We can measure our time , complacently , with French watches ; we can give pap in Paris spoons ; we can dish our tea in Birmingham ware , and we can study toilets in foreign mirrors ; but we hope never to see our prairies laid open with a British plowshare , or our shipwrights seeking foreign models . Apropos of pianos ; there was a rumor running through the columns of American papers , not long ago , that a certain manufacturer of Boston had gained the first premium ; and the rumor ran , gaining all the strength of running rumors , utitil in the iso // Far West we catch a paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good round terms at those effete nations of Europe who have exhausted all their inventive genius even in matters of art , and who must come henceforth to Boston in search of their best instruments of music ! It is a pity to expose such cheerful rhodomontade , and yet the truth has borne out only a minimum of this grand hoast . It would appear that the square-box pianos which make an unfortunately common hit of American furniture ( our ears are even now aching with the " practice " of our neighbor 's daughter ) , are hut little affected heyond the seas ; and that of seven such appearing at the Paris Exhibition , one of Boston manufacture has been recommended as worthy of the fourth prize ! Much as we like to give modesty a prop , we do not know hut we take even greater pleasure in pulling the stilts away from undue hoastfulness . Let our dear friend Mr. Ladd , or Chickering ( or whatever the name may be ) , console himself with the fact that M'Cormick 's reaper is cheapening hread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American exhibitors do not appear to have been very successful ; nor are we at all surprised to learn that the Greek Slave of Mr. Powers , trumpeted about Paris as the cli ef-d'ceuvre of this age , did not draw away the crowd from the Palace galleries , or provoke a single Imperial visit . French critics are not taken by storm , and the approaches to their favor and kindly mention , althou0h quickened by qwq The hotel itself is represented as altogether a grand one . Its west face fills the entire side of that open square which lies between the Palais Royal and the newly-built wing of the Louvre ; upon the iRivoli it stretches its arcades as far as the ancient Rue du Coq St. Ilonorim ; and , return lug upon itself , occupies the entire block . Its southern rooms will be partially shaded by the gigantic pile of the Palace ; but no better lounging window could be imagined than one upon its western front , looking down upon the busy square between the palaces , always restless with the human tide that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining salon of this hotel is said to eclipse even the wonderful ones of New York , and the quaint Moorish hall of the Hotel des Princes shrinks altogether out of comparison . It is still a question , however , if the new enterprise will prove a successful one , and grave doubts are entertained as to the possibility of warping the whole hotel habit of French life by the mere attractions of a brilliant hall and a public parlor . It is specially noteworthy in this connection , that while the European hotels are just now assimilating in souse measure to our own forms , our own fashions are shifting into harmony with theirs . We count both facts strongly in evidence of the amnazing increase of American travel , as well as a pleasant foretaste of that intermingling of habit , and softening down of national differences , which will by-and-by secure to every nation the best usages of a ripe civilization . // ergy , and something of the dignity , which have sustained it hitherto ? Why not take a pride ( and accomplish a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that our material progress has not altogether forbade a higher culture , and those accomplishments of the mind and heart which enable him to meet on even ground with the diplomatic gentlemen of Europe ? We are aware that very many well-meaning persons look with contempt upon the whole system of our Foreign Legations , and deny the necessity for its existence ; but independent of any strict business necessity , which may or may not exist , it seems to us that one civilized nation can not with propriety offend against those rules of courtesy which are acknowledged and honored by sister nations . A man is no way necessitated to say " Good-morning ! " to the neighbor with whom he has only commercial dealings ; but he is a surly dog who omits it . We love to regard our diplomacy-though it may prove as barren of issues as the Ostend Conference-as a kind of black-coated Good-morning ! sent over the water in token of comity , and in furtherance of whatever kindliness must and ought to grow up between civilized nations . But , in Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good-morning " understandingly ! If the system is to stand , there is not a soul so eccentric as to admit the propriety of sending those notoriously incompetent . Until , however , the appointments cease to be counted as the mere bribes for partisan effort , we can scarcely hope for any change for the better . SPEAKING of national courtesies brings us back , by an easy circumbendibus , to the exiled or runaway Republicans . Among these are very many quartered upon the pleasant little Island of Jersey , which , as every body knows , is a domain of the British crown , lying in sight of the western shores of Normandy . A certain Felix Pyat , famous in the stormy annals of 1848 , is living among the refugees of Jersey , and with others has latterly established a paper upon the island , of high Socialist doctrines-ignoring all the principles of the Christian churches , and all the ties of domestic life . Within a short time the journal in question has made an odious assault upon the Queen ; and , instigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with opprobrious epithets . The people of Jersey were at once in a ferment ; they are sturdy loyalists , and could not abide the ingratitude which assailed their monarch . They called a meeting ( after good American fashion ) ; they drew up a sturdy body of resolutions , very Lynch-like in their tone ; and at the last accounts the Governor of the island had waived ceremony in receiving a deputation from the indignant people upon Sunday . Whether M. Felix Pyat will be expelled the island , or his paper be quashed , remains to be seen . WE love to regale ourselves , from time to time , with the London Times leaders ; they smack to the life ( if you read them aloud ) , like a mug of London stout . We have just now fallen upon a plum of its hardy satire , which we lift for the benefit of our readers . It appears that a certain Lord Ernest Vane , son of the late Marquis of Londonderry , an officer in the Life Guards , quartered at Windsor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cal manager of the town , who gives the following account of the affair in the Windsor Express : " I am the lessee of the theatre in this town . Lord Ernest Vane , an officer of the 2d Life Guards , stationed in this place , had been in the habit for two or three nights previous to the evening in question , with other officers , of coming behind the scenes and had behaved himself in a respectable manner , but on the 21st ult. his lordship amused himself by blacking the eyes of one person , kicking another , and so forth . My first salute from him was his stick broken across my back . The curtain was going up ; as I did not wish the audience to be disturbed , I put up with it , and went on the stage . When the first piece was over , and I was dressing for the last I was informed that his lordship had forced his way into the ladies ' dressing-room , and would not leave , though repeatedly requested by the ladies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no effect . I then went myself when he told me to go to a place not mentioned to ears polite . I at length was obliged to send for a policeman . When the officer came he quietly walked out . I had finished dressing and was preparing to go on with the last piece , when he met me at the back of the stage , and said he wanted to speak to me , took hold of me by the collar , and before I was aware , dragged me to the top of some steep stairs leading beneath the stage . He then said , You dared to send a policeman to me ; now I will break your infernal neck ! I 'll kill you ! ' He held me in a position that I must fall backward . I endeavored to escape from him , and said , For God 's sake , do not kill me in cold blood ! ' But he hurled me from the top with all his force . Fortunately a young man , hearing the noise , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke my fall , or death would have been certain . He then was cowardly enough to come and dash his fist in my face as I lay on the ground ; but eventually his brother officers and other persons interfered and got him away . I may mention that the soldiers of whom there were many in front , had been informed that their officers were being insulted , and were forcing their way on the stage . Fearing a collision between the soldiers and civilians , I did not give him into custody . On the following day a military gentleman waited on me to compromise matters . I told him I would bring the young ruffian to justice , and no one can prove that either myself or any person on my behalf , listened for one moment to any offer of settlement . Having felt the bitterness of death , I did not think that money should compensate it . " After many difficulties the poor manager gets a hearing before the Local Court , which condemns the noble delinquent to a fine of ? 5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times , after gravely proving the injustice of the sentence , and the felonious intent of his Lordship , proceeds with the matter thus : " The provincial Themis is a capricious deity . Had the assailant in this case been a Thames bargee , convicted of a similar assault upon his mate , we can not but think that the Areopagus of Windsor would have remitted the matter to the decision of a jury . Let us take a more merciful view of the case . Let us presume that when Lord Ernest Vane Tempest said I 'll kill you ! ' he meant nothing more than I will give you a good beating . ' Let us suppose that when he hurled Mr. Nash down stairs he had no real intention of murdering him , // although , if a man 's intentions are not to be gathered from his acts and his words , from what are they to be gathered ? Still here , beyond all question , and taking the most merciful view of the case was an assault of a most heinous and aggravated character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual , is it not the invariable course , to remit such cases to a jury ? Oh ! but all this is an extreme view ! Lord Earnest Vane Tempest is such a fine young man , so extremely well connected-he was a little " sprung " at the time . The manager was insolent , and , in the playfulness and buoyancy of his youthful spirits , this really very delightful young nobleman simply wished to chastise the base plebeian who had outraged his feelings by letting a policeman loose upon him . What more natural-although we admit it was not strictly right-than that he should slightly thrash the manager the first time he met him ? To be sure the meeting was not accidental ; the fine young man no doubt did , after a certain delay , go in search of the common fellow , ' the scoundrel manager ; but the delay only proves that Lord Ernest Vane Tempest is not in the habit of giving way to the first impulse of passion  --  a point in his favor . Besides , it is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurlin ,  --  let us say easing - Mr . Nash down the ladder , for else it would have been incompatible with his feelings , as a member of the aristocracy , to dash his fist in the manager 's face as he lay upon the ground after his fall . If you cut a man 's throat , you do n't box his ears afterward . Had poor Lord Ernest really intended serious injury to the fellow by sending him to the bottom of the stairs , he would have been satisfied with that ; but , as he was not satisfied with that , it is obvious that he could not have intended serious injury . As for the language held , that goes for nothing ; young noblemen are not supposed to be acquainted with the force of language , or with the English language at all , for that matter . On the whole , the right conclusion is that Lord Ernest Vane Tempest was guilty of a venial error . He did not intend any thing more than the infliction of a slight punishment ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error will be amply expiated by the payment of ? 5 . Consider , again , what the consequences must have been had this case been remitted to a jury . Lord Ernest Vane Tempestan officer of the 2d Life Guards , a scion of one of our noblest families-would in all probability have lost his commission had the case been brought before a criminal court  --  a result which could not for a moment be contemplated . The manager was not killed , after all ; so let the fellow take his ? 5 and be content . This seems to have been pretty much the sort of reasoning which helped the Windsor magistrates to their conclusion . It must be quite a feather in the cap of the Horse Guards ' Minos that a civil court has been found which emulates the decision of his tribunals . Lord Hardinge is at least clear of all responsibility in this case-save in so far as he has permitted Lord Ernest Vane Tempest to exchange into a Dragoon regiment , now in the Crimea , in place of dismissing him from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only most disgraceful in itself ; but it had been accompanied by other actions which were an outrage upon all propriety . Lord Ernest , it seems , had been " blacking " the eyes of one person behind the scenes , knocking another down , and , finally , by way of bringing these Tom and Jerry proceedings to a climax , he had made his way to the dressing-rooms in which the ladies attached to the theatre were robing and unrobing themselves for the performance , and here , in violation of all common decency , he would remain . Hence the policeman 's appearance upon the stage , and hence the savage assault upon Mr. Nails . The lessee of the Windsor Theatre deserves , in our opinion , the highest credit for the spirited manner in which he has followed up these proceedings , considering how seriously his interests may be damaged by the hostility of the officers quartered at Windsor . One word more and we have done . We have no doubt that the army in the Crimea-that band of brave soldiers led by gallant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field-Marshal Lord Viscount Hardinge , who , when a wanton and insolent lordling breaks through every rule of decorum at home , marks his high sense of the offender 's behavior by sentencing him to serve in the ranks of those heroes who have shed their blood like water for their country . In the good old times Botany Bay , and not the Crimea , would be the reward of such gallant deeds as that recently perpetrated by Lord Ernest Vane Tempest . " We do not envy the reputation that Lord Ernest Vane will carry with him to the Crimea . BUT the Times is not occupied only with the castigation of these occasional recreants ; its old , last winter 's bombardment of the British military system , of the octogenarian generals , of the drawing-room captains , and the younger sons portioned with lientenancies , is again begun . " Why is it , " says a leader of mid-October , " that the states of Continental Europe can embark in war without so discreditable and disastrous a transition from a state of peace ? What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations ? France has , indeed , carried on campaigns during a quarter of a century in Africa , but it has been chiefly a warfare of skirmishing and surprises ; it was not in Africa that her engineers learned how to sap up to the Malakofi ' . In the present generation Russia has made only a single short campaign in Hungary ; yet the Russian generals and officers have shown themselves , by the admission of their enemies , men of the highest skill , while their transport service and commissariat have performed prodigies . Pinssinus and Austrians never see any warfare more serious than a review , yet were they to take the field they would perhaps march and bivouac without serious loss . Even little Piedmont has surprised the world by the efficiency of its troops . Every thing connected with its army is said to be a model of arrangement . We , the only people who in the last forty years have carried on regular wars-we who have fought the disciplined armies of mighty Indian princes as well as Caifres and New Zealanders , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a great occasion novices in the military art . Why have Affghanistan and the Punjab given no lessons for the Crimea ? That Indian experience has been lost as regards the present war is part of the system , and the blame must fall somewhere . But even practical warfare seems in the case of our allies and enemies to have been less the cause of efficiency than careful education and accurate arrangement . Our officers we know to be brave beyond all praise ; the // men who follow them are worthy of such leaders ; vet what is the result ? We can not relate a deed of heroism without blushing at an act of folly . They rush needlessly on batteries at Balaclava ; they have no batteries to defend them at Inkermann . It is glorious , but not war , say French and Russian lookers-on . The subaltern and the general are equally fearless and equally unskillful ; there is no difference between them ; the general is only a subaltern of seventy . These gallant deeds have not saved the nation 's military fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paltry German newspaper can talk of England 's exhaustion and humiliation . " And the indefatigable correspondent who gave us that familiar picture of General Simpson sitting in a trench wrapped in his cloak ; upon the famous day of the Redan , is still provokingly critical , and very careless of what the Globe calls " gentlemanly proprieties . " At the risk of giving very much war-color to our gossip of the month , we venture to add a little of his irony and picturesqueness here . The date is of the 1st October-not so far away from December as many of our country friends are from Bala-clava ! " The contrast between the actual proceedin*s of the allied armies since the 9th of this month and the fevered dreams in which the public at home , as rel ) resented by the press , are indulging , is as striking as it is painful . The Russians , so far from flying in discomfort over boundless wastes , are calmly strengthening their position on the north side . The face of the country bristles with their cannon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their guns is sounding through our camp , and occasionally equals the noise of the old cannonades which we fondly hoped had died into silence forever . There is no trace of any intention on their part to abandon a position on which they have lavished so much care and labor . They retired from the south side when it became untenable , shaken to pieces by a bombardment which it is impracticable for us to renew . They have now between themselves and us a deep arm of the sea , a river , and the sides of a plateau as steep as a wall . We let them get off at their leisure , and looked on , much as we would have gazed on the mimic representation of such a scene at Astley 's , while the Russian battalions filed in endless column over the narrow bridge , emerging in unbroken order out of that frightful sea of raging fire and smoke , which was tossed up into billows of flame by the frequent explosion of great fortresses and magazines . What time our generals woke up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is certain they did not , as a body , distress themselves by any violent efforts to get a near view of the enemy 's movements early in the morning . It was late in the day when Fort Paul blew up . At about half-past five o'clock , as well as I can now recollect , that magnificent work was shaken violently , heaved upward , seemed to fly into pieces  --  the breaking masonry and embrasures emitting sheets of white smoke , lighted up by fire , and then collapsed , as it were , into ruins . The mine missed in the first instance ; but , so cool were the enemy , so perfectly satisfied of our inaction were they , and so convinced they had us awed by their tremendous energy in destruction , that they sent across a boat with a few men in her about half-past four o'clock in the evening , who quietly landed end went into the fort , and were seen by several people in the act of entering , in order to prepare for the explosion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , informed the authorities , in the most positive manner , that the Russians were prepared to retreat , and had all in readiness to cover a retrograde movement , in case the fleet succeeded in forcing a passage , and the Allies evinced a determination of throwing their whole force against the north side . Their field-guns and guns of position were all in readiness , and were strengthened by a very large corps of cavalry , which would hold our infantry in check , and our cavalry could not , of . course , get over the water in less than several days , nor could it gain the heights of Mackenzie unless the infantry had previously established themselves there . Every thing was foreseen and calculated , and the Russians were in hopes that they might catch us at a disadvantage amidst some of their fortified positions in a difficult country , and retrieve their past disasters , or , at all events , make a masterly retreat . But when they saw that all was hesitation , if not confusion , in the army of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face for one moment , and the next were busily employed in making the best of it , and they have now erected such batteries as to shut up the harbor to our present navy , and to render any attempt to cross it as rash as it would be undesirable . Yesterday theyfinished a new line of batteries , today ice begin to make some reply . " Oun readers will remember , perhaps-perhaps they will not-that some months since in the course of our foreign mention , we took occasion to appreciate the French book of a certain Madame Fontenay ; it appears that the volume has latterly fallen under the eye of Jules Janin , the theatrical critic and weekly feuilletonist of the Duets newspaper in Paris . Inspired by its truthfulness , and made zealous by what he counts the indignities which have been put upon Mademoiselle Rachel in this savage country , he indulges in a warm diatribe against American art , and ignores American cultivation of any sort . The special cause of his provocation in the matter of Mademoiselle Rachel , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called upon to chant that " odious and bloody " song of the Marseillaise ; and he indites for her an indignant reply to such appeal . What will the feeilletoaist say , when he learns that his great tragidiesmne has once more-in a free land ( once more ) - stooped to the level of the great French war-song of Liberty ? How hard , indeed , to chime with the humors of a people which is every thing by turns , and nothing long ; which now pasquinades perfidious Albion , and now courts her Queen ; a people , with whom all the serious things of government , of popular rights , of political privilege , shift like a play ; and to whom the only real stable materials of thought and of affection , are just those which to every other nation are fleeting and changeful accessories ; to wit , their art , their music , their plays , their mistresses , and their wines ! Let their umpires in such matters rule supreme . But when they affect to talk of high national characteristics , . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us listen warily : it may be only the phantasmagoria of a dreamer ; or haply , the make-scene of an actor , who will change his part to-morrow !
