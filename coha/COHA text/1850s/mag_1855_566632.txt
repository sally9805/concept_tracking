ART . V.-BAPTIST CLOSE COMMUNION . THE difference of opinion between us and our Baptist brethren , lies back of the creeds which we respectively profess to believe . It lies in the principles of reasoning by which we establish those creeds . They assume that an explicit warrant must be found for all the divine institutions , by some plain enactment in the New Testament ; and that inference or analogy can never be rightfully employed to prove them . We deny the former part of this proposition , and affirm the latter . But while we do this , we carry out our principles to all the institutions of God : they restrict theirs to the single practice of Infant Baptism , but reason on other subjects as we do , from inference and analogy . Now xv&amp; maintain that inasmuch as Abraham received circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith , and was commanded to administer that rite to his male infants ; and inasmuch as Paul assures us that believers under the New Testament are the children of Abraham ; and inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired example teaches that it be . administered to males and females ; and inasmuch as all the language of the New Testament is in conformity to the usage of baptizing infhnts ; we need no explicit warrant such as would be contained in a direct enactment in the New Testament . We consider Infant Baptism as an institution of God , and binding upon all the disciples of Christ , because , in the circumstances of the Apostles , accustomed to the connection of parents and children in the ordinances of the church , there would need to be an express prohibition of Infant Baptism to induce them to depart from all their usages . We can not account for the mention of household baptism without explanation , and for the language of clean and unclean as applied to the children of believers and unbelievers , ( 1 Cor. vii , 14 , ) and for a nmltitude of other circumstances , without admitting Infant Baptism to be an institution of God . In this manner , and with a great many additional arguments and considerations , we establish that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Baptist brethren . In the same manner and on the same principles , we proceed to show that the Lord 's day , or the first day of the week , is the Christian Sabbath ; that family prayer is an ordinance of God ; that female communion and baptism , as a prerequisite to // communion , are of divine appointment . But none of these things we admit , have any express enactment for them in the New Testament ; and some of them , neither in the New Testament nor the Old . In all this reasoning we are at least consistent with ourselves . We do not proceed upon one principle for a specific purpose , and then for another purpose abandon it . But the Baptists argue against Infant Baptism on the principle that it has no explicit warrant in the New Testament by way of express enactment ; and then argue in favor of the first day Sabbath , family prayer , female communion , baptism as a prerequisite to communion-all by inferential reasoning , without an explicit warrant or an express enactment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no Sabbath under the Christian dispensation , and in this they have shown an unfortunate consistency . But the tendency of that sentiment to evil has so manifestly appeared , that the piety of the denomination has got the better of their logic . We believe that at the present time they are generally the advocates of a weekly Sabbath . Be this as it may , the fundamental inconsistency of their mode of reasoning sufficiently appears on the other points . They argue against one thing on the same principle that they argue for another . You can find nothing in the New Testament amounting to a direct enactment of the first day of the week as the Sabbath-nothing that family prayer should be observed-nothing that female communion should be admitted-nothing that baptism must precede communion . Yet the Baptists claim that all these are the institutions of God . Why ? In regard to the first day Sabbath , we should like to see an argument conducted on Baptist principles . It would be a desideratum in religious literature . The same may be said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument is , We know that females were baptized ; and we know that they were members of the church . Therefore they have a right to communion . Very well-a good argument for us , but a bad one for them . Here is no explicit warrant contained in a direct command . We know one thing , and therefore we infer another . But on their principles they have no right to their inference . They must have a positive enactment . But where is it to be found ? There is neither precept nor example positively set forth in the New Testament for admitting females to the communion . It is all made out both by the Baptists and by us from inferential reasoning . Next , how do the Baptists prove that baptism is requisite before communion ? This is the point on which all the foregoing // observations are intended to bear ; for we wish to hol*1 our brethren to their principles . Ts there any express enactment-any explicit warrant ? Examples , they say , are found . But to say nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite " explicit warrant , " what do the examples teach ? They teach that the Apostles baptized at one time and communed at another . iBut there is no evidence except the propriety of the thing ' and the usage of the Old Testament in regard to circumcisiom* and the passover , and other inferential or analogical reasoning , that baptism was always a prere*1uisite to the communion . On Baptist principles there is no evidence at all that baptism must always precede communion ; for there is no command on this subject-no explicit warrant . We deny their right to come over teinporarily to our principles and take advantage of them for a specific purpose , and then desert those principles for another purpose . They must find a positive enactment , or else , according to their principles of reasoning , the practice is not authorized in Scripture . We need not say that no such enactment can be found . And then , too , where is the evidence that Peter and John , James and Bartholomew , were ever baptized at all ? You know there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you know that they were baptized when they sat down with the Lord Jesus Christ at the first Supper ? Since no man can obtain positive proof , the Baptists have no right to an imiference here . And especially as there is a presumption against theim* being baptized at that time , in the fact that Christian baptism , or baptism in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost , was not instituted till after the resurrection of Christ . If a Baptist tells us here that John 's baptism was of this sort , how does he know ? Is there any hint in Scripture that John baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost ? On the contrary , is there not an express declaration in the nineteenth of Acts , that certain persons who had been baptized by John , had " not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost ? " And , moreover , if John 's baptism were Christian baptism , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ; then , tIme Apostles were ever baptized at all , agreeably to the Christian institution , it must have been subsequently to their partaking of the Lord 's Supper . At any rate , the point is left very indeterminate and loose in the New Testaument . Not much this , like building up close communion on the principle of baptism as a prerequisite ? No man can prove that the twelve were all baptized previous to the first communionmuch // less can the Baptists do it on their principles . What , then , becomes of the great argument for close commumon derived from baptism ? The inconsistency of reasoning , by which , on Baptist principles , baptism is made the nec*ssary antecedent of communion , is singularly overlooked by our Baptist brethren . They appear to take this for granted as an axiom , because most Christians admit it . But , then , it should be remembered , that they admit it not on the gi*ound of an express command , but only on that of inference and analogy . Such an admission the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are bound to go beyond inference , and show us an express command . It is very clear to our mind that they can not prove the great point upon which close communion is founded , namely , that baptism must precede communion , without abandoning the principles upon which their denomination is built . There is one way which our Baptist brethren take of defending themselves , which they seem to regard as a sort of argumentum ad hominem , but which we can not but consider as unfair and disingenuous . It is by affirming that they are no more close communionists than we are , because we , like then in , require baptism before communion . To this it is obvious to reply , that as our notions of baptism are not so exclusive as theirs , L follows that our communion is not so exclusive as theirs . If we refused to commune with all who had not been baptized by sprinkling , then we should be on a par with the Baptists who refuse to commune with all who have not been baptized by immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptism , and count it sufficient to have been baptized either by sprinkling , affusion , or immersion , and that , too , either in infancy or in riper years ; our practice in regard to communion is as wide from theirs as the heavens from the earth . There is therefore a fallacy in the argument which attempts to make us close communionists , from the fact of our requiring baptism as an antecedent of communion , because 1 ) aptism , in the Baptist acceptation of the term , is confined to one mode of its administration , while ours is extended to all the modes . This araumentum ad kominern , as they think it , is carried still further and supposed to convict us of an inconsistency . They tell us that they commune with all who they believe are baptized , while we do not commune with all who we believe are baptized , namely , our infant children . There is this fallacy in their reasoning here : that it takes for granted that a Pedo // Nov. baptist church is founded on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total difference between them . The former recognizes the children of the covenant as entitled to the seal of the covenant ; but the latter knows no such class of childi:en . The former , like the Apostles , ( 1 Cor. vii , 14 , ) speaks of chiidren as holy or clean in the ceremonial sense , namely , such as are born of one believing parent ; but the latter knows no such distinction . The former administers baptism to all its children ; the latter does so to none but such as profess   believe . So that communion , in a Pedobaptist church , does not follow upon baptism . Other things must concur to make it proper . We do not profess to commune with all who are baptized ; and the very constitution of our churches and the nature of Tnfant Baptism which we practice , proclaim that fact . Now it certainly is unfair to take Baptist principles and put them upon us without our consent , and then bring an accusation that we do not commune with all that we acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our close coinmunion . Our profession and our practice agree , whether they be right or wrong . And this is more than we can say for our Baptist brethren . They profess one thing on this subject , and practise another . They profess to commune with all who , in their opinion , are baptized , but , in fact , there are many who they admit are baptized , but who are debarred from their cominunion . For example , many of our churches contain members who have come to us from Baptist churches , and therefore have been baptized by them . Yet they will not commune with these . There are also the Seventh Day Baptist denomination , the Open Communion Baptist , the Free Will Baptist , the Antinomian Baptist-all of whom they acknowledge are baptized , and yet with not one of them will they commune . Is there not then a great mistake in supposing that Baptists commune with all who , in their opinion , have been baptized ? There is no excuse for this variance between profession and practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their arguments in support of close communion , hold it up as the great thing which entitles to communion . Baptism then , after all , is , in the practice of the Baptists , a qualification for comm union which amounts to nothing . It is a qualification which does not qualify . It stands for nothing or something , at the bidding of convenience . Thus far we have argued in respect to the original and fundamental principle of the Baptist denomination , that all positive institutions must be the subject of direct positive com // mand , and never of inference or analogy . We think it appears that baptism can not be shown on this principle to be a necessary antecedent of communion ; and that the Baptists , in order to prove such a doctrine , must either resort to our principles of reasoning , which prove too much for them , or to our concession that baptism should precede communion  --  a concession which we should by no means make , if we were confined to the principles upon which , they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not admit that their exclusive claim to baptism is valid . Such a claim can be made out neither upon their principles nor upon ours . Let us look at this point simply in the light of the New Testament . In all the arguments of our brethren on this subject we hear much of the Greek word /3c*r*-s*&amp;* . And so much do they take it under their supervision , that you can not find any among them , even the most illiterate , who will not tell you with confidence , that this word is transferred in our Bible , and not translated ; and that , should it be translated , it always signifies to immerse . Now we deny that this word was transferred by our translators . It was an English word long before their time , and exclusively appropriated to designate that religious ordinance which Christ appointed . It was used by Jerome , in its Latin form , in the fourth century , in his Latin translation of the New Testament , and it was in the time of our translators , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ordinance . It is the only word now . Baptism is a ritual application of water , in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . Whatever other things any one may claim , this surely is essential to it . Can this be said of immem-sion , or sprinkling , or pouring ? A man goes into the river for the purpose of swimming . He is immersed , but not baptized . A man falls overboard from a ship into the sea . He , too , is immersed , but he is not baptized . So also a man is sprinkled by the rain , but he is not baptized ; or he is sprinkled by waves dashing against a rock , and bounding back upon himself . But he is not baptized . So also you may pour water upon a man , but he is uot , of course , baptized . Neither unmersion , nor sprinkling , nor pouring , is baptism , unless it be administered in a ritual manner , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost . Neither the word immerse , nor sprinkle , nor pour , therefore , can express the idea of baptism . If a man can be immersed without being baptized , as is too plain to need further argument , then immersion does not express the whole idea which baptism is intended to convey . You falsify the word of // Nov . God , if you translate bapti2o by immerse ; and so you do if yoi* translate it by sprinkle . The word baptize has always been appropriated , ever since the introduction of Christianity into England , to the religious ordinance known by the name of baptism . It is no more a Greek word than Geometry , Theology , Astronomy , Biography , Grammar , TJistory . All these are derived from Greek ; but they are English words now as much as any other words in the language . The Baptists themselves are guilty of ' the flagrant inconsistency of constantly talking of baptism and baptizing , while they contend that immerse is the proper word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to their churches , we never hear that so many were immersed , but that so many were baptized . Whether baptism conveys the idea of immersion , is a question to be decided by an appeal to the Scriptures , and to that authority only . Whatever other books may say , if we are not instructed here that the idea of immersion is contained in the word baptism , it is at least safe to conclude that it is not essential to it . Professor Stuart , in his Essay on the Mode of ' Baptism , thinks that he proves the practice of the church in the second century and onwards to be immersion as a general thing , though admitting other modes as exceptions ; and thence infers that the meaning of ' the word in the New Testament might have been such . But at the same time , lie declares that neither the Scriptures nor the fathers of the first century furnish any evidence of this ; but the contrary ! With the fact before us , then , that the Sci'iptures and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of immersion , we can easily account for its introduction afterwards , as we do for other corruptions . The doctrine which was generally believed , that baptism operated by way of cleansing the soul , would easily account for the idea of increasing the quantity of water ; and the same doctrine would acconnt also for the naked subjectsa point which the professor fully shows . The well known classical use of the word baptizo might , mom'eover , have led these fathers of the second century , who were often converted philosophers , to ad ? pt the meaning to which they had been accustomed in their heathen state , rather than the one which the sacred writers hold forth . We would follow these fathers no more in their immersion than in their stripping the subjects of bap4ism of all their garments . We choose , as true Protestants , to abide by the Scriptures . We see no need of entering at large into the controversy respecting the meaning of the Greek word 3c*r*rs*w . As in proof of a doctrine , we always consider it better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages than to take such a range as to confuse the unlearned , so here we deem it sufficient to adduce a few instances of the use of the word f3o rq-s*c.a in a sense short of immersion . It can not be disputed that in the first chapter of Acts we are told of the baptism of the Holy Ghost , which , in the next chapter , is described as the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel concerning the pouring out of the Holy Ghost . Besides the undoubted fact that the Holy Ghost is always spoken of as poured out , and no example can be found of an immersion in that sacred influence , we have here an express definition of this sort of baptism This is one case of the word baptism having a different signification from immersion . Mark vii , 4- " And when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . " Here the Greek is , " Except they baptize , they eat not . " Now , here is a partial washing , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial washing , appears from the verse preceding , where it is said , " The Pharisees and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not . " And in this case another word is used , Ni*rc* . It is not baptizing their hands . That might possibly be immersion . When the hands are mentioned another verb is used . But when this transaction is characterized in general terms , the word *3oc*r*-i*w is used . It is called baptizing : that is , baptizing themselves . Mark it , when the word baptize is used , there is no object added . It is not baptize their hands , but baptize . And this general term baptize is explained to mean a partial washing , such as belongs only to the hands . The preceding verse tells us that they washed their hands , and this verse tells us that such a washing is a baptism of themselves . " Except they baptize , they eat not . " Does a man wash when he merely washes his hands ? Yes ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptize when he washes his hands ? Yes ; but he does not baptize his whole body . lie submits to a partial ablution-such a baptism as can not be an immersion . Thus we are expressly intbrmed that a pai'tial washing , which extends only to the hands , is baptizing themselves . There is no way of getting rid of this testimony . Baptist writers have struggled to apply the word to time hands , as though the Evangelist intended to says they baptized their hands ; and , therefore , an immersion would be implied . But they have been obliged to admit that the Greek word being in the middle voice , without aim object added , has a reflexive sense , and indicates that the object of the action is comprehended in the word itself ; that is , that they baptized themselves . // And this general term can not be made to signify that ' they baptized their hands . They washed their hands , as the preceding verse tells us ; and this verse says that to wash the hands is a baptism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And many other things there be which they have received to hold , as the washing ( baptisms ) of cups and pots , brazen vessels and tables . " The last word is xXivwv , the couches on which they reclined at table . To say nothing of cups , &amp;c. , did they immerse their couches ? We have another clear instance of the word baptizo being used for a partial washing . Luke xi , 38- " The Pharisee marveled that he had not first washed ( baptized ) before dinner . " Here great effbrts have been made to show that the Jews might have immersed themselves before dinner . No pretence is made that there is any evidence of such a custom ; and yet , if it had been so universal as to cause the Pharisee to wonder that Jesus had not done it , there must have been some record of it . It is argued , that they might have immersed themselves ; but the question is , not what they might have done , but what they did do . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before dinner , and in the great improbability of such a custom in itself considered , we are compelled to understand this as a partial washing , like the other . But we have another passage , where it seems to ns to be placed beyond all doubt that baptism may be a partial washing . Heb. ix , 10- " Which stood in meats and drinks and diverse washings . " Here the Greek is diverse baptisms . Now the Apostle is speaking of time ceremonial washings of the Jewish ritual . These , as every one knows , were mostly sprinklings . And it is manifestly sprinkling which he has especially in view here , for he mentions it frequently . " Time blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean . " Moses sprinkled the blood of the covenant-the sprinkling of the blood of Christ-our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , &amp;c . If baptism were an immersion in the usage of the sacred writers , they could not apply it to the various ablutions of the Jewish ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from this usage would it be to say , they were immersed in the blood of the covenantthe immersion of the blood of Christ  --  the blood of immersion , which speaketh better things than the blood of Abel  --  the immerson of regeneration and the renewing of the holy Ghostthe Messiah *hall immerse many nations-then will I immerse you in clean water , and ye shall be clean ! // There is a use of the word 1ap*'i2o by the Apostle Paul , thus : " And were all baptized unto Moses , in the cloud and in the sea ! " 1 Cor. x , 2 . To say here that baptize signifies immerse , would be to contradict the history of ' the event given . Ex. xiv , 19 , 22- " The waters were a wall unto them on their rio*ht hand and on their left . " " They went into the midst of th' sea upon the dry ground . " Unless , therefore , you can make out that a wall was capable of immersing them in water , or that going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have proof here beyond question , that baptism does not of itself signify to immerse . The Egyptians are not said to be baptized ; but the history tells us they were immersed . " The Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea . " These things we deem sufficient to show that the word haptizo has not the force of the word imrner8e in the New Testament . It manifestly refers to washing , without designating the mode , as immersing , sprinkling , or pouring would do-leaving it , therefore , perfectly optional with the church which mode to adopt . Nor , such being the fact , can the actual cases of baptism recorded be interpreted as implying immersion . We should extend this Article too far were we to go into an examination of the baptism of John . And such a labor appears the more unnecessary , as the main principles involved in it are bronght to light in the cases of baptism which are mentioned subsequently to the great commission given to baptize the nations by the risen Savionr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispensation . What shall we say of the baptism of Paul ? The sacred writer informs us that after his conversion he was " three days without sight , and neither did eat nor drink . " In this weak and exhausted condition , " Ananias entered into the house " where he was , and baptized him . " And when he had received meat he was strengthened . " This is a fact which took place subsequently to his baptism . The natural inference is , that he was unable to go out till after the baptism had taken place ; and , of course , that he was baptized in the house . The household of Cornelius were baptized in consequence of Peter 's saying , " Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized ? " The natural inference here is , that water was brought in , and not that the persons themselves went out to the water . The jailer was baptized at midnight ; and we are expressly informed that the apostles never left the house till they were nrged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natumal inference here is , that the same water whiqh was brought to wash the stripes of the apostles , sufficed for // Nov. baptism . That a tank of water was in the prison , as is said lately by some Baptist writers , is such a gratuitous assumption , that it needs no reply . Who ever heard of such a thing under the cruel institutions of heathenism ? The multitude , on the day of Pentecost , were baptized in the city of Jerusalem , where there is no river ; and all the public baths were in the hands of the enemies of the apostles . The time occupied was so short , and the history of these baptisms so concise , as ill agrees with the idea of immersion , which must have taken so much time , and have brought so many ceremonies into action . as would scarcely have escaped the notice of the sacred writer . Here , too , then the natural inference is , that sprinkling or pouring was the mode of baptism . And this inference is confirmed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse of Peter , setting forth the pouring out of the Spirit as having taken place . It is remarkable that there is but one case after the Saviour s resurrection , which looks , even at first sight , at all like immersion . We need not say it is the case of *e Ethiopian eunuch . Why should this case be made prominent , and all the other cases , instead of explaining themselves , be compelled to take their hue from this ? Admitting this to be a case of immersion . what would it prove by the side of the other cases already mentioned , but that immersion is admissible ? It could not show that it is necessary . But when we consider that it took place in a desert where no river has ever been found ; that the baptism was l ) erforined in consequence of the eunuch 's suggestion , arising from his perusal of a description of the Messiah in the Old Testament , where it is said , that He shall 8prinlde many nations ; that an expectation of immersion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek word which describes the ascending from the water , is the word which is always applied to ascending the baiik of a river , time mast of a ship , or such like things ; and never to ascending from under a fluid ; we can not concede this to be a case of immersion . It is well known also that the translation , " They went down to the water and came lip from it , " would agree as well with the Greek as the present translation ; and this would accord with the idea of a small spring which must needs be situated in a place lower than the country around it . All these circumstances render it doubtful , to say the least , that immersion took place . And it certainly is not philosophical to throw aside the plain indications of the other cases of baptism for the sake of making them conform to a doubtful interpretation . But enough . Our brethren do not cla ! m that baptism is // anything more than a religions rite or ceremony . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it seems to *s , that in a ceremonial washing a little water is as good as much . When He washed the disciples ' feet , Peter required that not only his feet , but his hands and his head , should be washed . But our Lord said , " He that is washed , needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit . " This is a general principle , which applies to all ceremonial washings-baptism among the rest . He that is baptized , needeth not save to wash in part , but is clean every whit . With all these plain exhibitions of the Bible before us , nothing is more absurd to our minds than to talk of immersion as essential to a ceremonial ablution . And this absurdity is increased when we look at the spiritual character of Christianity which mainly overlooks external observances and fixes its eye on the heart . Immersion is not complying with the command of Christ , except as it is one mode of washing . And when we set up immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command which Christ himself has not put . We abridge Christian liberty . Admit , then , that the word baptize , in heathen writers , signifies immer*e . What then ? Does it follow that the Scriptures so use it ? We have seen that they do not . The change is easily accounted for . It is a universal principle that when you introduce new ideas to a nation , you must either appropriate some of their words to a new sense , or you must introduce new words . The heathen Greeks knew nothing of baptism as a sacred rite . It was necessary , therefore , to take their word baptize with a new sense , or to introduce a new word . The former the sacred writers have chosen to do . And this is not peculiar to the word baptize . Many other words are used in a sense totally unknown to the heathen Greeks , and therefore totally different in their signification from what they understood them . For example , there is the word @so* , translated God . Not one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the invisible , the only God  --  the Creator of the ends of the earth . Yet the sacred witers use it in this signification without a word of explanation . So also the word 1fl*-i* , translated faith . Nowhere in the heathen Greek writings will you find this word bearing the signification that it does in the New Testament , for this obvious reason that the heathen Greeks had no such ideas as the word implies . So also *vccxLo*uv ' *1 , translated righteousness and justification . Nowhere in the classical writings of antiquity is this word used as it is in the New Testament . Now , shall we go to the heathen // Nov . Greeks to ascertain the meaning of the words just mentioned ? If we do we shall have heathen ideas , and not the ideas of the inspired writers . We shall , as in the case of baptizo , when we go to the heathen for an explanation of its meaning , make the connection ill agree with the words , and cause the sacred writers to deliver an incoherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is , that the sacred writers had an ordinance of divine appcintment to introduce . It was not a simple immersion , nor a sprinkling , nor a pouring . It was an application of water to a person in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , in a way of ritual or ceremonial purification . They , therefore , take the word already in use , and apply it to a new subject . The meaning of it then is to be derived , not from the old writers , who knew nothing of the new subject , but from those writers who apply it to the new subject . As in the case of Oeo* , flio*q-* , 6VCcLLod'uv'rj , we appeal to the sacred writers , and not to the heathen Greeks , for the meaning of the words ; so in the case of Bc*rq- : *w we do the same . And we find , by indubitable evidence , that in the New Testament use of the word it does not designate the quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing when not speaking of the ordinance , and that such things are done in the administration of the ordinance as clearly correspond to this partial washing . The conclusion , then , to which a majority of the Christian world , and nine-tenths of the Protestant world , have come , that baptism is a washing with water , without saying how much , in the name of the at er , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost , is plainly made out . Where , then , is the evidence that in default of one kind of washing , any of Christ 's disciples should be excluded from the Lord 's Supper ? Or that any set of men have a right to shut themselves up in close communion , and say to all their brethren whom they acknowledge to be accepted of Christ , Away from us . Unless you be plunged into the river after the manner of our section of the household of believers , we hcild you out of the church of Christ Him accordin to His appointm and unqualified to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all His disciples ? ' Whether we are right in our conclusion respecting the quantity of water in baptism or not , there is surely some reason on our side . And since our Baptist brethren can allege nothing for making baptism a ground of communion , except what they allege , by abandoning the principle upon which their denomination is built ; we think it strange that they should raise so great an edifice as the doctrine of close com // munion , involving so many consequences , as we shall see by and by , on so slender a foundation . One of the unhappy consequences of close communion is its tendency to injure the influence of religion in the heart . A man who feels that he has a right to sit at the table of the Lord , and exclude others whom he acknowledges to be the Lord 's genuine disciples , for want of an agreement with him in the mode of an external ceremony , is likely to imbibe feelings ill suited to the expansive benevolence of the Gospelfeelings which carry him beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exceptions to this as a matter of fact , arising from extraordinary piety or extraordinary command of the passions , or some other counteracting cause not to be expected in the mass of men . But that which is a general tendency , will , in most cases , take effect . Hence a division and party spirit among the followers of Christ . It is vain to talk of the full existence of Christian love where the Lord 's table is shut up from the approach of acknowledged Christians . To talk of communion in the prayers and praises of the sanctuary , and in other acts of the Christian life , and at the same time , of exclusion from the Lord 's table , is inconsistent with all the principles of human nature . How far do feelings of union and fellowship go which stop their course the moment you arrive at the special bond of union which our Saviour has appointed ? If you tell us we are unfit for the communion of saints at the Lord 's table , no matter what else you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communion . You place us exactly where you place the unbelieving world . It is impossible , as human nature is constituted , that we should be indifferent to this treatment , except by way of shaking off all regard for your professions , and treating your opinions with contempt . And is there any fellowship in this ? The consequence is , that you are spurred on to sectarian strife ; and the followers of the same Master are exhibited to the world as contending for their respective standards , till the pure spirit of peace and love , so much insisted on by our Lord , is forgotten . There is something remarkably narrow and sectarian in the principle of close communion . Its abettors stand up and virtually say to all the people of God who do not come within the terms prescribed , and who , by their own acknowledgment , are as holy and as Christian as they , We pronounce you unworthy of sitting down with us at the table of our common Lord . We know we are right , and we know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else we have nothing to do with you as the disciples of Christ . You have not entered the kingdom // of God . You belong to this world . We do not deny that the Lord receives you ; but we must reject you . There are certain external things which you have not complied with ; and you must be content to be treated like the world , till you give up your judgment and submit to ours . ' Such is the legitimate , the necessary language of close coinmunion . And does it tend to good ? Especially as we have seen that it is built upon taking for granted the necessity of baptism before communion , without one particle of proof , except upon principles wholly at war with other parts of the same system ; does it not lead to presumption and arrogance ? Does it not tend to destroy the fine feeling of love to all that love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity ? The party spirit which this principle engenders is fully rebuked in the New Testament . " Wherefore receive ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of God . " In the controversy about meats in the Church at Rome , where one party thought the opinions they entertained were of fundamuental importance , the apostle sets up a single point as the ground on which any one should be received , namely , " that God hath received him . " Whatever might be the views of individuals on the question which agitated that church , the fact that God had received any one was sufficient to entitle him to the Christian regards of the whole , and of course to the communion in the body and blood of Him who died for them all . But in no place does the apostle rebuke this party Spirit more pointedly than in 1 Cor. i , 12-17 , where the very term of communion which our brethren so much exalt , is made a matter of secondary concern . He congratulates himself that he had had little to do with it . He had baptized none except two individuals and one household . And this fact he rejoiced in , because his commission was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some might suppose that he had rallied a party by that means . How different this from the spirit of close communion ! That spirit says , I thank God that I have baptized so many ; I have baptized no households as such , for that is a baptism which I avoid ; but I have baptized individuals in their individual capacity , and thus increased the number of those with whom I can commune at the Lord 's table . ' Thus the advocate of close communion , on the ground of exclusive baptism , is obliged to make baptism a very important part of his business , while the apostle regarded it as secondary . Close Communion sets up exclusive pretensions to a church state which its abettors contradict by various acts of their // lives . If close communion be right , it is right on the ground that they only who practise it are the churches of Christ . Baptism , they say , is the only appointed way of entering the church of Christ ; and they refuse us the communion because we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the church . fudeed , they openly say that their refusal to commune with us is on the same principle that we refuse to commune with young converts before they unite with the church , This language means nothing else than that we have not yet become members of the church ; that we are in a state in regard to the church of Christ similar to those who have not yet made a profession of religion . There is , however , an obvious difference between us and the young converts alluded to , that they do not expect communion , and they acknowledge that they have not yet done that act which completes their Christian character ; while we have done all in the external profession of religion which we ever expect to do , and are conscientiously pursuing our way , believing that we are members of the church . It is manifest then , that according to the professions and practice of close communionists , they regard us as living in such plain disobedience to the divine commands that we have no churches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same men exchange pulpits with us . They preach our sacramental lectures . They pray to God that He will bless our churches and our pastors , and that He will pour out His Spirit upon us as churches . They are reduced therefore to this alternative : either they are insincere in their prayers to God , or they are inconsistent and weak in their arguments . We can not accuse them of insincerity in their prayers , since many of them manifest a spirit of religion which it would be uncharitable and unreasonable to question . The other side of the alternative is unavoidable . They are inconsistent and weak in their arguments . Their system of close communion is so self-contradictory that when the true Christian comes before God he virtually renounces it , and speaks forth the words of truth and soberness . A strong illustration of this inconsistency may be seen in the following fact . Many years ago , when Dr. Stillman was minister of one of the Baptist churches in Boston , he had in his pulpit on one communion day a Pedobaptist minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter sat down as if he were going to stay to the Communion . Dr. Stillmnan approached and apologized , - " I am sorry , brother , that we can not invite you to the Communion ; but you know the rules of our church . " " Invite // me ! " said the Pedobaptist , " invite me ! I do not want any invitation  --  the Lord has invited me . I come by the same right that you do . " " But you know , " rejoined the Doctor , " how onr communion table forbids the approach of any who in our opinion are not baptized . " " Your communion table ? Very well ; if it is your communion table I want nothing to do with it . While I was preaching by the Lord 's commission , I thought it was the Lord 's table which was in view before ns . If it is the Lord 's table , I have the same credentials that you have : namely , the invitation and welcome of the Lord himself . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thus , after having acknowledged the Pedobaptist as a minister of Christ , and in that capacity set him to feeding the flock , close communion required that he should be debarred the privilege of feeding him . self at the table of the Lord . An acknowledged minister of Christ not a member of the church , and having no right to communion in the body and blood of Him whose minister lie was , and whose atoning sacrifice he was commissioned to set forth in words and in actions ! Close Communion is contrary to the natural dictates of a Christian conscience . There is something in the conscience of a true Christian , which , like the natural conscience , is universal , unless warped out of its course by peculiar circumstances . " Conscience , " says Dr. Chalmers , in one of the Bridgewater Treatises , " whether it be an original or a derived faculty , yet as founded on human nature , if not forming a constituent part of it , may be regarded as a faithful witness for God , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character a consistent testimony . " " We admit , " says he again , " a considerable diversity of moral observation in the various countries of the earth , but without admitting any correspondent diversity of moral sentiment between them . When human sacrifices are enforced and applauded in one nation , this is not because of their cruelty , but notwithstanding their cruelty . Even there the universal principle of humanity would be acknowledged , that it were wrong to inflict a wanton and uncalled for agony on any of our fellows , but there is a local superstition which counteracts the universal principle and overbears it . When , in the republic of Sparta , theft , instead of being execrated as a crime , was dignified into an art and an accomplishment , and on that footing admitted into the system of their youthful education , it was not because of its infringement on the rights of property , but notwithstanding that infringement , and only because a local patriotism made head against the universal principle and prevailed over it . Apart from such disturbing // forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men gravitate towards one and the same standard , all over the globe ; and that when the obscurations of superstition and selfishness are dissipated , there will be found the same moral light in every mind , a recognition of the same moral law , as the immutable and eternal code of righteousness for all countries and ages . " All this is perfectly applicable to the Christian conscience extending its vision to other points besides the fundamental principles of morality . There is but one set of moral sentiments all the world over in the Christian heart , which the conscience , alive to all its obligations , everywhere sanctions and requires . It is love of the brethren ; recognition of them as Christians ; and that too in all the ways that are practicable . It is giving all who are sanctified by the same Spirit , the right hand of fellowship , as heirs of the same inheritance , and partakers of the same faith and the same privileges . Now close communion is not practised because of its exclusiveness , nor because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any more than human sacrifices are offered because of their cruelty ; but because of some other things ; and notwithstanding its exclusiveness , its unamiableness , and its contrariety to the expression of Christian love and fellowship . There is something superinduced , something forced upon the Christian conscience , contrary to its unbiassed dictates , in order to quiet the mind in close communion . Missionaries in heathen lands , surrounded by the abominations of idolatry , and having no pressure upon them for the support of theories or sectarianism , feel the influence of this universal Christian conscience with few , if any , " disturbing forces . " When the second band of missionaries whom the American Board sent to India arrived in that country , they were uncertain for a while where their place of destination would be . In the mean time they abode with a Baptist missionary from England who had been laboring for many years , and had not seen the face of an English or American Christian . He received them with open arms , invited them to preach , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By and by a communion season came . Our missionaries , not wishing to set their Baptist brother on the defensive by entering into an argument , merely tried the force of an appeal to his conscience . They went into the church in a body and seated themselves in a remote part of the house , by which it was known that they did not expect to commune . The native converts , never having heard of close communion , were astounded . // Nov . " What ! " said they , " these Christian ministers whom we have been taught to love and recognize as Christians , retire from the Lord 's table ! " The Baptist missionary kept weeping all the while lie was administering the elements to the people , but said nothing . As he came out of the house , he advanced to our missionaries , and taking them by the hand , gave vent to his feelings in a flood of tears . And in the midst of uncontrollable sobs he exclaimed , " Brethren , I do not believe the Lord ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the missionaries , " it is a trial of your own making . " " Well , " said he , " I will go home and think of it . " The result was , that he renounced close communion , and afterwards sat down in consistency with his Christian conscience at the table of the Lord with his brethren . And so kind was he , that though he retained his other Baptist sentiments , he allowed the American missionaries to baptize one of their infants in his own chapel . These facts we obtained in conversation from the Rev. Mr. Bardwell , who was one of the above mentioned band of missionaries , but who now resides in Massachusetts , having been obliged to relin .. quish the missionary work by ill health . It is a remarkable fact that when a man first bows himself at the foot of the cross , there is always an ingenuousness in the heart which revolts at close communion . The conscience is then peculiarly tender and unperverted . It speaks out in its natural voice , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces " which turn it aside . It is one of the greatest difficulties which our Baptist brethren have to encounter , to persuade a new convert to be satisfied with close communion . If they can , they cover it up until the convert is received into the church . And it is a fact which is too notorious to dispute , that many unite with Baptist churches without even suspecting that that act will debar them from communion at the Lord 's Supper with all other disciples of Christ . The only way to meet this difficulty so universal in the Christian conscience , before it is biassed , is to forestall objections to close communion by filling the mind with baptism . They create the impression on minds uninformed as yet on the subject , that others who differ from them are governed only by traditional evidence , and not by the Scriptures ; that Infant Baptism is a relic of Popery ; that infants can receive no benefit from baptism . They carefully call Infant Baptism infant sprinkling , by which they would cast a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that this method of treating the subject , which can not be denied to be extremely common , if not universal , is calculated to raise a great prejudice in the mind of a man who has not yet ex // amined it . And non-communion with those who practise such abominations , is a trifling matter . By these means and such as these , the conscience is warped from its natural hold ; and then the new convert is prepared for close communion . Never till then-never till he becomes fully sectarianized , is he prepared to go with his eyes open and shut himself out from the great mass of Protestant Christendom , and sit down at an exclusive table of the Lord  --  a table which , though it contains many true disciples of Christ , is nevertheless a Baptist table , one of denominational peculiarity , and not one of enlarged Christian catholicity . Why is adult immersion any better than infant sprinkling ? Neither of them is baptism , as we have already seen , unless performed in the name of the Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a religious ordinance , a ritual purification . And baptism can do as much good to an infant as to an adult , provided it be the appointment of God that it be administered . It is not at the moment of baptism that good takes place , but in its influence afterwards . It is the consciousness of being externally devoted to God , which , if followed by internal acts of obedience , is the mark of God , the Christian badge which separates us from the world . Now it is precisely the same thing in its influence on the individual , whether it be applied in infancy or in adult years . It is still the badge of discipleship , which becomes such in its completest degree when our other obedience to God 's commands takes place , and not before . Now , why all this preoccupying the mind with distorted views of other men 's practices on baptism ? Why should Infant Baptism , which is connected with the most sacred of our associations , be subjected to ridicule and treated with contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air of incredulity about a subject which requires some examination , in order to conceal the enormities of another subject which strikes the mind unfavorably at first sight . We do not say that this is the deliberate intention of any , but this is the effect , and this is the principle upon which it proceeds . The natural dictate of the Christian conscience is love . And it is love not contradicted by official acts of church fellowship . No man was ever yet born into the kingdom of God in contention . He that begins to contend the moment he begins to hope in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ , is never truly born again . Such converts always show the fact by their after life . It is under the sweet influence of love that a man begins to breathe the air of Jerusalem . The first promptings of that spirit are love to all that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity-carried // out in appropriate acts . He chooses one denomination rathw than another sometimes , because , according to the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but more frequently , becanse circumstances have thrown him there . But the communion of saints , which embraces the whole family of the faithful : - from that his conscience must be warped off by extraordinary means , or he abides by it with all his heart . We have had intercourse with many hundreds of young converts , and in no instance did we ever perceive other than flit e feelings we have described . Indeed , so universal is the dictate of a Christian conscience on this subject , that not a few who are regular members of Baptist churches , have no fellowship with close communion ; and were it not for offending their brethren , they would sit down at the table of the Lord with churches of other denominations whenever the opportunity presented . With the Bible in their hand , and the evidence beaming upon them which none of them , not even the straitest sect of close communion , will deny , that other denominations have men of as great piety and discernment as theirs ; and that the Lord owns these denominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at the Lord 's table in the communion of saints ; they dare not call that common or unclean which God has so manifestly cleansed . These are a few of the considerations which seem to our minds , aside and beyond the utter indefensibleness of close communion on the ground assumed by its advocates , to place that subject at a point directly the reverse of Christian charity , and to show it altogether unbecoming in the household of God . But we have from the apostle Paul , an actual definition of communion at the Lord 's table : " The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which i*re break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ? " Aye , ' says the advocate of close communion , it is such in certain circumstances . It is baptism that must give it the finishing touch . The communion of baptism must stand out in prominence . The communicants must all agree on the subject of immersion , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can we commune with those who are not baptized ? How can we hold a communion in the body and blood of Christ with such as differ from us in other things ? ' The answer is , you are not asked to commune in anything else at this ordinance than the body and blood of Christ . Perhaps some who are externally baptized , have no faith by which alone they can commune in the body and blood ot Christ . But all who have this faith , if they submit to the known // requirements of the Saviour , without which faith can not be said to exist , are qualified , according to the apostle 's definition , for communion . The evidence of faith is not made out unless the subject of it be willing to submit to all the requirements , whether external or internal , which ke perceive8 are of God . And when this evidence exists , who shall say that he can not commune with all his brethren of every subordinate name , in the body and blood of our Lord Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his only Saviour ? If communion at the Lord 's table consist in similarity of views in regard to baptism , which the apostle connted so small a matter that he thanked God he had baptized but few at Corinth ; if it consist in similarity of views in regard to any thing but the great point which is there represented ; we see not how the apostle 's definition can be sustained . As we lay down our pen we have one request to make . If any should attempt to reply to our humble efforts , we ask them to point us to the chapter and verse of our Bible , where it is enacted that baptism shall be an antecedent of communion . We shall not be satisfied with inferences coming from those who professedly discard all inferences when reasoning on the positive institutions of God . We require , and so does every man who turns his attention to the subject , that they shall be consistent with their principles and show us a direct Thus saith the Lord . Till they do this , they fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every thing they hold dear as Baptists.
