txt ART . 1. - LORD BACON . The Works of Francis Bacon , Lord Chancellor of England . A new edition , with a Life of the Author , by BASIL MONTAGU , Esq . In Three Vols . Philadelphia : Carey &amp; Hart , 1846 . Essays , Critical and Miscellaneous , ( Art . Lord Bacon . ) By T. BABINGTON MACAULAY . Philadelphia : Carey &amp; Hart 1845 . AT long intervals in the history of mankind seem to occur great dynamic periods , when Nature puts forth her strength again , once more doing her best , and producing her grandest forms of man . Then great intellects speak to each other across from land to land ; then thought moves in deep and swift currents again ; men grow more awake ; everywhere there is an unwonted freshness and fullness of intellectual life . And it is specially to be observed that the men of mark in such a time , are apt to be characterized rather by the possession of great powers and the performance of great services , than by faultlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century . During this time in England alone were produced Shakspeare , Hooker , Raleigh , Bacon , Cromwell and Milton  --  a most wonderful series , all will allow . These were preeminently efficacious men ; they availed // 334 Lord Bacon . Aug. much ; and yet , if we except Hooker , they were men of faults which have caused each of them to be by a number of persons regarded rather as baleful prodigies than as strong and beneficent helpers . Fifty years ago very many men in New England , even men of considerable enlightenment , looked upon Shakspeare as we do now upon Paul de Kock ; fifteen years ago few out of New England would see in Cromwell anything but a huge hypocrite and impostor ; at this day Bacon 's is to many an accursed name ; Milton in his own time was denounced and execrated from the pulpits of the land ; and Raleigh  --  the stouthearted man ! - navigated all his life a very ocean of opprobrium and abuse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these has been held up for a reprobate ; each may be made to seem a reprobate by no more cunning artifice than the trick of using his greatness as a background on which to set forth in striking relief his imperfections and faults . But we lay this down as a true canon of criticism : Given a man who by the strong endeavor of his life has made himself a helper and benefactor to mankind ; we shall then judge him most justly when we judge him most as if he had been our own brother . Unhappily there are always those , who , when the errors of a great and serviceable worker in the vineyard of the world have been half forgotten and quite forgiven , as they should be , then smelling an opportunity for profitable peddling of virtuous indignation , will go raking and scraping after these errors again , for the purpose of parading them in the reviews . There always have been , and perhaps always will be , some who have the virue of the crow  --  to pass over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carrion ; over which they caw rhetorically enough . Now to make a great man look mean , the process , as was before said , is simply this ; - make his greatness the background , giving him no credit for that ; on this ground set forth whatsoever in his conduct was inconsistent with it ; color highly , aggravate to the utmost ; and there is a picture will make you stand aghast . But this is a very despicable trick . There should be some law for shutting up such jugglers in jail , where they may never exercise their base cunning any more since a people can have no worse enemies than those who filch and destroy its great names . They not merely diminish our consideration and so wound our pride ; they discourage all emulative nobleness ; they fill our young men with disgust , scepticism , and contempt ; and so effectively produce in the future that poverty of true greatness , which they falsely represent in the past . Of few men in modern times have harder words been spoken // than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth his judgment in a line known to everybody " The wisest , brightest , meanest of mankind . " And Macaulay , in the essay before us-written with even more than his usual vigor and glitter-has spread essentially the same judgment over more than forty pages . It has been widely accepted ; so that poor Bacon , in return for his life of laborious service , in return for being one of the benefactors of mankind , has received this much ,  --  that he is the standing illustration of great intellectual gifts joined to great moral depravity . Respecting Mr. Macaulay 's essay , much might be said ; but not profitably . It lacks nothing of energy , of clearness , of brilliancy ; but it does lack truth most wofully . We have no wish to speak harshly ; and in lieu of all else , we will say that if Mr. Macaulay writes histories as he has written this essay , then the fewer readers he has the better . Of Mr. Montagu 's Life of Bacon , prefixed to this edition of his works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some respects the execution is most commendable . He sets out from the right point-that of a true , earnest sympathy with the man he treats of ; more diligence in the collection of facts , or more candor in the exhibition of them , could hardly be ; but he is feeble , prolix , repetitious ; and there is something-we hardly know what to name it-which gives you the notion that were Bacon ever so bad , Mr. Montagu would not see it . Perhaps had he *mttempted less he would have accomplished more ; for he aims at nothing short of procuring for his subject an entire dischsrge from blame . Now we do not believe that he ought to be wholly successful in this ; we do not believe that Bacon was any such faultless man . The true ground , we take it , is this : Bacon sinned as many others did in his time ; he performed services such as only the fewest have rendered in any time . And what we ask is , that those injurious compliances into which he was drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with noble and useful labors . Francis Bacon was born in London , January 22d , 1561 . His father , Sir Nicholas Bacon , held the great Seal from 1558 to 1580 , the time of his death . His mother was a daughter of Sir Anthony Cooke , and one of the most accomplished women of her time . The health of young Francis was extremely delicate , and always continued so through his life . He was apt to faint when the moon was eclipsed , or upon sudden changes of weather . Now the exhibition of character which any man shall make , the manner in which he shall appear to those about // him , depends in no small measure on the vigor of constitution , the temperament , and degree of health , he has . We do not make allowance enough for this in our usual judgments of men . Bacon 's slight , frail make unfitted him for enterprise , for adventure , for contest ; and produced in him a strong sense of dependence . He could not act alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was bold , but not sturdy ; able to direct actions , but not able to act ; and resembled a general who could furnish a masterly plan for a campaign , admirably order the movements of great armies , but wanted bodily strength to guide a horse or wield a sword , and must therefore always be in immediate dependence upon others . At thirteen young Bacon entered the University at Cambridge , where he made one unusual acquisition , namely , a habit of thinking for himself , and of believing his thoughts : the consequence of which was that he began to take the guage and measure of many things about him , and to come to conclusions , which , for the sake of his peace and good estimation there , it is to be hoped he was wise enough to keep to himself . At sixteen he left , and went over to France , where he remained three years . How he demeaned himself in these young years , how he appeared to those about him , what thoughts he had , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a young child he was noted for a great gravity of deportment , a sort of senior-like air and manner of speech ; the effect of which was heightened by the pertinence of what he said . This infant gravity and wisdom , it is well known , has all the effect of wit ; and even the queen sometimes amused herself with him . As a young man we figure him somewhat thus : Very even in all his motions ; perfectly courteous , but slightly reserved ; speaking with very clear pronunciation , somewhat slowly , and with gentle emphasis ; and never in the smallest degree fluttered or deprived of self-possession . Thus much we can , perhaps , fairly gather from various hints . More important it would be could we describe his inward culture , the complexion of sentiment which his mind was coming to take . One thing may be set down : whatever generosity , whatever nobleness , he should come to possess , it would be sure to issue in loyalty . The sentiment of loyalty toward the sovereign was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom this sentiment had been weak or wanting , might be presumptively set down for low-minded , and incapable of nobleness . The best thought , the best valor , the very religion of the nation , were all intensely loyal . It were not difficult to trace the causes and reasons of this ; but at present it will be // enough to state the fact . The special position of Elizabeth , and relation to the time , was also one calculated to produce on the part of her people an affection and reverence toward her as a person , besides what was accorded to her as queen . She stood as the center , the stay and hope of Protestantisrn in Europe . And so firmly she stood there ! So nobly she acquitted herself ! It was a mighty game that was played , and grandly the brave , keen-eyed princess played her side of it . It has been fashionable of late to decry Elizabeth ; and indeed her faults are neither few nor small , while they are not such as we incline to pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ; ready , if need were , to bait her hooks with the bodies of men ; and though most sincere , as greatness must be , in her prime purposes , capable of the deepest duplicity in her actions . We allow also that her desire of power was almost unbounded , and that she ruled England nobly in no small part , because she passionately loved to rule . And yet the conviction abides with us , that without these same faults she could hardly have possessed those virtues which fitted her for that place . She was a ship built not to charm the eye in harbor-sailing , but to weather hurricanes : look at her in a storm and judge her there . She had hard , rugged realities to cope with ; and she overcame them by being herself a reality more hard and rugged and tough than they . Thus the personal qualities of the queen-brought out and made visible by circumstances , which , while displaying them so firmly , made her people keenly feel how great the worth of such qualities is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty which was the prevailing sentiment of the time . Loyalty has now become a tradition , and hardly less so in England than here . No man could address to Victoria the language that was used to Elizabeth , without making himself ridiculous . But let no man , unwisely judging the language of that time by the sentiments of this , fancy the exaggerated deference of that age assumed , and the language it spoke hypocritical . So it is otten considered . Have we then grown so much more sincere ? Not so ; they believed , and therefore spoke . Their words , now often stigmatized as adulatory and servile , uttered , not the cool convictions of their intellects , but the profound reverence and loyalty of their hearts . He who should have regarded the queen only with that limited admira* tion which we accord to great and serviceable abilities , and should have used the language which we use , would have been a monster to his time . And we shall preserve ourselves from false and foolish judgments , if we , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if , other things being equal , we esteem him the youth of greatest hope , not who is most " independent , " but who promises to prove the most sincerely and stedfastly loyal man . Thus prepared for truer judgments , we may return to our history . In February , 1580 , Sir INicholas Bacon died ; and in him Elizabeth lost an able and trusted counselor . The news of his death reached young Bacon in France , where he was diligently pursuing his studies , ill-prepared for such an event , and recalled him to England . His position soon proved embarrassing enough . Very little property had been left him ; and it became speedily apparent that he must cease " living to think , and begin thinking how to live ; " a species of thought to which it might have been well had he more accustomed himself before . But , absorbed in his speculations , he seems hardly to have considered that there was anything these many years for him to do , but to enrich his own mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable thoughts . He trusted , however , that the queen would provide for him , his suit being favored by his uncle , the powerful Burleigh ; and that thus he would be able to go on elaborating into clearness and completeness that wiser system of philosophy , which was at length to displace the unprofitable speculations of the schoolmen , and be named by his name . He was nobly to fulfill the promise of his mind ; but not till he had been subjected to a trial which he then hoped to escape . The small office , whose duties he could well discharge , whose emoluments would secure him a living , while time remained to him for contemplation , he sought , but could not obtain . The good offices of Burleigh were not rendered ; on the contrary , there is said to have been a special opposition to him in that quarter . The Lord Treasurer , they say , desirous of securing the preeminence for his own son , Robert Cecil , afterwards Secretary of State and Earl of Salisbury , looked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So says Macaulay ; and it may be so . But it will , perhaps , seem a matter of wonder that Elizabeth should not , unprompted by Burleigh , or even contrary to his counsel , bestow this small favor on the son of her deceased minister , himself a young man of so rare promise . A closer inspection of the case will make that wonder cease . For twenty-two years Buileigh had been by her side , mingling in her councils , making all her solicitudes and cares his own , and proving himself always a faithful , vigilant and wise servant . Endowed with many of the qualities of his sovereign , prizing by nature the same things and pursuing the same methods , he was endeared to her by the // recollection of many a danger averted and many a difficulty overcome , by his brave prudence , his fidelity and foresight ; and she could not hold him at less than his worth while she saw what greater difficulties and dangers were yet to come . For now the grand crisis of her reign approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " She had now taken the crown from her head and cast it upon the doubtful fortune of war . " She saw what was at hand , and would more than ever prize sober , sagacious counsels , and fidelity that could not be doubted of When therefore such a counselor , at suich a time , discouraged bestowing preferment on a contemplative young man , who had hitherto retired wholly into speculative studies , with small tokens of inclination or aptitude for the stateman S course ,  --  what more natural than that she should immediately acquiesce , and therewith dismiss the matter from her mind ? With her crown at stake-with the welfare of England and Protestantism in Europe staked upon her crown-no qualities to her would seem valuable but energy and political capacity . Speculative genius , however promising , could seem to her of no high worth , nor but feebly commend any man to her favor . When Troy is to be conquered , let Achilles offer himself ; Plato may stay behind . The vast political and legislative capacity afterward manifested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might naturally seem more an object to pleasure a statesman than to create a philosopher . Neither was Burleigh altogether willful in his course . Himself intensely prudential and practical , a strictly limited man , he probably could not sincerely admire his nephew . He thought Francis , we judge , a vain and windy young man , of fine abilities doubtless , but puffed up with knowledge , and yet knowing nothing that was likely to be of any use . He certainly educated his own son to be as much as possible the very opposite of Bacon . The contemptuous manner in which Cecil afterwards spoke of Francis as a " raw youth , " seems to us very sincere . The same course of remark may be extended to the queen . We do not believe she willfully neglected Bacon ; on the contrary , we believe she could not have thought very highly of him then , if she had tried . She loved a Man ; she cared very little about a philosopher . Force of character , valor , foresight , tact , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculative genius-what was that good for ? " Would it enrich her kingdom ? would it disappoint her enemies ? would it humble Spain ? would it fill her treasury ? or strengthen her navy ? or ferret out treason ? would it exalt her in that regard which she obtained , not as the patron of liberal arts , but as the most // vigorous sovereign in Europe ? " Perhaps not . " Very well then , it is a small affair . " Young Francis finally learns that his application , written " from Gray 's Inn , this 16th of September , 1580 , " will not succeed ; Queen Elizabeth does not feel herself in need of his services ; she will not have him to ride in her car ; if he makes any progress , it must be by stout trudging upon his own feet . The young man is civilly advised to lay aside all vanities and apply himself to the study of raw . Most unwelcome advice ; and yet , what can he do but follow it ? Now for law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , it was welcome and joyful work , to spell out the great fact of the world , to gain comprehensive views of things ; it was drudgery , to chop logic , and balance precedents , and elaborately " Sever and divide A. hair twixt north and northwest side . " His mind was discursive , not argumentative ; and he would , therefore , take no pleasure in a profession where skillful argumentation is the one thing needful . The practice of law demands acuteness and mental agility ; it wars against comprehension and breadth of view . An acute , prompt intellect , which always " keeps the roadway , " which can rest in precedents and ask no questions respecting the ultimate grounds and reasons of things , is suitable for a lawyer , and will obtain satisfaction in his pursuits . Some degree of pugnacity also , enough to produce a natural turn for disputation , is quite necessary . This does not describe Bacon . His mind was not lacking in acuteness or promptitude ; but it incessantly craved scope and comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a directing and shaping mind ; a mind fitted to survey and lay out courses , not to tread assiduously in ways by other men appointed ; a mind fitted to compress into axioms that which is yet vague and therefore unacknowledged , not to rest in the skillful use of axioms already prepared . Moreover , the man was borne by his whole spirit to the assertion of the rights of living against dead reason ; to making the present judge of the past , not the past dictator to the present ; in fine , he asserted , with whatsoever might was in him , the living reason and present constant . experience of mankind against the accumulated dicta of ages . Now it can not be necessary for us to say that this is not the spirit which prevails in legal procedures . Nowhere is precedent so strong ; nowhere is reason in opposition to precedent so weak . Law is the most timid of all sciences . Not one clings to authority so affectionately , looks up to it so reverently ; // not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with such infinite sloWness , bearing patiently its burden of dicta ; not one puts the present into such subjection to the past . Perhaps this is necessary ; we think in part it is . Men always move slowest , most timidly and tardily , and always value authority most , in those matters which are most with their interest , and which at the same time admit no palpable , sensible measure of right and wrong , truth and error . The Copernican theory of the universe may be mathematically proved , and so settled forever ; stoves do save fuel , that every househo1d*r may see for himself ; but the wisdom of a given principle in law is a matter of judgment , clear enough to one intellect , perhaps , but hidden from another . And yet every man has palpable interests which the principles and axioms acknowledged in law may affect . This makes us fearful ; law may not be all we could wish , but we are afraid to have it meddled with . What is far off , what but distantly concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely rectified according to reason ; but what comes close home and has to do with our felt interests- " Take care ! " we say , " lest you make a bad matter worse ; keep close to the letter . " This disposition to hide from ourselves the evils of what is near , lest upon its free exposure reason may meddle rashly with it , has some curious manifestations . Thousands of telescopes had been pointed at the sky , before the naked eye of one man , Mayhew , was faithfully applied to London ; and the scientific men of Great Britain can discover the geologic formation of their island , while not one of all her statesmen dares thoroughly probe the Irish sore . In the sky are no " thirty thousand miserable needle women , " for whom something needs be done : and let geologists search downward ever so many miles or backward innumerable years , they will find nothing which affects " the sacred rights of propertv . " Now Bacon was , by the whole force of his nature , an Innovator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describes him better . Slow , careful , modest beyond almost all men , there was in him a calm , terrible thoroughness of reason , which would seek for reason in all things , and would appraise all institutions according to the reason expressed in them . But in Law he would be required to consider precedent and reason as one . He wished into all things to introduce a higher order ; the first condition here was that he should defer utterly to the existing order . He wished to legislate , and was required to plead ; to establish , and was required to apply ; to institute reason , and was required to reason only from what is already instituted . // Hard , therefore , was it for the young man to bring himself to adopting this as his profession . We do not know , but we suppose that he had property enough to support him , had he been willing to retire to the country , and live in a private and economical way . In 1598 we find that he had an estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions of it had been sold to pay debts . Whether he enjoyed the revenue of this in 1580 we can not say certainly , but judge that he did . However , to live in a private and economical way he least of all things inclined . He loved expense , and would indulge in it . " I will lose none of my feathers , " said he , when after his fall , being in comparative poverty and distressed with debts , he was advised to dismiss some portion of his train : " No , " said he , " I will lose none of my feathers . " We are to regard him as an expensive man , always anticipating his means ; always in debt and yet with a sense of equity which prevented him from resting quietly under the debt . This must be constantly kept in mind , as it will explain many things . The time was one when great expense was becoming usual . Essex died at thirty-three ; but besides his own great resources he had received from Elizabeth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next reign , Buckingham wore a court suit , the very jewels upon which cost ? 80,000 . Raleigh wore a pair of shoes which stood him at ? 6,000 . Elizabeth , frugal in everything else , expended immense sums upon her person ; and she loved to see herself surrounded with courtiers magnificently habited . In the time of Bacon 's father , this might not have gone to such an excess ; yet Francis had been used from infancy to court splendor , and could not wholly forego it now . You will say this was a weakness ; very true ; Bacon was weak in character , strangely weak . He had a grand efficacy of intellect , he had a kind and generous heart ; but a Roman force of character he lacked utterly . It was impossible that such a man should ever be bad ; it was impossible but that , with his noble purposes for the improvement of man 's estate , and his wonderful constancy in labor for the accomplishment of them , he should do great good ; but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would comply to his own hurt and to the hurt of others . Well , the young man will betake himself to law , and see if * he can not rise there . There are some very fine preferments for a lawyer  --  the Solicitorship , the Attorney-Generalship , Chief-Justiceships , nay , towering over all , is the Chancellorship , the first office in the kingdom . Consider him then established at Gray 's Inn , and working away with might and main . And yet he will not remit his other studies ; he will not even give his // law studies the first place . For he is fully persuaded that it is his to confer a great benefit on mankind through his thought ; and this he will not give up , come what come may . Good ! We rejoice in his constancy ; for in that matter the people of this day have some interest ! From the latter part of the year 1580 , we may then date the beginning in earnest of his legal studies . And there in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear much of him again . Many , however , were becoming sensible of his rare abilities , and he gained business rapidly . In 1586 he was called within the bar ; in 1588 was chosen lent reader ; and in 1590 , ten years since he set out , he received the first token of favor from the queen . He was then appointed Qu*en 's Counsel , Learned Extraordinarya new office of some dignity and very small profit . This , by drawing attention to him , might and probably did help him to a larger practice ; but so far as the office itself was concerned , it could only be an injury to him ; since it connected him more with the court , thereby causing an increased expense , without assisting him to meet it . The next year he made one more application to his uncle , Burleigh , to be relieved from this legal drudgery , by some appointment . Burleigh resolved not to grant this request , and yet thinking it only decent , perhaps , that he should do something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Registry of the Star Chamber-an office which , when he should get it , would be worth ? 1,600 per annum , but which he was not to come into possession of these twenty years ; and so as to present means he remained just where he was before . The next year , 1592 , he went into Parliament . Here his first effort was to set on foot something in the nature of Law Reform , probably with small success . Soon after came up a motion for granting six subsidies to the crown . Bacon , in a spirited speech , which seems to us nowise called for , made some opposition . All must allow that Elizabeth was saving of her people 's moneys ; that she always asked from them the very least sum it was possible to get along with . Six subsidies would amount , perhaps , to ? 600,000 or ? 700,000 . Consider now that she was engaged in a war with the mightiest power in Europe , a war which her people loudly demanded and gloried in ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before ; that she was now selling off her crown lands to meet these expenses ; and does it not seem that her parliament should have voted promptly and her people promptly paid six subsidies , or eight , if she had asked them ? Bacon , as we said , made a speech in opposition , or at least in hindrance . // Elizabeth upon learning this was extremely offended ; and was half right . She caused both the Lord Treasurer and the Lord Keeper to communicate to him her displeasure ; which was neither felt in any light degree nor expressed , probably , in any very limited terms . To each of these functionaries Bacon replied in a temperate and manly letter . Of these letters Mr. Macaulay speaks in the most offensive and contemptuous terms he can devise . " The young patriot condescended to make the most abject apologies . He adjured the Lord Treasurer to show some favor to his poor servant and ally . He bemoaned himself to the Lord Keeper in a letter which may keep in countenance the most unmanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thus Macaulay . The first of these letters , to his uncle , is thoroughly simple and manly . He regrets that the great queen , whom he in common with all the young men of England looked up to with almost worship , should be angry at him , but says that he " spoke in discharge of his conscience to his God , his queen , and country : " and bespeaks at the close his uncle 's good offices . The other , the letter in which he " bemoaned hhpself " to the Lord Keeper , we will give entire , that the reader may be able hereafter to know how far to trust Mr. Macaulay . " My LoRD-It is a great grief unto me , joined with marvel , that Her Majesty should retain a hard conceit of my speeches in Parliament . It might please Her Sacred Majesty to think what my end should he in those speeches , if it were not duty and duty alone . I am not so simple but I know the common beaten way to please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care I should take to please many , that take a course of life to deal with few . On the other side , Her Majesty 's grace and particular favor towards me bath been such as I esteem no worldly thing above the comfort to enjoy it , except it be the conscience of deserving it . But if the not seconding of some particular person 's opinion be presumption , and to differ upon the manner be to impeach the end , it shall teach my devotion not to exceed wishes , and those in silence . Yet , notwithstanding , ( to speak vainly as in grief , ) it may be 11cr Majesty has discouraged as good a heart as ever looked toward her service , and as void of self-love , and so in more grief than I can express , and much more than I can dissemble , I leave your Lordship , being as ever , " Your Lordship 's entirely devoted , * There it is verbatim . These are the " abject apologies . " The young man is " greatly grieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had from infancy been taught to reverence as much as man may reverence mortal ; whose voice was to all England almost like the speech of destiny ; whom it was his father 's joy and pride to serve and to serve well ; and in whose service he had proposed one day to prove and attest his worth ; but he had acted only from a sense of duty ; he avers that it was not and argues briefly that it could not be a base effort after popularity ; and if no freedom is to be allowed him , his service to the queen must stop with silent and ineffec // tual wishes for her welfare , and so " in much grief he rests , " &amp;c . In all which , if the reader can find any " abject apologies " - why , he may believe Mr. Macaulay next time , that is all . Mr. Bacon 's fortunes by this time are getting rather low . Without a patron it was next to impossible that any man in those days should obtain preferment-he had none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with disfavor . His worldly prospects are certainly not flattering . About this period rose one wearing on his front all the presages of victory . It was Robert , Earl of Essex . The son-inlaw of Leicester , he succeeded to a heritage of royal favor ; and he was one of those who seemed to conquer by their presence . lie made prophets of all beholders . They immediately foresaw the victories he would win . The life of most men may be a problem unsolved , till the reality solves it . But Essex wore the solution of his problem on his brow . You saw him , and read it all clear . Alas , and you are utterly mistaken . The beholders are made false prophets . He , a victor in his looks , shall have no other victory . Essex was one of those concerning whom the wonder , when they are gone , seems that Nature did not giv* them more or withhold what she gave ; whose life is all a splendid promise unfulfilled , and tending to no fulfillment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to none ; who figure largely , seem for a time to be no less than the privy councilors of Destiny , and dying leave behind them  --  a name with a fine string of adjectives attached ,  --  like a useless kite flying the atmosphere of history with said adjectives for a tail . But not thus did he seem then ; and the keen-eyed Bacon was among the gladdest of those who hailed his rising . Essex wanted partisans ; Bacon was a most welcome acquisition . Bacon wanted a patron ; where could he find such another ? They soon made common cause . Their union speedily ripened into friendship . Each had found what he desired ; Essex an adviser , calm , Wise , comprehensive , sincere ; Bacon a supporter strong , generous , able to achieve . We can by no means suppose that Bacon 's adhesion was wholly or mainly , selfish . He seemed to find there the other half of himself , one who could and would carry out and realize his thoughts . By the strong bent of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things better . He wished into all things , into Politics , Law , Philosophy , to introduce a higher order ; and would therefore have all things , and continue all things , as clay in the hands of plastic Reason ; that thus they might be ever renewing into a better form . Essex came forward boldly as if to perform in // the State what the other conceived . He would scorn to creep like Burleigh , suffering innumerable abuses to continue from a slavish regard to precedent , and fear of change . He would install the living reason of man in its rightful supremacy . He would be a political renovator ; and under his hold , wise treatment all " the diseases of the State " should be healed . Alas ! these ardent impulses , sincere enough to produce quite earnest talk , were far from being those deep , strong purposes which produce the earnest deed . But as yet all seems well ; and Bacon , we may conclude , experiences a great satisfaction in this new alliance . For now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very ordinary ones he has in common with all seekers of place , the nobler ones he has in common only with the good and great ? In 1594 the office of Attorney-General became vacant . Bacon was then thirty-three years old ; he had been thirteen years engaged in law ; and had given various satisfactory proofs of his legal acumen . Essex tried hard to secure for him this place Burleigh opposed : it was given to the then Solicitor . Essex then fell to the Solicitorship , and strove with all his power for this . To fail , to stand before the court as one who could not effectually patronize his most attached friend , would be a kind of ' ignominy ; for Burleigh , whom he aspired to rival , could effectually patronize his friends . It stood openly as a test of his influence with Elizabeth ; and he , thus incited , urged also by friendship , left no stone unturned to obtain success . But there were many things in the way . Elizabeth had not forgotten Bacon 's speeches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a good deal more showy than deep in law ,  --  of which indeed his being a man of genius was proof enough ! Then the Earl carried matters with too high a hand , and demanded acquiescence where he should have asked a favor . Besides all which , we are well persuaded that she made it an established policy , not to let Essex build up a too powerful party . She loved him , but she distrusted , and had cause to distrust , his ambition . She was willing to favor and grace him to the utmost ; but she would not suffer favor to pass to others through his hands . In Burleigh 's case she had no such misgivings . He was a man of altogether another quality . She knew him , and knew that he sought only to be a useful and honored subject . He too had always secured a favorable answer to his requests , by making few . He had studiously avoided any appearance of desire to build up a party ; and had constantly pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Essex possessed neither his moderateness of ambition // nor his prudence ; the consequence was that his requests in behalf of others were systematically denied . So after a year and a half of fruitless effort , he had the unspeakable mortification of seeing the Solicitorship bestowed upon Mr. Sergeant Fleming . Essex saw , and in words confessed , that his friend had failed of this appointment solely by trusting him to secure It . To Bacon , therefore , who felt this refusal , not only as a severe disappointment , but an unendurable disgrace , he immemediately went and offered him a farm at Twickenham , " worth near two thousand pounds , " * ( *1,8OO . ) The other refused . Essex said , " You have busied yourself in my matters ; I die if I do nothing toward your fortune . " Bacon took it , but with the express condition that it should not so bind him to the other 's service as in any way to interfere with his duty to the queen . In this the earl acquiesced , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make a gift , and let it be indeed a gift , not prepayment of expected service . We will not , however , asperse the earl 's generosity . This was a noble act , and such shall stand as our judgment . But as this farm , " worth near two thousand pounds , " has been so much paraded by the reviewer already mentioned , we are bound to observe , that a gift which probably might not come up to the cost of one of Essex 's shoes-which did not amount to a fifteenth of what he yearly received from Elizabeth , in addition to his great patrimonial wealth-made too under such circumstances-though it may please , can not extremely astonish us . Or , at least , we do strenuously protest that such a gift could not wholly buy up Bacon , and take away his freedom forever . Mr. Macaulay seems to think that after receiving this , Bacon had nothing for it but to stand by Essex , right or wrong ; that henceforth it became his duty and chief privilege to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of Fortune by such a sacrifice . We differ . That great persecutor and tyrant , the Duke of Guise , understood the trick of " turning his estate into obligations ; " he made gifts to which this is but a poor puddle to the sea . Of course those who had received his bounty without understanding the object , had nothing to do when that object was manifested , but hew and hack and slash the Huguenots at his beck ? And if one had gone so far as to take up arms on the other side , it would have been the blackest ingratitude ? We will listen to no such stuffi We say that Essex gave generously ; and never thought to purchase Bacon with a " farm at Twickenham worth near two thousand pounds . " He gave // it as a delicate and inadequate compensation to one who-so himself said-had failed of a valuable appointment and incurred the disgrace of the most pointed refusal , " by making him a dependence . " When afterwards , maddened with hot ambition , he grew reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hazard the lives and properties of his most attached friends , and attempted to throw the whole country into confusion for objects purely personal " **when he left his friends no choice but to become the wretched disturbers of their country 's peace , and expose their necks to the halter , or to separate themselves forever from him ; then Bacon made his choice , and made it wisely . But in the present case we do not believe that the earl looked forward to anything of the kind ; and that in giving this " farm worth near two thousand pounds , " he was as noble as he seemed to be . In the following year occurred the celebrated expedition to Cadiz . Essex commanded the land forces ; Lord Howard of Effingham , that able and gallant veteran , who had defeated the Spanish Armada , commanded the fleet . The admiral made his dispositions with that prudence which always characterized him ; he sank a large numberof the enemy 's ships in harbor ; and then , - what was rare in those days-put forth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Essex also behaved with great gallantry ; he likewise signalized his humanity by interfering , after the victory in the land fight , to prevent slaughter . He returned laden with " glory . " This was his first considerable service ; it crowned a long list of Effiagham 's , and the queen signified her approval of them by creating him Earl of Nottingham . Essex flared up at once . Nottingham had done entire credit to his gallantry ; no one was disposed to detract anything from his merit . But that all eyes were not turned solely upon him-that the uttermost of the article of " glory " was not conceded to him alone-seemed to him a great affront . He actually wanted to fight a duel with that veteran officer . He wanted to fight with any one of his relations . Finally , however , he consented to be pacified . He was now eager to undertake some other expedition . Bacon now began to see that he was taking a wrong course , and tried hard to dissuade him from it . " Glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only made him more haughty , headstrong , unjust . Bacon had now taken a truer measure of the Earl 's abilities ,  --  saw that he wanted capacity to be a great commander , and that yet failure would only madden // 319 him ; and that either way , by good or by ill success , he would ruin himself in a military career . He therefore strove to persuade him to rest upon the laurels he had won , to seek eminence and fame in a safer , better , more useful course . He vehemently dissuaded him from seeking greatness in a military dependence . . . as that which would breed in the queen jealousy , in himself presumption , and in the state perturbation. ** He said , " My lord , stand upon two feet , and fly not upon two wings ; the two feet are the two kinds of j.ustice , commutative and distributive ; use your greatness for the advancing merit and virtue , and the relieving wrongs and burdens ; you shall need no other art of finesse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it ; and all that Bacon had prophesied came to pass . In the following year Essex obtained command of a fleet intended to sail for the Azores to intercept the Spanish Indian fleet . The English fleet was divided into three squadrons , the first commanded by Essex in person , the others severally by vice-admirals Lord Thomas Howard and Sir Walter Raleigh . Of this latter officer , one of the ablest and bravest men of any time , Essex was infinitely jealous . On the way out , the yard of Raleigh 's ship was broken , by which being separated from the fleet , he did not overtake them until they had been some time at Flores . On arriving there he found that Essex had sent a dispatch to England branding him as a deserter . For this , however , the former apologized , and communicated to Raleigh his design , when they should arrive at Fayal , of assaulting and taking possession of that island . For this they now set sail . Raleigh arrived first , and after waiting for Essex till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenses , he decided to attack , and did so successfully . The next day Essex arrived , and instead of thanking Raleigh for his conduct , he was greatly enraged , thinking that officer did it on purpose to deprive him of the " glory , " and was actually proceeding to cashier him ; but from this extremity he was dissuaded by Lord Howard . All this seems too ridiculously petty to be true : but it is undisputed matter of history . Henceforth Raleigh , who was one of Dr. Johnson 's " good haters , " hated Essex with no little energy . After the taking of Fayal , the fleet , owing to the earl 's mismanagement , had but little success , and returned to England . When willful and headstrong men pursue courses which their own reason does not justify , they commonly come to dislike those counselors who side with their reason rather than with their will . Of this Essex was likely to afford an example . Bacon persisted in remonstrating with him against the ways he // was pursuing , - against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state in a continual disturbance , rather than really seeking its good . One time he said to him : " My lord , when I came to you , I took you to be one who would heal the diseases of the state ; but now 1 begin to think you will be like those physicians who are willing to keep their patients always low , that they may be always in request . " Plain talk that ! Has then Bacoi seen through his patron-weighed him in the balance and found him wanting ? And are all those dreams of noble statesmanship , of improvements to be effected through the wisely directed energy of Essex , proven to be only dreams ? flowS much longer will this friendship last ? Not much , it would seem : for Essex begins to weary of all this ; he gradually drew himself apart , and a certain distance and coolness took place between them . It went on so ; and for a year and a half they took no couns@l together . In 1599 the queen resolved to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually quelling a formidable rebellion . She designed the command for Lord Mountjoy , an able and gallant young man , and a friend to Essex . The latter , however , interfered and obtained it for himself . Before formally accepting it , however , he called Bacon  --  the first time for a year and a half  --  and advised with him . Bacon dissuaded him vehemently , besought him to abandon all thoughts of it , as the maddest thing he could do . " I am sure , " says he , " I never in anything in my lifetime dealt with him in like earnestness of speech , by writing and by all the means I could devise . For I did as plainly see his overthrow chained , as it were , by destiny , to that journey , as it is possible for any man to ground a judgment upon future contingents . " This was a really difficult and arduous service . Essex was utterly unfit for it , and Bacon knew him unfit . He would fail ; this would put him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And indeed if he had , by good luck , a great success , it would be not much better . This would but prick the sides of his ambition , and then would come some mad leap or other , by which to destroy himself and all who trusted in him . Raleigh and Cecil , on the contrary , were altogether for his having the command . They knew that he stood solely upon the partiality and love of the queen-that she greatly overrated him  --  and that in no way could her eyes be so quickly opened as by allowing him to demonstrate his incapacity in some service where only a truly able man could succeed . Essex went , with a larger army than had ever sailed out of England , and larger powers than had been granted to any governor of Ireland before . What had been expected came // quickly to pass . He disobeyed his orders ; he went precisely contrary to the plan laid down for him ; he mismanaged most egregiously ; he lost opportunities , he lost battles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen . Immeasurable was the disgust of Elizabeth when she found how things were going . She sent to enquire what he meant by taking the course he had : there came back nothing but complaints about " his enemies " at court . What had " his enemies " to do with the matter ? Had Raleigh caused him to act contrary to his own plan which Elizabeth approved ? Had Cecil made him conclude a disgraceful truce with Tyrone ? But this was all she could get from him- " his enemies . " It now began to be feared that instead of using his army to conquer the rebels in Ireland , he would march it into England , to London , to conquer whom he pleased there . That this was feared seems the probability . At any rate , Elizabeth sent him positive orders to remain in Ireland ; she established a body guard of six thousand men ; and sent Lord Howard and Sir Walter Raleigh to cruise in the channel with a fleet of sixteen ships . In a month , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now known , though it was not known till Essex was dead , that he actually did propose in secret to his friends Southampton and Blount , to land an army of 3000 men in Wales , then strengthen himself with the multitude of discontented persons , who he supposed would flock to his standard , and thence marching to London , take vengeance on all who disputed his ascendancy , and dictate terms for himself . To this , however , they would not agree , and the design was abandoned . He resolved , notwithstanding , to go to England ; and in September , crossing over with 200 men , he proceeded to London . The queen was at Nonsuch . Thither he posted alone , arrived in the morning , pushed into the queen s chamber , found her newly risen , sitting with her hair about her face , and surprised her into giving him a kindly reception . Immediately , however , upon gaining time for reflection , she resumed her severity ; ordered him to keep his room , and finally committed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house he remained for a time . Upon hearing of the earl 's return . Bacon instantly wrote him a friendly letter , and soon after calling on him advised him respecting his course ; precisely contrary to which advice , Essex , as usual , acted . And now ensued a strange scene . The people , whose idol Essex was , clamoring for his instant release ; the queen pulled one way by her love , urged the other by her judgment ; several of her council advising legal investigation ; and Bacon strenuously persuading forgiveness and oblivion of // all offenses . Elizabeth inclined toward proceedings in the Star Chamber . This Bacon constantly opposed ; twice she rose from him in displeasure ; but we doubt not he would have been wholly successful , if the poor foolish partisans of the earl would have kept quiet . These , however , set up and kept up so loud a howl of complaint as actually drove her at last to institute proceedings against him , for the mere sake of justifying herself by positive proof of his criminality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , followed ; a nominal sentence succeeded ; and Essex , having made confession , was set at liberty , but not allowed to present himself at court . He retired to Essex House , a little out of London . And in all this he was leniently dealt with ; for we aver that there was not another man in England who could have done the same things , and kept himself out of the Tower , to . say nothing of keeping his head on his shoulders . And now how did Bacon regard Essex ? He could not now honor him for a great and true man , fit " to heal the diseases of the state ; " he saw that the earl was one of far other quality than he at first had taken him to be , of less ability , of lower aims ; but he believed him still loyal at heart , and took all occasions of avowing that belief . He would have been shocked to think him otherwise ; for not in England was one from whom the imagination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abhorrent , than to Francis Bacon . He was no longer Essex 's admirer , but he was his friend . And from this time for many months he left no stone unturned to procure his full and complete restoration to favor . He importuned , he entreated , the queen ; he lay in wait for seasons to speak some opportune , and , if possible , effectual word ; he contrived cunning plans for working upon her feelings ; and even resorted to devices which we must hold questionable . He saw the queen grow angry with him for his importunity ; he saw himself pointed at as a falling man ; and , at length for three months he was denied access to her majesty . And all this , while Essex , so far from gratefully acknowledging his fidelity , was accusing him of indifference , and of treachery . One device used by Bacon deserves mention , as it comes up again . By the earl 's consent he drew up two letters , one as from Anthony Bacon to Essex , the other from Essex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tone such as would please Elizabeth . These were then shown to her as epistles which had really passed , and produced upon her , for the time , a quite favorable effect . In this letter Bacon makes Essex say that his return to favor was opposed by certain enemies at court , ( Cecil , // Raleigh , and others . ) This was true ; they did oppose it , opposed strenuously ; and there was no denying it . they But while Essex was protesting his loyalty , and reproaching Bacon for not asserting the same , and advocating his restoration more strenuously , he was secretly engaging in treasonable and most dangerous projects . He applied to Lord Mountjoy in Ireland , and to James in Scotland , to concert an invasion of England , from both points at once . This however fell through . Meantime , he applied to Elizabeth to renew his monopoly of sweet wines , from which he derived great profits , and the term of which was about expiring . She refused , saying , " an unruly beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and answered , that " she was an old woman , as crooked in mind as in carcass . " Elizabeth was an old woman , bent with years , and with cares ; but womanly vanity had not gone out in her ; and when Essex 's rude speech had been reported to her , it was all up with him ; if they had both lived a thousand years longer , he could not have returned to court . And now Essex rushed down with swift steps . He determined to do nothing less than raise a military force , and capture the queen in her palace . For this he had been some while preparing ; he now wrote to great numbers of his friends , assuring them that his life was in danger . A great concourse soon took place at Essex House . We have no disposition to drag the reader through all the details of this most miserable business . Suffice it to say , that all sorts of reports were put in circulation , by which the minds of the people might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that a story was made up that Raleigh and Cobham were seeking to assassinate the earl  --  a miserable , barren pretext , neither more nor less , which Essex himself could never tell twice alike ; that attempts were actually made to procure the assassination of Raleigh ,  --  the man whose courage , energy , and vigilance they most dreaded ; that finding themselves watched , the development of their conspiracy was precipitated ; and that , as the issue of all , Essex sallied into the street , one quiet Sunday morning , at the head of three hundred men , armed with swords , and proceeded to the palace , calling loudly upon all his partisans in the city to arm and join him . And now let us pause and consider what this thing is that is going forward . Essex had confided to one or two his determination to take vengeance on " his enemies " - Raleigh , Cecil , Cobham , &amp;c. - by which is meant simply his intention of taking their lives . Them therefore it behooves to withstand him with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was not his intention to dispossess Elizabeth of her crown , but only com // pel her to obey his bidding . This is all foolery . Elizabeth was not the woman to do homage for her crown to a subject . The upshot of the matter is simply this : if he succeeded , he was king of England ; if he failed , he lost his head . He fails . No matter how much he cried out that his life was in danger ; it would not do , the pretext was too thin ; the citizens , g*Ang to church , some of them , likely enough , only stared at him , open-mouthed , incredulous . He went part way to the palace ; then , seeing his followers dropping off one by one , he turned and made the best of his way back to Essex House , having done no more than cost the lives of four persoas in an affray during his return . Returned , he loudly proclaimed his intention of perishing sooner than yield ; lie put his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was taken to prison . And by this time Elizabeth will be saying to herself , " I wonder if Bacon was a party to that treachery ? " How could she doubt it ? Was not he notoriously the earl 's adviser ? Had he not professed a knowledge of the other 's disposition and intents ? and so in passionately assuring her of Essex 's perfect and unsullied loyalty , in striving to dispossess her mind of all suspicion , he had been only trying to keep her quiet , while Essex prepared a net to catch her in ! Oh , the cunning traitor ! Certainly Bacon had been cruelly treated ,  --  deluded , gulled , made a blind tool , used as no man ought to use a dog . however , Elizabeth saw one way to prove him . She would order him to appear against Essex at the trial ! Then the fact would appear . He was more than willing . He wished to be brought to the test . And now , after what had passed , no one could pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we approach the trial of Essex . And if the reader has access to the essay of Mr. Macaulay , we will thank him to turn to it , and read that gentleman 's account of this affair before proceeding with us . For we are bound in unwelcome duty to say , that among all accounts of any matter which have met our eyes , not one have we seen so elaborately untrue as this . There is not a sentence in it-we are speaking deliberately-there is not a single sentence in it which accurately represents the fact . These are harsh words , but the reader must pardon us ; if less than this were said , it had been better to say nothing . And indeed , it was long before we could make up our minds whether it were not best to pass him wholly by without mention . To this course we inclined ; but that would leave still upon the minds of many , that amongst so much that he asserts thus positively , somewhat must be true . Neither // does Mr. Macaulay deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this garbling ? Not to justify Essex-that is impossible ; but only to hide his crime under the odium which he fixes upon others ; to gratify a whim , a causeless liking , and a desire to triumph over Mr. Montagu , he is willing to fix upon the names of Sir Robert Cecil and Sir Walter Raleigh , the stain of murder , and upon one of the first benefactors of his nation , the character of an incomparable villain . On the 19th of February , 1601 , the trial of Essex came on . And to take part in this trial Bacon went , feeling that he had been shamefully used , and cherishing , we doubt not , as deep a resentment towards the earl as in his heart could find a place . He hoped also to remove from the minds of all mne* any suspicion of his having been a party to this treason . Essex rested his hopes on two things ; first , in making his act appear entirely unpremeditated-rash , indeed , and ill-advised , but one whose consequences and treasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuading his judges that no violence , no force , no alteration in government was intended-that he merely sought the queen 's presence to justify himself before her . But these hopes were destroyed when four of the conspirators made a full confession . By these it was shown that Essex , at least six days before his act , had with his own hand drawn up a full scheme of the treason , in which his intention was fully declared , first , to take the palace with an armed force ; secondly , to call his enemies to a trial for their lives , to summon a parliament , alter the government , and obtain for himself and his associates such a share in it as they might demand. * No violence to the queen , other than forcing her into compliance , was mentioned . Yet we shall not be so foolish as to suppose they could have succeeded without this violence . And Blount on the scaffold confessed that " if they had not obtained all they would , they must have drawn blood , even from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan , it will be observed , was " to put his enemies upon trial for their lives . " What sort of trial was intended will the better appear from the confession of the Earl of Rutland-that Essex had privately told him that " London stood for him , " and that " he intended to take possession of the city , the better to enable him to revenge himself u his enemies , Cecil , Cobbam , andRaleigh. " pon When Essex saw himself thus cut off , and his pretenses exposed , he lost all self-command , and burst forth into passionate accusations of various principal persons of state , accusing // them of treason , of murderous intentions , of anything that might come into the mind of a desperate man . He averred that Cecil was a partisan of the Infanta . He averred that a plot was laid to assassinate him . " Cobbam , Cecil , Raleigh 's violence , " he shouted , " hath driven me to this necessary defense of my life . " He protested that he was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his course was a necessary expedient to save his life . And this Mr. *Vacaulay has the exquisite effrontery to pronounce true , and to say that Bacon knew it to be true ! And now what next ? Will he not say that Elizabeth prowled about the streets at midnight stabbing people in the dark ? Will he not say that Bacon never wrote the *ovum Organum , but hired a hack to do it for him ? Let him say what he will , nothing can astonish us after this . Does he not know that Essex was again and again invited , pressed , to offer any , the slightest proof of this-that he offered none , pretended to offer none ; but only shuffled , and repeated the charge ? Does he not know that an attempt was actually made on his part to procure the assassination of Raleigh ? Does he not know that Essex himself afterwards retracted all this ,  - -  so far at least as to say " he was sorry he stood so upon his justification at his arraignment , " to confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to state under his own hand that , so far from being driven to these courses to defend his life , he was instigated to them by false and wicked men , " who had most malicious and bloody purposes to subvert the state and government . " * And yet he says , " this was true , and Bacon knew it to be true . " When it came Bacon 's turn to address the court , t he made a temperate and well-considered speech , in which he first showed that these accusations of Cecil , Raleigh , &amp;c. , besides being unproven , were utterly improbable , incredible , and that the earl could only injure himself by making them : secondly , he pointed out the inconsistencies and contradictions in the stories of this sort which Essex had put in circulation-one time that he was to be stabbed in his bed , at another that he was to be slain in a boat , and again that he was to be killed by the Jesuits ; * and finally , turning to the earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex , it is evident you had planted in your heart a pretense against the government of your country , and as Pisistratus calculating upon the affections of the people , showed himself * See Essex 's Confession , Bacon 's Works , voL ii , p. 374. * Consisting of twenty-five Peers , several of them Essex 's relatives . * Thomson 's Life of Raleigh , p. 104. // wounded in the streets of Athens , so you entered the city in the vain hope that the citizens would join in your rebellion . Indeed , my lord , all you have said or can say in these matters are but shadows , and therefore methinks it were your best course to confess , and not to justify . " This was sound advice . It was the only thing that could save Essex 's life . While he persisted in these mad accusations , he at once invited and justified his own destruction . And in thus exposing his pretenses , and counseling him to submission , Bacon did him the only service it was now possible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We say this , not pretending that he retained for Essex his ancient friendship . It was not so . His friendship was dead . It could not now survive . We say it , admitting that Bacon was willing by a certain severity of tone toward the earl to discharge himself from all suspicion of sympathy with his present treason . But we do say that it was the wisest , and therefore kindest , advice Essex could have . But he was not to be counseled . At this point he broke in . " The speech of Mi- . Bacon , " said he , " calls upon me to defend myself ; and be it known , my lords , I call upon him to be a witness for me , for he being a daily courtier , and having free access to her majesty , undertook to go to the queen on my behalf , and did write a letter most artificially , which was subscribed with my name ; also another letter was drawn by him to occasion that latter , with others that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which letters he showed to the queen , and therein he did plead for me feelingly against those enemies , and pointed them out as particularly as possible ; both which letters I know Mr. Secretary Cecil hath seen , and by them it will appear what conceit Mr. Bacon then held of me , so different from what he here coloreth and pleadeth against me . " That letter the reader has heard of before . It was written at a time when Bacon had not a doubt but that all treasonable designs or disloyal thoughts were as foreign from Essex 's heart as from his own ; and Essex allowed him to think so , and allowed his own name to be signed to it , while at the very time he and Cuffe were taking malicious and injurious counsel together . It was written , observe , after his ft rst " nominal " trial , when he had been set at liberty , but was not restored to favor . We will now give the only passages in it which refer to Essex 's enemies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most steadfastly the queen never meant to bring my cause to a public censure ; and I believe as verily that since the sentence she meant to restore me to tend upon her person ; but those who could use occasions ( which it was not in me to let ) and amplify and practice occasions to VQL. x. 46 // represent to her majesty a necessity to bring me to the one , can and xviii do the like to stop me from the other . You say my errors were my prejudice , and therefore 1 can mend myself . It is true ; but those that know I can mend myself , and that if lever recover the queen I will never lose her again , will never suffer me to obtain interest in her favor . " . . . . " For , thanks be to God , that they which can make her majesty believe I counterfeit with her , can not make God believe that I counterfeit with him , " &amp;c . Thus wrote Bacon for Essex , believing him , without doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex suffered him to write , carefully concealing from him several things ! And here what is charged upon " his enemies ? " That they were trying to murder him ? That they were trying to do any injury to his person or estate ? Simply , that they opposed his " restoration to favor , " his re-instatement in power . This was true ,  --  just as true as that he whom Bacon had religiously believed an honest , though erring man , now stood confessed dishonest and traitorous ,  --  *ust as true as that Essex 's story now was , not the plain and simple matter Bacon had set forth , but that these " enemies " had been all along diligently seeking to murder him . And yet Mr. Macaulay says that Bacon had " stated under his own hand the very things which he now represente ( l as idle pretexts ! " By the disclosure of this trick practiced upon the queen , however , Essex had perhaps accomplished one thing ; he had succeeded in doing Bacon a great injury . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? Poor earl ! he hardly knew what he was about ,  --  any more than he did afterwards when he accused those of having been his instigators to this treason , who were positively proven to have come to his aid only , upon his express solicitation . We shall forgive him : he seems hardly sane . To Essex 's speech Bacon replied , " Mv lord , I spent more hours to make you a good subject than upon any man in the kingdom besides ; but since you have stirred up this point , I dare warrant you this letter will not blush to see the light , br I did but perform the part of an honest man , and ever labored to have done you good , if it might have been , find to no other end ; for what I intended for your good was wished from the heart , without touch of any man 's honor . " Essex was condemned by the unanimous voice of the peers , and six days after suffered death , professing upon the scaffold great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the fool dieth . He died and left England not the better , but worse , for his being born in it ; he died and left it the better for his going // away . He has our pity ; he might have had our admiration . He has our pity ; but rather that , in a time when good and true men were needed , he , with all his fine advantages , would be no more than a political gladiator ; than that , being a gladiator , he managed his weapons ill . May he rest in peace , and there never be another wholly like him ! We now pass on to the time of Elizabeth 's death , which happened two years after : merely remarking , that Bacon was honorably distinguished from almost every other courtier of the time , by refraining while she lived , from all *ttempts to ingratiate himself with her successor . He stood by her in all her sorrow and sickness of heart , while so many , more favored far than he , forsook ; saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could to make up for lost time . He succeeded sufficiently ; he was a man of benign aspect , of courteous demeanor , and of gentle and winning ways ; who would neither flutter the timid king by an unseasonable display of valor , nor offend him by open opposition . He applied himself assiduously to a study of James 's character , whims and prejudices-no very lofty studyand conciliated him by proposing a plan for effecting one of the few wise things the king had at heart , namely , a union of the two kingdoms . He soon received the cheap honor of knighthood , and saw that his way to promotion lay tolerably clear before him . And now began his danger . He had been ke*t down long , too long ; he was resolved , if possible , to be so no more ; nor was there need that he should be ; opportunity at length , fair opportunity , was given him to rise . Alas , they ihat rose under James must pay a certain price ! They must sho - no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . Which of all James 's chief officers escaped this degradation ? Did one ? We judge that Bacon early made up hi* mind to accept the conditions . However , for some v ears yet , there is nothing to allege against him , but rather more to be put to his credit than we have space to set down . He soon entered parliament ; and his parliamentary career is a bright chapter in his history . He plunged into the thick of legislative business ; engaged in all debates ; sat on twenty-nine committees ; was chosen mediator between the Lords and Commons ; chosen to address the king upon the abuse of purveyors , upon the grievances of Commons , upon ecclesiastical grievances , &amp;c . We wonder how he could find time for anything else , having so much of this work to do . But in the midst of all this came out his treatise upon the " Advancement of Learning "  --  a work not composed in a day , // and breathing the calmest spirit of philosophy . And it may serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could preserve this contemplative calmness while mingling actively in that perturbed element of legal and legislative life . In the year 1606 , while his parliamentary labors continued unabated , he presented the king a " Discourse touching the Plantation of Ireland . " And here may be the place to say , that of all the statesmen of that period , Bacon seems the truest friend to Ireland . So early as 1601 his labors in behalf of that unhappy country began . He then addressed to Secretary Cecil a letter , " with some reasons enclosed , " in which he advocated first , a toleration of religion , secondly , an efficient administration ot justice , and thirdly , the judicious bestowment of rewards instead of relying on severity alone . Under which last head , he mentions the carrying generally of an even course between the English and Irish , whether it be in competition or in controversy , as if they were one nation , without that same partial course which bath been held by governors and counselors there .... the countenancing of their nobility as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knighthood ; the care of educating their children , &amp;c . Oh , how slow men are to accept wise counsels ! " Wisdom crieth in the streets , " but we heed her not ; we go our own chosen ways , and when at length the evil day finds us , are taken by surprise as though there had been not the least reason in the world to expect it . And when one sees how it has been , it becomes hard to forgive the miserable temporizers of our own day , who think God has gone to sleep , who go on heaping wrongs upon the head of the already too much wronged , saying , " Offices , dividends are good , and days of judgment never come . " England 's day of trial has arrived , and now that same injured Ireland is poison in her cup . Irish beggars choke up the streets of her cities ; the throng of wretched , starving , Irish laborers daily presses multitudes of her own Saxon laborers over the verge into the abyss of pauperism ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , too , 0 America , comes on apace . " Croaker ? " 0 yes , Croaker , or what else you will . You , with your miserable fugitive slave laws ; you , with your faithful city that has become an harlot , in which righteousness lodged , but now slave-catchers ; you will find that there is One who never croaks , but smites , when he has waited long in vain . Swear by your spreading acres , swear by your rowing millions , that the day of retribution shall not come : He who poises a world on His finger 's end , to whom wheeling spheres are but as the dust of the balance , sees your small patch of a continent without astonishment , and little meditates to condition his elec // tions upon the tipping of your ballot-boxes . Do justice ; love mercy ; seek truth ; relieve the oppressed ; defend the fatherless , torn from mothers ' bosoms ; plead for the wife widowed Wv sales in the market , while her husband lives . Your land is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end to your treasures ; but the plunder of the poor is in your houses , and though the roofs were propped up with mountains , they shall fall . Shall fall , unless you make haste to do right , while yet a season and space for repentance is given. - Had Bacon 's wise , noble counsel , with regard to Ireland been well attended to and followed , what sufferings and sorrows had been saved ! it was not , not heeded then , but now it must be . Nor this only , but other counsel must now be given and heeded , and that without delay . About this time Bacon prepared and presented to the kin g a paper " On the True Greatness of Britain . " In this paper he takes the ground that the true strength and wealth of a kingdom is not in its money , but in its men ; that courage , patriotism , intelligence , are the true sinews of war , the true guaranties of peace , the true and sole basis of nationalgreatness . This fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon these ; * that the material proceeds out of the spiritual , the visible out of the invisible-.is one that men are slow to recognize speculatively , still slower to believe practically . When men come to see and know and believe that the ontward is but projected from the inward ,  --  that things seen are shadows cast by the unseen ,  --  that qualities are the true substances ,  --  then a new era indeed will arrive . Till this recognition takes place , all remains uncertain. - Another point set forth in this paper has come now to be acknowledged , namely , that material wealth is worth more , is really a greater amount of wealth , in many hands than in few . Other tracts written during these years are weighty , and well worthy of mention ; but as we are not yet emancipated from the conditions of time and space , they must pass without more said upon them . Thus have we brought forward Bacon 's history to the time when he assumes responsible office under James , and so passed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little by little , mingles with the story of his life . Much nobler right noble endeavor , not easily estimated too highly , remains , and always to the end of his life remains , to be set down : but there are also injurious , almost damning compliances to record . Compliances which bore him up , only to fling him again from the highest post to the ground ; where in sorrow and shame he lay during the few lingering years of his life , only to rise slowly as // men forgave his errors and learned to appreciate his work . Nor yet so high but many a Macaulay may set heel upon his neck and display a cheap and wordy virtue in contempt of the erring and falling great . For ourself , our task is simple . We have only to carry an even hand , balk no truth , never hide what can not be excused , nor excuse what is worthy of blame . Yet it shall not be forgotten that to them who love much , much shall be forgiven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny that Bacon nobly loved Man , and nobly , fruitfully labored for his good . Had he been equal to himself ! In the year 1607 , in the 48th year of his age , Bacon was made Solicitor-General ; and thereby became officially and responsibly connected with the mixed up , and to a large extent ignoble government of James . James did not govern nobly and holily ,  --  his officers and counselors must act according to the quality of his government . If any one of the more active and prominent among them escaped this doom , we have forgotten him . We do not suppose that any great spiritual change for the worse took place in Bacon , during these ensuing years . Only , he was placed in a position where the fatal weakness of his character would be to the greatest degree manifested . The worst thing that could ever befall such a man as Bacon would be to be placed in a condition of dependence upon and duty toward one who was himself a man of prejudiced , impure , selfish will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem out after his fashion , and obtains for answer ,  --  " A mean-souled wretch , with a large intellect . " Whoso can be satisfied with this , let him be satisfied . To those who can not we offer this ,  --  A man great , truly great , but of a greatness not complete and consistent with itself . If you ask us whether the grand purpose and grand labor of his life were noble , we can answer with a clear and sure , Yes . If you ask us if he he adhe&amp;ed to that purpose and pursued that labor under difficulties and oppressions which would have forbidden an ordinary man to take thought for anything but his own immediate welfare , we can again answer unhesitatingly , Yes . But if you ask us if the bread-and-butter details of his life were consistent with this nobleness of purpose and labor , then we answer , No , they were not ,  --  he diA shameful things in his life . The heartbeat of his purpose was steady , but its warm current did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The portion of Bacon 's life which follows , until the time of his downfall , does not greatly interest us . To be sure , that // great secret labor of thought goes on unabated , earnest and unselfish as ever . He is slowly toiling upward toward the Novurn Organum : and the fidelity , the sincerity , of this toil , must not be underrated , still less forgotten . It is always the strong , deep undercurrent of this life . This was the saving ballast of the man ; without it , he would , we believe , have gone to utter wreck . And his case may show us how one great , earnest , overcoming purpose , one true , steadfast , faithful labor , may keep a man spiritually alive and sweet at heart , amid much of outward taint . That Novum Organum , so long imagined , so long struggled after , was Bacon 's salvation . Still , during these years he was verging toward compliances , which would almost ruin him , spite of this central preserving influence. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  worlds necessarily separate , sometimes too far apart ; namely , the world he thinks , and the world be lives in , and therein has his bread and meat . If he be one of strenuous and heroic make , he will , likely enough , be so faithful to his thought as to become a troubler to his time ; cursed with many curses , it may be , by those who take his work amiss ; visited inwardly with many chagrins for the more than half failure that his life has to be : failure , for however much he may accomplish , the best of his thought , he must die and leave a promise yet unfulfilled . If , on the contrary , he be one of slighter and more open texture , he will be apt to compromise more ; nay , under peculiar pressure , may compromise fatally , for his dignity , his peace of mind , and his favor with God and the aftertime . It is an evil and unsafe course , sure to lead in the end to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to wickedness , but weakness ,  --  the spring of it rather lack of courage and of will than of just feeling and the intent to do well . Meanwhile , the great victim by every compliance is more entancrled a more b nd bounden to comply ; till at length , it may be , he abandons his outward life to the rule of that society in which he dwells , seeking to recover himself into spiritual health by and in thought alone . He establishes , or tries to establish , for himself the rule of a balancing compensation , repaying the wrong of his conduct by the right of his thought , and becoming perhaps more earnest in the latter as he more complies in the former . Such was Bacon : a man , great , generous , true in thought ; unhappily weak in will and compliant in action . He had not the heroic temperament . His was no granite soul , that stands and lets all the billows of society beat and roar against it ,  --  only beating themselves back , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet that grand undercurrent of his life , setting toward truth with a deep and steady tide , saved him . Of Bacon 's course during the time that he was Solicitor , we can barely mention his efforts for Law Reform ,  --  a matter upon which there need be no lack of interest even in our time . In October , 1612 , he became Attorney-General . Grateful for this favor , ambitious of higher place , he seems now to have submitted himself to James more compliantly than ever . In the man to whom he thus subjected himself , he was most unfortunate ; in the time , unfortunate . In the man , for there was no magnanimity in James . In the time1 for the clock of the world had struck another hour . The Reformation was beginning to bear fruit ,  --  the great struggle commencing . Man had begun to know that he was man . Bacon himself , in the character of his thought , his philosophy , was one of the least dubitable attestations of this . But Bacon was two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been but one . In heart , in thought , he was with the many ; habit , culture , interest , drew him in the opposite direction . By ministering to man he fulfilled his mission ; by adhering to James he obeyed his prejudices , and sought his fortunes . Bacon 's first notable act as Attorney-General was to make a strenuous effort to put down the miserable custom which lately drove Mr. Rhett from the Senate ,  --  the custom of duelling ; the second was to obey James , with apparent alacrity , in putting poor Peacham to the rack , to extort confession , and in tampering with judges , to procure an unjust conviction . This is the truth ; and the truth must be told . Let not the offense be palliated . Let it stand on record to be wondered at , and to be abhorred . King David 's was hardly worse , and more deeply repented of . Perhaps some Nathan , with his stern , terrible , " Thou art the man , " might have brought Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet truth , which demands this exposure , has also other demands to make . Bacon 's offense WAS NOT the same , tried by the standards of that time , which it is , tried by ours . He still remained to no small degree a favorite with the Commons . He still retained the honor and affection of high-minded men . Even Milton several times quotes him as venerated authority , nowhere whispers reproach against him . It must also be owned and can not be denied- . Macaulay himself can not deny-that Bacon was the kindesthearted statesman of his time . In two conspicuous instances he diverted* Elizabeth from purposes of cruelty . He was from the first and to the last the steadfast advocate of mild government . But Macaulay 's argument runs thus : Bacon is a wretch for one bad act , because that act is such as you might // expect from almost any man sooner than from him . He was such in the quality of his thought , stood so commonly in the utmost advance of thought and sentiment , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest sentiment of his time , takes you by surprise , and seems unlikely ; you are sure he could not have done it out of his own heart . But one such act he does ; therefore he is wholly and altogether bad . " We find fault with such reasoning . Why , we pay the highest honor to a man in expecting noble action from him . Just as when a man has proved himself possessed of the first genius , we complain if he writes such a book as a man much inferior to him might have written . Our complaint expresses our sense of his greatness. - " If another man had done this act ;  --  but Bacon ! " True , but what means our astonishment ? " Bacon far behind his age ! Bacon clinging to exploded abuses ! " You intend , Mr. Macaulay , these exclamation points for Bacon 's ignominy . Did it occur to you that you were paying him a high compliment ? Who taught us to expect noble action from Bacon ? Did not he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same from you ; and if at any time you thwart our expectation , we will speak ? * your defection ,  --  if it must be spoken of ,  --  in sorrow and with forgiveness ; even as we would speak of a father s errors , with hushed voices and bowed heads . Eight years pass ; James is in hot strife with his subjects . Prince and people , no longer of one mind , one interest , behold their " natural enemies " in each other . The world-clock has sounded its new hour into many harts ; but the heart of the king , beneath its wrappages of pride , cunning and self-conceit , can not hear : already a Cromwell is dimly and distantly foretold . And Bacon is on the wrong side ! But the wrong side is still able to reward his adherence . He has become Lord Keeper , Lord Chancellor : the highest official position in the kingdom has been for four years occupied by that " raw youth " whom Cecil despised and Elizabeth neglected . The Novum Organum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in Europe occupied a position so splendid . And now his wrongful compliances are to return upon him , and cast him to the ground . Of Bacon 's conduct as Chancellor , Macaulay , with some maligni ty , labors to give the worst impression . He says that Bacon allowed some of his eight thousand decisions to be influenced , if not dictated , by the sovereign , or , what is the same thing , by Buckingham . Undoubtedly so ; and therein he was blameworthy . Only , the reviewer forgets to menti6n that Bacon , in submitting to this interfbrence , did what every Chancellor had done for fifty years . Nay , he actually turns against // Bacon his own efforts to put a stop to this . The mild old Chancellor strove for freedom to be just-protested against interference , as what had long perverted justice . And yet in special cases , where freedom was allowed , he probably submitted . So Macaulay makes his condemnation of this abuse , his efforts to put it away , an aggravation of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's partial fidelity to the better convictions of his intellect is constantly pleaded against him . He was usually in advance of his age ; but as he was not always in advance of it , therefore he was a wretch ! Painful it surely is , to see such a man as Bacon , not wholly , but only half , true to his own high and just thought . But what legerdemain of logic is this , which would therefore thrust him below those who were too mean , selfish , and greedy , ever to deal with high considerations of justice at all ? More , far more , would we honor him , had he possessed the true martyr spirit , and preferred " rather to be a wretch and a fool in this world , than to soil his white garments by any compliance . " But to condemn and execrate a man for the nobleness he did exhibit , because that nobleness was not altogether victoriously asserted , is what does not commend itself to our mind . Bacon asserts of himself that " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since his father 's death . " We have no doubt this was true . And it is a fact of some significance that , of all his several thousand decisions , not one was ever reversed . But unhappily ( or in sterner mood shall we say happily ? ) the period for " measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , " was now past . He had been connected with a bases injurious government , a government of obsolete , ideas , of ignoble methods ; he had winked at , nay , shared in , the abuses he could not prevent ; and as is not seldom the case , chastisement was to fall on the best , first . A Reform Parliament had assembled ; had assumed the aggressive , and was bent on invading James wherever it found him vulnerable . An opportunity soon offered of attacking him through his Chancellor . As Attorney-General Bacon had an income of more than five thousand pounds . As Chancellor his fees amounted to but little above nine hundred . He soon fell into debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was offered in the presents which suitors often presented to Chancellors , and which most Chancellors had been wont to receive . Sir Thomas More , indeed , had adroitly declined them , so adroitly as not to offend his suitors by seeming to think they wished to bribe him , rather // than meant to make a free gift . Bacon in his distress for money allowed his servants to take these presents . And if he had always decided accordingly , there would have been no trouble . For in the case of both those who entered the accusation against him , the complaint was in form that , THOUGH they had presented him with such and such sums , he had not decided in their favor . However , the complaint once made , Bacon could not escape . Every instance , of which any clue could be obtained , was industriously hunted out . Persons who had given freely and complained of nothing , were compelled to testify . Twenty-eight instances , in which gifts had been received , were discovered . Of these several were cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made by persons who had no cause depending . Five or six were made during the dependence of a suit . The remainder , constituting the majority of all , were made at some period after a decree was passed . The smallest present was between forty and fifty pounds . The largest was one thousand but this Macaulay allows he had a right to take . None of these cases was recent . Still , Bacon could not escape . We have , indeed , no doubt he might have made a strong defense . l3ut this James commanded him not to do ; it would endanger him and his Buckingham . The other might have persisted ; but to what purpose ? Poor man ! the " merciful chastisement " was come ; he had nothing to do but bare his shoulders to receive it . To the charge of bribery he pleaded guilty ; be fell , and James made no effort to stay his fall . We are glad he did not . We look on with a stern satisfaction to see " the noblest Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been true to his own nobleness ,  --  had participated in the meanness of those who stood . Had he lived and died a prosperous man , perhaps we could not forgive him . Now we can . Fallen , Bacon reappears in his true g'reatness . Adversity restores him to us . Five heavy , retributive , contrite years he passed , toiling still as ever ; and then his head sought its last pillow . We steal forward to take our last *look of him , and then give him up , sadly , but willingly , to the Grave . " Man goeth to his long home , and the mourners go about the streets . " An estimate of Bacon 's mind and character we shall not attempt . One quality only we shall mention ; being that around which , in our view , the whole worth of him clusters . That quality is his truthfulness . He gives in every word upon oath ; nay , he thinks upon oath . So deep , strong , and overmastering is the tide of truth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to justify himself ; he is unable to arrest or turn it aside even if , for the moment , he would . He cannoC play the attorney in his own behalt* Truth is the fixed , dominant habit of his soul ,  --  his law , as gravitation is that of the spheres . His account of any matter is true by a necessity above his immediate volition . Now we find persons enough who would not consciously tell a lie , yet whose thoughts invariably lie to them upon any matter in which they are personally concerned . Do they have a difference with another ? Hear their account of the matter a while afterward , and you find it garbled to an extent , which , if you know accurately what the fact is , shocks and sickens you . Nay , you do not need always an acquaintance with the circumstances to feel assured that this account is garbled . It wears the unmistakable ex-parte air , and can not be true : not this , whatever may . It is wonderful what a power there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most solid , stubborn facts into a mere dew of flattery for their own souls . Look with their eyes , and how the proportions of all things are changed ! It is like looking through bad glass , which stretches a ten-yearold boy into a colossus , and turns a six-footer into a great squat baby waddling along in coat and boots . And yet they would be far from telling a lie . They have been told where all liars go ! And this may serve to teach us that spiritual culture is something other than merely giving precepts duly fbrtified with promise and threatening . If your artillery of precepts show formidable enough , many will surrender incontinently but the true victory may be nearer , and may be farther off . Bacon was right when he showed that the true problem of culture is to get one-not merely afraid to tell a lie , but-able to think the truth . And this is to be accomplished by dismissing all idols from the mind , and coming to the true worship of Truth . Bacon 's truthfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubious passages in his own life . We should expect him to favor himself here ; yet his account is such as you would look for from the most exact and impartial of beholders . It has the indubitable tone of truth ; we know him to be veracious as we do that a bell is sound , when we hear it ring out perfectly sound and clear . We pass now to consider what Bacon did for mankind . He is commonly called the Father of the Inductive Philosophy . This Macaulay disputes ; and is , perhaps , right . He is not strictly the author but the great patron of the Inductive method ; being related to it , perhaps we might say , somewhat as Newton // to the Copernican system . He first discovered what might be made of it ; discovered that the method then in use was barren utterly , and would be ,  --  that you might as well plough and plant the shore-sand.  - -  - Mr . Longfellow , in his late poem , the Golden Legend , introduces the conversation of two students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it appears that they spent there eight years , of which the first three were passed in studying Logic . The schoolmen believed fully in the plenary inspiration of Aristotle . And their method was to read out of him a few first principles , and from these elaborately spin and draw out such facts and special principles as they needed . Of course , the art of spinning , called logic , was the first thing to be acquired . However , we know but very little of the schoolmen , and shall say no more under this head , except this ,  --  - that Bacon brought into use the only method by which any progress in science can take place . 2 . He changed the objects as well as the methods of intellectual labor . He saw in advance what . the next great task of mankind must be , and succeeded in engaging the intellect of Europe upon that task . He clearly saw and said that man 's greatest outward enemies are his necessities ; that his necessities yield to science only ; that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , as he discovers what are his relations to the world he lives in ; that therefore his first business is to find out accurately what the fact of the world is ; that so the great labor of thought should be a labor of discovery ; and hence , that to add one fact to the stock of human knowledge was to confer a benefit on mankind ,  --  while any unimaginable nicety of skill in the art of disputation , exercised for its own sake , was no better than skill to keep four eggs in the air without breaking them . Ever and anon mankind feels its way obscurely toward a new task . It is a great happiness if there then arise one gifted to interpret this tendency , to see what is wanted , and to point out the methods by which it may be reached . When Bacon arose , the task that lay before man was to take more full possession of the earth , and so make himself somewhat more at home in that scene of things where he is placed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge that gives use . The Indians were no possessors of America ; for they were merely robbers in the domain of nature , not provident users of her bounties and interpreters of her laws . They held the earth as a place where they might camp and forage ; not as one which it was theirs to make the household and homestead of the race . It was Bacon who clearly and distinctly gave man this task . He brought up the cultivated intellect of Europe face to face // with Nature , and said , " There , know that , make that known ; this shall be your share of the world 's work for a time . " True , it was rather material than spiritual nature which he regarded . True , he aimed more to better the condition , than to enrich the quality , of man . But a great work of this kind also needs to be done . And we may reflect that the outward condition of man has somewhat to do with his inward state . It is true , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man may bring himself into a kind of servitude and slavery to things . " Things are in the saddle And ride mankind . " But this is our fault , not that of him who told us how to better our condition , and compelled idle intellect to assist us . Bacon , then , gave the intellect of Europe for its object the enlargement and solace of man , instead of its own exaltation ; for its task the interpretation of Nature , the discovery of the true fact of things ; and for its method Induction . 3 . Bacon may be ranked among the principal authors of modern democracy . He was no democrat ; his leanings were all toward absolutism as indeed were thbse of all Europe . Thought* had broken free ; but , as Guizot has remarked , the same period which witnessed its escape from prison , saw triumph the principle of absolutism in government . He was no democrat ; neither was Luther ; yet modern , democracy owes much to them . Both assumed for man , as such , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been accorded him before . Luther , by maintaining that every man is through reason and conscience directi y related to the Omniscient and All-Good ; Bacon , by showing that all the costly arrangements of Nature are with reference to man , and that the highest mission of thought is to serve him , He cared not that the demos should rule ; no doubt thought it unfit to rule : as indeed it will prove itself unfit , if it shall leave off the worship of God to fall to the worship of its own will . But his heart was with the many , not the few ; his labor was always for the comfort , enlargement , and furtherance of mankind . The root of all democracy is reverence for man , as man , not as conventionally ennobled . That is therefore the democratic thinker , who places man above science ; makes knowledge , learning , his servant , dignified by the help it renders him , not he by the possession of that ; whose desire is not to work up the millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and accomplished individual , but who , reversing this , makes the gifted and accomplished individual servant and helper to the millions , to man . // 371 Essex was the opposite of this . To him , with all his fine humanities , English manhood was but wool to be carded and spun and woven in the loom of battle , into robes of " glory " for my Lord of Essex . The working man of this day knows that he is Man . He respects himself . He is willing to till the soil ; to callous his palms in guiding the plow or swinging the scythe ; to grow tanned and uncomely in the sun , or blackened at the forge , or crooked at the bench ; but not to be given up as waste material , used for its best purpose when woven into cloth to adorn the shoulders of the few ; not to be considered one to whom the high truths of nature have no relation , who is but a drudge and hireling in her domain , a mere feeder for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightly claims , that those who are excused from his sweaty toil , and privileged to think and know , shall still hold him for their equal brother , and think and study in his behalf . But for this recognition of himself he is much indebted to Francis Bacon . Not to Bacon alone ; still more , perhaps , to Luther ; infinitely more to One who is worshiped in the churches in Christendom . For we do firmly believe , that the stream of Bacon 's , as well as Luther 's , thought issued forth at Nazareth. 4 . Finally , Bacon is , under another form , the great Prophet and Precursor of a new era in the history of mankind ,  --  the era of positive knowledge . Mankind has needed a body of certainty , on which it could take its stand and say , " This much we know . " This as yet it had not . Men had thought much , and been exalted by their thought ; had discoursed and harangued in eloquent and persuasive fashion ; had reasoned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; had sung gloriously ,  --  nay , in Bacon 's own time one was singing in the true world-tone , the language that all nations understand ; for Shakspeare was his contemporary . But how much was there on which Man could put his finger , and say , " This I do not think ,  --  I know ? If he looked up to the heaven , what did he know about that ? To one man , Copernicus , the truth respecting that had begun to intimate itself . Kepler and Galileo were confirming and advancing his views : yet they had advanced but a little way . If he looked to the earth he lived on , what did he know about that ? He did not know what was even the superficial shape of it . Tide , wind , climate , rain , heat and cold , production and decay , were all profoundest mysteries . No ,  --  perhaps these will always be mysteries ; - they were matters of superstition . For faith can not cover // the whole ground of our relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes , that place will be supplied by superstition . It is curious to see how simple are some of even Bacon 's remarks ,  --  just the shrewd guesses of a child , at which our school children would now laugh . For instance , he observes that the middle region of the air is coldest ,  --  that nearer either to the sun or earth , warmer . Which , says he , is the reason that the tops of the lesser mountains are covered with snow , while the summits of the highest ( they , you understand , surpassing the middle region ) are made too warm for snow by . the near proximity of the sun ! Even the simplest and commonest things about himself were to man as much beyond understanding as things farthest off . He did not know what his sight was , nor his hearing , nor his smelling , nor his walking , nor anything . Even the idea of a fixed law , according to which all things take place , was very weak , or quite dormant , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past was so potent with him , when the present spoke to him in an . unknown tongue . No wonder he could be argued into the grossest superstitions , while there was hardly a single unmistakable present fact , on which he could lay hold and say , " Your argument is not true , for it contradicts this ! We used to be much amused with the doings of two dogs , Veto and Fowler , whose owners did business together . If Veto came to Fowler 's house , Fowler easily whipped him . If Fowler came to Veto 's house , Veto as easily whipped him . The reason was , that when the dogs got abroad , upon unknown ground , they grew superstitious , and therefore weak . Well , before the age of knowledge man was not at home anywhere , not at home in the world ; it was always a strange place to him . And therefore it was only the bravest soul and clearest intellect which could not be made the captive of superstition . The voice of the past was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He believed whatever was told him ,  --  or assented to it ,  --  for , why not ? But let him get to be at home in the world ; let him by large knowledge make himself strong and established in this living present ; then , crouching no longer , he turns to the past , standing erect , and says , " Well , now we will hear again what you had to say . He is at home , he knows his ground . He marches forward , too , toward the future with a firmer step ,  --  " Naught that abides in it Daunting him . " // The disposition to re-judge the past , so strongly manifested during the last fifty years , and still manifest , is significant . Nothing can escape . All things must be summoned anew to the bar of human judgment , and stand the test of a new trial . We re-judge the past , because we have become otherwise related to it . If some of the manifestations of this spirit are evil , still , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be overthrown . When the ground is ploughed , the old growth is turned under , and all looks barren ; but it will not continue so . If the old faith in the providential interference of God with the affairs of the world ceases to guide our governments , and belief in a higher , spiritual law-intimate with all things , permeating all , judging , compensating everywhere-does not come to supply its place ; yet the result is sure . Greater numbers of men will rise to high planes of thought and life . Let believers be the most earnest , willing and expectant of investigators ; or own themselves sceptics , and not believers . Let reverence not resist knowledge , but promote and guide it . God lives , unwearied , and all truth is His . This great world-period-of the knowledge of fixed laws-began with the oceanic discoveries and with Copernicus ; and Bacon assumed toward it the relation of Patron , and , as it were , Prophet , by being the great fore-thinker of his time . Two and a quarter centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed ! - how much is changing ,  --  yet to change ! Not only outwardly , but inwardly , the man of this time differs from the man of two centuries ago . Nothing is more remarkable at this time than the hunger of men for facts . If you wish wholly and heartily to convince them , tell them , not what was , but what indubitably is . Open up to them , the significance of this great to-day ; reveal to them its binding , living laws ; and expect to be heeded . Our task is finished . The work that for months has lain before us , making leisure laborious , is now brought to a conclusion ; and though little is done of what it seemed possible to do , we are glad to find the end . For , while , in these early June days we sit writing last words , through the open window come the voices of birds inviting us to their groves . Their tones are kindly , and sound to our ears like a swect promise of summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drooping Bacon was borne by loving hands to his last couch at liighgate . The winter wore wearily away , spring opened . and the first days of* " April , with his shoures sote , " had passed , while yet the dying man lingered . But now the bourne was reached ; and when von . x. 48 // the sun went down upon the 9th of that month , his slant rays fell upon the house where lay all that was mortal of Francis Bacon . At his request he was buried in the same grave with his mother . In his will was found the touching clause : " For my memory I bequeath it to men 's charitable speeches , and to foreign nations and the next ages . " The words hold us . We linger , murmuring and repeating them . And thus lingering , this becomes a requiem , singing itself in our thoughts ,  --  " to men 's charitable speeches and to foreign nations and the next ages . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
