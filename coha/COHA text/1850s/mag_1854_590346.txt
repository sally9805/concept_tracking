EDMUT*D BURKE. * THE lives of distinguished public men exhibit in a good degree the spirit , form and pressure of the age in which they have lived . Their connection with leading political interests , although other records of those interests may have been obliterated , shows the reflection of important public affairs from their own minds , and the parts which they have borne in determining their progress . They come down to us like those paintings , the master-pieces of former times  --  the works of a Raphael , a Titian , or a Michel Angelo , which in their lights , shades and coloring , furnish the evidence of the power of the artist , and the scenes which they portray !  --  or rather they may be more properly compared to the Egyptian pyramids , few and scattered upon the desert , which although solitary relics of an empire swepi away , yet remain massive and enduring monuments , evincing the power of their bQilders , and something of the genius of the period in Which they were erected . Our remarks will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have named at the head of this paper . He possessed a moral and intellectual character formed in the best mold , and was cast upon times distinguished for important events : a period which may properly be deemed the golden age of the political and literary mind of Europe , and the volcanic age of its revolution . From the amount of his public services , he comprised in himself a prominent part of its history . He was the contemporary and companion of some of the most distinguished names which commemorated that marked epoch of the British Empire , which then numbered Fox , Pitt , Sheridan , Wiudham , and Erskine , besides other individuals who were scarcely less known to fame upon the political arena ; and Johnson , Goldsmith , and Sir Joshua Reynolds , in the world of literature and the fine arts . His works , running through thirteen * Correspondence of the Right Honorable EDMUND BURKE , between the year 1744 and the period of his decease * 1797 ; edited by CHARLES WILLIAM EARL FITRWILLIAM and Lieutenant General Sir RICHARD BOURKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis &amp; John Rivington . Svo. 1844 . The Works of EDMUND BURKE . In nine volumes . Boston : Charles C , Little and Janies Brown . Svo 1839. // thick octavo volumes , comprising parliamentary speeches , historical and philosophical essays , together ' with the large body of letters which have recently been issued , under favorable auspices , in an elegant*orm of the English press , extend through a pretty wide segment of the circle of human knowledge . It is our design in the present article , through the aid of the records which we have consulted , to portray the principal incidents in the life of this great man , and to trace briefly the part he performed , in those political revolutions which convulsed the old world and the new from their foundations . Edmund Burke , was born on the first of January , 1730 , upon Arran Quay , in the city of Dublin . Springing from a respectable family who long resided in that portion of Ireland which is included in the county of Limerick , and in the possession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals of substantial character and respectable standing . His great grandfather resided originally in the village of Castletown Roche , that is situated in the county of Cork , and was in the possession of a property valued at about four thousand pounds sterling which , in 1765 , descended to him . His father , Richard Burke , or Bourke as the name was sometimes written , occupied the position of an attorney in Dublin who had acquired a lucrative practice , and maintained a prominent rank in his pi*ofession , while his mother was a relative of the Admiral , Sir Edmund Nagle , a lady who held the same name . Of the early life of Burke but little is accurately known , or at all events , but few records have come down to us . It appears , however , that he possessed a weak and delicate constitution , and in consequence he was secluded from the world under his paternal roof , where he was instructed in the rudiments of knowledge . But the atmosphere of Dublin being soon found poorly adapted to invigorate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather , and continued at this place four or five years , acquiring all the knowledge that he could obtain within that period in the village school , when he returned to Dublin . Remaining in Dublin for the period of one year acquiring the basis of his intellectual character , he was thence transferred to the classical school of Ballitore , in the county of Kildare , where he arrived on the twenty-sixth of May , 1741 , being then in the twelfth year of his age . It was here that the leading traits of his mind were in some measure shown . Without evincing thatremarkable brilliancy which distinguished his more matured // powers . He exhibited a sobriety and solidity of character , comprehensiveness of thought , persevering habits of application , an ardent desire of acquiring knowledge , and a strength of memory , a *combination of traits which not only attracted the observ ' *tion of surrounding observers , but constituted in themselves the most conclusive evidence of his succeeding eminence . During his residence in this place , and in the society of his companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , he invigorated his frame and strengthened the powers of his understanding . Evincing a manliness of thought , and a soundness of judgment remarkable in a youth , combined with a somewhat speculative cast of mind , and a large fund of information in history , the classics , as well as various other branches of knowledge . Nor were his moral principles less worthy of respect than his merely intellectual powers . Affectionate in his disposition , and like many other sensitive men of genius , sedate and fond of solitude , he possessed notwithstanding a large share of frankness and good nature , and indeed most of the traits that are calculated to be attractive in an aspiring and ingenuous youth . But a few anecdotes of the career of Mr. Burke in this place have come down to us , yet there is one which we are tempted to record , the incidents of which occurring when be was passing through the initiatory instruction and which demonstrate the spirit of the boy , before his information had become matured and his character disciplined in the severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular occasion , while beholding a poor man near the village in which his academy was situated , pulling down his Qwn house , and being told that it was done in consequence of an order from " The Conservator of Roads , a great gentleman in a gold laced hat , " upon the ground that this edifice intrenched upon the highway , young Burke exclaimed , his bosom swellir*g with impulsive indignation , that were he a man and possessed of such authority , the poor should not thus be oppressed . This trait of boyhood , although but trifling in itself , clearly exhibits the innate opposition in his soul to every form of oppression . In the school of Ballitore , he found time , amid the intervals of his ordinary duties to execute some valuable translations from the classic languages , and to complete occasional poetic compositions , as well as to strengthen his character by regular habits of study , and in the judicious cultivation of social intercourse . With elements of character such as we have described , possessing a considerable stock of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it would appear , he removed about the middle of April , 1744 , from the school of Ballitore to Trinity College in the crowded metropolis of Dublin . Entering upon a course of collegiate study within the walls of a university , a broader theatre o*Intellectual research was now opened before him . It seems however that he did not greatly distinguish himself within the prescribed range of classical exercises , and that his labors were more particularly devoted to the acquisition of general knowledge , than to the attainment of excellence in any particular branch connected with collegiate discipline . His investigations were , however , extended to general literature , the classics , history , philosophy , mataphysics , and a perusal of the standard works of English literature , and the productions o* the ancient Greek and Latin authors , and from those sources be accumulated an amount of miscellaneous knowledge which was made to bear with extraordinary power upon the labors of his study , as well as on those masterly efforts which were made in the House of Commons . Although Mr. Burke does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collegiate study , he did not remain unknown amid the aspirants for classic laurels , for it was only two years after his admission , that he was elected a scholar of the house . The qualification for this election was required to be a successful examination in the classics , and the honor conferred solid advantages upon the possessor , among which were a small annuity and chambers and commons free for five years . His pen was moreover frequently practiced in the art of composition , and his taste for history was improved by a frequent attendance upon a Historical society which had then been just commenced by the students of the college , an institution which afterwards advanced to great distinction in Ireland not not only from the high character of its members , but also from the benefits which it conferred upon the public taste and intelligence of that country . Here his interest in history and politics was greatly increased , and his powers gradually matured . Of the precise circumstances under which he left the university we have no means of knowing , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not clearly appear , no evidence having come down to us regarding this subject upon which we can found a conclusive judgment . Designing to prosecute his professional studies , and having adopted the legal profession , he soon proceeded to the city of London , for the purpose of entering as a student of the Middle // Temple . He was now launched more directly upon the wide world , and we have from his own pen the reflections which would naturally spring up in his own mind from the fresh and novel scenes by which he was surrounded* Among those topics which called fol*h the descriptive powers of his pen , were the subjects which would most naturally engage the attention of the stranger in great Britain . He describes his impressions of the general character of Englishmen and their great commercial metropolis of the world , the architectural and sepulchral glories of Westminster Abbey , and the exquisite and highly wrought beauties of English rural scenery , as well as the general condition of literature , science , and the arts . Upon the last topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " As to the state of learning in this city , you know I have not been long enough in it to form a proper judgment on that subject , I do n't think however there is as much respect paid to a man of letters on this side of the water as you imagine . I do n't think that genius the rath primrose which forsaken dies ' is patronized by any of the nobility , so that writers of the first talents are left to the capricious patronage of the public . Notwithstanding this discouragement literature is cultivated in a high degree . Poetry raises her enchanting voice to heaven . History arrests the wings of time in his flight to the gulf of oblivion , Philosophy , the queen of arts and the daughter of heaven , is daily extending her intellectual empire . Fancy sports her airy wing , like a meteor on the bosom of a summer cloud and even mataphysics spins her cobwebs and catches some flies . " Cf the House of Commons , in the galleries of which he appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arena of his most succesful labors , he remarks : " The House of Commons not unfrequently exhibits explosions of eloquence that rise superior to those of Greece and Rome , even in their proudest days , yet after all a man will make more by the figures of arithmetic than the figures of rhetoric , unless he can get into the trade wind , and then he may sail secure over Pactolean sands . As to the stage it has sunk to the lowest degree . I mean as with regard to the trash that is exhibited on it , but I do not attribute this to the taste of the audience ; for when Shakspeare warbles his native wood notes , the boxes , pit and gallery are crowded , and the gods are true to every word , if properly winged to the heart . " While residing in London Burke applied himself more zealously to general literature and political sciesce than to the mysteries of special pleading , as affording a more pleasant // field of labor , if not a wider scope to his ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dry , severe , and technical learning of the law , and accordingly upon the completion of the customary term*f legal study , he was not admitted to the bar . He was now in his twenty-second year , and possessing an amount of information remarkable in a person of his age , he was induced , since his means were comparatively limited , to seek a field more favorable for the development of his growing powers . In accordance with this determination , he applied , as we are informed , for the situation of the vacant professorship of logic in the University of Glasgow , but without success . Yet the young statesman was not thus to be discouraged ; for he returned to his studies with undiminished industry , continually adding by his labors to the vast bulk of human knowledge of almost every kind which he had already accumulated . Being now anxious to exercise his powers in an embodied form , he published in 1765 , his first pamphlet , entitled " A Vindication of Natural Society . " This was an ironical essay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had then been recently promulgated by the ingenious and brilliant although unsafe statesman , Lord Bolingbroke , and it was a most successful imitation of the language and spirit of that writer . To this followed his great work , great indeed for so young a man , the " Philosophical Enquiry into our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful . " The topic of which it treated had before been but partially discussed , and was but little understood . The essay of Mr. Burke soon advanced to a wide reputation , being considered a most admirable model of philosophical disquisition . Original in its plan and execution , it placed its author at once in the first rank among the writers of that particular department of literature , it was introduced as a test book of Common Education , and was deemed sound authority in the European Universities . From his close and persevering labors , his health soon began to be impaired , and he was induced accordingly to try the waters of Bristol . To this occurrence may be traced an alliance of great importance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs in this place , he casually met a former friend and acquaintance , who was a physician of extensive practice , and much respected for his sterling moral and intellectual qualities . Being invited to reside at the house of this gentleman while remaining here , he // soon formed an attachment for the daughter of his friend , which gradually ripened into love , and was at last consummated by marriage . To this visit he frequently traced the unusual amount of conjugal happiness which he enjoyed through life , and whi*i caused him to declare " that every care vanished the moment he entered under his own roof . " Mrs. Burke added to unusual accomplishments , and a most amiable character , an ardent admiration for the talents of her husband , and ' manners in every way adapted to soften the stronger passions of an irritable and impulsive nature , grappling with the discordant and rival interests of a rough world . The reputation he justly acquired by the publication of his work on the sublime and beautiful , made his name known throughout the literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished members . About this period his pen was moreover employed in preparing his " Essay toward an Abridgment of English History . " But the narrow field then opened to new literary aspirants in England , crowded as it then was by illustrious names , induced him to meditate a removal and permanent settlement in America , yet he soon abar*doned the project . With a view probably to an immediate and certain income , he then attached himself as a regular contributor to a work which is well known in Great Britain , entitled the " Annual Register , " the depository of much valuable information , and a journal which was much consulted . A favorable opportunity was soon presented for the young statesman to gratify his political ambition by an appointment to the office of private secretary to the Marquis of Rockingham , on the 17th of July , 1765 , and be was soon launched upon the theatre that was peculiarly adapted to the display of his extraordinary powers by being returned a member of parliament . During the month of January , 1766 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to the young orator then in the thirty-sixth year of his age . The House of Commons at this period presented the most favorable field for the display of oratorical powers , and a severe school for their discipline . It possessed among its members some of the most eminent statesmen of the age , and embodied an amount and accuracy of information , a discriminating acumen , and an active jealousy springing from the discordant interests of party , all sharpened by a constant exercise in debate , which made the first efforts of a parliamentary novice hazardous to the same extent that his success was brilliant . It was here and at this time that William // Pitt poured forth his torrent-like declamation , Sheridan uttered the arguments which appeared the effect of intuition rather than study , and Charles J. Fox thundered those massive periods which seemed almo* as natural , if not as startling as the peals which roll along the sky . It was in such a school that Burke made his first speech upon the floor of parliament , in the discussion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy of the ministry , drew forth the commendation from Mr. Pitt that " the young member had proved a very able advocate ; he had himself intended to enter into details , but he had been anticipated with so much ingenuity and eloquence , that there was little left for him to say , he congratulated him on his success , and his friends on the value of the acquisition they had made . " We now approach a period in the public life of Mr. Burke which is not only important , from the discussions which were then agitated upon the floor of parliament , and among the great body of the people of Great Britain ; but also from its connection with the controversy between our own and the mother country , resulting in the American revolution . It can hardly be doubted that the causes of the Ameirican revolution ran back to an early period of our colonial existence , and were founded in the severe and exacting character of the laws of trade which were made to bear upon the North American colonies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she has exercised with the most tenacious perseverance down to the present period , to restrict the labor of her remote colonial dependencies , to the particular enterprises which should interfere in no measure with those of the central government . That policy was strenuously pursued respecting the industrial labors that were springing up in our own country , regarding both its commerce and manufactures . As early as 1670 , Sir Joshua Child had declared that the increase of shipping in New England , was of great injury to the power of the Crown , and systematic efforts were moreover made to cripple the manufactures which were springing up in the various colonial establishments now constituting our own country . The basis of this policy was the alleged fact , that " the erecting manufactories in the colonies tended to lessen their dependence upon Great Britain . " In accordance with that system , severe and searching laws were passed for the purpose of suppressing the manufacture of iron , woollen fabrics , hats , and other products , while the Board of Trade recommended at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their industry // to such manufactures and products as might be of service to Great Britain , and more particularly to the production of all kinds of naval stores . " Great Britain was at *hat period in a state far removed from the condition of quiescence . The whole Empire was exhausted in its means , having just emerged from an expensive war . Numerous points of policy were unsettled , and it was at that time especially desirable that a solid and productive revenue should be obtained . It was moreover claimed that a part of such revenue ought to be raised from the North American colonies , inasmuch as the colonies had always received the protection of the parent government , and the war with France that swept away the French power from the soil , and which resulted during the year 1760 , in the capitulation of Quebec , that this had been prosecuted in a great measure by British funds , and had also been maintained in no small degree by the armies of Great Britain . In the year 1765 the stamp act was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Greenvile , but in consequence of the opposition which was made to the measure it was soon repealed . The colonies which were established upon the Atlantic frontier , indurated by the hardships of a comparatively rude wilderness , and trained to independence by the exercise of self-government in their little primary , municipal communities , while there lingered in their minds something of reverence for the prescriptive forms of the British monarchy , had long become alienated , from the course of policy which had been pursued in their commercial relations from the parent government . The disaffection which had been long festering , at length broke forth into overt acts in 1770 , by which a crowd of people in the city of Boston who were assembled in State street were fired upon , some of them being killed and others wounded by a detachment of British troops , and in the overthrow of the boxes of tea in the harbor of that city , which in 1773 had been shipped from the port of London . As early as 1774 , the political sky of what now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a tempest were gathering in the heavens which here and there shot forth electric fires . The popular mind became inflamed , and councils were held in various parts of the country whose avowed object was revolution . It was during such a crisis that the exertions of Edmund Burke were put forth in our behalf . A prominent question which called forth his powers in behalf of the colonies was based upon a bill presented to parliament // during that year entitled " an act for granting certain duties i1r the British colonies and plantations in America , for allowing a drawback of the duties of customs upon the exportation from this kingdom of coff* and cocoa nuts of the produce of the said Colonies or plantations for discontinuing the draw backs payable on China and eastern ware exported to America , and for more effectually preventing the clandestine running of goods in the same colonies and plantations . " This act having been read it was moved " that this house will upon this day seven night resolve itself into a committee of the whole house , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight upon tea , payable in all his Majesty 's dominions in America , imposed by the said act , and also the appropriation of the said duty . " In alluding to the subject of taxing the colonies he says : " Let us , Sir , embrace some system or other before we end this session . Do you mean to tax America and to draw a productive revenue from her ? If you do , speak out , name , fix , ascertain this revenue , settle its quantity , define its objects , provide for its collection , and then fight when you have something to fight for . If y oumurder , rob , if you kill , take possession ,  --  do not appear in the character of madmen as well as assassins , violent , vindictive , bloody , and tyranical , without an object ,  --  but may better counsels guide you . " " Again and again revert to your old principles , seek peace and ensue it . Leave America , if she has taxable matter in her , to tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rights nor attempting to mark their boundaries , I do not enter into these metephysical distinctions , Ihate the very sound of them . Leave the Americans as they anciently stood , and these distinctions born of our unhappy contest will die along with it . They and we , and their and our ancestors have been happy under that system . Let the memory of all actions in contradistiction to that good old mode on both sides be extinguished forever . Be content to tax Americans by laws of trade , you have always done it . Let this be your reason for binding their trade now . Do not burthen them with taxes . You were not used to do so from the beginning . Let this be your reason for not taxing them . These are the arguments of states and kingdoms . Leave the rest to the schools , for there only they can be discussed with safety . But if intemperately , unwisely , fatally , you sophisticate and poison the very source of government , by urging subtle distinctions , and consequences odious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme sovereignity , you will teach // them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question . When you drive him hard the boar will turn upon the hunters . If that sovereignty and their freedom can not be reconciled , which will they tal* ? They will cast your sovereignty in your face . " Petitions in great numbers opposing hostilities between the Colonies and the parent government were presented to the parliament from merchants , manufacturers , and other individuals both in England and our own country , which were advocated by him with great vigor , but of course without success . Lord Chatham likewise proffered papers which had the same *design . On the twenty-second of March , 1775 , thirteen propositions for conciliating America were introduced by Mr. Burke . Those were supported by a sketch of the actual relations that existed between the government of Great Britain and their colonial establishments in America , which were as vivid and graphic as if he had been a citizen of the rebellious Colonies , and had been a permanent resident within their bounds . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable for great internal strength , and that the people , from the peculiar circumstances of their colonization , were possessed of extraordinary firmness , decision , and energy . Holding that the colonial policy of the parent country respecting us was that of trade rather than war , he argued that mildness and persuasion might effect that which could not be accomplished by force . He contended that the power of the crown was supreme over the distant colonies , but that this power regarding taxation , should be exercised with great care and discretion , and that it should be left as it had been in the Provincial Assemblies . He alleged moreover that the government had never received a productive revenue from the colonies , and that such a revenue could never be properly exacted . That conciliation could alone be successful with a people , nurtured in the principles of almost aborginal freedom and independence , scattered over a wide tefritory under the shadows of vasts forests , to the central depths of which they might retreat in battle , and separated by three thousand miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that all which ought resonably to be asked , or would be gained , should spring from voluntary concession on the part of the North American Colonial Establishment . It is unnecessary perhaps for us to state at this late day , that all those statements and predictions have been since most fully verified . Nor was he unaided in the efforts which he put forth on the side of the Colonies ; for Mr. Fox // whose constitution naturally inclined him to the side of liberalisrn , was even more zealous , and while the Colonial controversy was passing through the house , constantly wore a dress of buff and blue , which wa*at that time considered the American uniform . We need not here specify the various subjects of debate which employed the powers of Mr. Burke while he continued a member of parliament . His legislative duties were arduous , and he delivered many speeches of great ability , which continued to extend his reputation . A deserved compliment was moreover paid to his moral and intellectual character during the year 1784 , by his election to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prior to which he had been appointed to the office Paymaster General . At this period he was established in comfortable circumstances in his hospitable mansion in Beaconsfield . His domestic finances were surrendered to the prudent management of his wife ; and although he deemed it his duty in accordance with the dignity and prominence of his position to keep a carriage , his horses earned their own subsistence at the plough . Possessing an estate of twenty thousand pounds which had descended to him , producing as it did an income of seven hundred pounds sterling , together with an annual pension of twelve hundred pounds which had been granted to him in consideration of his services to the government , extravagant and splendid display were of course out of his reach , and with those limited means he could scarcely keep himself from being involved in debt . We will pass over without special notice his great efforts upon British interests connected with the East , the debts of the Nabob of Arcot , the Begum charge , and his great speech upon the impeachi-rient of Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of the American Colonies , had earned the reputation of one of the most powerful champions , of North American Colonial freedom , and foresaw the consequences which sprang from the policy of the British ministry , enforcing in their exactions ; he likewise took strong ground in behalf of constitutional liberty against the lawless J acobinism of the French revolution . We do not propose to go into a particular consideration of the causes which produced this sanguinary and destructive revolt . They were mouldering corruptions growing out of the feudal structure of the monarchy . They consisted in the i*ict that , the literature of the nation had become licentious and debased , and the Church was bulwarked by privileged classes , whose 6 // studied policy was to exclude all , without that charmed circle , from a participation of its dignities and emoluments . A body of hereditary nobles , regarding with disdain the untitled and even the wealthy c1*ses , held moreover the chief privileges of state . Taxation was unequal and oppressive ; an indigent peasantry were borne down by the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royal prerogative was unrestrained by other branches of the government , and was exercised to the extent of despotic power ; the expenses of the crown were confined within no constitutioiial limits , the salaries of public officers were exorbitant , the manners of the court were corrupted , and more than all , the finances of the monarchy , which had been long declining , were sunk in bankruptcy . Besides the causes which we have described , tidings of the success of the American Revolution had been spread abroad by the French troops who had just returned from the wars of the American Colonies , awakening a desire of innovation and an ardent spirit of democratic freedom , as opposed to the prescriptive policy of monarchical government . There can hardly be a reasonable doubt that there were abuses , which had existed for ages in the ancient monarchy of France , that required to be remedied . A prominent evil springing from the revolution was the volcanic power with which it was effected , and the entire absence of sound intelligence and system in the policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the most splendid empires in Europe , shedding the best blood of France under the guillotine , destroying that portion of the nobility who remained within its bounds , defacing its most costly statuary and some of its most noble works of art , left the social edifice a heap of smouldering ruins , which was finally recontructed by the sword of N apoleon , into a fabric of despotism . Mr. Burke , whose opinions were established in favor of the prescriptive forms and established order of the British monarchy , perceived in this sudden outbreak of popular violence in France symptoms of entire disorganization ; and the rupture that subsequently occurred between himself and Mr. Fox , was occasioned by the difference of opinion which they entertained upon the subject of French revolutionary principles . In reply to that statesman who it is well known was a strenuous advocate of the French constitution , he remarks respecting this instrument : " That constitution , or revolution , or whatever they choose to call it , can never serve the cause of liberty , but will inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never entertaincd ideas of government diP // fe rent from those which I now maintain . Monarchy I have always thought is the basis of all g*d government , and the nearer to monarchy any government approaches the more perfect it is , and vice versa. whose who are anxious to subvert the constitution are now few in number in this country , but can we be sure that this will always be the case , or that the time may never come , when under the influence of scarcity or tumult , the monarchical institutions of our country will be threatened with overthrow ? Now then is the time to crush this diabolical spirit and watch with the greatest vigilence the slightest attempt to subvert the British Constitution . " It was , indeed , the horror he entertained for the political principles of France at that day , which induced him to prepare his well known work upon the French revolution , and to give a more palpable evidence of his convictions upon that subject , by drawing from his bosom a dagger and casting it upon the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of French revolutionary patriotism . But notwithstanding his opposition to social disorganization in every form , Mr. Burke was always found on the side of substantial and well regulated liberty both in the Church and State . This disposition was manifested not only in the part he bore in our own revolutionary struggle , hut in the grounds he maintained relating to the Catholic bill , the Dissent ers and the Unitarians . The decease of his son in August , 1794 , together with his increasing infirmities soon induced him to relax somewhat his parliamentary exertions , and soon afterwards to retire from that pro ( luctive field of his labors . Upon this theatre he had for a long time occupied an important space . We can almost imagine him now standing before us in the House , with his tall figure , arrayed in a worn and light brown coat , which was his ustial dress , with his smiling and somewhat effeminate countenance , looking out from beneath curls , for he wore a bob wig , de claiming in a somewhat harsh voice to red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not successful in moving the audiences to whom they were addressed , have yet come down to us as the most approved models of British parliamentary eloquence . He did not , however , possess the character of a popular debater . His speeches were indeed too broad , comprehensive and philosophical ; too much illustrated by metaphoric imagery , to be readily understood or to produce an immediate effect upon a popular audience . He did not follow the advice of Cromwell to his soldiers , which is so necessary to the // orator who desires to arouse popular assemblies , to " shoot low . " When a subject was presented to his view , it appeared in so many relations , that the popular mind became weary in following his *ack ; but it was this very comprehensiveness of vision and amplitude of illustration , which made his reported speeches more valuable as written records . Instead of proceeding in a connected chain of logical demonstration , he was often induced to wander from the plain track of his argument , and to gather flowers by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he studied in the cloister as profound political treatises upon the subjects which they discuss . In making these remarks , we do not detract from his intellectual powers , for it is well known that popular eloquence quite frequently derives its success from other causes tha*n the powers of the mind ; being not unusually founded in mere effect of manner , a ready play upon the popular passions , modulation of voice , and that which would appear trick , if perpetrated upon the stage . Burke spoke not merely for his audience , but for the great public , his country , and to all ages . In his speeches he advanced fundamental principles , which are now read with pleasure and profit by the statesmen of all lands , as clear and eloquent expositions of the subjects which they discussed . The political character of Mr. Burke stood upon the most elevated ground . Educated in an attachment for the forms of a monarchy , yet sprung himself from the untitled classes , he yet clung with the greatest tenacity to the prescriptive principles of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the principles of that Constitution . lie knew , what all experience has proved , that when the barriers of the law are broken doxVn , and the powers of the government are yielded up lo an ignorant rabble like that which existed in France at this period , a species of hydra headed despotism could alone be substituted . it e had witnessed the throne and the altar prostrated , the king and queen beheaded , and the diadem of the monarchy which had come down through a long line of succession for ages , dabbled in blood . He moreover held a.s the enemies of social order , such men as Marat , Danton and Robespierre , inflaming the popular mind , by wrong motives , misleading the people by false lights , arraying class against class , and like Cataline , arousing the licentious passions of men , by holding up the gratification of those passions as the reward of their subservience . He had seen the mob of Paris , the fish women , prostitutes , desperate gamesters , and all that // anti-social class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild beasts through the French metropolis , and subverting the order of the State . It was those circumstances which attached him rr*re strongly to the monarchical forms of the British Const ; itution , and caused him to designate the character of the French revolt as " the hot spirit drawn out of the alembic of hell . " But while opposed to the revolutionary violence of France , he did not deny that there were political wrongs springing from the structure of its government which required to bo remedied ; not however by the volcanic power of insurrection , but by the sure progress of gradual and pacific reform . He believed that the sovereign power of the British monarchy should be lodged with the King , Lords , and Commons , guarded and checked by moral , popular and legal restraints , because he held the conviction that the great body of the people from their habitudes of life were not in their democratic organization the proper sole depository of political power . " I am accused " says he , " I am told , of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the peers , I have no vulgar admiration or vulgar antipathy towards them . I hold their order in cold and decent respect . I hold them to be of an absolute necessity in the Constitution , but I think they are only good when they are kept within proper bounds . " On the other hand he remarks , " when indeed th' smallest rights of the poorest people in the kingdom are in question , I would set my face against any act of pride and power countenanced by the highest that are in it , and if it should come to the last extremity and to a contest of blood , my part is taken ; I would take my fate with the poor and low and feeble . " The opinions which he entertained regarding the church were conformable to those he had adopted respecting the other branches of the Constitution of Great Britain . Believing that the throne of that Empire waa based upon Christianity , he maintained that a neglect in directing the religious policy of the country by the church establishment would tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this established church , enthroned as he considered it , in historic association , whose records were sculptured in antique marble and deposited in tho venerable archives of ancient cathedrals . But while a staunch supporter of the church establishment , he did not desire to ex*lude those who were of a contrary opinion , from a participation in the advantages of the rights of conscience . His literary acquisitions were various and extensive , and // indeed he may justly be considered to have been a scholar in the ripest sense of the term . In an intellectual circle sparkhug with the most brilliant gems , he shone conspicuous . The extent and variety o*his attainments seem to have com. - prehended the whole range of knowledge , and it was the vast amount of his learning which tended to encumber the success of his oratory . lie lived in an age of excitement , when society was convulsed from its lowest depths , and the existence of the British monarchy was threatened by the contagion of the revolutionary principles of France , where a gigantic struggle was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his political efforts bear the stamp of that period . Yet all his essays , pamphlets , and speeches , exhibit a vigorous and practical cast of thought , deeply imbued with the spirit of classical literature , which render them master pieces of study to the scholar and statesman . In those works indeed , he has bequeathed to us a monument which in its solid strength , grace and decorations , may be compared to one of those old Gothic cathedrals of England , which he so much admired , settled upon deep and strong foundations , and rich in classic sculpture of ancient story , with the rainbow light of heaven beaming through the stained windows , upon its antique and winding courts , flying buttresses , and richly adorned pillars , a proper object of attachment and veneration . But it was as a man that the character of Edmund Burke stands out in bold and beautiful proportion . Possessed of an irritable temperament , and an organization alive to the natural beauty as well as the impulses of benevolence , he was peculiarly exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high toned temperament , often associated with great intellectual powers , which formed a prominent trait of the statesman , and frequently exhibited upon the floor of the House of Commons from an imaginary insult , it was also manifested while he hung upon the neck of the old horse which had once belonged to a deceased and javorite son . Among the prominent features of his character moreover , was a disinterested benevolence . We find him at one time relieving the distress of a profligate but unfortunate woman whom he casually met in the streets of Loudon , giving her the shelter of his own roof until she was finally restored to virtue , and at another supplying necessary aid to a poet who applied to him for assistance under the goadings of absolute want . The admiration which he entertained for the fine arts as well as the liberal tendency of his disposition , // was also evinced in the fact , that he placed under his own patronage a painter of distinguished promise , and at his own expense aided him during a residence in Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art which are there deposited . Upon another occasion he employed his influence in favor of a young and promising sculptor , procuring for him the privilege of executing the monument that was to be erected to the orator Grattan . Besides those leading public qualities which we have briefly enumerated , he moreover exhibited a model of deportment in the most searching of all positions , the domestic relations . But time , which like Aurora , guides the morning with rosy steps , was fist leading the venerable statesman in the evening of his age to the borders of the spiritual world . With a constitution which had been somewhat impaired by the labors of a long life , his health began to decline , and while his intellectual powers continued in full vigor , his body grew to a state comparatively feeble . The loss of a favorite son , in whom his hopes had concentrated , ploughed deep furrows in his soul , and he describes himself as " a dejected old man buried in the anticipated grave of a feeble old age . " Finding medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite watering place , but here he derived no greater benefit , and he soon returned to Beaconsfield , to draw his labors to a close . During his confinement , the mind of the statesman often recurred to his parliamentary labors , and he recapitulated to his friends the leading motives of his political career . At the same time he communicated to his family the desire , and according to his request they read to him the papers of Addison upon the immortality of the soul . Those duties had scarcely been performed , when his form reposed in death on the eighth of July , 1797 , at the age of sixty-eight , leaving in his life an example of public virtue and private morality which will ever remain a safe model to the future statesman , and in his works a monument of intellect , which will endure as long as the records of literature , political philosophy , and parliamentary eloquence .
