ART . VI. - CHRISVS RULE FOR ALMS-GIVING , BETTER THAN* OUR MODERN METHODS . THE systematic contribution of money for the causes of public Christian benevolence , has now become so universal in our churches as to constitute of itself an interest of very g*'eat magnitude ; not only in reference to the world , which is to be acted upon by this instrumentality , but in respect also to the reflex influence of this habit upon the churches-upon the growth of Christian character , and the development of the resources and energies of these religious bodies . Indeed , in all ages of the church , both Jewish and Christian , it has been a part of God 's p lan to train his people , to bestow of the substance which he has given them , with a cheerful heart , for the promotion of his cause in the earth . And there have been many periods in the world 's history when the amount thus bestowed , on the part of the people of God , has doubtless been far more in proportion to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very much accust&amp;med to think that the grace of benevolence belongs peculiarly to modern Christians , it requires but a glance into the records of the Jewish and the early Christian Churches to perceive , that there have been times , when the sacrifices made have been far greater than any to which we are now subjected ; or , in other words , to which we subject ourselves . And yet , there are certain peculiarities in connection with our modern systems of benevolence , which make them stand out with peculiar prominence . The world has at length been brought into such a condition thro*g1h the providence of God , and the church has been made to stand in such a relation to the world , that the great enterprise of evangelizing the nations seems now to be fairly under way ; and there is to be no more a going backs until the work is done . There is everywhere a marshaling of the forces , which belong to Christ , and which move in obedience to his commands , for the last great contest with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any apprehension among the people of God , that all this stir will prove only a brief and spasmodic effort , to be followed again by ages of sloth and inactivity . It is one of the most striking characteristics of this whole movement , that the heart of the Christian world cherishes a feeling , which amounts almost to an absolute assurance of ultimate success . While Mohammedanism , which was once so mighty and aggressive a // power in the earth , has at length come to a state of utter deadness and inactivity , and seems not to iBdulge the faintest dream , that it is any longer to go forth as a conquering faith-yea more , while it appears to have lost all hope of even preserving its own , and sits , as with a doom upon it , looking grimly forward to that inevitable destruction , which is stealing on , noiseless but sure as the steps of fate-while those vast systems of the East , Brahminism and Budhism , ( which as relio'ious systems are older than Christianity , and which hold wit%in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as uttely dead , in reference to any general action upon the world beyond their own limit , as though they were but huge masses of inorganic matter-there is in a pure Christianity everywhere , an exultant hope  --  a reaching forth boldly toward the future  --  a settled expectation of progress and ultimate triumph . This is a divinely implanted earnest of success . The mind and heart within are thus made to be in harmony , with the mighty energies which God has stored up in the Christian system , and it can not be doubted that the church has applied herself to an enterprise which shall never go back . It may experience many varieties of prosperity and adversity-it may gain its triumphs slowly and after long struggling-ages may pass away before the conquest is complete  --  but sure as God sits upon the throne , the world shall be redeemed , and Christ shall reign " from sea to sea , and from the river to the ends of the earth . " This is the kingdom which the God of heaven has set up , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not be left to other people , but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and shall stand forever . " It is in view of considerations like these , that this system of public contributions in our churches , for the great work of extending the IRedeemer 's kingdom and evangelizing the nations , can hardly be over rated . Everything which tends , even in a slight degree , to promote or retard this most sacred interest , assumes an importance , which would not otherwise attach to it . It is of vital interest to the churches that this whole subject should be put upon the right basis-that those rules and methods should be adopted , which are in the most exact agreement to truth and nature-that no element should , it possible , be allowed to come in , which is not exactly confbrmable to the strictest Christian propriety-that everything should go forward according to those laws which Christ hims 11 has instituted for the guidance of his people . It is only in this way that we can hope to build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing influence , // which shall be flexible and elastic , standing ever ready to meet the great developments of God 's providence in the future . We must seek to relieve the whole system from what is merely transient and artificial , and bring it where it will rest upon the solid foundations of nature , where life and energy can be supplied from deep and never-failing fountains . Nature is exhaustless in her resources , and her supplies are steadily and surely furnished , as by an unvarying law . But man s processes are rude and clumsy , and liable to perpetual interruption , through ignorance , weariness and neglect . There is one law , which our Saviour has laid down , with reference to this work of benevolence , which is sadly overlooked , and which almost all our public systems seem especially designed to ignore and set aside , as if it could not be trusted , as if it were not safe , in the present imperfect state of the world , to recognize it and rely upon it . This law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3rd and 4th verses : " When thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do , in the synagogues , and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . Verily , Isay unto you , they have their reward . But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth ; That thy alms may be in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , himself shall reward thee openly . " This rule , which is most clearly and definitely expressed , and which is in exact accordance with other passages in the New Testament having reference to this general subject , we have been very slow to recoo'nize and apply . We have adopted a timid and hesitating po*licy , as if a rule like this might be a very beautiful thing to contemplate theoretically , but would be found altogether too perfect to be put in practice among men who are in the mass so selfish and vain-glorious . We have acted to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the means to carry on God 's work upon earth , must , after all , be in making an adroit appeal to man 's love of praise and notoriety , and we have without doubt hitherto secured our resources for this work , to a very considerable degree , by playing upon what is merely selfish and earthly in the human heart , instead of resting u*pon a sense of what is due to God , and what the constraining love of Christ would lead his followers to do and suffer in his behalfi We have so constructed and managed our systems for raising funds , as to bring quite as prominently before the mind , the question , what men will think and say about the amount we give , as how God , the great searcher of hearts , will regard the act . // A brief glance at some of the methods adopted in our churches , for raising money for the various objects of public Christian benevolence , will reveal this matter in a clearer light , and prepare us afterward , for the fuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our New England churches , are quite numerous and diversified , as might naturally be expected , since the freedom of our congregational pulpits allows and encourages each church to form its own plans , and pursue its own measures in this as in other thing . It may serve a useful purpose , to sketch briefly some of the more prominent of these plans , as they are acted upon in our churches . We do not intend to exhaust the subject . Doubtless many schemes have been adopted and put in practice , which are unknown to the writer , and which , if known , would serve a useful purpose in this enumeration . According to one mode , which is very common , a church adopts a certain number of objects to which it will contribute during the year , and then selects two , usually the Foreign and Home Missionary causes , for which subscription papers shall be circulated , while the rest shall receive the offerings of the people , by passing the boxes in the church . The result naturally is , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which subscription papers are circulated will be several times greater , than that which is given to any one of the objects for which a collection is taken in the church . It is true , these two causes are selected for the public subscription , because they are regarded , as they should be , of special importance , and it is because they are held to be of such importance , that there is a fear to entrust them to the simple Christian principle of the church , but the adventitious aid of publicity must be sought , in order to ensure them an adequate contribution . Meanwhile , the liberality of the church , having thus been pushed forward by this artificial process relapses , and under cover of the darkness , makes its other contributions unnaturally small . Many churches have adopted the system of taking subscriptions on the spot , for all the public causes of benevolence . When the time arrives , at which the church is accustomed to make its annual contribution to the Bible , Tract or Education cause , as the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation , ( or what is better , little paper slates prepared for the purpose , each one furnished with a pencil of its own , ) and the amount which each one will give is inscribed thereon , which is afterwards to be called for by some one appointed for the purpose , or else is to be paid in by each individual to the // church treasurer . This system has the advantage of *ipportioning the amount raised by a given church , more equally and justly according to their several wants and claims , among the different benevolent societies ; since the principle of publicity acting alike in all cases , the judgment is left free to decide upon the relative merits of the various causes . But certainly it can be nothing else , than a desire to bring a certain amount of human and earthly influence to bear upon the mind in the act of giving , which should lead to the adoption of a system like this ; in preference to the simpler one of allowing each individual to deposit his gift in the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take note of its amount . In some churches , the practice has prevailed of circulating once a year , through the different districts of the parish , papers on which are inscribed all the various causes , to which the members of the congregation would wish to contribute , and each individual enters under the several heads what he is willing to give for that year , to this , that and the other object . This finishes up the whole business at once for that particular year . As in the last mentioned case , the influence to be derived from publicity here acts equally upon all the various objects , and leaves the mind free to choose according to its partialities . There is still another method , somewhat similar to the last , though quite distinct in certain respects , which has been acted upon in some few churches , and which is doubtless still in existence , though it is not likely ever to become popular . Once a quarter , or once a year , as the case may be , collectors are sent round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of benevolence , without any specification of the several causes or objects . Each one enters upon the paper what he or she is willing to give for that quarter or that year , for the work at large . This whole amount is then given into * the hands of a committee , appointed for the purpose , and is divided out among the several benevolent societies , aeccording to the discretion of this committee . The element of publicity operates here as fully as in the previous cases , but there is a surrender of the private judgment in a way not suited to the genius of our people or our institutions . Such a process long continued would doubtless show a diminution in the benefactions of a church , since in this indiscriminate giving , there is but a feeble influence exerted , to keep alive the interest of the mind and heart . The thoughts need to be exercised about that which is positive and definite , or feeling will soon die out . It has been the custom , ( more so formerly than now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially in many of our city congregations , after a secretary or agent has preached in behalf of one of the benevolent societies , to allow him , and not only allow , but often to request him , to devote a part or the whole of the week following in passing around among the congr*gation , to solicit their subscriptions in behalf of the cause which he represents . A list of names is furnished him by the pastor , or by some intelligent member of the congregation , and this list is arranged usually according to the relative weight of individuals , in respect to the item of giving , so that the collector may have the prestige of large suins , with which to influence those farther down upon the list , and who would be sorely tempted , unless they were plied with some such motive as this , to make their subscriptions inconveniently small . It has been thought , and not without reason , that the presence of a stranger acts to ensure a more generous donation than if the whole transaction were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the inspection of men , and from a love of general notoriety , are here brought to bear under very favorable circumstances , and they produce their fruits . In one association at least in New England , a system somewhat peculiar has been in operation for many years , which is founded upon the same principle in an eminent degree . Certain causes are singled out , which , at the time the system was started , were regarded as of preeminent importance , ( and which doubtless are so still , though they are counterbalanced more than formerly , by the new modes of instrumentality which have been put in operation , ) and the sums contributed to one or more of these causes , on the part of each individual connected with the several congregations , are published in a pamphlet year by year , the name of the individual standing over against his donation ; and this pamphlet is distributed broadcast throughout these several congregations . The consequence has been , and is , that the amount of money contributed to the great work of benevolence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is comparatively small . A very large part of the donations of these churches , ( if report speaks truly , ) pass through these particular channels , while other causes receive but insufficient aid . These are some of the methods which have been in common use among our churches for the raising of money for purposes of public Christian benevolence , and they are perhaps sufficient to illustrate the subject , and prepare ns to consider the principles which ought to lie at the basis of this whole enterprise . The very able tracts , inculcating the duty of systematic benev // olence , which were called forth and published by the Americ*in Tract Society a few years since , have doubtless had a very considerable influence in introducing more correct ideas and sentiments upon this whole subject . 14ot a few churches have been led to adopt the practice , which was earnestly inculcated in some of those publications , of laying by small sums at very frequent intervals , according to the spirit of the apostolic advice , and wherever this system has been tried its beneficent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of raising money , the charge of publicity may or may not attach . That will depend upon the manner in which the system is worked , in respect to the gathering up into one mass of the individual sums . This may be done publicly , so that the resuli in each case may be known by the whole congregation , or it may be done in the most secret and silent manner , so that what is given by each individual shall be known only to himself and his God . But before passing to consider the principles which ought to regulate this whole matter , we must not omit a reference to one fact , of public interest and notoriety , and which stands in most intimate connection with the remarks which have gone before . We have several times within the past twenty-five years , witnessed scen*s in connection with the annual meetings of the American Board , in which the minds of good men have been wrought up to a state of the highest excitement , through the intense action , in part , of motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses . Multitudes have been brought together from all parts of the laud , and gathered into one great congregation , to " see the rich men cast their gifts into the treasury . " Influences have been brought to bear , other than those a purely religions kind , suddenly to subdue the love of money in the human heart , by the presence of a mightier agency , and to draw out from the purses of the wealthy sums of great magnitude to relieve a pecuniary crisis . The poor widow who has but her two mites to offer , thouo*h she m single-heartedness in her gift , ny have the purest would stand but a small chance of being noticed at such a time as this . Another influence is at work-another spirit rules the hour . Doubtless there are good motives mingling with the evil ; doubtless there is no little amount of Christian principle underlying the action of the mind at such times , and struggling into some sort of exercise . But that these purer motives are strangely mingled and defiled by the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one who knows the weakness of the human heart , and // how easy it is to kindle into activity its remaining corruptions . There is another method of drawing out from the churches the money needed for the various works of public Christian benevolence , which seems far more in accordance with the rule which Christ has laid down , in the passage already quoted . It is , to dismiss and banish the motives derived from the praise and inspection of men , so that they may have just as little influence as possible . Let our churches and congregations be instructed , earnestly and faithfully , by their pastors , that the obligation to give , according as God has prospered each one , rests upon every individual as a solemn religious duty , in the per4*ormance of which , we are not to seek at all the " honor which comes from men , but the honor which comes from God only . " Let the appeal be made on the ground , that this is a matter which lies between each soul and God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other subject pertaining to private religions duty , and then let the people be called to contribute , not as in the presence of men , but so that they can answer it , each one to God and his own conscience . Doubtless it will require considerable labor and constancy on the part of pastors to keep their people enlightened and impressed in respect to their duty upon the subject . Doubtless , in very many instances , it might seem to work badly at first to drop out altogether that artificial stimulus under which the mind had before been accustomed to act . Doubtless , in the transition periodin the process of passing over from our present modes to this simpler and more Christian method-there would be often a positive diminution in the contributions of a church . This loss is incidental to every such change , where one set of motives is to 1 ) e substituted for another . But the mind would ere long find its new position , and rally under the inspiring influence of the new motive , and find its satisfaction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is not mere theory . The process has been tried with the most satisfactory results . It is very likely that there are in all a large number of churches scattered throuo'h the land , which act strictly upon this principle , and woul* be able to bear their testimony to its force and efficiency . Two instances are known to the writer in which this experiment has been tried with the best results . A plain country church , which had been wont in former years to raise about two hundred dollars a year for all the causes of Christian benevolence , was reduced to adopt the principle of having all contributions taken in the church , and in the most unostentatious manner ; the general // May , duty resting upon each individual having been first faithfull'y inculcated . The result was , that in the course of three or four years , without any very marked additions to the pecuniary strength and resources of the congregation , the contributions rose from two hundred to eight hundred dollars a year . To cut off just as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspection of men , the boxes were not even passed round in the congregation , but on the days appointed for the collections the boxes were placed at the door , and each individual deposited his or her gift , as the congregation left the house at the close of worship . This is a method which would ordinarily , according to our general habits of thought upon this subject , be regarded as one of the most unfavorable in reference ' to results , since it would give almost any one who might desire it an opportunity to slip out in the crowd without being noticed . But by removing entirely all artificial schemes for controlling the mind , and relying upon the honor and integrity of each individual , making him feel that he was acting in the presence of God , the great Searcher of hearts , to whom alone lie was responsible for his conduct , every wish or desire to escape from the responsibility resting upon him , was as far as possible , taken away , and the result was as secure as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was superadded to the privacy of the contribution , the system of laying by in store , from week to week , small sums , which could easily be spared at the time , and which in the course of a few weeks would accumulate beyond the amount which the individual would be likely to give , if called upon at once to make the appropriation . In the other instance , the same experiment has been tried for several years in one of the stronger and wealthier churches , situated in one of the smaller cities of New England . In this case also the result has been most happy . Though the details of the experiment in the latter case are not so fully known , it is understood that there has been a very decided increase in the contributions of the church , and what is more , the state of feeling prevailing in the church and congregation , in reference to the work of benevolence , is most healthy and pleasant . There is little of that fretful and complaining spirit so common in certain sections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to be regarded as a Christian luxury , far more than is usual . The church is gratified and encouraged by finding what strength God has imparted unto it , and how easy it is to bear a generous part in an enterprise like this , when once the mind and heart are brought into their true relations to God . // There are in almost all our churches some members who are a perpetual source of trial and vexation to the pastor , in respect to this duty of giving of their substance for the spread of the Gospel . The members in question are usually individuals who are abundantly possessed of this world 's goods , but who through a narrow and covetous spirit , are always disposed to hold back and bear a very contemptible part in the offerings of the church for public charity . Our systems are so constructed for the most part , as to expose these men constantly to the view of their fellow-men  --  to hold up this weakness of theirs to the gaze of the world in the most conspicuous manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the circle of their acquaintance , and thus to irritate them into a position of obstinacy , and to lix them in the determination , that they will not be driven by their fellow-men into the performance of any duty . On the other hand , their consciences trouble them , and they are led to seek ont all manner of excuses to justify themselves in their course . They are constantly complaining of the frequent calls which are made upon them , and yet little do these calls impoverish them , or incapacitate them to respond to the next one which may be made . If the church , in any case , has applied itself with unnsual energy to a particular cause , and has raised for the purpose a larger sum than usual , though the merest pittances of it may have been drawn from the pockets of the men in question , still they are the very persons to be especially burdened under a sense of the great ellbrt which has been made , and thus feel their inability to rouse themselves to any new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole condition of these men is false , unnatural , unchristian . They are a perpetual trial to themselves , to their fellow Christians , and especially to their pastors . Now , even with these men , a change of the system of public contributions , so that everything should be transacted under the veil of secrecy , with no eye but the eye of God to look on , would very often be attended with the most favorable results . Brought into this new position and relation , they would soon be made to feel , if they are possessed of any real piety , that they are no longer subjected to the prying inspection and curiosity of their fellow-men-that they are no longer required to shape their course to meet the ideas of their neighbors , but that they are left alone with God to settle the matter wish him as they can . This consideration would bring a motive at once to bear upon them , far more controlling than the mixed and distracting motives under which they have been acting . This view presupposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ele // ments of real piety , and are capable of being affected by high and holy motives . If ; on the other hand , they are destitute of all true piety , and though enrolled upon the list of the church , have no part with God 's people , so that they might be disposed to use the cover of privacy for a more uncontrolled indulgence of their covetousness , and abstain almost wholly from giving , this is a matter for which we are not answerable  --  but the man must settle the account with God for his hypocrisy and deceit . It is of little consequence that we should seek to enlist the service of such a man in the cai*se of God , by purely artificial means , when he has no heart in the work . For the purpose of analyzing the subject still more fully , and bringing forward the chief reasons in favor of the principle here suggested , we will arrange these reasons under several distinct heads , which may not in every instance embrace any new arguments , but may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . ( 1 . ) The principle here advocated is in accordance with the rule which Christ has laid down for our guidance . The world at large , and even the Christian world , has as yet only a very partial and imperfect faith in the safety and utility of the laws and precepts which Christ has set forth in his g ospel . The practice of the Church shows , most conclusively , a while these precepts are acknowledged theoretically-while they are received intellectually , as embodying the highest wisdom , there is not a thorough practical confidence in them . It would be deemed somewhat Quixotic and visionary , to attempt to carry them out in their fullness , into all the details of life . There is without doubt , an increase of confidence , from generation to generation , in these divine maxims . As the centuries pass slowly by , these sacred precepts gain power and influence , step by step , and are incorporated more fully into the habits and policy of Christian men . There can be no doubt , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , quite as much , in the more complete subjection of the individual mind to the law of Christ , as in the wider diffusion of Christian light and knowledge over nations now sitting in darkness . But as yet , there is a great practical distrust of these gospel maxims , even on the part of the professed followers of Christ . When Christ says , " Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you , " every Christian mind will instinctively recognize the moral dignity and beauty of such a rule , and will respond to its claims theoretically ; but when it is brought down to the every day concerns of life-when it // comes to assert its claim amid the stir and activity of businesswhen it demands a constant recognition through all the trials and temptations of social intercourse , then the faith eyen of Christian men is found too weak , and the rule finds onlyVa very partial and irregular application to their varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men should do to you , do ye even so unto them , ' men listen with the highest admiration , so long as their attention is called to the words , as embodying a mere intellectual proposition . They extol the wisdom , which shines forth in this pure and simple rule of life , and delight to tell how far it transcends all the boasted wisdom of the ancients ; how immeasurably it rises above all the philosophies of human device . And they are right . But when we pass beyond this , when we propose to make this rule strictly practical , in the intercourse of this world , men start back , as if fearful that human society would be utterly shattered and destroyed , if such a principle as this were put into action . " Every one for himselt " " take care of number one , " are the practical maxims in which our human wisdom is stored up , and which pass current in this world ; and men act as if they supposed they could not abandon these selfish rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin . And yet unquestionably , the rule of Christ is the only safe rule . It is in this way only that we can ensure an abiding and thorough prosperity . If men would but once dare to leave acting so largely for themselves , and embrace their fellow-men equally with themselves , in all their plans , wishes , and hopes , according to the spirit of this rule , they would find themselves , one and all , in a condition of comfort and happiness , of which they have now only the faintest conception . God knows how to provide for all his numerous family ; and sorrow , want , and privation , do not come from following the rules of life which he lays down , but by conformity to those false and artificial systems which sin and selfishness substitute for the divine plan . These considerations are pertinent to the subject in hand . It may seem wiser and safer to our short-sighted vision , to bring a large amount of human motive to bear upon the mind in reference to these public charities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the whole matter under a more complete control , and that it would not be safe to relinquish our earthly grasp upon it . We may fear , least there should be no longer any moving spring to stir the mind into activity , if we but once cease to ply it with our earthly stimulus . But Christ , who " needed not that any should testify of man , for he knew what was in man , " nn* derstands the fundamental laws of the mind infinitely bettex // than we , and we may securely trust the rules which he lays down for our direction in this particular . It is most presumpPious . in us , to come in with our selfish and narrow systems , to supplant the system which he himself has instituted . If he distinctly directs the Church , in reference to the mode of its charities-if he counsels secrecy in our alms-giving , instead of sounding a trumpet before us-if he would make this whole matter to lie between the individual soul and the God " who seeth in secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to the best results , and that we may dismiss our fears , as idle and unmeaning . ( 2 . ) The plan here presented accords with our instinctive sense of Christian fitness and propriety . We can not conceal from ourselves that the giving of money , for purposes of Christian benevolence , ought not to proceed from such motives and influences , as control men at large in their common worldly actions-that we ought , especially in matters of this kind , to do what we do , " heartily ( with the heart ) as to the Lord , and not as unto men ; " that there is something , at the first glance , unseemly , in calling in artificial aid , for the promotion of what is truly a solemn religious duty . There is , undoubtedly , among Christian men , a sense of something wrono ' and disorderly , in appealing so much to these lower and carna* motives , for securing that activity on our part which a simple conviction of our obligation to God ought constantly to secure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of order , in many of the modes now adopted for gaining large contributions , and there can be no doubt that the simpler method here advocated harmonizes well with the first instinctive sense in the Christian mind of what is fit and proper , in enterprises of this kind . ( 3. ) lIt removes the friction consequent upon the presence of diverse and distracting causes . Singleness of purpose is always a source of efficiency and strength . It gives the mind directness and intensity in its action , and enables it to press toward the mark with a steady and uniform motion ; while everything which tends to excite counter-currents of feelings and emotion , diminishes and paralyzes the mental force . It can not be denied , that a large amount of religious principle has been called into requisition , in the work of benevolence , as it now goes forward in our churches . We have not , by any means , intended to imply that the results already secured , have been by virtue only of the selfish principle . A principle like this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to year , and that too with a somewhat increasing vigor , a // work of this kind . Genuine religious principle must have had a large place in this enterprise , from the beginning until now . The churches of our land have , to a very considerable degree , recognized the claims of Christ upon them , and have acted in honest obedience to these claims . The trouble has been , however , that this religious principle has not been allowed to develop and strengthen itselt by its own natural law of ' growth , but has been distracted and turned aside by influences foreign to its own nature and hostile to its prosperity . " No man can serve two masters , " and the attempt is always attended with disastrous consequences . To get rid of the confusion consequent upon this double policy , to simplify the whole subject until it stands before the mind in perfect unity , can produce no other than the most beneficial results . ( 4 . ) It ensures a steadness and constancy in the contributions of the churches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , according to the increasing wants of the world . The only way , in which the mind can be brought to set a true value upon the wealth of this world , is by regarding it as the gift of God , lent to us for a season , that it may contribute to our real comfort , and that we , as stewards , may use it for his glory . A nd no influence can better serve the purpose of bringiimg the mind into this position , and molding it there , than the habit of giving of our substance directly to God , no human eye being permitted to take note of the transaction . It is almost certain , that if this whole business is thus kept under the vail of secrecy , there will be some genuine recognition of the fact , that the silver and the gold are the Lord 's , and the cattle upon a thousand hills . When men really cherish this conviction-when they feel the constraining power of this motive upon their hearts , they find it very easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheui otherwise they would grasp them with the utmost tenacity . They find within them aim ability to enlarge their contributions , without endangering their worldly interests , to an extent , they would not before have deemed possible . And what is more , they find that there us a divine economy in this matter-that time very fact of giving freely under the influence of a motive like this stands connected with such habits of mind and heart , as ensure real prosperity , and prepare the way for a still more enlarged beneficence . There are , moreover , sources of prosperity in connection with such a habit , which we may not be able to analyze and describe with all our philosophy-there is a positive promise of God , who has all resources at his disposal , which he can // surely fulfill in ways which we may not trace out , and which are known only to himself . " He that watereth , shall be watered also himself .

There is something most beautiful and touching , in the address of David unto God , when he with his people had made their great effort , and had gathered together the materials , which his son Solomon was to use in the building of the temple : " But who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of thine have we given thee , for we are strangers before thee , and sojourners as were all our fathers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is none abiding . 0 Lord our God , all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine iioly name , cometh of thine hand , and is all thine own . I know also , my God , that thou triest the heart , and hast pleasure in uprightness . As for me , in the uprightness of mine heart , I have willingly offered all these thin o*s and now have I seen with joy thy people , which are present here , to offer willingly unto thee . " Here is no complaint-no reference even to any burden which had been imposed upon them , but a public thanksgiving to God , that they had been enabled to make all these offerings willingly . There is too , the most explicit recognition of the fact , that all these things belonged to God , before they had been thus bestowed . " All things come of thee , and of thine own have we given thee . " When the property of the church is held according to the spirit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that God 's ownership is prior and paramount to all human ownership , we have a key which will effectually unlock the Christian treasures of the world , and afford the means for carrying on our benevolent enterprises , upon a scale , of which we have as yet but the faintest conception . Everything which tends to bring the mind and heart of the churcYi into this position , is of incalculable importance . And just in proportion as we simplify and purify the motives which are made to act upon the mind , in the same degree do we conduce to this result . Though we are very much disposed to congratu // late ourselves upon the amount of money now contributed to benevolent purposes , on the part of our churches , yet in truth the amount is very small , as compared with the wealth actually possessed by these churches . A single fact may illustrate this point . In a certain county in Massachusetts , numbering some twenty-five churches of the Congregational order , and not behind other counties , in its interest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benevolent Association , embracing these several churches , after the report of the Treasurer was read , giving in detail , the sums of money which had been contributed to the various objects of benevolence , there was presented also a paper , showing the items of a single legacy , made by a man of moderate wealth  --  a legacy very limited , as compared with several of the large bequests , which have been made of late by some of our wealthy merchants , yet it appeared , that the sums which had been paid in from this legacy to the treasuries of the Benevolent Societies during the year , in almost every instance , surpassed the whole amount contributed by all these churches to the same societies . One small estate , ( there are thousands and thousands like it in every part of New England , ) belonging to a plain country farmer , who had through his life been distinguished for his benevolence when it was really relinquished in full , and made over to th' cause of Christ , actually furnished forth more money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five churches of the county , for a whole year , and yet not a few among these churches , are quite distinguished for their devotion to these public Christian enterprises , and in the mass they certainly fall not below the average , in proportion to their means . A fact like this shows clearly , that we have not yet risen to any very high standard , and that we are far enough from any danger of impoverishing ourselves , or exhausting our resources by the amount bestowed for the spread of the gospel . The valuation of property for the entire state of Massachusetts , shows an amount of $300,000,000 very nearly . Now it has been estimated that the amount of money contributed yearly by the churches of all denominations in the state , for purposes of general benevolence , is not far from $300,000 , which is * of a cent on a dollar , or a little more than 3 cents upon $100 . Massachusetts is one of the foremost states in the Union , as regards her public charities . Connecticut stands upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other state has yet risen even to this standard . There certainly must be some principle , which if thoron*hIy applied would develop the strength of these churches-.w dch // would search out and reveal the secret of their ability , far beyond anything which we have yet attained . And may it not be that the principle which we here advocate , would do much to work out this change ? May it not be that something like this is needed to touch the springs of life anew , and open up to the view , resources which have until now been concealed ? May it not be , that this is one of the central principles of that divine economy which we have hitherto , in a great measure , overlooked , but which will be found far more efficient m securing the desired results , than all our acts and contrivances ? Ingenious minds have for centuries puzzled themselves to find out the principle of perpetual motion , and though the failures have been innumerable , the same attempt is still made . Owing to the inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably impossible ever to discover and put in operation such a principle . But in morals this law may not be impossible . In this spiritual realm many processes may go on , for which we can find no analogies in the material world . The mind may be encircled by such motives , that it will move on in a given direction without interruption . It will not need to be acted upon perpetually from without by artificial power , but will have an inward principle of life and progress , which will keep it in vigorous and healthy motion . This is what we need to find , in order to secure a safe and reliable activity in these works of benevolence . We want something in which we can assuredly trust from year to year , and from century to century-something which will secure us from a mere fitful and transient interest , and give us instead a law which shall be regular in its action-steady as the shining of the sun . ( 5 . ) This rule , if adopted would simplify all our outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for many years , no little complaint , on the part of pastors and churches , that so many agents should be employed for raising funds to carry on our benevolent operations . It has been regarded as a great calamity that so many men should be withdrawn from the active labors of the ministry , especially at a time when men , in much larger numbers , are needed for ministerial service . The very business of an agent has become irksome and disagreeable , in consequence of the state of feeling in the churches , on this subject . However able he may be intellectually-however earnestly devoted to his master 's work , he knows full well , that wherever he *ocs , Y the congregations which lie addresses will look askance at mm , so soon as his object is known , and will say in their hearts , // " Oh , he is only an agent . " And though he may afterwards redeem himself in their eyes , by the interesting character of his address , and may succeed in winning their favor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sub*jected , Sabbath after Sabbath , to pass through the same ordeal  --  to meet with a cold and forbidding reception , as though there were something disreputable in his very occupation . On the other hand , the benevolent societies have found , by long experience , that they can not safely dispense with services of this kind . They can not secure the means for carrying on their operations , except by employing these men to go abroad and awaken an interest among the congregations , and see to it that a contribution is taken . They have found to their sorrow and regret , that there is no principle at work among the churches , which can be securely relied upon , without this constant external prompting . No benevolent society could have any wish or desire to send forth their agents , if it knew by actual experience , that the means necessary for its work would be forth-coming by virtue of an inward life and activity in the churches themselves . Nothing could be more desirable , on the part of all our benevolent associations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these works of public charity , as to make it sure that the necessary iueans for prosecuting them would be steadil and sufficiently supplied . But as it is , they find that they can pay their agents , and still have a much larger sum for carrying on their operations , than they could otherwise realize . Now it certainly would be most desirable , in every point of view , if this immense outward machinery could be suspended , or very greatly reduced . It is an evil of no little magnitude , that so large a per percentage of the money raised , should be expended in paying for the labor of raising it . But until the churches are brought to act upon some new principle , this evil seems to be unavoidable . Complaints may still be made , but however loud and oft-repeated , they will not remove the difficulty , until a principle is implanted in the churches themselves , which will ensure a constant activity , without these external appliances . The root of the evil is here , and it is useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " cry peace , peace , when there is no peace . ' * ( 0 . ) This principle , if once put in operation , would conduce most directly to secure a healthy reflex influence upon the churches . It has already been suggested , that one of the main points to be secured in this great work of evangelizing the world , is to awaken the sympathies of the church , to enlist the mind and // heart of Christians in the plans and purposes of God  --  to lift up the thoughts to the steady contemplation of God 's g reat designs in the work of redemption . It is in this wa a od brings one of his most powerful instrumentalities to bear upon the church itself , to develop and strengthen its piety  --  to work out its sanctification , and to fit the s*ls of the redeemed to bear a part in the higher labors and activities of heaven . It was by no means necessary that God should employ an agency of this kind , for the simple purpose of carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an innumerable company of holy angels , " that excel in strength , that do his corninaudments , hearkening unto the voice of his word , " might have commissioned these ministering spirits to herald salvation to the nations . But it was his benevolence  --  a part of his redemptive plan , that led him to give this honor unto those who are redeemed by the blood of Christ from among the guilty children of men . It was not to impose a burden upon them , but to call them to a holy exercise , to habituate and train them for high and heavenly services , that he gave this work unto them . It was to implant in them " the same mind , which was also in Christ Jesus , " " who , though he was rich , became poor , that we through his poverty might be rich . " This is the view which God would ever lead us to take of the work which he has thus entrusted to us . He would still all our murmurin gs and complainings , by teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon us-that he honors us infinitely beyond our poor deserts when he thus permits us to bear a p*trt with Christ in the great enterprise of redeeming the world , and that the only Spirit which is becoming in us , is that of gratitude and thanksgiving , that we are thus made to be co-workers with him . It is therefore a very short-sighted view , to confine our thoughts simply to the influence which is thus brought to bear upon those " who sit in darkness , and the region and shadow of death . " An influence no less important , in some respects far more important , is exerted for the promotion of the holiness of the church itself-for the development of its strength , and the enlargement of its activity . If some of the great banking-houses of the world were to combine , and agree to make over and a from year to year to the work of general Christian benevo-y ence , a sum three times greater than that which is now raised for the same purpose , and thus to set the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great object , it would be perfectly preposterous to listen for a moment to the proposition ; since it would be a great and irreparable injury to the church to be released from this obligation . The influence of this ac // tivity could not be spared without entailing untold calamities upon the piety of the Christian world . But in order that the church may experience in any high degree the proper results of this reflex influence-in order that it may grow strong and vigorous under this discipline , it is needful that its charities should be bestowed with an eye single to God 's glory-that there should be an heartfelt acknowledgment that it is his work , and that we are co-laborers with him . It it needful that we should cut off just as far as possible , all those motives which spring from a simple regard to the inspection of our fellow-men , and do whatever we do , out of sincere regard to God , and the obligations which he has imposed upon us . When once the church at large shall come into this position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with advantages to the Christian world of incalculable weight and importance . Then for the first time , will the wisdom and beauty of God 's plan , in calling the Church to these labors , be seen in their fulness . It may have suggested itself to the mind of the reader , that a principle such as we have here advocated , would probably cut off those contributions which now to a very considerable extent come into the treasury of the Lord from men of the world connected with our congregations , and who could not be expected to give out of a purely religious motive like this . It may seem , in many respects , desirable to draw out their gifts by the force of inferior , and merely human motives , and afterward to employ the money thus gained for the glory of God . But this certainly is not far removed from a course which the apostle most explicitly condemns , viz : " doing evil that good may come . " Besides , it becomes us to inquire , whether we do not lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of the contribution , far more than we gain . If the men of the world were to be once made deeply sensible that a principle was at work in the hearts of Christians , which from year to year brought forth fruit steadily and abundantly , and which could by no possibility be classed with those principles which rule in the selfish and selfseeking world , the fact itself would make a most profound impression upon them , and lead them often to inquire wherein they themselves were lacking . A power would be at work , which in the long run , might consecrate a far larger amount of property to the service of the Lord than could ever be gathered by virtue of a mere human appeal . Truth reaches forth with a thousand hands , and strengthening itself on every side . It gathers force from secret sources continually . But error is weak even in respect to what seems her strength . Her supports are constantly failing her , even when she least expects it . // We have thus presented some of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolence in which our churches are engaged , needs a thorough and radical reformation-that we can not hope to develop the energy of these religious bodies , to any great extent , except by banishing the motives which are now so largely brought to bear upon them , and substituting in their stead , one which is more purely Christian , and which will be found safe and enduring . If any think these views visionary , let him ponder well the evils under which we now labor , and see if lie can devise any way of escape from them . There is yet to be a great work done , in some form by the Church , in behalf of a world living in wickedness . the time will undoubtedly be long , according to our notions of time , before the earth will be fully redeemed unto Christ . It would seem to be possible to strike out some plan which shall not be attended with the embarrassments , the uncertainties , the weaknesses of those which are now in operation . It would seem possible to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly impedes and weakens their motion . iNature is simple in her laws , and all her movements are easy and harmonious . Man 's arts and contrivances are often exceedingly complex and difficult , because they stop short of natural laws , and attempt to work in the face of them . It is certainly deserving of our most serious attention , whether any improvement can be made in our present machinery for carrying on our great enterprises of benevolence . The subject is vast enough and important enough to enlist the thoughts of all the friends of the Redeemer . If this article shall serve to awaken the minds of Christian men to this topic , and lead to candid and earnest inquiry , it will have answered the end for which it was written .
