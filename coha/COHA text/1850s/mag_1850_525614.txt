SIR JOHN FRANKLIN AND THE ARCTIC EXPEDITIONS . A PE*I0D in every age of the world has been marked for its spirit of adventure either for the discovery and exploration of unknown countries , or for the colonization and settlement of countries previously known . Curiosity is , doubtless , the first principle which directs human footsteps to penetrate where they had not before trodden ; to scan the broad ocean in quest of new lands ; or to explore the depths of the African continent , and amid her burning Bands , and her pestilential climate , to trace the sources of her mysterious rivers . Again , it leads him into the icy regions of the Poles , to search for a north-west passage across the American continent , or to reach those imaginary points which are the centre of the earth 's axis . Without going back into the earlier periods of history , when the love of adventure was as great as in our time , it will suffice to speak of it , as it has been exhibited to us . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have both been prominent . For several years the desire was to penetrate into the interior of Africa , to discover the source of the river Niger . Mungo Park was the first adventurer in this field , as well as the first victim to its deadly climate . Successive expeditions were sent out by the British Government , which only terminated with the late attempt to ascend the Niger , with steam vessels from its mouth . To discover the sources of the Nile has recently been the object of several expeditions , and although traced almost to the c*itrc of the continent , its head waters have not yet been discovered . A va*st region remains unexplored within this continent , and several adventurers are , at the present moment , pressing forward to penetrate it . In another quarter of the globe there has been a great curiosity to know of what the centre of the vast island of New Holland consists , but every attempt to reach it has failed . The broad Pacific , with its innumerable islands , has been the field for maritime expeditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States has entered into competition with other nations , and has contributed her share to the geography , and the natural and physical science of this region . In the Antarctic exploration we have also done our part . Besides these several portions of the earth , where the love of adventure and the promotion of science has led the traveller , there are others in Africa , Asia , and America , into which he has also found his way , and where he has been amply rewarded for his labors . During the present century , in fact since the year 1818 , the most remarkable zeal and interest has been awakened in England for explorations in the Arctic regions of America . They originated , first , in a desire to solve the problem of the existence of a north-west passage , second , to reach the North Pole ; and , finally , when neither of these ends could be accomplished , it resolved itself simply into a desire to mark out the geographical features of these dreary and inaccessible solitudes , and to make certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north-west passage , it is known , would possess no advantage , in a commercial point of view ; nor would the feat of reaching the axis of the earth 's rotation , be likely to confer a benefit on mankind ; but every lover of science , every bold adventurer , in fact ; every one at all imbued with the rational curiosity of knowing the physical condition of this inaccessible portion of our globe , feels a desire to see these questions solved . The world would rejoice if the daring and noble Franklin might yet be the means of solving these problems . No one has done more to earn these laurels than he , and 572 June , // though the hope grows fainter , we ardently pray that he may yet live to attain the goal of his ambition . The revival of a desire for polar exploration , mainly with a view to discover a north-west passage , took place in the years 1817 and 1818 . This is said to have grown up in consequence of accounts brought home by the whaling ships from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fixed ice of those seas , by which they were suddenly rendered more navigable than thej had been for many years . " It was supposed that the great icy barrier , which had during so many ages obstructed these inaccessible regions , had , by some revolution of our globe , been broken up , and dispersed . " The ocean was reported to be full of gigantic icebergs which had broken loose from their moorings , and it was stated in a Scottish newspaper , that , " a stupendous mountain of ice had been stranded on one of the Shet .. land Islands . " THE REV . DR . SCORESBY 'S ARCTIC VOYAGES . AMONG the distinguished polar navigators of the present century whose voyages and explorations in those regions have made us acquainted with new lands , and who have made valuable contributions to physical science , the name of Captain ( now the Reverend Dr. ) Scoresby , should be first mentioned . This gentleman was engaged in the Greenland whale fishery for upwards of twenty years , and as early as 1806 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time . The point reached by him was in lat. 8i* 30 , or within 500 miles of the North Pole . In order to reach this high latitude , Captain Scoresby found it necessary to cross a broad berrier , or field of broken ice , which was accomplished with much labor , when he came to an open sea , extending northwards , as far as the eye could see . A fine opportunity was now presented for enlarging the knowledge of the seas near to the pole ; but he had been fitted out for other objects , and he could not forego these for the sake of the most brilliant speculations in science . In subsequent voyages Captain Scoresby approached the eastern shore of Greenland , and in the year 1822 , when in search of a new fishing ground , discover%d and traced nearly 400 miles of its coast . The Dutch had previously seen some points , but they were involved in much obscurity . The successful voyages of Captain Scoresby , and the valuable contributions made by him , had greatly increased the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the United Service Journal , " more than ordinary claims to public attention and confidence , as emanating from a man peculiarly qualified to entertain correct notions upon the subject . An accurate and scientific observer of the phenomena of these Boreal regions , trained from infancy in the navigation of the Arctic seas , it was scarcely possible to find a man possessing the varied accomplishments of Mr , Scoresby , and having the actual experience he possessed. ** These events led to the equipping of two expeditions . One was instructed to seek for a north-west passage , and , through it , to penetrate to Bebring 's Strait . The other , to attempt to reach the North Pole , and thence , to make the north west passage to the same point mentioned . We now propose to give a brief account of the several expeditions sent to theAretie seas for these two objects , as well as those of geographical discovery , and the advancement of science . Space compels us to confine ourselves simply to the objects and results of these several expeditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabella , of 385 tons under the Alexander , of 252 tons , commanded by command of Commander Ross , and the Lieutenant Parry , sailed from England , 1850. 573 // on the 18th of April , 1818 . Their instructions were , to proceed up Davis 's Strait , thence to the head of Baffin 's Bay , examine the three openings , known as Smith 's , Jones 's , and Lancaster Sounds , at the north-west side of that bay , and through them , make their way westward to Behring 's Strait . On the 17th June the ships reached Waygat Island , in Baffin 's Bay , where a barrier of ice prevented their farther progress . Mooring the ships to an iceberg , in company with forty-five whale ships , they awaited the breaking up of the ice . They then pressed forward , and in lat. 750 came to a part of the coast which had never before been visited by navigators , where they found a tribe of Esquimaux living in the deepest seclusion . On the 18th of August they passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice . Next day they came to Smith 's Sound , on the extreme north of the bay . This opening had been described by Ilaffin as the most spacious in the whole circle of the coast , and it was believed that an opening might be found here . Captain Ross regarded it with attention , and becoming convinced that he saw it encompassed by land at the distance of eighteen leagues , he passed on . Following the western coast he next came to Jones 's Sound , at the bottom of which he thought he discovered a ridge of very high mountains , stretching nearly across , united to a less lofty ridge from the opposite s*de . The 29th of August had now arrived , and the sun had set after an uninterrupted day of 1872 hours , or two months and a half . The se*on was passing away , and the nights became gloomy . They now approached the last and principal opening , or that known as Lancaster Sound . This great inlet , which proved to be forty-five miles in width , bordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ascended it for thirty miles . " During the run , the officers and men crowded the topmast , filled with enthusiastic ho pe , and , judging that it afforded a much fairer prospect of success than any of those they had so hastily passed. ** " As the evening closed , " says Captain Ross , " the wind died away-.the weather became mild and warm , the water much smoother , and the atmosphere clear and serene . The mountains on each side of the Strait had beautiful tints of various colors . For the first time we discovered that the land extended from the South two-thirds across this apparent Strait ; but the fog , which continually occupied that quarter , obscured its real figure . During this day , much interest was excited by the appearance of this Strait ; the general opinion , hou'ever , was , that it was only an inlet . Captain Sahine , who produced Baflin 's account , was of opinion that we were off Lancaster Sound and that there were no hopes of a passage , until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own words " there was no indication of a passage , no appearance of a current , no drift wood , and no swell from the north-west . Thus was this important inlet again overlooked . The expedition continued its course along the coast southward , passing two other openings in the land or inlets closed with ice , after which it returned to England . " On the return of Sir John Ross , " says the United Service Journal , " his conclusion regarding Lancaster Sound , became the subject of much skeptical discussion ; and it was urged by those experienced in naval perspective , that Sir John Ross had not sufficiently guarded against a common optical illusion , and that he had not penetrated deep enough into the Sound to form a*y accurate judgment upon the subject ; for it was urged , that a strait even of considerable breadth , if winding or varied by capes , always presents to the spectator the precise appearance of an enclosed bay . Discussion soon gathered an element of an*ry sentiment , which made it assume a form t%at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject , accusations and recriminations appeared ; and the zeal which was exhibited upon the occasion led to the adoption of a line of conduct in some of the opponents of Sir John 's views , which were not very creditable to them , and we think scarcely excusable or justifiable by any amount of zeal in the cause of science or po* pular enthusiasm . " Lieutenant Parry , second in command , differed in opinion from Captain Ross as to the continuity of land across Lancaster Sound* and the result was , a new expedition was determined on which was to be placed under the command of Lieutenant ( now Sir Edward ) Parry . 574 // CAPTAIN BUCHAN 'S VOYAGE TOWARD THE NORTH POLE . 1818 . The ships forming the expedition to reach the North Pole , were the Dorothy , Captain I3uchan , and the Trent , Lieutenant Franklin . The former contained 12 officers and 42 seamen ; the latter 1 0 officers and 28 seamen and marines . On board the Trent was George Back , then Admiralty 's mate , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise distinguished himself in the Arctic expeditions . The expedition left England on the 18th of April and on the 24th of May , had reached Cherie Island , in latitude 74o 33 ' . Their instructions were to proceed to the Spitzbergen seas ; pass northward between that island and Greenland , and make every effort to reach the North Pole . A few days after the ships separated , Lieutenant Franklin proceeded to Magdalena Bay in Spitzbergen , the place of rendezvous , where both soon after met . On the 7th of June they again sailed , and in a few days got beset in a floe of ice where they remained for thirteen days . Escaping from this imprisonment , they again sought a shelter in Fair Haven , and continued there until the 6th of July . Putting to sea once more with a favorable wind , they pressed forward but were soon brought up by the pack ice in latitu* 809 34 ' IN . Soon after a violent gale came on , and to avoid inevitable shipwreck , both ships pressed forward into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subsiding of great masses of ice , grinding.huge pieces to atoms , and threatening every moment to crush and swallow up the ships . " No language , " says Captain Buchan , " can convey an adequate idea of the terrific grandeur now produced by the collision of the ice and the tempestuous * Such was the noise occasioned by the crashing of the ice , and the roar of the wind , that it was with great difficulty the orders could be heard . Yet the crew preserved the greatest calmness . " If ever the fortitude of seamen was fairly tried , " says Captain Buchan , " it wa*ssuredly not less so , than on this occasion ; and I will not conceal the pride I felt in witnessing the bold and decisive tone in which the orders were issued by the commander of our little vessel ( Franklin ) and the promptitude and steadiness with which they were executed by the crew . Each person instinctively secured his own hold , and , with his eyes fixed upon the masts , awaited in breathless anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brig cutting her way through the light ice , came in violent contact with the main body . ln an instant we all lost our footing , the masts bent with the impetus , and the cracking timbers from be low bespoke a pressure which was calculated to awaken our serious apprehensions . " Both vessels were so much injured by this concussion , that when the gale abated and the pack broke up , they made the best of their way to Fair Haven ; the Dorothea in a foundering condition . Lieutenant Franklin was desirous to proceed with the Trent ; but this was contrary to their instructions . Besides it would have been unsafe to risk the whole party again to the danger of these seas without any means of escape , in case an accident should befal them , in a a vessel , too , so much shattered . All further efforts to prosecute the voyage were useless , and after the necessary repairs , both ships set sail for home on the 30th of August , and on the 22d of October reached England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed under the command of Captain ( now Sir Edward ) Parry . The ships selected were the Heela , of 375 tons , and the Griper , of 180 tons . The latter was commanded by Lieutenant Hoppner . On board Captain Parry 's ship the Hecla were Captain ( now Colonel ) Sabine , Lieutenant ( now Sir F. W. ) Beechey , and Midshipman ( now Sir James ) Clarke Ross . All these gentlemen have since distinguished themselves in other Arctic expeditions , as well as in scientific researches of an important character . The whole complement of officers and men in the two ships was ninety-four . They were provisioned for two years . On the 11th of May , 1819 , they took their departure , and on the 3d of July crossed the Arctic Circle in Davis 's Strait , passing on that day fifty icebergs of large dimensions . One of these huge masses was 140 feet high , and aground in 120 fathoms , making altogether a height exceeding 600 feet . On reaching the 73d degree of latitude , opposite Lancaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the great barrier of ice which fills the middle of Baffin 's Bay , instead of pursuing the usual route of the whalers , which was to follow the eastern coast to the very head of that bay , and then cross above the barrier referred to , where the sea is usually open . Seven days were spent in sailing and warping , before the ships again reaches the open water , the barrier being not less than eighty miles in width . The ship now stood for Lancaster Sound , and on the 30th of July reached its entrance , just one month earlier than Captain Ross reached it the previous year , when he took the usual course around the shores of Baffin 's Bay . This was a most important gain for the expedition , as nearly the whole navigable season was before them . In approaching the magnificent channel , which lay before them , bounded by lofty cliffs , they felt an extraordinary emotion , aware that the great question , on which rested the failure or success of the expedition , would soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takemi , and one thousand and fifty fathoms by the line , were found . But owing to the drift , Captain Parry did not think the depth of water more than 800 or 900 fathoms . The sea was open before them , neither ice nor land being visible to the west . " It is more easy , " says Captain Parry , " to imagine , than to describe the almost breathless anxiety which was now visible in every countenance , while , as the breeze increased to a fresh gale , we ran quickly up the Sound . The mast beads were crowded by the officers and men during the whole afternoon ; and an unconcerned observer , if any could have been unconcerned on such an occasion , would have been amused by the eagerness with which the various reports from the crow 's nest were received , all , however , hitherto favorable to our most sanguine hopes . " A strong easterly wind having sprung up on the 3d , they were rapidly carried to the west . They passed several headlands and openings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed , and to which the name of Barrow 's Strait was afterwards given . The first day they sailed 150 miles ; the strait was still from forty to fifty miles in breadth , and no land was visible westward . They now came to an opening ten leagues across the mouth , with no land visible to the south . As their progress westward was obstructed by the ice , Parry determined to seek a passage through this new opening , afterwards called Prince Regent 's Inlet , thinking that it might lead , and be nearer to the coast of America , than to follow Barrow 's Strait west . They sailed down this inlet 120 miles , when they were stopped by the ice ; after which they returned to Barrow 's Strait , which they reached on the 19th of August . On the 21st , the ice had moved off , and left an unobstructed passage westward . The ships now pressed on , passing islands , headlands , and a very broad opening , eight leagues across , up which neither land nor ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Wellington Channel . Proceeding westward , large and small islands were passed on the north , while at the south land was occasionally seen . Their compass on account of their proximity to the magnetic pole became useless , and it was with difficulty , except in clear weather , that they knew what course they steered . The needle would now have pointed to the south . The officers landed on some of the islands as they passed , and found traces of the Esquimaux reindeer , 576 June , // and musk oxen . The ravines were covered with luxuriant moss , and other vegetation . On the 4th of September the ships reached the 110th degree of W. longitude , which entitled them to the reward of ? 5,000 , offered by Parliament to the first ship 's crew that attained this longitude within the Arctic circle . They now reached the largest island they had seen ; to which the name of Melville was given , and worked their way along its shores . The navigable channel had been daily growing narrower on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south , as far as could he seen . Their progress was now slow , and on the 20th of September they found themselves completely beset by floes of ice . From the mast-head one unbroken field of ice presented itself , which had been there during the summer . It was now evident that no further advance could be made that season . The ships accordingly returned a short distance , and entered an excellent harbor , which they had passed . Here they sawed a channel through the ice for upwards of two miles , and took up their winter quarters . The ships were now dismantled , and housed over . The most improved heating apparatus was put up ; every attention was paid to the food , clothing , exercise , and mental occupation of the crew . A school was opened . A newspaper called the Nortt* Georgia Gazette was published . Theatrical performances were got up by the officers , and every means adopted that would conduce to the health and comfort of the crew . In this manner the winter passed away . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not again visible above the horizon until the 3d February . The animals took their departure early in the winter , and did not return until May . To this desolate spot the expedition was frozen up for ten months . Early in May , however , parties were sent out on foot to explore in various directions , as well as to seek for game . Musk oxen , deer , hares , and ptarmigan , ( a bird resembling a partridge , ) ducks , and geese , became plenty . The hunters were tolerably successful , and the addition of fresh provisions was very acceptable . The greatest cold experienced was on the 16th of Febru*xy , when the thermometer indicated 55 ? below zero . In March the snow began to melt in the sun , yet , as late as the last of May , the sea still presented one unbroken field of ice , from six to seven feet in thickness . Toward the end of June the ice l* egan to move in the offing . On the 5th o* July the thermometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at 60u On the 1st of August the ships left their winter harbor , and stood westward , but after three or four days spent in working the ships through the floating ice , their farther progress was arrested by the compact ice , more firm than any they had seen . It did not appear to have been broken up for years , and on ascending the lofty hills which bordered the coast , from which a distant view was presented , no boundary was seen to the icy barrier . A brisk gale from the eastward produced no effect upon it , which induced Captain Parry to believe that a large body of land existed westward , which held it in thi5 fixed state . To the south a bold coast was seen which was named Banks ' Sound . The ships remained here till the 15th August , when seeing no prospect of advancing farther , it was determined to escape while the weather was favorable . They accordingly put them about on the 26th . Barrow 's Strait being clear of ice , they reached Lancaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After some brief delays the ships proceeded to England , landing their officers at Peterhead on the 30th of October . In this long voyage of 18 months , but one man died out of 94 persons ; the remainder were brought home in excellent health . Captain Parry was warmly received on his arrival , for the results of the expedition bad surpassed the expectations of the most sanguine . " To have sailed upwards of thirty degrees of longitude beyond the point reached by any former navigator ,  --  to have discovered so many new lands , islands , and bays ,  --  to have established the much-contested existence of a Polar Sea , north of America ,  --  and to bring back his crew in a sound and vigorous state , were enough to raise his name above that of any other arctic navigator. ** Another expedition was immediately decided on , and the command tendered to this efficient officer . 1850. 577 // PARRY 'S SECOND The sole object of this expedition , was the discovery of a north-west passage . The ships selected for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 375 tons . Captain Parry commanded the former and Captain Lyon the latter vessel . They left England on the 8th May 1821 , accompanied hy a transport , with stores and provisions , which were to he transhipped on reaching the ice , where their field of explorations began . Captain Parry , it will be remembered , in his first expedition , discovered a broad channel opening from the southerly side of Barrow 's Strait , since known as Prince Regent 's Inlet . This he believed communicated with the American Coast , and that the lands which lay on either side of it , were islands . It was also an opinion , pretty generally believed , that Repulse Bay had not been thoroughly explored by Captain Middleton in his attempt to find a north-west passage in 1741-that he might have been deceived by the appearance of the ice and by fogs , and that an opening might still be found through ' this bay . Another point of discussion was a passage known as Frozen Strait . The examination of these passages or inlets were therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious consideration , ** says Captain Parry , " 1 came to the resolution of attempting the direct passage of the Frozen Strait , though , I confess , not without some apprehension of the risk I was incurring , and of the serious loss of time , which , in case of failure , either from the non-cxistence of the strait , or from the insuperable obstacles which its name implies , would thus be inevitably occasioned by the expedition . " Parry was successful in getting through this Strait as well as in tracing the coast beyond , and of proving the general correctness of the statements of Middleton . Much time was lost in settling these points , after which the expedition continued its examination of several inlets and bays to the northward , through Fox Channel to a broad opening known as the Strait of the Hecla and Fury . In some of these inlets there was an appearance of summer , such as is not common in such VOYAGE , 1821-22-23 ; high latitudes . " The vallies were richly clad with grass and moss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most gaudy tints , so that the sailors might have fancied themselves in some happier climate , had not the mighty piles of ice in the Frozen Strait told a different tale . " Hunting parties were sent out which procured a variety of game . To follow the narrative of this expedition , which abounds in events of the most interesting character , for a polar subject , would be quite beyond the limits of this brief sketch . Though much more was accomplished in point of distance , in the first expedition of Parry , than in this , the number and the variety of incident was greater in the latter . Esquimaux were seen at many places , with whom the most friendly intercourse was held , and the long tedium of two Arctic winters was much relieved by the contiguity of villages of these people . In fact , none of the Arctic navigators have had so favorable an opportunity to study the habits of the Esquimaux as Captain Parry did in this expedition , and the pages of his narrative are much enlivened by the interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this paper of the natives , it may not be amiss to quote a short account of a party which established themselves near the ships and at whose request Captain Parry accompanied them to their huts : " When it is remembered that these habitations were fully within sight of the ships , and how many eyes were constantly on the look out among us for anything that could afford variety or interest to our present situation , our surprise may be imagined at finding an establishment of five huts , with canoes , sledges , dogs , and above sixty men , women , and children , as regularly , and to all appearance as permanently fixed , as if they had occupied the same spot for a whole winter . In the construction of these houses the only material used was snow and ice . After creeping through two low passages , each having its arched doorway , we came to a small circular apartment , of which the roof was a perfectly arched dome . From this three doorways , also arched , led into as many inhabited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these presented a scene no less novel than interesting . The women were seated on the beds at the 578 June , // side of the huts , each having her little fire place , or lamp , with all her domestic utensils about her ; the children crept behind their mothers , and the dogs , except the female ones , which were indulged with a part of the beds , slunk out past us in dismay . The construction of this inhabited part of the hut was siinilar to that of the outer apartment , being a dome formed by separate blocks of snow , laid . with great regularity aud no small art , each being cut into the shape requisite to form a substantial arch , from seven to eight feet high in the centre , and having no supjort whatever , but what this principle of building supplied . They were lighted by a circular window of ice , neatly fif*ed into the roof of each apartment . " Exploring parties were sent out both years which traced thc coast to a considerable distance in various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact established that there was no passage leading* to the west south of Hecla and Fury Strait . In August 1823 , the ships left their winter quarters . On the 17th of September 1823 they entered Hudson 's Strait , and reached England on the 18th of November . CAPTAIN LYON 'S EXPEDITION TO REPULSE BAY , 1824 . In order to connect the Polar discoveries of Franklin eastward from Coppermine River and the late discoveries of Parry by which the whole line of coast might be made out , the Government determined to send the Griper , under the command of Captain Lyon , to Repulse Bay . The expedition left England own the 11th June 1824 . The orders were to proceed to Wager River or Repulse Bay ; to cross Melville Peninsula on foot ; thea to follow the western shore of that peninsula , and the northern shore of North America to the extreme point reached by Franklin in 1820 , called Point Turnagain . The *riper , although she had been employed by Captain Clavering in the Greenland seas proved herself unfit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy her sailing qualities and render her unmanageable . She reached Repulse Bay near which she encountered successive gales of wind , and narrowly escaped foundering . She was beset with the ice , enveloped in fogs and in a severe gale lost all her anchors . Drifting at the mercy of the winds and waves she was happily carried by the etirrent out of danger . The season having passed without effecting anything , and not thinking it prudent to continue in those boisterous regions without anchors , Captain Lyon determined very prudently to abandon the voyage , and make the best of his way to England , where he arrived in safety on the 10th of November . CLAVERINGS AND SABINE 'S VOYAGE TOWARDS THE NORTH POLE , 1823 . THIS voyage , although it was sent out for the purpose of reaching the Pole , is deserving of insertion here . This expedition consisted of the gun-brig Griper , commanded by Captain Clavering . Oaptain Sabine , since well known for his contributions to science , accompanied the expedition to make scientific experiments . The plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the North Cape in Norway , iu the 70th degree north latitude , thence to a second station , in or near the 80th*parallel. on the northern coast of Spitzbergen ; afterward to make the east coast of Greenland , in as high a latitude as the barrier of ice would permit , and having got within the barrier , to ascend the coast to the northward as far as might be compatible the same year , in order to obtain a third pendulum station for Captain Sabine 's experiments at the highest degree of latitude that might be there obtained . " A fourth station , if desired , was to be selected in Iceland , or any other place in the same parallel , if desired . Aftar visiting Hammerfest , the expedi-. 1850. 579 // tion sailed on the 23d June , was in sight of Spitzbergen in four days , and on the 30th , rounded Hakinyt 's Headland and dropped anchor . The tents and instruments were disembarked and set upon shore . Captain Sabine , two officers , and six men , then landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided with a launch , six months ' provisions and fuel , to carry them to Hammerfest in case of necessity . The Griper then left , Captain Clavering having determined to push as far northward as possible . On the second day out he reached the pack ice , but twenty-five miles from the island , extending east and west as far as the eye could reach . The latitude observed was 800 20 ' . After tracing the margin of the ice for sixty miles west and finding it trending to the South , and everywhere closely packed , he deemed it useless to proceed farther , and returned to the *tation , which he reached on the 11th of July . Captain Sabine having completed his operations , and procured an abundant supply of rein deer for provisions , the ship sailed to the eastern coast of Greenland , in about the latitude of 74Q the highest known point on the coast , where they landed . " Never was there a more desolate spot seen , " says Clavering , " Spitzbergen was , on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northward till stopped by the ice in lat. , 75Q 12 ' , which he supposed the N. E. point of Greenland . A party of 12 Esquimaux were found here , with whom they held intercourse . The expedition remained on the coast till the 13th of September , during which time Captain Sabine , was enabled to complete his operations . They then sailed for England . PARRY 'S THIRD VOYAGE , 1824 , 1825 . Captain Parry was placed in command of a third expedition for the discovery of a North-west passage , which sailed from England on the 19th of May , 1824 . This expedition consisted of two ships , the Heela and Fury , the same which were employed in the last expedition , the latter vesset being placed under the command of Captain Hoppner . Their instructions were to make the best of their way to Lancaster Sound , thence through Barrow 's Strait to Prince Regent 's Inlet , by which channel it was believed he would be able to proceed westward to Behring 's Strait . The ships entered the middle ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this time , " says Parry , " the obstructions from the quantity , magnitude , and closeness of the ice , were such as to keep our people constantly employed in heaving , warping , or sawing through it , nd yet with so little success , that at the close of July we had only penetrated seventy miles to the westward . " They narrowly escaped being crushed , and it was not until the 9th of September that they succeeded in releasing themselves from this icy barrier . On the 10th of September they entered Lancaster Sound , which they found free from ice . They had not proceeded far , however , before their progress was obstructed by the new ice which had already begun to make across the Strait . Opposing winds and a strong current setting east ward , tended still more to check their progress , and in one night they drifted between eight and nine leagues westward . On the 26th of September an easterly wind sprang up which wafted the ships rapidly towards Prince Regent 's Inlet , which they reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the 1st of October . The dreary winter passed off as usual , and without accident . The mercury in the thermometer did not rise above zero till the 10th of April , having remained below that point for one hundred and thirty one successive days . As in former expeditions , parties were sent to explore the coasts in different directions before the breaking up of the ice , which took place on the 12th of July , and on the 19th the ships got clear , and stood across to the western shore of the inlet . They followed this shore southward for several days in the passage between the ice and the shore , until a change of wind brought the ice upon them , forcing them 580 J tine , // into shallow water , and causing them to ground . They made several narrow escapes here , but the Fury was so much injured that it was necessary to take out her stores and heave her down . After making the necessary repairs , her stores were again embarked , only to be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again grounded , without any hope of getting her off . The summer was now rapidly passing away , and prompt measures were necessary in this dilemma . It was therefore determined to land the stores of the Fury , take her officers and crew on board the Hecla , and proceed at once to England . It was now the 27th of August . A favorable wind enabled them to reach the western shore of Prince Regent 's Inlet , whence , after a few days ' preparation in getting the ship ready for her voyage , she sailed on the last of August , and entered Barrow 's Strait on the 1st September . They found Baffin 's Bay still clear of ice , and meeting with no obstructions , reached England on the 12th of October . This last attempt was the least successful of either of Parry 's Voyages . No information regarding a western passage had been obtained , and the additions to our arctic geography consisted in extending the line of coast but a short distance beyond what was previously known . The contributions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regent 's Inlet were found to be the " most barren , the most dreary and desolate , that have been seen , not excepting Melville Island ; not merely desolate of human beings , but almost deprived of animal and vegetable life . " Astronomical and magnetical observations were made as in former voyages , the results of which are appended to the narrative of this voyage . PARRY 'S POLAR VOYAGE , 1827 . THE fourth voyage of this distinguished navio*ator ( or rather the fifth , as his first voyage was with Captain John Ross ) , was totally different from the preceding . This was to reach the North Pole in the most direct manner ; first by a ship as far as the ice wou1* permit , and then by travelling with slcd* , e-hoats over the ice , availing themselves of any spaces of water that might occur . T*vo boats were constructed for the expedition , " twenty feet long and seven broad , fiat-floored , and as stout as wood and iron could make them ; and so fitted as to contain nautical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing and other * A bamboo mast , a tarred duck sail , answering also the purpose of an awning , paddles , boat hooks , &amp;c. , cornpleted each boat 's complement . Two *ffi-. cers and twelve men , were selected for the crew of each . " Each boat , with all her furniture , tools , instruments , clothing , and provisions of every kind , weighed 3753 pounds , exclusive of four sledges. ** With this expedition Captain Parry sailed in the Hecla , on the 4th of April , 1827 , reached Hammerfest , in Norway , on the 19th , where they took on board eight rein-deer , and a supply of moss to feed them upon , and on the 14th of May rounded Hakluyt 's Headland in Spitzbergen . On the 8th of June the boats took their departure with 71 days ' provisions , with a clear sea . The second day they reached the pack ice in latitude 81* 12 ' 51 " . As the daylight is constant in these high latitudes , the sun continually above the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the twenty-fours which corresponded with night for travelling , and rested during the day . The sun was higher during the day hours , and oppressive to the eyes , while the heat rendered it more comfortable for sleeping . " This travelling by night , " says Parry , " and sleeping by day , so completely inverted the natural order of things , that it was difficult to persuade ourselves of the reality ; nor could we , even with pocket chronometers , always bear in mind at what part of the 24 hours we had arrived . " A brief sketch of their mode of living may be interesting " Being rigged for travelling , " says Captain Parry , " we breakfasted on warm cocoa and 1850. 581 // biscuit , then stowed the things in the boats , and set off on our day*s journey . After travelling five or six hours , we stopped an hour to dine , and again travelled four , five , or six hours . After this we butted for the night , though it was early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauling our boats on . The boats were placed chose alongside each other , and the sails , supported by the paddles , placed over them as awnings . Dry shoes and slockings were then put on and supper eaten . After this pipes were smoked and the men told their stories . This part of the twenty-four hours was often a time , and the only one , of real enjoyment to us . A reg ular watch was set during the resting time to look out for bears , and for the ice breaking up around us , as well as to attend to the drying of the clothes . We then concluded our day with prayers , arid having put on our fur dresses , lay down to sleep with a degree of comfort , which perhaps few persons would imagine possible under such circumstances . The temperature while we slept , was usually from 36* to 45O* according to the state of the external atmosphere ; but on one or two occasions it rose as high as 6O* to 66g . After we had slept 7 honrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cocoa , when it was ready . Our fuel consisted entirely of spirits of wine , of which two pints formed our daily allowance , the cocoa being cooked in an iron boiler , Gver a shallop lamp , with seven wicks . One pint of the spirits of wine would heat 28 pints of water , though it commenced from the*temperaPare of 32g . Th* ice was found to be entirely different from what it was expected to be . Instead of a smooth level plain , instead of compact floes , it consisted entirely of small , loose , and rugged masses , obliging them " to snake three journeys and sometimes four , with the boats and baggage , and to launch several times across narrow pools of * One day they only advanced half a mile in four hours ; and another the ice was so much in motion as to make it dangerous to cross with loaded boats , the masses being so small . At other times the roughness of the ice compelled them to unl*ad the boats and carry their stores in severa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to discover , on taking an observation on the 30th , that they had reached no higher than 81* 23 ' , and had consequently advanced but eight miles nearer the pole in five day 's laborious travelling . They continued slowly to advance , working from 10 to 12 hours each day ; and in the windings of their journeys of 10 or 15 miles , did not advance more than two-thirds that distance . On taking observations as before , they found their actual advance northward was little more than half their apparent advance . This was owing to a strong current setting to the South , carrying with it the whole body of ice . On the 23d of July they reached their highest latitude or 82* 45 ' . They strove in vain to reach S3* . On this day the therulometer ranged from 31* to 36o in the shade . At the extreme point of our journey , ** says Parry , " our distance from the 1-lecla was only 172 miles . To accomplish this we had travelled by our reckoning , 292 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously to our entering the ice . As we travelled the greater l ) art of our distance on the ice three , and not unfrequently 1ive* times over , we may safely multiply the length of the road by two and a half ; so that our whole distance , on a very moderate calculation , amounted to 580 geographical , or 678 statute miles , being nearly sufficient to have reached the pole in a direct line . " On the 27th of July , they turned their faces homewards and reached the Hecla on the 21st of August , after an absence of 61 days . During their absence , the officers who remained with the ship were occupied with scientific explorations and observations . On the return of the expedition to England , Captain Parry submitted another plan to reach the North : Pole , but the Admiralty did not deem it advisable to make another attempt . FRANKLIN 'S FIRST EXPEDITION TO THE POLAR SEA . 1819-20-21-22 . The first expedition for exploring the placed under the command of Lieutenant shores of the Arctic Sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen by Hearne and Mackenzie , was naturalist . They left England on the 23d 582 June , // May 1820 ; took the usual route of the great lakes ; thence by the way of Lakes Winnepeg , Athapasca , and Slave Lake , to the Coppermine River , which they followed to its entrance into the Arctic Sea , where they arrived on the 21st July . The object of the expedition was to trace the shores of the Arctic Sea , * eas*-ward ; and , if possible , to reach Repulse Bay . Embarking in canoes , they commenced their voyage under favorable auspices . The sea was clear of ice , save a small iceberg at a distance . The coast was found of moderate height , easy of access , and covered with vegetation ; but the islands were rocky and barren . For the first thirty-seven miles they experieaced little interruption . In passing a prominent headland , they first encountered the dangers common to the Polar Seas . Beset by ice , they encountered a violent storm , which compelled them to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different aspect . Hills and mountains of granite , destitute of vegetation rose abruptly from the water 's edge to the height of 1400 or 1500 feet ; no animals were seen except small deer and seals , and their hunters succeeded in shooting a bear , but so miserably poor was the latter as to be unfit for food . No Esquimaux were seen . The party continued their explorations along the coast , which was indented by numerous inlets , and studded with small islands , until they reached a Cape , denominated Point Turnagain . They now found that they had lost so much time in following the indentations of the coast , that it would be impossible to reach Repulse Bay that season . Beside this , their fuel was expended , and their provisions only enough for three days . " The appearances of the setting in of the Arctic winter were too equivocal to be mistaken the deer , on which they depended for fresh meat would soon disappear ; aquatic birds were winging their way southward ; and the men , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look disheartened , and to entertaij* serious apprehensions for their safety . " The officers united with Franklin in his opinion that it was not prudent to advance farther . The expedition , therefore , after spending a few days in the examination of some of the bays , returned to the mouth of Hood 's River , from whicI* they intended to make their way to Fort Enterprise , their destined winter quarters , about 150 miles southward . Up to this point , where their canoe voyage on the Arctic Sea terminated , they had performed a distance of 650 geographical miles . They now proceeded up the river in their canoes , and though on a short allowance of provisions , they managed , by means of their nets and fowling pieces , to satisfy their wants for a few days . Coming to a high fall , their progress was checked ; their large canoes could not be carried over them , and they were obliged to construct two smaller and more portable ones . With these , they set off on the 1st September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach their spring encampment in a few days . The second day exhausted the last of their solid food , and on encaniping for the night they could find nothing to make a fire with . The third day a violent snow storm came on ; the party could not move forward , and for want of fire , the men remained in their beds . The snow had drifted to the height of three feet around their tents , and even within them , it lay several inches thick on their blankets . But they could not delay longer , hunger stared them in the face , and they were compelled to pack their frozen tents and push forward . " Disaster now crowded on disaster . The wind rose so high , that those who carried the canoes were frequently blown down , and one of the canoes so much injured as to be unserviceable . " The ground was coveredwithsnow , andtheswamps , though frozen ground , were not sufficiently strong to bear the men , who often fell through knee deep in water . A fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of portable soup and arrow root was cooked . They now resorted for food to a kind of lichen , known to the Canadians as tripe de roche , with which the rocks were covered . In cases of extremity this is boiled and eaten ; but it taste is nauseous , its quality purgative , and it sometimes produces severe pain . On this the party subsisted for several days , and until a musk ox was shot which afforded them great relief . " This success , ** says Franklin , " infused spirit into our starving party . The contents of its stomach , were devoured on the spot ; and 1850. 58* // the raw intestines were pronounced by the most delicate of the party to be excellent . A few willow twigs were grubbed up from beneath the snow , fires made , the tents pitched , supper cooked and devoured with avidity . " The expedition rested a couple of days to recruit their strength , when they proceeded ; supporting themselves by the lichen alluded to , and an occasional deer and partridge killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party were , nevertheless , thankful , and felt that a merciful Providence had watched over them and provided them with a means of subsistence ; but it was the will of God that their confidence should be put to a more severe test ; for they now entered a level country covered with snow , where the tripe de roche was not to be found . Another distress now attacked them the intensity of the cold increased , while they became less able to endure it . Their blankets were insufficient to keep them warm , and the piercing winds reached their emaciated bodies . " The reader , " says Franklin , " will probably be desirous to know how we passed our time in such a comfortless situation . The first operation after encamping was to thaw our frozen shoes , if a sufficient flr* could be made ; dry ones were then put on . Each person then wrote his notes of the daily occurrences , and evening prayers were read . As s*n as supper was prepared it was eaten , generally in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful conversation until our blankets were thawed by the heat of our bodies , and we had gathered sufficient warmth to enable us to fall asleep . On many nights we had not even the luxury of going to bed in dry clothes ; for , when the fire was sufficient to dry our shoes , we dared not venture to pull them off , lest they should freeze so hard as to be unfit to put on in the morning , and therefore inconvenient to carry . " The next disaster that befel th*jn was the loss of their remaining canoe . This was of the utmost importance to them , as they had no other way to pass the rivers which lay across their path . A few deer were happily killed soon after by the hunters in the party , who were kept constantly on the look out for game . The flesh , skins , and even the stomachs of these aniinaL5 were equally divided among the party , whose spirits were greatly invigorated by such a supply of food after eight days ' famine . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached Coppermine River , the breadth and current of which rendered it impassable without a boat . Efforts were made to construct one with willows and the canvas of their hut without success . Retracing their steps , they next attempted to ford a river presenting less obstacles by means of a raft . In this too their efforts were foiled , for they had nothing to propel the raft and their tent poles would not reach the bottom . " The failure of every attempt occasioned a deep despondency , which threatened to have the most fatal effects , when Dr. Richardson , with a disinterested courage that made him forgets his own weakness , threw ofi his upper garments , and attempted to swim with a rope to the opposite hank . Pluaging in with the line around his middle he at first made some way , but the extreme cold was too much for him , and in a few moments his arms became powerless ; still , being an expert swimmer , he not only kept himself afloat , but made some way on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the other side , when , to the inexpressible anguish of those who watched his progress , his limbs became benumbed , and he sank . All hands now hauled in the line , and drew him ashore almost lifeless ; but , placed before a fire of willows and stripped of his wet clothes , he gradually revived enough to give directions as to the mode of treating him . His thin and emaciated limbs , which were now exposed to view , produced an involuntary exclamation of compassion and surprise . " Ah , que nous sommes maigres ! said the French Canadians ; but it is probable that few of them would have presented so gaunt and attenuated an appearance as the brave and excellent man who had thus nearly fallen a sacrifice to his humanity , for it was discovered about this time that the hunters were in the practice of withholding the game which they shot and devouring it in secret . " While these efforts were making , the party lived upon tripe de rocke of which a small quantity was procured . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks where it had fallen , though so acrid as to excoriate the lips was eagerly devoured , and the antlers and bones ofdeer , which had been picked by the wolves and birds of prey , were made friable by burning , and converted into food . One of the Canadians now endeavored to make a canoe by stretching the painted 584 3 one , // canvas used for wrapping up the bedding , over a frame work of willows . Pitch was gathered from the small pines to pay the seams and a frail bark was thus constructed , which to the joy of all was found to float . One by one the whole party was carried across the river , though from the leaky condition of the little bark , their garments and bedding were completcly drenched . The joy of the Canadians knew no bounds at this unlooked for deliverance , and their spirits rose from the deepest despondency into tumultuous exultation . Mr. Back was now dispatched with three men to Fort Enterprize in search of the Indians . After drying their bed-clothes and tents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six miles only were accomplished this day against a piercing wind and drifts of snow , and a few shreds of tripe de roclie mixed with the remains of their old leather shoes , boiled or roasted , formed their evening meal . The following day two of their best hunters gave out and fell behind , and the stoutest men were unable to bring them to their evening 's fire and encampment . Matters had now reached a dreadful crisis , and the only alternative seemed to be that Mr. Hood and Dr. Richardson , with a single attendant , should remain with the two Canadians where there was a supply of wood and ten days ' stock of tripe de roclie , and that Captain Fxanklin with the remainder of the party should hasten to Fort E*terprize for relief . The next day Franklin proceeded on his journey , leaving every thing but a single tent , their ammunition , journals , and a blanket for himself . After a march of but five miles they encamped , supping on an infusion of the Labrador tea plant and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men , among them the strongest of the party , gave out and endeavored to retrace their steps to the spot where Richardson and the others were left . The whole party able to proceed now consisted of Captain Franklin and five men who pushed forward and succeeded in reaching Fort Enterprize . It was here they had passed the previous winter , and arrangements had been made to have a stock of provisions and other necessary comforts provided for there on their arrival at this time . They expected therefore to find the Indian hunters here , an abun dance of game , a s*6ck of fuel and a comfortable house . " On approaching the house their minds were strongly agitated betwixt hope and fear , and oontrary to their usual custom , they advanced in silence . At length they reached it , and their worst apprehensions were realized . It was completely destitute . No provisions had been deposited ,  --  no trace of Indians could be discovered-no letter told them where they could be found . On entering a mute despair seized the party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broken sashes , through which the wind and snow penetrated , and , awakening to a full sense of their situation burst into tears . " A note , however , was found from Mr. Back , stating , that he had reached here two days before-that his party had endured great suffering , and one of them had been frozen to death . That they had gone on to Fort Providence , which it was doubtful they should ever be able to reach . The sufferers thus disappointed , looked about for some means of subsistence , and found several deer skins thrown away during their former residence at this place , as well as a quantity of bones . Of these they made soup . They next made their house as comfortable as possible with loose boards , fo* the temperature of the outer air was from l5* to 20n below zero . Captain Franklin was desirous to pro. * ceed to Fort Providence with his five men , but two had become so feeble that they were unable to move . He therefore left them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes of meeting some Indians and sending relief to his suffering party . The second day out he fell between two rocks and broke his snow shoes , which compelled him to abandon his journey and retrace his steps to Fort Enterprize . The two men were directed to press forward to Fort Providence for a supply of meat as the only means of saving the lives of the party left behind . On his return to Fort Enterprize , Franklin found two of the men left there so weak that they could not leave their bed , so that the whole labor of procuring tripe de rocke and cooking it , as well as the collecting and carrying fuel , fell upon him and the remaining Canadian . The frost was now so severe too , that the lichen could only be detached from the rocks to which it ad-. 1850. 585 // hered , with great difficulty , and the bone soup was so acrid as to corrode the inside of their mouths . Soon after , Dr. Richardson , who had been left behind with five men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having perished . The narrative of their sufferings and the cause of the death of these must be passed over . The arrival of Dr. R. was attended with a favorable change , as he and his companion were in a better condition than Franklin and his men . A partridge was shot and divided among the six , which was the first morsel of flesh they had tasted for 31 days . Their several tasks were now allotted to each . Hepburn and Richardson went out in search of deer and other game while Franklin , unable to walk far remained nearer the house , employing himself in digging under the snow for the skins and bones of the animals they had killed and eaten during their previous winter residence here . Two other men procured wood for the fire , while the sixth was confined by swollen limbs to his bed , unable to move . But the winter was coming rapidly on them , the cold increased-food was more difficult to obtain-their stock of putrid bones and skins were nearly exhausted , and the tripe de roche very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dishevelled limbs , their sunken eyes and sepulchral voices , betokened the fate that awaited them . Their mental faculties partook of their bodi*r weakness , and " an unreasonable pettishness with each other began to manifest itself . " Two of their men died from exhaustion and there was not strength left in the rest to remove their bodies . " All they could do was to remove them into an opposite part of the house ; and the living and dead remained in awful contiguity under the same roof . " In the midst of these dreadful sufferings , with death staring them in the face , these brave men were supported by an unwavering reliance on the *nercy of God . " We read prayers , " says Captain Franklin , " and a portion of the iNew Testament in the morning and evening , as had been our practice since Dr. Richardson 's arrival , and I may remark , that the performance of these duties always afforded us the greatest consolation , serving to re-animate our hope in the mercy of the Omnipotent , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at hand . On the 7th November , three Indians who had been sent by Mr. Back , arrived with provisions . Qn the 16th they bad so far recovered their strength as to be able to proceed by aid of the Indians to the abode of Akaitcho , an Indian chief , who treated them with the greatest kindness . Provisions and clothing soon after reached them from Fort Proyidence . The following summer they returned by the usual route to Montreal and thence to England . Their travels in North America including voyage on the Arctic Sea exceeded 5500 miles FRANKLIN 'S SECOND EXPEDITION TO THE POLAR SEA , 1825-6-7 . In 1824 , the British Government determined to send another Polar expedition to complete the survey of the Northern coasts of America . Captain Franklin tendered his services to command the expedition and submitted a plan for a journey overland to the mouth of Macken*e River , and thence by sea to the north-western extremity of America , with the combined object also of surveying the coast between the Mackenzie and the Coppermine Rivers . " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his services as naturalist and surgeon , and volunteered to undertake the survey of the coast between the mouths of Mackenzie and Coppermine Rivers , while Captain Franklin should be engaged westward in an attempt to reach Icy Cape and Behring 's Strait . In this expedition they were enabled to profit by the experience of their first journey . Boats were constructed in England , of various dimensions adapted to the passage of rapids and other waters between York Factory on Hudson 's Bay , and Mac* kenzie River , as well as for the navigation of the Arctic Sea . These were made of mahogany , with timbers of ash , yet so light , that the largest one , twenty-six feet 586 June , // long and five feet four inches broad , and adapted for six rowers , a steersman and an officer , could be easily carried on the shoulders of six men . Their boats were shipped direct to York Factory and thence across the country , through the various rivers and small lakes , to await Captain Franklin at Methye River . Every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that could add to their comfort and ensure the safety of the expedition , was procured . The expedition sailed from Liverpool on the 16th of February 1825 ,  --  passed through New York , Albany and the great lakes to Lake Superior ; thence through the Lake of the Woods and Lake Winnepeg to the Methye River where they overtook their boats on the 29th June . The season had so far advanced before they reached Mackenzie River that they determined to the great expedition till the ensuumer . They accordingly established their winter quarters on the banks of Great Bear Lake , by erecting substantial houses which they called Fort Franklin . Lieutenant Back , a young officer , who accompanied Franklin in his first expedition , superintended the arrangements here , while Captain Franklin determined to descend Mackenzie River , take a view of the Polar Sea , and return before the winter set in . This voyage he performed without difficulty and returned to his winter quarters on the 5th september . Dr. Richardson returned at the same time from some eastern explorations . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing , by which means abundant stores of provisions were secured for their winter 's use . The daily product of the nets during the autunin was eight hundred herring-salmon . A supply of fuel was also collected and piled up for use . The prospect before them was , therefore , very different from that which they had experienced in their previous winter residence in these regions . Nothing of importance occurred during their long winter . The officers instructed the men in reading , writing , and arithmetic duAng the long evenings , and divine service was held on Sunday , which was always kept as a day of rest . On the 28th June the party embarked VOL . V. NO . Vi . NEW SERIES . 38 on the Mackenzi&amp; River . On the 4th I July Capt . Franklin took the western channel where the river branched off towards its mouth , while Dr. Richardson took the eastern branch with his party . Large numbers of Esquimaux were met at the river 's month with whom Franklin had a difficulty . They plundered some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had it not been for his great forbearance . The Esquimaux interpreter made a speech to his countrymen , in which he made known the great love which the white people had for them , which induced them to return much of the plundered property , and exacted a promise from them to behave better in future . The Esquimaux apologized by saying that " they had never seen white inca before , and all the things in the boats were so very beautiful and desirable , that it was impossible not to steal them . " The expedition proceeded along the shore of the Polar Sea with some interruption from the ice and fogs until the 16th August , when they had reached 1 59Q W longitude , or about one half the distance from Mackenzie River to Icy Cape . A perceptible change had now taken place in the weather . Vegetation assumed an autumnal aspect , and ice began to form at night on the pools of fresh water . The Esquimaux lately so numerous had ceased to appear ; the deer were hastening from the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more genial climes . It was , therefore , resolved to return . Accordingly , on the 18th August the boats began their voyage eastward to Mackenzie River , which they reached without accident on the 4th September ; and proceeding at once up that river , arrived in safety at Fort Franklin , where Dr. Richardson arrived a few days before . Dr. Richardson in his exploration of the Polar Sea eastward from Mackenzie River met with no obstacles to retard his progress , and was enabled to accomplish his voyage to the Coppermine River , a distance of 590 miles , between the 4th July and the 8th of August He then proceeded up that river and reached the winter quarters of the party on the 1st of September . After a winter spent at Fort Franklin the expedition , in the following summer , returned by the usual route to England . 1850. 587 // June , CAPTAIN BEECHEY 'S VOYAGE THROUGH BEHRING 'S STRAITS . 1825-26 . To co-qperate with Parry and Franklin , it was determined by the British government to send an expedition to Beliring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blossom , a 24 gun ship , was destined for this service , and sailed from England on the 19th of May , 1825 . A boat to b* used as a tender , built as large as could be carried on the deck of the ship , was taken out . She was schooner rigged , decked , and fitted out in the best manner . On the 22d July 1826 , which was as early as it was desirable to be in the Polar Sea , Captain Beechey anchored in Kotzebue Sound , after surveying a portion of which , he proceeded to Chamisso Island , where he was directed to await Captain Franklin . Leaving the barge for the purpose of following the coast , he proceeded northward with his ship and passed Icy Cape . On the 17th of August , as the channel between the ice and the shore was not wide enough to trust his ship farther , he despatched the barge under the command of Mr. Elson to trace the shore as far eastward as possible . The barge proceeded as far as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most northerly part of the American contineUt yet formed the terminus to a spit of and discovered jutting out several miles from the regular coast line . It was now late in the season , and prudence dictated to the party that it was unsafe to proceed farther , as there was danger that the ice minht close in upon them and prevent their escape . They therefore began a retreat towards their rendezvous , at Chamisso Island , which they reached on the 9th September not without difficulty , having been " thickly beset with ice , that threatened every moment to close with its impenetraable walls and cut off their return . " The result of this voyage was the addition of an extensive line of coast to our Polar geography ; and a comparison of notes she wed that but 146 miles intervened between the expedition of Captains Beechey and Franklin , who were on this coast at the same tune . Captain Franklin afterwards asserted , that had he " been aware of the fact of his near proximity to the barge of the Blossom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return . " It was the great object of his ambition to reach Icy Cape , and he doubtless would have accomplished it , or perished in the attempt . The following year , Captain Beechey returned to the Arctic Sea , and endeavored to extend his survey beyond the point attained by him in 1826 ; but the severity of the weather obliged him to return before he had reached Icy Cape . SIR JOHN ROSS 'S SECOND VOYAGE , 1829-30-31-32-33 . IN 1828 , Captain John Ross whose name appears first among those who attempted to discover a North West Passage , and whose mistake in passing Lancaster Sound , lost to him the honor ann renown which were gained by his successor Captain Parry , felt ambitious to resume the undertaking and make another effort to make this passage . He proposed to government a plan to explore the Polar Sea , with a steam vessel , but they were tired with an enterprise which had lost its ' novelty , and determined to send out no more expeditions for the purpose specified . Mr. Felix Booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote the scheme of Captain Ross , then generously came forward , and advanced the amount necessary for the expedition . The Victory steamer of 150 tons was accordingly equipped for the voyage . A great interest was excited in the enterprise and many officers in the navy tendered their services to Captain Ross . He gave the preference to his nephew Commander James C. Ross who had been in all the 588 // qwq again sent out . Commander Ross proceeded northward in search of a western opening but found none . Captain Ross and other officers went in other directions . The most important journey , however , was a later one performed by Commander Ross in search of the Magnetic Pole . Calculations had been made by the leaiiied , which placed this interesting spot in latitude 70* north , and longitude 98o 30 ' west , and it was one of the objects of this voyage to discover the spot . In Commander Ross 's journey the previous year , he passed within ten miles of it , but had not instruments with him to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he directed his course . The journey was tedious and laborious , not only from the rigor of the season , and the ruggedness of the surface , but from the care with which he examined the country . " On the 1st of June , he reached the spot where his own calculations fixed the Magnetic Pole , which was 700 5 ' 17 north , and longitude 960 46 ' 45 west . The instruments were put in motion and the amount of the dip of the needle found to be 89o 59 ' , being only one minute less than 90 * the vertical position , which would precisely have indicated the polar station ; and the horizontal needles when suspended in the most delicate manner possible , did not shew the slightest tendency to move . He looked in vain for some object to mark the spot . " i*ature had here erected no monument to denote the spot which she had chosen as the centre of one of her great and dark powers * Commander Ross erected a pile of stones and returned to the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 29th of August the ship left her winter quarters . She was soon stopped by adverse winds and bad weather . A snow storm came on with a heavy gale , and they again found themselves completely surrounded with masses of ice . The* watched an opportunity to escape through any channels in the ice that might be presented , but they watched in vain . On the 14th of September they were enabled to take exercise by skating on the new ice which had formed around them . A few days later , all hope of escape vanished and they found themselves fixed in the ice for a third winter , but four miles from their late winter station . " The spirits of the adventurers now began to droop in earnest . They soon became sensible that , at all events , it would be perilous to wait another season in the hope of extricating the vessel , in which they could never return to England , and had no alternative but to abandon her amid the Arctic regions . Their only means of escape was to proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wreck of the Fury , when after supplying themselves with a fresh stock of provisions out of her stores , they might reach Davis 's Straits , and return in one of the whale ships . ' , Up to this time the whole party had enjoyed excellent health . Now , the scurvy began to shew itself ; yet the long and tedious winter was passed much as in previous years , and the spring found them ready to abandon their vessel . The stores of the Fury lay 180 miles off , in a direct line ; but the windings which it would be necessary to make , increased the journey to 300 miles . There was no other hope of escape left for them but to reach these stores , and they determined to make the attempt . On the 23d of April 1832 , they commenced the labor of carrying their provisions , the ice clothing and boats over ; but it was impossible to carry all , except by making many journeys . By the 21st of May they had accomplished but 30 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On leaving the Victory for the last time , they hoisted her colors , nailed them to the mast , and drank a parting glass to her . After the most fatiguing and incessant labor , in transporting their boats to a safe and accessible point , they made their way with their stores to Fury Beach , which they reached on the 1st July . They now set to work , and built a house of canvas for their residence , until the ice permitted their leaving . The boats were next repaired and fitted ; and they now awaited the moment when some channels of water would permit them to set out on their voyage . On the 1st of August there was an open sea to a considerable distance when they embarked , but the dangers to which they were constantly exposed from the masses of floating ice , obliged them 590 June , // often to seek the beach for safety . On the 29th of August they reached Barrow 's Strait , where they landed and pitched their tents . They attempted to run along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible . The whole Strait was firmly closed with ice , and had been so during the whole summer . Ascending the neighboring mountains , they saw an impenetrable barrier of ice before them , and that it would be impossible to reach the sea eastward . To return to Fury Beach was their only hope . On the 24th of September they retraced their steps , but were only able to get half-way in their boats , when they were stopped by the ice . They now hauled them high up on the beach for safety , where they left them put their prJvision on sledges , and made their way to Fury Beach where they arrived on the 7th of October . As the frail canvas house was to be their abode for the fourth winter , which had already set in with severity , they endeavored to make it comfortable by covering , and raising walls of snow around it . Stoves were set up and a temperature of 510 maintained . " But the winter as it advanced , proved one of great severity ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . " For food they were pretty well off . The stores of the Fury furnished them with a reduced allowance of preserved meats ; but plenty of flour , sugar , soups , i*d vegetables . In February , the carpenter died of scurvy , and many of the seamen were attacked with the same disease . Their situation was now becoming awful , and unless liberated in the approaching summer , death was inevitable . In April and May they carried forward to their boats a supply of provisions . To accomplish this many journeys were necessary , as in the previous year ; and , although the distance to their boats was but 32 miles , their journeyings amounted to 256 miles . Having effected this , they returned to their canvas house where they remained until the 8th of July , when they set off , carrying with them the sick , and in four days reached their boat station . Here they anxiously awaited the breaking up of the ice . On the 15th of August a lane of water appearing , they launched their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under way with a fair wind . They soon reached Barrtw 's Strait which they found open and navigable though obstructed with floating ice . They made rapid progress until contrary winds met them , which detained them four days . On the 25th they made Navy Board Inlet where they landed for the night . The next morning a sail was seen . Signals were made but she did not descry them . A breeze sprang up and the sail soon vanished from their sight . A second soon after appeared . The weather became calm , when by hard rowing the boats approached so near that their signals were discovered . A boat was now seen coming from the ship , and on approaching , the mate asked them if they wanted aid , supposing them to be the crew of a whaleman , who had lost their vessel . On being asked by Captain Ross where their ship was from and her name , they replied that it was the Isabella of Hull , formerly commanded by Captain Ross . On being told that this gentleman stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he had been dead at least two years . Captain Ross soon satisfied them of the reality , when they hastened to the ship where he and his party received a most cordial reception . " Every man was hungry , and had to be fed ; all were ragged and were to be clothed ; it was washing , dressing , shaving , eating , all intermingled . " Then came a thousand questions and the news of what had transpired in the world during their four years ' absence . On the 13th of September they fell in with the fleet of whalers on the fishing ground , when all the captains came on board to welcome them , bringing presents from their stores . On the 30th , the fishery being no longer practicable , the Isabella left IDavi8 's Straits , and on the 12th October reached Stromness . The news of the arrival of Captain Ross spread like lightning through the kingdom . for no modern enterprise of the kind had created so strong a sensation . All hope of their return having fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave . Crowds rushed to see them on their way to London . The officers were all promoted and eligible places given them . Captain Ross was knighted , and a committee of the House of Commons recommended a grant of ? 5000 to him for his services . In conclusion , it should be ob 1850. 591 // Arctic Expeditions . qwq CAPTAIN Back was sent out by the 3ritish government at the head of an expedition in search of Captain John Ross , who had then been absent four years , and for the safety of whose party , great fears were entertained . He left England in February 1833 , and following the route of Captain Franklin , with whom he had been associated in his two land journeys , reached the eastern shore of Great Slave Lake , where he took up his winter quarters . The winter proved a severe one ; and besides taking care of his own party , he was obliged to sustain a party of Indians which had reached his dwelling in a state of starvation . In April 1834 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dospatches from England informing him of the return of Captain Ross . Nevertheless , agreeable to instructions , he made a journey to the Polar S*a by following a large stream , abounding in cataracts , since known as Back 's lUver . He was unable to trace but little of the*hore of the sea , and after many hardships , made his way back to his winter quarters . In the following year , he returned by the route he came , to England . CAPTAIN BACK 'S ATTEMPT TO REACH REPULSE BAY . 18.36-37 . THE object of this voyage was the same as that on which Captain Lyon had been employed in 1824 . Captain Back 's in*tructions were to proceed to Wager River or Repulse Bay , as he should find most expedient . On arriving there he was to leave his ship with an officer to be employed in making surveys and observations , and proceed with a large party across the intervening land to the Eastern shore of Prince Regent 's Inlet . It was then to divide ; one party to trace the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow the coast line westward to the mouth of Back 's River , and thence to Point Turnagain of Franklin . The ship Terror was selected for the expedition , and a total of 73 officers and men made up the party . They left England on the 14th of June , 1836 , and on the 28th of July , crossed Davis ' Strait . On the 5th of Saptember , they had reached lat. 65 25 ' opposite to Frozen Strait in Fox Channel , when they became fixed in the ice . The ship was tossed about among the broken ice for several weeks until a large floe or mass , got beneath her bottom and raised her high out of the water . Huge blocks of ice , and gigantic icebergs , attached themselves to , or were thrown upon the floe , while the ship lay in her icy cradle , unable , with all the efforts of her crew , to extricate herself from this dangerous position . November came , and finding themselves permanently fixed , Captain Back made his winter arrangements . Galleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship for places of shelter as well as to protect her from the wind . This gave employment to , and furnished amusement for the men . But their situation was a dreadful one . At times , huge floes and icebergs were driven upon them by severe gales , crushing and grinding the floe or ice-island to which they were bound , threatening every moment to involve them all in a common destruction . In this situation they were tossed about at the mercy of the winds and waves during the whole winter . On one occasion they were driven near the rocky cliffs which bound these dreary and inhospitable seas , // expecting to share the fate of the icy masses which rushed by them , and weic ground to atoms against the cliffs . But on they floated . Late in February , " the crashing of the ice , the hoarse rushing sound , and the severe shocks against the ship " indicated a change , and it was soon found that a rent had been made in the ice , forming a continuous line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship was mounted . " The ship now began to complain , and strained considerably under the counter . She then heeled over to port , and relieved herself about six inches from the starboard embankment against the side , making hy the effort , gaping rents through the snow walls . At this time , the crashing , grinding , an ( 1 rushing walls beneath* as well as at the borders of the floe , the rents and cracks in all directions toward the ship , herself suffering much , the freezing cold of 33* below zero , combined to render our situation not a little perilous and uncomfortable . " But the Terror was not now to be liberated . The ice gave way in part , only to give place to other floes and masses , which hemmed her in on every side , and were piled up around her in the same icy cradle in which she had so long been rocked . Away was she borne again in the midst of the ocean , enveloped in fogs and snow , her compasses useless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got in readiness , and arrangements made in case of necessity to embai'k in them as a last resort , but they were mercifully spared this crisis . In this state the ship remained until the 11th of July , when the ice was again rent asunder , and " a loud rumbling notified that she had broke her icy bounds , and was sliding down gently into her own element . " " I know not , " says Back , " how many cheers commemorated the occasion . It was a scene not to be forgotten by the spectators . " The ship " crazy , broken , and leaky** as she was , now made her way to England as fast as possible , where she arrived in safety . This sketch of the various Arctic Expeditions should not be concluded without mentioning the important services rendered by Messrs . Dease and Simpson . These gentlemen fitted out a boat expedition under the direction of the Hudson Bay Company , with which they completed the discovery and survey of the shores of the Arctic Sea , by connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , and those of Franklin , Back , and Ross , east of Coppermine River . These gentlemen made the longest voyage in boats , ever performed in the Arctic Seas . The explorations and discoveries of Dr. Rae about Repulse Bay and Boothia , completing the survey of the shores about these regions are also of importance , and deserve to be mentioned here . SIR JOHN FRANKLIN 'S EXPEDITION , 1845-6-7-8-9-50 . IN December 1844 , Sir John Barrow , submitted a proposition to the British Admiralty and to the Royal Society for another expedition for discovery in the Arctic Seas , from which we make the following abstract : PROPOSAL FOR AN ATTEMPT TO COMPLETE THE DiSCOVERY OF A NORTH WEST PASSAGE -- There is a general feeling entertained in the several scientific societies , by individuals attached to scientific pursuits , and also among officers of the navy , that the discovery , or rather the completion of the discovery of a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific , round the northern coast of America , ought not to be abandoned , after so much has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that with our present knowledge no reasonable doubt can be entertamed that the accomplishment of so desirable an object is practicable . A brief sketch then follows of what had been accomplished by the several Polar ex-peditions : " It may be presumed , therefore , that a distance of 300 leagues on a clear sea , keeping mi ( lway between Banks ' Land and the coast of America , would accomplish an object which , at intervals during 300 years , has engaged the 1850.111 593 // attention of crowned heads , men of science , and mercantile bodies , whose expectations were frequently disappointed , but not discouraged . " * * * Furthermore , Sir John Barrow observes , " that a final attempt to make a north-west passage would render the most important service that now remains to be performed towards the completion of the magnetic survey of the globe ; and it is hardly necessary to say , that the geography and hydrography of this part of the Polar Sea would be a valuable addition to our knowledge of the globe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I The plan received a favorable consideration , and after a little consultation was adopted . Sir John Franklin had but just returned from Van IJieman 's Lnnd on the opposite side of the globe , having been governor of that colony for several years , and was at once given the command of the expedition . The ships selected were the Erebus and Terror . His second in command was Captain Crozier , ( who accompanied Captain Ross in his Antartic cxpedition . ) These , with 136 officers , seamen and marines made up the party . This expedition left England on the 19th of May 1845 . Their official instructions were to proceed up Lancaster Sound and Barrow 's Strait to Cape Walker , a point noticed by Captain Parry from which the land trended southward . If an opening presented here , they were to avail themselves of it , and push on toward Behring 's Strait . In case this course proved impracticable , their orders then were , to attempt the openings at the north of Barrow 's Strait , particularly Wellington Channel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when Captain Parry passed in his first voyage . He was then directed to proceed westward towards Behring 's Strait . To accomplish this , it was believed that three years would suffice ; and in case the expedition should be unsuccessful , the same period would be required in their endeavors to penetrate the several passages referred to . Provisions for three years were accordingly placed on board , and everything which could tend to the oomfort and health of the party was added . The ships , too , were made strong , that they might withstand the pressure from the ice to which they would be subjected , and the most approved means were adopted to warm and ventilate them . Cofisiderable discretionary power was given to Sir John Franklin , notwithstanding these instructions , for they continue : In an undertaking of this description , much must always be left to the discretion of the commandi ig officer ; and as the objects of this expedition have been fully explained to you , anil you already have had much experience on service of this nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it to your judgment , in the event of your not making a passage this season , either to winter on the coast , with the view of following up next season any hopes or expectations which your observations this year may lead you to entertain , or to return to England to report to us the result of such observations , always recollecting an anxiety for the health , comfort , and safety of yourself , your officers and men ; and you will duly weigh how far the advantage of starting next season for an advanced position may be counterbalanced by what may be suffered during the winter , and by the want of such refreshment and refitting as would be afforded on your return to England . " On the 26th July 1845 , these ships were seen moored to an iceberg , in latitude 74o 48 ' , longitude 660 13 ' W. , a point near by the middle of Baffin 's Bay , and opposite Lancaster Sound , no doubt waiting for an opening through the floating or " Middle Ice , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last seen of the ships . The probability is that the middle ice was passed , and that the ships entered Lancaster Sound ; but what course they took afterwards is , of course , not known . No trace has been found of them on the shores visited by the various whaling vessels . In the year 1848 , no tidings having been received from Sir John Franklin , the British Admiralty and the friends of the intrepid navigator , determined to send out vessels for his succor . Three expeditions were accordingly equipped by the Government , to be dispatched in different directions . The first vessel which sailed was the Plover , under Captain Moore . She left England on the 31st January , 1848 , expecting to reach Behring 's Strait by August , which would have given time for two months ' exploration of the Arctic Sea . But proving a bad sailer , she only reached the Sandwich Islands on the 22d August , a period too late to make the attempt . Capt . Moore accordingly proceeded to the 594 June , // coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surveying vessel employed in the Pacific , under command of Captain Kellett , was directed to join the Plover at some point near Behring 's Strait . Capt . Kcllett was ordered to take her under his direction , an ( l search the Polar Sea north of that strait for Sir John Franklin . The second expedition was placed under the conimand of Sir John Richardson , a gentleman who had distinguished himself in the overland expedition of Sir John Franklin many years before . His instructions were to proceed overland to Mackenzie 's River ; to follow that river to the Arctic Sea , and then with boats to examine the coast extending to the mouth of the Coppermine River , as well as the lands contiguous thereto . It was supposed that if Sir John Franklin had abandoned his ships and taken to his boats , or if he had sent out any parties to explore , they would have made every exertion to reach this coast . From this point they could proceed either to the Russian settlement at Colville River , or overiaw* to Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of the relief expeditions , was that under Sir James Ross and Captain Bird , in the ships Enterprise and Investigator . This expedition was directed to enter Barrow 's Strait , to examine the prominent points of land as it passed up , particularly the points leading up Wellington Channel on the north and Cape Walker on the south , for traces of the missing expedition , and then to proceed westward towards Melville Island . On this division a much greater sum had been expended than on the others ; the ships were provisioned so as to enable them to winter in the Arctic regions , which would give them two summers for their explorations . They were to follow the supposed track of Sir John Franklin ; and , of course , great hopes were entertained of the success of the expedition . The fourth and last division wa* simply a store-ship called the North Star , Mr. Saunders commanding . This vessel was laden with supplies for the Franklin expedition . " The main object of the voyage was , first , by replenishing the stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the return of the Investigator , Capt . Bird , to England in the summer of 1849 , in order that Captain Bird with his ship might continue to co-operate with Sir James Ross in prosecuting his search during the summer of 1850 ; and , secondly in case of not meeting with the Investigator or her boats , to land the necessary supplies at certain points on the south side of Lancaster Sound and Barrow 's Strait . The preference was to be given to Whaler Point on Leopold Island . If these places were inaccessible , the supplies were to be left at Pond 's Bay . This being accomplished , the North Star was then to run up to the head of Baffin 's Bay and examine the openings known as Smith 's and Jones 's Sounds . " But it was ordered , and the order was reiterated , " says Dr. Seoresby , " that the commander of the North Star should carefully avoid risking all hazard of being detained throughout the winter . " Such were the four expeditions sent in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard except the last . Their results we will now proceed to state The Herald and Plover proceeded to Bebring 's Strait for their winter quarters , . in the summer of 1849 , arriving at Chainisso Island , their place of rendezvous within the straits , on the 14th of July ; one vessel preceding the other by a day only . They were joined here by a private yacht , the Nancy iDawson , belonging to and commanded by Mr. Shedden . The object of this gentleman was to search for and aid Sir John Franklin . Lie was last from Hong Kong . On the 18th of July they sailed on their voyage of research . Passing Icy Cape , a boat expedition was arranged and despatehed on the 25th , consisting of the Herald 's pinnace , decked over , and three other boats . The Nancy Dawson joined them ; when this expedition of small craft boldly pushed its way into the Arctic Sea for sonic distance beyond Point Barrow . Here , according to instructions , they despatehed two whale boats under the command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These boats were directed to proceed along , and examine the coast as far as Mackenzie 's River for traces of the missing ships ; and , if they attained that point , were to ascend the river to Fort Hope , 1850. 595 // and return hy the way of York Factory , a trading post on Hudson 's Bay , in the Summer of the present year . The Herald , after despatching the boat expedition to Mackenzie 's River , advanced to the northward , until the 28th July , when she reached the great field of pack ice , which stopped her further progress . This was in latitude 72* 51 ' N. and longitude l63* 48 ' W. From this time until the 17th of August , the ship continued to force her way along the cdge of the pack , exploring the re*ion between the extreme northern point of the American coast and the contiguous parts of Asia , when land was discovered from the mast head . The details of these explorations arc given with minuteness in the official report of Capt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until land was seen , they are passed over . The particulars of the discovery alluded to are of interest , and are given in ot der to complete our narrative . The island visited was in latitude 71* 20 ' N. , longitude 175* 16 ' W " In running a course along the pack towards our first discovery , a small group of islands was reported on our port beam , a considerable distance within the outer margin of the ice . " The pack here was not so close as I found it before . Lanes of water could be seen reaching almost up to the groop , but too narrow to enter unless the ship had been sufficiently fortified to force a hole for herself . " These small islands at intervals were very distinct , all were not considered at the time very distant . " Still more distant than this group ( from the deck ) a very extensive and high land was reported , which I had been watching for some time , and anxiously awaited a report from some one else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under it , we ran 25 miles directly for it . At first we could not see that the pack joined it , but as we approached the island we found the pack to rest on the island , and to extend from it as far as the eye could reach to the E. S. B. " The weather , which had been fine all day , now changed suddenly to dense clouds and snow showers , blowing fresh from the south , with so much sea that I did not anchor as I intended . " I left the ship with two boats ; the sen*r lieutenant , Mr. Maguire ; Mr. Seemaun , naturalist ; and Mr. Collinson , mate , in one ; Mr. Goodridge , surgeon , Mr. Pakenham , midshipman , and myself in the other , almost despairing of being able to reach the island . " The ship kept off and on outside the thickest part of the loose ice , through which the boats were obliged to be very careful in picking their way , on the S. E. side , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found running on it a very heavy sea ; the first lieutenant , however , land ed , having backed his boat in until he could get foothold ( without swimming , ) and then jumped overboard . I followed his example ; the other were anxious to do the same , but the sea was so high that I could not permit them . " We hoisted the jack and took possession of the island with the usual ceremonies , in the name of her most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria . " The extent we had to walk over was not more than 30 feet . From this space and a short distance that we scrambled up , we collected eight species of plants ; specimens of the rock were also brought away . " With the time we could spare and our materials , the island was perfectly inaccessible to us . This was a great disappointment to us , as from its summit , which is elevated above the sea 1,400 feet , much could have been seen , and all doubt set aside , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be obliged to carry sail to get off the pack and out of the bight of it we were in ; neither could I expect at this late period oft the season the weather would improve . " The island on which I landed is four miles and a half in extent east and west , and about two and a half north and south , in the shape of a triangle , the western end being its apex . It is almost inaccessible on all sides , and a solid mass of granite . Innumerable black and white divers ( common to this sea ) here found a safe place to deposit their ec**s and bring up their young ; not a walrus or seal was seen on its shore , or on the ice in its vicinity . We observed here none of the small land birds that were so numerous about us before making the land . " It becomes a nervous thing to report a discovery of land in these regions without actually landing on it , after the unfortunate mistake to the southward ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has 130 pairs of eyes to assist him , all agreeing , I am certain we have discovered an extensive land . I think , also , it is more than probable that these peaks we saw are a continuation of the range of mountains seen by the natives off Cape Jakan ( coast of Asia ) , mentioned by Baron Wrangell in his Polar voyages . I returned to the ship at 7 P. M. , and very reluctantly made all the sail we could carry from this interesting neighborhood to the south-east , the wind at the time allow .. lug me to lie just clear of the pack . " August 18. - Towards the morning we bad a very strong wind , with constant snow storms and excessive cold . The wind having changed to the northward left me no choice but to return to my rendezvous for the boats . " No traces of Sir John Franklin were met - with by the Herald , the Plover , or their boats , as far as heard from . The Plover was then equipped and provisioned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed to take up her winter quarters in Kotzebue Sound . From this place Captain Moore will continue his explorations during the summer of 1850 , in search of the missing expedition . // The second expedition in order is that of Sir John Richardson . This gentleman , accompanied by Dr. Rae , left Liverpool on the 25th of March , 1848 , arrived in New York a fortnight afterwards , and proceeded at once to Montreal . Here he was joined by 16 Canadian voyageurs , provided by Sir George Simpson , when the party proceeded on their journey by the way of Lakes Ontario , Erie , Huron , Superior , Lake of the Woods , and Lake Winipeg , reaching Cumberland House on the 19th of June . A few days after , Sir John overtook the party which left England before him , under Mr. Rae , and had come by way of Hudson 's Bay . This *arty consisted of 16 Canadian voyag*urs , with a large batteau , four boats brought from England , with their crews of five seamen and fifteen sappers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also brought by this party . On passing the last portage , the two canoes , with their crews , were sent to Canada . The party again divided on reaching Mackenzie 's River . Sir John Richardson and Mr. Rae proceeded with two boats and their crews down Mackenzie 's River , while Mr. Bell , with the remainder of the party , took the winter stores and hastened to Great Bear Lake , to establish a fishery , as well as to erect dwelling-houses and storehouses for the whole party , when it should assemble for its winter quarters . Two men were al* despatched to the mouth of Coppermine River , there to hunt and await the arrival of the boats . Sir John reached the sea on the 4th of August , and had an interview with about 300 Esquimaux , who were collected to meet him , having been apprised of his coming by signal fires lighted by their huntino* parties on the bills skirtincr the river . The distance from Point Encounter where they met this party , to the mouth of Coppermine River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upwards of 600 miles ; and as they had almost tonstantly head *nds , they rowed along near the shore . Their communications with the Esquimaux , assembled on the headlands to hunt whales , or in pursuit of reindeer , were frequent . They came off to the boats with confidence , and through the medium of an Esquimaux in the party of Sir John , who spoke good English , they were able to converse freely together . These Esquimaux invariably told them that no ships had passed , and were rejoiced to learn by the inquiries made of them , that there was a prospect of their seeing more white men on their shores . Up to Cape Bathurst , or about one third of the distance between the Mackenzie and Coppermine , the Esquimaux informed them that for six weeks of the summer , or , as they expressed it , for the greater part of two moons , during which they were chiefly occupied in the pursuit of whales , they never saw any ice . At Cape Bathurst they erected a signal post , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other prominent points . After roundinj Cape Parry , they observed for the first time on their voyage , flows of drift ice , which increased as they advanced . No Esquimaux were seen here , though traces of them were noticed . On the 22d of August the weathei suddenly changed , and became cold . Snow storms were frequent , and the progress of the ' boats was much impeded by the new ice . After much labor , in hauling the boats over the ice , in making portages along the shore , and with the aid of occasional spaces of water , the party succeeded in reaching a point near the mouth of Coppermine River by the end of the month . Here they left their boats , buried their provisions and ammunition , and on the 3d of September , with thirteen days ' provisions , set out on foot for their winter quarters , at Fort Confidence , which they reached in safety on the thirteenth day . In the spring of 1849 , Mr. Rae volunteered his services , with an excellent crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Coppermine River , there to take their boats , and about the middle of July , at which time the sea is open , explore the region northward . his intention was to cross over to Wollaston Land , and endeavor to penetrate to the northward erecting signal columns , and making de : posits on prominent headlands , and especially on the north shore of Banks ' Land , should he be fortunate enough to reach that coast . He was directed to return during the summer ; also to engage one or more families of Indian hunters to pass the summer of 1850 on the banks of Copper1850. 597 // mine River , to be ready to assist any party that may direct their course that way . The results of the third expedition , or that under Sir James Ross , comes next in order . He sailed from England on the 12th of May , 1848 ; cntered Baffin 's Bay early in July ; and left the Danish settlement of Upernavik on the 13th of tke same month , lie met with great difficulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20th of August that he succeeded in reaching the clear water in latitude 75* degrees north , and longitude 68 degrees west . The ships now proceeded to the western shores of Baffin 's Bay , which they followed , and closely examined for traces of Sir John Franklin . Signals were erected on all the prominent points , and casks were thrown overboard containing papers with information for the missing party , should they discover them . The shores of Barrow Strait , both north and south , were examined , as well as the entrance to Wellington Channel , which was closed with ice , and did not appear to have been open during the summer . Their progress westward was also stopped by the pack ice , which stretched across Barrow Strait , so that the only alternative seems to have been to secure a harbor for the winter in Leopold Island , into which the ships entered on the 11th of September , 1848 . On the 15th of May , 1849 , Sir James Ross *ft the ship with Lieut MeClintock and a party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the clothing , were lashed to two sledges . The party followed the shore of North Somerset , westward to Cape Rennel , when the land trended to the south west , and afterwards to the south . They followed all the indentations of the coast until the 5th of June , when , having consumed more than half their provisions , and several of the party being disabled , they abandoned further operations . Returning , they reached the ships on the 23d of June , afteisan absence of 40 days . During the absence of Sir James , other parties were sent out to explore the north shore of Barrow Strait ; the east of Prince Regent 's Inlet ; and a third to examine a portion of its western shore . Very little was accomplished by these parties . No traces of the missing ships were discovered by either Sir Jam4*s Ross or the other exploratory parties referred to . During the winter a great many white foxes were taken alive in traps set for the purpose ; and as it is well known how large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , copper collars , upon which a notice of the position of the ships and depots of provisions was engraved , were clenched around their necks , when they were set at liberty . It was hoped that intelligence might , by this means , be conveyed to the crews of the missing vessels . The season being late , without a prospect of immediate release from their winter quarters , Sir James Rosa employed his men in sawing a canal two miles long through the ice , wide enough to admit the passing of the ships . Even by this means , which was attended with immense labor , he only reached the open sea and liberated his ships on the 28th of August . Sir James now intended making all haste to reach a westerly point and , if possible , Melville Island , during the short season that remained ; but he had gone but twelve miles when his further progress was arrested by fixed pack ice , which had not broken away during the season . He watched an opportunity* to push his way through any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the westward brought the whole pack down upon , * and closely beset the ships . All attempts to extricate themselves proved fruitless . Vast fields of ice and gigantic icebergs surrounded them for miles in all directions , and they soon perceived that the whole body was driving eastward , at the rate of eight or ten miles a day . " Every effort on our part , " says Captain Ross , " was totally unavailing ; for no human power could have moved the ships a single inch . " In this manner they drifted until the 25th of September , by which time they had been carried completely through Barrow Strait into the centre of Baffin 's Bay . Here new dangers attended them ; tossed about among the icebergs of that boisterous sea , and surrounded by a field of ice 50 miles in circumference , they were in fear of being carried to the western shore of that bay , and crushed among its innumerable icebergs . But on the day named , the great ice-field was rent asunder , and the ships made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another season had now passed ; all the harbors were closed with ice , and it was too late to recross the pack . The only alternative was to return to England , where they arrived early in November . Thus terminated an expedition on which the hopes of the English nation were centred . It was the best arranged of any division sent in search of Sir John Franklin ; and the seas Sir James Ross was directed to penetrate and examine were those wherein Sir John was believed to have passed , and , if still living , where it was believed he could be found . But misfortune seems to have attended the expedition from its start . The first season was spent in passing the middle ice of Baffin 's Bay , and they barely reached Leopold Island in time to secure a winter harbor . The selection of this was unfortunate , as the ice remained in it during the whole summer ; and a month before Captain Ross made his escape , whaling ships were in sight of it or had passed it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their exploring field at the moment they entered it ; for it is probable that , had the expedition remained in its harbor at Leopold Island a few days longer , until the great field of ice had passed , it would have found an open sea to the westward . From the foregoing it will appear that there are now three parties in the Arctic Sea*in search of the missing ships . 1 . The North Star store-ship . This vessel has already been in these seas one season . She was last seen on the 19th July 1849 , in latitude 740 3i N. , longitude 59o 40 ' W. , waiting for a passage round or througb the middle ice of Baffin 's Bay . It is to be hoped she succeeded in reaching some point beyond that attained by Sir James Ross up Barrow Strait , or that she has passed up Wellington Channel . Her return will be looked for during the approaching season or autumn with much interest . 2 . The party under Dr. Rae . This expedition was to be at the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1849 , or at a period when he might avail himself of the earliest opening of the ice in the Polar Sea to push forward with his boats through the passage between Wohlaston and Victoria Lands ; and from thence work his way towards Cape Walkem* on Barrow Strait , and Banks ' Land . Much will be expected from this enterprise . Dr. Rae will have a full season before him , and it is believed with confidence , that the addition he will make to our Arctic geography will be greater than that of other recent Arctic navigators . If Sir John Franklin was successful in reaching Cape Walker , and in passing south or west of that point , some trace will be discovered of his expedition . As this party intended to return to some post on Hudson 's Bay before the winter set in , the result of their examination will reach England in April or May of the present year . It appears by a recent despatch of Sir George Simpson , Governor of the Hudson 's Bay Company , that Dr. Rae has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along its shores during the present year . To send out two expeditions , one to be commanded by himself . One of these is to examine such portions of the region lying between Banks ' Land , Cape Walker and the Coppermine River , as had not been visited in 1849 ; the other to be despatched from the mouth of Mackenzie River . Rewards were to be offered to the Esquimaux and the half-breed indian hunters of Mackenzie River , to search for some vestige of the missing expedition . 3 . The Plover , under Captain Moore . This vessel wintered in Kotzehue Sound , north of Behi'ing 's Strait , and will continue her explorations during the present season in the seas of that quarter . 4 . The party despatched from the Plover and Herald , near Point Barrow , under the command of Lieutenant Pullen . This consisted of two whale boats 27 feet in length , and one baidar , a boat made and used by the Esquimaux , manned in all with fourteen persons . They were provided with provisions for 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any of Sir John Franklin 's pa*ty which might reach the coast . Lieutenant Pullen 's instructions were to examine the coast of the Arctic Sea to Mackenzie 's River . He was then to ascend that river , and make his way to York Factory on Hudson 's Bay . 5 . In addition to these three parties which were left in the field last year , other expeditions of greater magnitude a*'e in progre*s of preparation in England , or have already taken their departure for the Arc1850. 599 // tic regions . The ships Enterprise and Investigator , lately under the command of Captain Sir James Ross , have already been refitted , and were despatched from England on the 12th of January ; the Enterprise , under command of Capt . Collinson , and the Investigator under Lieut. jiVlaclure , who served in the Enterprise in her lake voyage . Measures have been taken by the Admiralty to give these vessels the aid of steamers in passing the Straits of Magellan and on to Valparaiso , in order to quicken their voyages and enable them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir John Franklin during the present season . Should information be received from the missing expedition , or any further light be thrown upon it by other expeditions now out , additional orders are to be sent by Panama to mect the ships at the Sandwich Islands . But the efforts to render succor to the nmissing ships do not end here , as the search within Bchring Strait is to be continued until the close of the summer of 1853 . This search will be committed to Captain Moore with the Plover beyond the time prescribed to Captain Collinson for his operations . Such a course seems necessary for the purpose of affording relief to Sir John Franklin or any of his party who may reach that region , as well as for affording aid to or co-operating with other expeditions . 6 . The last steamer from England brings advice , that the British Admiralty have decided on two more expeditions to be sent out during the present spring , as follows . The first will consist of two sailing ships , the Baboo and Ptar ? nigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These will be sent to Barrow 's Strait and adjacent localities under the command of Captain Austin , who acted as first Lieutenant of the Fury , in Parry 's third voyage in 1824 . These vessels will have a crew of 30 men each and will be fitted and stored with full three year 's provisions . 7 . The Admiralty have also iAanned another expedition , of which Captain Penny , late of the Advice whaler , is to have the command . This will consist of the Lady Franklin and Sophia , which will also be fitted with three years ' provisions , and will have a complement of 50 , being 25 for each ship . Captain Penny left town last evening for Aberdeen and Dundee , to personally superintend the fitting of his vessels ; and it is expected that he will be ready to sail for Jones ' Sound by the first week in April . 8 . It is also stated in a late London paper that the veteran Polar navigator , Sir John Ross is pushing on his expedition , and yesterday proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase a new vessel not yet launched . Mr. Abernethy , late gunner of the Enterprise , it was stated , was to accompany the gallant officer . The question of security to the crew of his vessel for their pay has been raised in many quarters . It is said the vessel is tobe insured , if any office will take her ; and should she return she will be sold , and the proceeds will form the means of paying the wages . Thus , it will be perceived that there are now , and will be , in the field during the approaching summer , eight different expeditions , embracing twelve vessels , including two steamers and two parties in boats ; all devoted to the noble and praiseworthy object of affording assistance to or rescuing Sir John Franklin and his associates from their ice-bound and dreary home . The Rev. Dr. Scoresby , whose long experience in early life in the Greenland Seas , aided by much valuable information collected in his voyages there and by subsequent scientific investigations , has thrown out some considerations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more feasible and more likely to be attended with favorable results than any before projected . His plan is to procure two vessels , such as are used for whaling ; two smaller craft of about 100 totis burden , or less ; and a well equipped boat , to be managed as follows " The largest vessel of the series ( which might be a whaler ) would be appointed to take position in , or not remote from Port Leopold ; another vessel-say the next largestmight take up a position as a second depot and place of refuge , at Melville Island . A third  --  a small vessel-would be directe4 to the west side of Cape Walker , for penetrating from thence , as far as she conveniently might , to the south-westward , should the position of the land and the condition of the ice permit in that direction . The other small vessel would have assigned to her the search of Wellington Channel , and other inlets proceeding out of Barrow 's Strait northward ; whilst th eboat being dropped , after the passage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 600 June , // tage , the researches which are still requisite within the different indents of the upper part of Baffin 's Bay ( principally that of Jones 's Sound , and secondarily that of Smith 's Sound , with any other penetrable channels that might be discovered ) , such inlets seeming to promise additional outlets , westward , after the manner of Lancaster Sound . " The boat , acting independently , would be no burden on , or incumbrance to , any of the exploring vessels The boat would seek its own safety at the close of its operations , hy going up to the refuge-ships at Port Leopold , or by endeavoring to join some one of the whalers , by which the boat 's crew might obtain a passage home . " From these vessels parties might be sent off in various directions , and examine a wider field than has yet baen explored . Even if they traversed the distance which Sir James Ross went on foot during the spring of 1849 , before he left Leopold Island , much might be accomplished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forty days , and on his return , had the whole summer before him . But his efforts were confined to releasing his ships from their winter harborr with a view of penetrating westward , andof course small parties could not be spared for separate explorations . With vessels stationed at prominent places , as suggested by Dr. Scoresby , to be employed for depots of provisions , and as rallying points for the crews of the smaller vessels , as well as for their w*ter quarters , more could be accomplished in an examination of the Arctic regions , with a view of relieving Sir John Franklin , than by any other plan . Even if they fail in attaining their object , they will then have acquired more geographical information than has been accomplished by any previous expedition . We are strongly impressed with the opinion , that if the barrier of floating ice which exists in the higher latitudes of the North Polar sea can be passed , that an open and unobstructed sea may then be found . Dr. Scoresby , as has been stated* once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad , when he entered an open sea . Sir Edward Parry , in his attempt to reach the Pole over the broken ice , found this ice moving southward in a body , so that after an arduous journey of 10 or 15 miles , he found by observation that he had not gained more than a third that distance . The barrier on this occasion and at this place , must have been very wide , or he would have passed it and reached the clear sea beyond . Throughout all the Arctic Seas the course of the currents are southward ; hence , when the ice is loosened and broken up , it moves with the current . A similar barrier was found in the Antarctic Seas , which was crossed by Captains Wilkes and Ross , and open water found beyond . Now , if Sir John Franklin in passing up Wellington Channel , crossed this barrier ( supposing the sea to exist north of that channel ) , he may have passed far to the west , and we may bear of him beyond Behring 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In these seas he would find whales and seals , which would support his party for a long time . In the United States a deep sympathy is felt for Sir John Franklin and his brave associates , and numerous appeals have been made by the press to the Government and to philanthropic individuals in his behalf . The President has already sent a message to Congress , recommending the fitting out of an expedition to be sent in search of the bold adventurers who have perilled their lives in the cause of science . Many officers of our Navy have applied for the honor of commanding the expedition , or of accompanying it ; and it now only awaits the tardy action of Congress before equipping the ships . But this is not all . While the country is awaiting the slow movements at Washington , HENRY GRINNELL , Esq. , a noble and public-spirited merchant of New York , has come forward , and proposes to furnish , at his own expense , two vessels of 100 tons each , well equipped and provisioned , for the Arctic Seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place them at the disposal of the Secretary of the Navy , to be officered and manned by him . These vessels will be despatched early , so as to be in Lancaster Sound as soon as it is clear of ice , and to search the various openings into Barrow 's Strait at the earliest period possible . In conclusion , it will be asked , What are the prospects that Sir John Franklin and his party survive ? These it will be proper to consider . The expedition took full supplies for three years . It has been absent nearly five years . If it appeared to Sir John that he 1850. 601 // might be kept in the Polar regions longer than his provisions warranted , he might , by lessening the allowance , make them last four years . And when his provisions were entirely exhausted , it is believed that he might , by fishing and the chase , procure a supply for his entire crew . This , of course , depends very much upon his situation . Some portions of these regions abound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parry , during his stay of nearly twelvemouths at Melville Island , added the following game to his stock of provisions : -3 musk oxen , 24 deer , 68 hares , 53 geese , 59 ducks , and 114 ptarmigans ; amounting in weight to 3766 lbs . of meat , or 3 1-2 pounds per month to each man . All this was obtained with but little effort , as hunting parties were occasionally sent out . Further south , on Victoria and Wollaston Lands , game is abundant . Here thousands of deer resort every spring , and game of every kind is plenty . Seals too , are common in these seas , and are easily shot , their curiosity rendering them an easy prey to parties in boats . Again , we have an example of Mr. Rae , who , while employed in Arctic explorations , was obliged to spend the winter on the shores of Repulse Bay . His only fuel consisted of the withered tufts of an herbaceous andromeda , and his whole party maintained themselves by the chase alone during a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none other have been , or should be selected for these polar voyages , ) the climate does not disagree . The deaths have been no more , if as many , as they would be under other circumstances . Parry , in his first voyage of eighteen months , lost but one man out . of his crew ; and Ross , notwithstanding the severe hardships and suffering of his party , shut up for four winters among the ice , one of which was passed in a canvas house , lost but two men . If whales or seals , therefore , can be found , there is no doubt but Sir John Franklin and his party may subsist for years . They would suffer most for the want of vegetables , but it is known that he was well provided with anti-scorbutics ; and during the summer season , sorrel , which is the best anti-seorbutic , is found in abundance on the islands north of Barro&amp;s Strait . There may be reasons why the party havenot abandoised their ships and sought the shores of the Arctic Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might proceed to the trading posts . In the first place , if they passed up Wellington Channel , they may be too far north to run the risk of attempting a journey on the ice , but would prefer remaining with their ships , in the hope that they might be able to escape during the summer . They may have attained a point far to the west-. ward towards Behring 's Strait , where they are surrounded by the ice , and from which there is no escape , except with their ships . If here , they would be in the midst of whales , on which they could subsist for years . Sir John Ross , it will be remernbered , was shut up for years in the Arctic seas , and finally escaped ; and we may entertain strong hopes that Sir John Franklin will yet return . It would be an extraordinary event to annihilate two ships , with 138 men , so completely that none should escape ; that none of them should have reached the Esquitnaux , or be seen by them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be left or discovered . Vessels , it is true , are often wrecked and crushed by the ice in the Polar Seas , but it is very rare that the crews perish ; in fact , no recent cases are on record . Since the foregoing was in type , advices have been received by Anthony Barclay , Esq. , British Consul at New York for Minesota , that intelligence had been received overland from the expeditions under the command of Lieutenant Pullen and Dr. Rae ; and that they had fulfilled their instructions without finding nny traces of the missing ships . The course which the former was to pursue is known ; but with the extent of Dr. Rae 's explorations we are not yet informed . If he reached Banks ' Land and Cape Walker , it is then almost certain that Franklin did not reach either of these points , but entered some of the openings on the northern side of Barrow 's Strait , probably Wellington Channel : This opinion we have entertained from the beginning , inasmuch as it presented more flattering prospects for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this direction he has not yet been sought , an ditis to be hoped that the expeditions now fitting out will send exploring parties into every opening north of Barrow 's Strait .
