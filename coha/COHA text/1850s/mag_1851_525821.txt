ATLANTIC MONTHLY : A MA *AZINE OF LITERATUBJIJ , SCIENCE , ART , AND POLITICS . VOL . XXXVIIJ. - NOVEMBER , 1876. - No . CCXXIX . THE ASCENT OF TAKHOMA . WHEN Vancouver , in 1 792 , penetrated the Straits of Fuca and explored the unknown waters of the Mediterranean of the- Pacific , wherever he sailed , from the Gulf of Georgia to the farthest inlet of Puget Sound , he beheld the lofty , snow-clad barrier range of the Cascades stretching north and south and bounding the eastern horizon . Towering at twice the altitude of all others , at intervals of a hundred miles there loomed up above the range three majestic , snowy peaks that " Like giants stand To sentinel enchanted land . " In the matter-of-fact spirit of a British sailor of his time , he named these sublime monuments of nature in honor of three lords of the English admiralty , Hood , Rainier , and Baker . Of these Rainier is the central , situated about half-way between the Columbia River and the line of British Columbia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 14,444 feet , while Hood is 11,025 feet , and Baker is 10,810 feet high . The others , too , are single cones , while Rainier , or Takhoma , 1 is an immense mountain-mass with three distinct peaks , an eastern , a northern , and a southern ; the two last extending out and up from 1 Tak-ho*ma or Ta-ho*ma among the Yakimas , Kliekitats , Puyallups , Nisquallys , and allied tribes of Indians , is the generic term for mountain , used precisely as we use the word " mount , " as Tak the main central dome , from the summit of which they stand over a mile distant , while they are nearly two miles apart from each other . Takhoma overlooks Puget Sound from Olympia to Victoria , one hundred and sixty miles . Its snow-clad dome is visible from Portland on the Willamette , one hundred and twenty miles south , and from the table-land of Walla Walla , one hundred and fifty miles east . A region two hundred and fifty miles across , including nearly all of Washington Territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is commanded in one field of vision by this colossus among mountains . Takhoma had never been ascended . It was a virgin peak . The superstitious fears and traditions of the Indians , as well as the dangers of the ascent , had prevented their attempting to reach the summit , and the failure of a gallant and energetic officer , whose courage and hardihood were abundantly shown during the rebellion , had in general estimation proved it insurmountable . For two years I had resolved to ascend Takhoma , but both seasons the dense smoke overspreading the whole country had prevented the attempt . Mr. Philomon Beecher Van Trump , humorous , homa Wynatchie , or Mount Wynatchie . But they all designate Rainier simply as Takhoma , or The Mountain , lust as the mountain men used to call it the " Old He " // generous , whole-souled , with endurance and experience withal , for he had roughed it in the mines , and a poetic appreciation of the picturesque and the sublime , was equally eager to scale the summit . Mr. Edward T. Coleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an Alpine tourist , whose reputed experience in Switzerland had raised a high opinion of his ability above the snowline , completed the party . Olympia , the capital of Washington Territory , is a beautiful , maple-embowered town of some two thousand inhabitants , situated at the southernmost extremity of Puget Sound , and west of Takhoma , distant in an air line seventy-five miles . The intervening country is covered with dense fir forests , almost impenetrable to the midday sun , and obstructed with fallen trees , upturned roots and stumps , and a perfect jungle of undergrowth , through which the most energetic traveler can accomplish but ei* , ht or nine miles a day . It was advisable to gain the nearest possible point by some trail , before plunging into the unbroken forest . The Nisqually iRiver , which rises on the southern and western slopes of Takhoma , and empties into the sound a few miles north of Olympia , offered the most direct and natural approach . Ten years before , moreover , a few enterprising settlers had blazed out a trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to its source , thence deflected south to the Cowlitz River , and pursued this stream in a northeastern course to the summit of the range , thus turning the great mountain by a wide circuit . The bestinformed mountain men represented the approaches on the south and southeast as by far the most favorable . The iNisqually-Cowlitz trail , then , seemed much the best , for the Nisqually , heading in the south and southwest slopes , and the Cowlitz , in the southeastern , afforded two lines of approach , by either of which the distance to the mountain , after leaving the trail , could not exceed thirty miles . One August afternoon , Van Trump and I drove out to Yelm Prairie , thirty miles east of Olympia , and on the Nis The Ascent of lialchomct . November , qually River . We dashed rapidly on over a smooth , hard , level road , traversing wide reaches of prairie , passing under open groves of oaks and firs , and plunging through masses of black , dense forest in ever-changing variety . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takhoma , bathed in cold , white , spectral light from summit to base , appeared startlingly near and distinct . Our admiration was not so noisy as usual . Perhaps a little of dread mingled with it . In another hour we drove nearly across the plain and turned into a lane which conducted us up a beautiful rising plateau , crowned with a noble grove of oaks and overlooking the whole prairie . A comfortable , roomy house with a wide porch nestled among the trees , and its hospitable owner , Mr. James Longmire , appeared at the door and bade us enter . The next morning we applied to Mr. Longmire for a guide , and for his advice as to our proposed trip . He was one of the few who marked out the Nisqually-Cowlitz trail years ago . He had explored the mountains about Takhoma as thoroughly , perhaps , as any other white man . One of the earliest settlers , quiet , self-reliant , sensible , and kindly , a better counselor than he could not have been found . The trail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was entirely illegible to eyes not well versed in woodcraft , and it would be folly for any one to attempt to follow it who was not thoroughly acquainted with the country . He could not leave his harvest , and moreover in three weeks he was to cross the mountains for a drove of cattle . His wife , too , quietly discouraged his going . She described his appearance on his return from previous mountain trips , looking as haggard and thin as though he had just risen from a sick-bed . She threw out effective little sketches of toil , discomfort , and hardship incident to mountain travel , and dwelt upon the bard fare . The bountiful country breakfast heaped before us , the rich cream , fresh butter and e0gs , snowy , melting biscuits , and broiled chicken , with rich , white gravy , heightened the effect of her words . // But at length , when it appeared that no one else who knew the trail could be found , Mr. Lougmire yielded to our persuasions , and consented to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procure an Indian guide before leaving us to our own resources . As soon as we returned home we went with Mr. Coleman to his room to see a few indispensable equipments he had provided , in order that we might procure similar ones . The floor was literally covered with his traps , and he exhibited them one by one , expatiating upon their various uses . There was his ground - sheet , a large gum blanket equally serviceable to Mr. Coleman as a tent in camp and a bath-tub at the hotel . There was a stron0 rope to which we were all to be tied when climbing the snow - fields , so that if one fell into a chasm the others could hold him up . The " creepers ' * were a clumsy , heavy arrangement of iron spikes made to fasten on the foot with chains and straps , in order to prevent slipping on the ice . He had an ice-axe for cutting steps , a spiritlamp for making tea on the mountains , green goggles for snow-blindness , deer 's fat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twine , tacks , screws , screwdriver , gimlet , file , several medical prescriptions , two boards for pressing flowers , sketching materials , and in fact every article that Mr. Coleman in his extensive reading had found used or recommended by travelers . Every one of these he regarded as indispensable . The Alpine staff was , he declared , most important of all , a great assistance in traveling through the woods as well as on the ice ; and he illustrated on his hands and knees how to cross a crevasse in the ice on two staffs . This interview naturally brought to mind the characteristic incident related of Packwood , the mountain man who , as hunter and prospecter , had explored the deepest recesses of the Cascades . He had been enga0ed to guide a railroad surveying party across the mountains , and just as the party was about to start he approached the chief and demanded an advance to enable him to buy his outfit for the trip . " How much do you want ? ' * asked the 515 chief , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , about two dollars and a half , " was the reply ; and at the camp-fire that evening , being asked if he had bought his outfit , Packwood , thrusting his hand into his pocket , drew forth and exhibited with perfect seriousness and complacency his entire outfit , - a jack-knife and a plug of tobacco . Half a dozen carriages rattled gayly out of Olympia in the cool of the morning , filled with a laughing , singing , frolicking bevy of young ladies and gentlemen . They were the Takhoina party starting on their adventurous trip , with a chosen escort accompanying them to their first camp . They rested several hours at Longmire 's during the heat of the day , and the drive was then continued seven miles farther , to the Lacamas , an irregular-shaped prairie two miles in length by half a mile in breadth . Here live two of Mr. Longmirc ' s sons . Their farms form the last settlement , and at the gate of Mr. Elkane Longmire 's house the road ends . A wooded knoll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its foot , was selected as the campground . Some of the party stretched a large sail between the trees as a tent , others watered and fed the horses , and others busied themselves with the supper . Two eager sportsmen started after grouse , while their more practical companions bought half a dozen chickens , and had them soon dressed and sputtering over the fire . The shades of night were falling as the party sat down on the ground and partook of a repast fit for the Olympians , and with a relish sharpened by the long journey and a whole day 's fast . Early in the morning Mr. Lougmire arrived in camp with two mules and a pack-horse , and our mountain outfit was rapidly made up into suitable bales and packed upon the horse and one of the mules , the other mule being reserved for Longmire 's own riding . We assembled around the breakfast with spirits as gay and appetites as sharp as ever . Then , with many good-bys and much waving of handkerchiefs , the party broke up . Four The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single file , leading their pack animals , and looking back at every step to catch the last glimpse of the bri*ht garments and fluttering cambrics , while the carriages drove rapidly down the road and disappeared in the dark , sullen forest . We stepped off briskly , following a dim trail in an easterly course , and crossing the little prairie entered the timber . After winding over hilly ground for about three miles , we descended into the Nisqually bottom and forded a fine brook at the foot of the hill . For the next ten miles our route lay across the bottom , and along the bank of the river , passing around logs , following old , dry beds of the river and its lateral sloughs , ankle-deep in loose sand , and forcing our way through dense jungles of vine-maple . The trail was scarcely visible , and much obstructed by fallen trees and underbrush , and its difficulties were aggravated by the bewildering tracks of Indians who had lately wandered about the bottom in search of berries or rushes . We repeatedly missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for the right course . The weather was hot and sultry , and rendered more oppressive by the dense foliage ; myriads of gnats and mosquitoes tormented us and drove our poor animals almost frantic ; and our thirst , aggravated by the severe and unaccustomed toil , seemed quenchless . At length we reached the ford of the Nisqually . Directly opposite , a perpendicular bluff of sand and gravel in alternate strata rose to the height of two hundred and fifty feet , its basc washed by the river and its top crowned with firs . The stream was a hundred yards wide , waist-deep , and very rapid . Its waters were icy cold , and of a milkwhite hue . This color is the characteristic of glacial rivers . The impalpable powder of thousands of tons of solid rocks , ground up beneath the vast weight and resi*tless though imperceptible flow of huge glaciers , remains in solution in these streams , and colors them milkwhite to the sea . Leading the animals down the bank and over a wide , dry bar of cobble - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turbulent river , and prepared to essay its passage . Coleman mounted behind Van Trump on the little saddle-mule , his long legs dangling nearly to the ground , one hand grasping his Alpine staff , the other the neck-rope of the pack-mule , which Longmire bestrode . Longmire led in turn the packhorse , behind whose bulky load was perched the other member of the party . The cavalcade , linked together in this order , had but just entered the stream when Coleman ( Iropped the neck-rope he was holding . The mule , bewildered by the rush and roar of the waters , turned directly down - stream , and in another instant our two pack-animals , with their riders , would have been swept away in the furious rapids , had not Longmire with great presence of mind turned their erratic course in the right direction and safely brought them to the opposit.e shore . Following the bottom along the river for some distance , we climbed up the end of the bluff already mentioned , by a steep zigzag trail , and skirted along its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right rushed the Nisqually . On the left the bluff fell off in a steep hill-side thickly clothed with woods and underbrush , and at its foot plowed the Owhap , a large stream emptying into the Nisqually just below our ford . Another mile through the woods brought us out upon the Mishdl Prairie , a beautiful , oval meadow of a hundred acres , embowered in the tall , dense fir forest , with a grove of lofty , branching oaks at its farther extremity , and covered with green grass and bright flowers . It takes its name from the Mishell River , which empties into the Nisqually a mile above the prairie . We had marched sixteen miles . The packs were gladly thrown off beneath a lofty fir ; the animals were staked out to graze . A spring in the edge of the woods afforded water , and while Mr. Coleman busied himself with his pipe , his flask , his note-book , his sketch-book , and his pouch of multifarious odds and ends , the other members of the party performed the duties incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread the blankets , and prepared supper . The // flags attached to our Alpine staffs waved gayly overhead , and the sight of their bright folds fluttering in the breeze deepened the fixed resolve to plant them on Takhoma 's hoary head , and made failure seem impossible . Mr. Coleman announced the altitude of Mishell Prairie as eight hundred feet by the barometer . By an unlucky fall the thermometer was broken . The march was resumed early next morning . As we passed the lofty oaks at the end of the little prairie , " On that tree , " said Longmire , pointing out one of the noblest , " Maxon 's company hanged two Indians in the war of 56 . Ski-hi and his band , after many depredations upon the settlements , were encamped on the Mishell , a mile distant , in fancied security , when Maxon and his men surprised them and cut off every soul except the two prisoners whom they handed here . " For eight miles the trail led through thick woods , and then , after crossing a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wigwams , where another trail from the Nisqually plains joined ours , it descended a gradual slope , traversed a swampy thicket and another mile of heavy timber , and debouched on the Mishell River . This is a fine , rapid , sparkling stream , knee-deep and forty feet wide , rippling and dashing over a gravelly bed with clear , cold , transparent water . The purity of the clear water , so unlike the yeasty Nisqually , proves that the Mishell is no glacial river . Rising in an outlying range to the northwest of Takhoma , it flows in a southwest course to its confluence with the Nisqually near our previous night 's camp . We unsaddled for the noon-rest . Van Trump went up the stream , fishing ; Longmire crossed to look out the trail ahead , and Coleman made tea solitaire . An hour passed , and Lougmire returned . " The trail is blind , " said he , " and we have no time to lose . " Just then Van Trump returned ; and the little train was soon in readiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stream , telling us to drive the pack-animals after him and follow by a convenient log near by . As the mule attempted to climb a low place in the opposite bank , which offered an apparently easy exit from the river , his hind legs sank in a quicksand , he sat down quickly. , if not gracefully , and , not f aneying that posture , threw himself clear under water . His dripping rider rose to his feet , flung the bridle - rein over his arm , and , springing up the bank at a more practicable point , strode along the trail with as little delay and as perfect unconcern as though an involuntary ducking was of no more moment than climbing over a log . The trail was blind . Longmire scented it through thickets of salal , fern , and underbrush , stumbling over roots , vines , and hollows hidden in the rank vegetation , now climbing huge trunks that the animals could barely scramble over , and now laboriously working his way around some fallen giant and traveling two hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The packs , continually jammed against trees and shaken loose by this rough traveling , required frequent repacking - no small task . At the very top of a high , steep hill , up which we had laboriously zigzagged shortly after crossing the Mishell , the little packhorse , unable to sustain the weight of the pack , which had shifted all to one side , fell and rolled over and over to the bottom . Bringing up the goods and chattels one by one on our own shoulders to the top of the hill , we replaced the load and started again . The course was in a southerly direction , over high rolling ground of good clay soil , heavily timbered , with marshy swales at intervals , to the Nisqually River a0ain , a distance of twelve miles . We encamped on a narrow flat between the high hill just descended and the wide and noisy river , near an old ruined log-hut , the former residence of a once famed Indian medicine man , who , after the laudable custom of his race , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early next morning we continued our laborious march along the right bank of the Nisqually . Towards noon we left the river , and after thridding in an east1816. 511 // erly course a perfect labyrinth of fallen timber for six miles , and forcing our way with much difficulty through the tangled jungle of an extensive vine-maple swamp , at length crossed Silver Creek and gladly threw off the packs for an hour 's rest . A short distance after crossing Silver Creek the trail emerged upon more open ground , and for the first time the Nisqually Valley lay spread out in view before us . On the left stretched a wall of steep , rocky mountains , standing parallel to the course of the river and extending far eastward , *rowing higher and steeper and more rugged as it receded from view . At the very extremity of this range Takhoma loomed aloft , its dome high above all others and its flanks cxtendin* far down into the valley , and all covered , dome and flanks , with snow of dazzling white , in striking contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked to our eyes , accustomed to the restricted views and gloom of the forest . After our noon rest we continued our journey up the valley , twisting in and out among the numerous trunks of trees that encumbered the ground , and after several hours of tedious trudging struck our third camp on Copper Creek , the twin brother to Silver Creek , just at dusk . We were thoroughly tired , having made twenty miles in thirteen hours of hard traveling . Starting at daylight next morning , we walked two miles over rough ground much broken by ravines , and then descended into the bed of the iNisqually at the mouth of Goat Creek , another fine stream which empties here . We continued our course along the river bed , stumbling over roeky bars and forcing our way through dense thickets of willow , for some distance , then ascended the steep bank , went around a high hill over four miles of execrable trail , and descended to the river again , only two miles above Goat Creek . At this point the Takhoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises on the west side of Takhoma , is nearly as large as the main river , and like it shows its glacial origin by its milk-white water and by its icy cold , terribly swift and furious torrent . Crossing the Takhoma branch , here thirty yards wide , we kept up the main river , crossing and recrossing the stream frequently , and toiling over rocky bars for four miles , a distance which consumed five hours , owing to the difficulties of the way . We then left the Nisqually , turning to the right and traveling in a southerly course , and followed up the bed of a swampy creek for half a mile , then crossed a level tract much obstructed with fallen timber , then ascended a burnt ridge , and followed it for two miles to a small , marshy prairie in a wide canyon or defile closed in by rugged mountains on either side , and camped beside a little rivulet on the east side of the prairie . This was Bear Prairie , the altitude of which by the barometer was 2630 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nisqually and Cowlitz rivers , and the little rivulet near which we camped flowed into the latter stream . The whole region had been swept by fire : thousands of giant trunks stood blackened and lifeless , the picture of desolation . As we were reclining on the ground around the camp-fire , enjoying the calm and beatific repose which comes to the toil-worn mountaineer after his hearty supper , one of these huge trunks , after several warning creaks , came toppling and falling directly over our camp . All rushed to one side or another to avoid the impending crash . As one member of the party , hastily catching up in one hand a frying-pan laden with tin plates and cups , and in the other the camp kettle half full of boiling water , was scrambling away , his foot tripped in a blackberry vine and he fell outstretched at full length , the much-prized utensils scattering far and wide , while the fallin* tree came thundering down in the rear , doing no other damage , however , than burying a pair of blankets . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canyon to its junction with the Cowlitz River , in search of a band of Indians who usually made their head-quarters at this point , and among whom Lougmire hoped to find some hunter familiar with the mountains // who might guide us to the . base of Takhoma . The tiny rivulet as we descended soon swelled to a large and furious torrent , and its bed filled nearly the whole bottom of the gorge . The mountains rose on both sides precipitously , and the traces of land-slides which had gouged vast furrows down their sides were frequent . With extreme toil and difficulty we made our way , continually wading the torrent , clambering over broken masses of rock which filled its bed , or clinging to the steep hill-sides , and reached the Cowlitz at length after twelve miles of this fatiguing work , but only to find the Indian camp deserted . Further search , however , was rewarded by the discovery of a rude shelter formed of a few skins thrown over a frame-work of poles , beneath which sat a squaw at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of perhaps four years lay on the ground near the fire in front . Beside the lodge and quietly watching our approach , of which he alone seemed aware , stood a tall , slender Indian clad in buckskin shirt and leggings , with a striped woolen breech-clout , and a singular head garniture which gave him a fierce and martial appearance . This consisted of an old military cap , the visor thickly studded with brass-headed nails , while a large circular brass article , which might have been the top of an oil-lamp , was fastencd upon the crown . Several eagle feathers stuck in the crown and strips of fur sewed upon the sides coinpleted the edifice , which , notwithstanding its components , appeared imposing ratber than ridiculous . A long Hudson Bay gun , the stock also ornamented with brass-headed tacks , lay in the hollow of the Indian 's shoulder . He received us with great friendliness , yet not without dignity , shaking hands and motioning us to a seat beneath the rude shelter , while his squaw hastened to place before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only food . After a moderate indulgence in this delicacy , Loagmire made known our wants . The Indian spoke fluently the Chinook jargon , that high-bred lingo invented by the old fur - traders . He called himself " Sluiskin " and readily agreed to guide us to Rainier , known to him only as Takhoma , and promised to report at Bear Prairie the next day . It was after seven in the evening when we reached camp thoroughly fagged . Punctual to promise , Sluiskin rode up at noon mounted upon a stunted Indian pony , while his squaw and pappooses followed upon another even more puny and forlorn . After devouring an enormous dinner , evidently compensating for the rigors of a long fast , in reply to our inquiries he described the route he proposed to take to Takhoma . Pointing to the almost perpendicular height immediately back or east of our camp , towering three thousand feet or more overhead , the loftiest mountain in sight , " We go to the top of that mountain to-day , " said he , " and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mountains , now up , now down , first on one side and then on the other , a long day 's journey , and at last , descending far down from the mountains into a deep valley , reach the base of Takhoma . " Sluiskin illustrated his Chinook with speaking signs and pantomime . He had frequently hunted the mountain sheep upon the snow-fields of Takhoma , but had never ascended to the summit . It was impossible to do so , and he put aside as idle talk our expressed intention of making the ascent . We had already selected the indispensable articles for a week 's tramp , a blanket apiece , the smallest coffee-pot and frying-pan , a scanty supply of bacon , flour , coffee , etc. , and had made them up into suitable packs of forty pounds each , provided with slings like a knapsack , and had piled together under the lee of a huge fallen trunk our remaining goods . Longmire , who although impatient to return home , where his presence was urgently needed , had watched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now bade us good-by : mounted on one mule and leading the other , he soon disappeared down the trail on his lonely , homeward way . He left us the little pack-horse , thinking it would be quite 1876. 519 // capable of carrying our diminished outfit after our return from Takhoma . Sluiskin led the way . The load upon his shoulders was sustained by a broad band passing over his head , upon which his heavy , brass-studded rifle , clasped in both hands , was poised and balanced . Leaving behind the last vestige of trail , we toiled in single file slowly and laboriously up the mountain all the afternoon . The steepness of the ascent in many places required the use of both hand and foot in climbing , and the exercise of great caution to keep the heavy packs from dragging us over backwards . Coleman lagged behind from the start , and at intervals his voice could be heard hallooing and calling upon us to wait . Towards sunset we reached a level terrace , or bench , near the summit , gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , we supposed , could not be far below . He not appearing , we hallooed again and again . No answer ! We then sent Sluiskin down the mountain to his aid . After an hour 's absence the Indian returned . He had descended , he said , a long distance , and at last caught sight of Coleman . He was near the foot of the mountain , had thrown away his pack , blankets and all , and was evidently returning to camp . And Sluiskin finished his account with expressions of contempt for the " cultus King George man . " What was to be done ? Coleman carried in his pack all our bacon , our only supply of meat , except a few pounds of dried beef . He also had the barometer , the only instrument that had survived the jolts and tumbles of our rough trip . But , on the other hand , he had been a clog upon our march from the outset . He was evidently too infirm to endure the toil before us , and would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Takhoma , but might even impede and frustrate our own efforts . Knowing that he would be safe in camp until our return , we hastily concluded to proceed without him , trusting to our rifles for a supply of meat . Sluiskin led us along the side of the ridge in a southerly direction for two miles farther , to a well-sheltered , grassy hollow in the mountain - top , where he had often previously encamped . It was after dark when we reached this place . The usual spring had gone dry , and , parched with thirst , we searched the gulches of the mountain-side for water an hour , but without success . At length the writer , recalling a scanty nIl which trickled across their path a mile back , taking the coffee-pot and large canteen , retraced his steps , succeeded in filling these utensils after much fumbling in the dark and consequent delay , and returned to camp . He found Van Trump and the Indian , anxious at the long delay , mounted on the crest of the ridge some two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct his steps . The mosquitoes and flies came in clouds , and were terribly annoying . After supper of coffee and bread , we drank up the w4er , rolled ourselves in our blankets , and lay down under a tree with our flags floating from the boughs overhead . Hot as had been the day , the night was cold and frosty , owing , doubtless , to the altitude of our camp . At the earliest dawn next morning we were moving on without breakfast , and parched with thirst . Sluiskin led us in a general course about north-northeast , but twisting to nearly every point of the compass , and climbing up and down thousands of feet from mountain to mountain , yet keeping on the highest backbone bctween the head - waters of the Nisqually and Cowlitz rivers . After several hours of this work we came to a well-sheltered hollow , one side filled with a broad bed of snow , at the foot of which nestled a tiny , tranquil lakelet , and gladly threw off our heavy packs , assuaged our thirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early as it was , the chill of the frosty night still in the air , the mosquitoes renewed their attacks , and proved as innumerable and vexatious as ever . Continuing our march , we crossed many beds of snow , and drank again and again from the icy rills which flowed out of them . The mountains were coyered // with stunted mountain-ash and low , stubby firs with short , bushy branches , and occasionally a few pines . Many slopes were destitute of trees , but covered with luxuriant grass and the greatest profusion of beautiful flowers of vivid hues . This was especially the case with the southern slopes , while the northern sides of the mountains were generally wooded . We repeatedly ate berries , and an hour afterwards ascended to where berries of the same kind were found scarcely yet formed . The country was much obscured with smoke from heavy fires which had been raging on the Cowlitz the last two days . But when at length , after climbing for hours an almost perpendicular peak , - creeping on hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass where a single slip would have sent us rolling a thousand feet down to destruction , - we reached the highest crest and looked over , we exclaimed that we were already well repaid for all our toil . Nothing can convey an idea of the grandeur and ruggedness of the mountains . Directly in front , and apparently not over two miles distant , although really twenty , old Takhoma loomed up more gigantic than ever . We were far above the level of the lower snow-line on Takhoma . The bi*h peak upon which we clung seemed the central core or focus of all the mountains around , and on every side we looked down vertically thousands of feet , deep down into vast , terrible defiles , black and fir - clothed , which stretched away until lost in the distance and smoke . Between them , separating one from another , the mountain-walls rose precipitously and terminated in bare , columnar peaks of black basaltic or volcanic rock , as sharp as needles . It seemed incredible that any human foot could have followed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . After a few hours more of this climbing , we stood upon the summit of the last mountain - ridge that separated us from Takhoma . We were in a saddle of the ridge ; a lofty peak rose on either side . Below us extended a long , steep hollow or gulch filled with snow , the farther extremity of which seemed to drop off perpendicularly into a deep valley or basin . Across this valley , directly in front , filling up the whole horizon and view with an indescribable aspect of magnitude and grandeur , stood the old leviathan of mountains . The broad , snowy dome rose far among and above the clouds . The sides fell off in vertical steeps and fearful black walls of rock for a third of its altitude ; lower down , vast , broad , gently sloping snow-fields surrounded the mountain , and were broken here and there by ledges or masses of the dark basaltic rock protruding above them . Long , green ridges projected from this snow-belt at intervals , radiating from the mountain and extending many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay between these ridges . Each at its upper end formed the bed of a glacier , which closed and filled it up with solid ice . Below the snow-line bright green grass with countless flowers , whose vivid scarlet , blue , and purple formed bodies of color in the distance , clothed the whole region of ridges and valleys , for a breadth of five miles . The beautiful balsam firs , about thirty feet in height , and of a purple , dark - green color , stood scattered over the landscape , now singly , now in groves , and now in long lines , as though planted in some well-kept park . Farther down an unbroken fir forest surrounded the mountain and clad the lower portions of the ridges and valleys . In every sheltered depression or hollow lay beds of snow with tiny brooks and rivulets flowing from them . The glaciers terminated not gradually , but abruptly , with a wall of ice from one to five hundred feet high , from beneath which yeasty torrents burst forth and rushed roaring and tumbling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our left front , could be seen plunging over two considerable falls , half hidden in the forest , while the roar of waters was distinctly audible . At length we cautiously descended the snow-bed , and , climbing at least fifteen hundred feet down a steep but ancient land-slide by means of the bushes growing among the loose rocks , reached the 1876. 521 // valley , and encountered a beautiful , peaceful , limpid creek . Van Trump could not resist the temptation of unpacking his bundle , selectin* one of his carefully preserved flies , and trying the stream for trout , but without a single rise . After an hour 's rest and a hearty repast we resumed our packs , despite Sluiskin 's protests , who seemed tired out with his arduous day 's toil and pleaded hard against traveling farther . Crossing the stream , we walked through several grassy glades , or meadows , alternating with open woods . We soon came to the foot of one of the long ridges already described , and ascending it followed it for several miles through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flowery meads which clothe these upper regions . Halting upon a rising eminence in our course , and looking back , we beheld the ridge of mountains we had just descended stretching from east to west in a steep , rocky wall ; a little to the left , a beautiful lake , evidently the source of the stream just crossed , which we called Clear Creek , and glimpses of which could be seen among the trees as it flowed away to the right , down a rapidly descending valley along the foot of the lofty mountainwall . Beyond the lake again , still farther to the left , the land also subsided quickly . It was at once evident that the lake was upon a summit , or divide , between the waters of the Kisqually and Cowlitz rivers . The ridge which we were ascending lay north and south , and led directly up to the mountain . We camped , as the twilight fell upon us , in an aromatic grove of balsam firs . A grouse , the fruit of Sluiskin 's rifle , broiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dry bread and coffee . After supper we reclined upon our blankets in front of the bright , blazing fire , well satisfied . The Indian , when starting from Bear Prairie , had evidently deemed our intention of ascending Takhoma too absurd to deserve notice . The turning back of Mr. Coleman only deepened his contempt for our prowess . But his views had undergone a change with the day 's march . The November , affair began to look serious to him , and now in Chinook , interspersed with a few words of broken English and many signs and gesticulations , he began a solemn exhortation and warning against our rash project . Takhoma , he said , was an enchanted mountain , inhabited by an evil spirit , who dwelt in a fiery lake on its summit . No human being could ascend it or even attempt its ascent , and survive . At first , indeed , the way was easy . The broad snow-fields , over which he had so often hunted the mountain goat , interposed no obstacle , but above them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of loose , rolling rocks , which would turn beneath his feet and cast him headlong into the deep abyss below . The upper snow - slopes , too , were so steep that not even a goat , far less a man , could get over them . And he would have to pass below lofty walls and precipices whence avalanches of snow and vast masses of rock were continually falling ; and these would inevitably bury the intruder beneath their ruins . Moreover , a furious tempest continually swept the crown of the mountain , and the luckless adventurer , even if he wonderfully escaped the perils below , would be torn from the mountain and whirled through the air by this fearful blast . And the awful being upon the summit , who would surely punish the sacrilegious attempt to invade his sanctuary , - who could hope to escape his vengeance ? Many years ago , he continued , his grandfather , a great chief and warrior , and a mighty hunter , had ascended part way up the mountain , and had encountered some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape destruction ; and no other Indian had ever gone so far . Finding that his words did not produce the desired effect , he assured us that , if we persisted in attempting the ascent , he would wait three days for our return , and would thea proceed to Olympia and inform our friends of our death ; and he begged us to give him a paper ( a written note ) to take to them , so that they might believe his story . The Ascent of Takhoma. // Sluiskin 's manner during this harangue was earnest in the extreme , and he was undoubtedly sincere in his forebodings . After we had retired to rest , he kept up a most dismal chant , or dirge , until late in the night . The dim , white , spectral mass towering so near , the roar of the torrents below us , and the occasional thunder of avalanches , several of which fell during the night , added to the weird effect of Sluiskin 's song . The next morning we moved two miles farther up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite within the limit of perpetual snow . Thence , with snow-spikes upon our feet and Alpine staff in hand , we went up the snow-fields to reconnoitre the best line of ascent . We spent four hours , walking fast , in reaching the foot of the steep , abrupt part of the mountain . After carefully scanning the southern approaches , we decided to ascend on the morrow by a steep , rocky ridge that seemed to lead up to the snowy crown . Our camp was pitched on a high knoll crowned by a grove of balsam firs , near a turbulent glacial torrent . About nine o'clock , after we had lain down for the night , the firs round our camp took fire and suddenly burst out in a vivid conflagration . The night was dark and windy , and the scene - the vast , dim outlines of Takhoma , the white snowfields , the roaring torrent , the crackling blaze of the burning trees - was strikingly wild and picturesque . In honor of our guide we named the cascade at our feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the mass of ice whence it derives its source we styled the Little INisqually Glacier . Before daylight the next morning , Wednesday , August 17 , 1870 , we were up and had breakfasted , and at six o clock we started to ascend Takhoma . Besides our Alpine staffs and creepers , we carried a long rope , an ice - axe , a brass plate inscribed with our names , our flags , a large canteen , and some luncheon . We were also provided with gloves , and green goggles for snow - blindness , but found no occasion to use the latter . Having suffered much from the heat of the sun since leaving Bear Prairie , and being satisfied from our late reconnoissance that we could reach the summit and return on the same day , we left behind our coats and blankets . In three hours of fast walking we reached the highest point of the preceding day 's trip , and commenced the ascent by the steep , rocky ridge already described as reaching up to the snowy dome . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular backbone , composed of a crumbling basaltic conglomerate , the top only , or backbone , being solid rock , while the sides were composed of loose broken rocks and debris . Up this ridge , keeping upon the spine when possible , and sometimes forced to pick our way over the loose and broken rocks at the sides , around columnar masses which we could not directly climb over , we toiled for five hundred yards , ascending at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees . Here the ridge connected , by a narrow neck or saddle , with a vast square rock , whose huge and distinct outline can be clearly perceived from a distance of twenty-five miles . This , like the ridge , is a conglomerate of basalt and trap , in well - defined strata , and is rapidly disintegrating and continually falling in showers and even masses of rocks and rubbish , under the action of frost by night and melting snow by day . It lies imbedded in the side of the mountain , with one side and end projected and overhanging deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or junction of these two faces that the ridge joined it at a point about a thousand feet below its top . On the southern face the strata were inclined at an angle of thirty degrees . Crossing by the saddle from the ridge , despite a stron0 wind which swept across it , we gained a narrow ledge formed by a stratum more solid than its fellows , and creeping along it , hugging close to the main rock on our right , laboriously and cautiously continued the ascent . The wind was blowing violently . We were now crawling along the face of the precipice almost in mid-air . On the right the rock towered far above us 1876. 523 // perpendicularly . On the left it fell sheer off , two thousand feet , into a vast abyss . A great glacier filled its bed and stretched away for several miles , all seamed or wrinkled across with countless crevasses . We crept up and along a ledge , not of solid , sure rock , but one obstructed with the loose stones and d6-bris which were continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of a steep slope of this rubbish , sending the stones at every step rolling and bounding into the depth below . Several times during our progress showers of rocks fell from the precipice above across our path , and rolled into the abyss , but fortunately none struck us . Four hundred yards of this progress brought us to where the rock joined the overhanging edge of the vast ne 've ' or snow-field that descended from the dome of the mountain and was from time to time , as pressed forward and downward , breaking off in immense masses , which fell with a noise as of thunder into the great canyon on our left . The junction of rock and ice afforded our only line of ascent . It was an almost perpendicular gutter , but here our ice - axe came into play , and by cutting steps in the ice and availing ourselves of every crevice or projecting point of the rock , we slowly worked our way up two hundred yards higher . Falling stones were continually coming down , both from the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it melted and relaxed its hold upon them . Mr. Van Trump was hit by a small one , and another struck his staff from his hands . Abandoning the rock , then , at the earliest practicable point , we ascended directly up the ice , cutting steps for a short distance , until we reached ice so corrugated , or drawn up in sharp pinnacles , as to afford a foothold . These folds or pinnacles were about two or three feet high , and half as thick , and stood close together . It was like a very violent chop sea , only the waves were sbarper . Up this safe footing we climbed rapidly , ' the side of the mountain becoming less and less steep , and the ice waves smaller and more regular , and , after ascending about three The Ascent of Talc homa . November , hundred yards , stood fairly upon the broad dome of mighty Takhoma . It rose before us like a broad , gently swelling headland of dazzling white , topped with black , where the rocky summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we continued our course . The snow was hard and firm under foot , crisp and light for an inch or two , but solidified into ice a foot or less beneath the surface . The whole field was covered with the ice-waves already described , and intersected by a number of crevasses which we crossed at narrow places without difficulty . About half-way up the slope , we encountered one from eight to twenty feet wide and of profound depth . The most beautiful vivid emerald-green color seemed to fill the abyss , tbe reflection of the bright sunlight from side to side of its pure ice walls . The upper side or wall of the crevasses was some twelve feet above the lower , and in places overhung it , as though the snow-field on the lower side had bodily settled down a dozen feet . Throwing a bight of the rope around a projecting pinnacle on the upper side , we climbed up , hand over hand , and thus effected a crossing . We were now obliged to travel slowly , with frequent rests . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our breath would be gone , our muscles grew tired and strained , and we experienced all the sensations of extreme fatigue . An instant 's pause , however , was sufficient to recover strength and breath , and we would start again . The wind , which we had not felt while climbing the steepest part of the mountain , now again blew furiously , and we began to suffer from the cold . Our course , - directed still diagonally towards the left , thus shunning the severe exertion of climbing straight up the dome , although at an ordinary altitude the slope would be deemed easy , brought us first to the southwest peak . This is a long , exceedingly sharp , narrow ridge , springing out from the main dome for a mile into midair . The ridge affords not over ten or twelve feet of foothold on top , and the sides descend almost vertically . On the // 1876. right side the snow lay firm and smooth for a few feet on top , and then descended in a steep , unbroken sheet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basin which lies on the west side of the mountain between the southern and northern peaks , and which is inclosed by them as by two mighty arms . The snow on the top and left crest of the ridge was broken into high , sharp pinnacles , with cracks and fissures extending to the rocks a few feet below . The left side , too steep for the snow to lie on , was vertical , bare rock . The wind blew so violently that we were obliged to brace ourselves with our Alpine staffs and use great caution to guard against being swept off the ridge . We tbrew ourselves behind the pinnacles or into the cracks every seventy steps , for rest and shelter against the bitter , pierein* wind . Hastening forward in this way along the dizzy , narrow , and precarious ridge , we reached at length the highest point . Sheltered behind a pinnacle of ice we rested a moment , took out our flags and fastened them upon the Alpine staffs , and then , standing erect in the furious blast , waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment upon that narrow summit , bracing ourselves against the tempest to view the prospect . The whole country was shrouded in a dense sea of smoke , above which the mountain towered two thousand feet in the clear , cloudless ether . A solitary peak far to the southeast , doubtless Mount Adams , and one or two others in the extreme northern horizon , alone protruded above the pall . On every side of the mountain were deep gorges falling off precipitously thousands of feet , and from these the thunderous sound of avalanches would rise occasionally . Far below were the wide-extended glaciers already described . The wind was now a perfect tempest , and bitterly cold ; smoke and mist were flying about the base of the mountain , half hiding , half revealing its gigantic outlines ; and the whole scene was sublimely awful . It was now five i ' . ivy . We had spent eleven hours of unremitted toil in mak ing the ascent , and , thoroughly fatigued , and chilled by the cold , bitter gale , we saw ourselves obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , except our meagre lunch . It would have been impossible to descend the mountain before nightfall , and sure destruction to attempt it in darkness . We concluded to return to a mass of rocks not far below , and there pass the night as best we could , burrowing in the loose dThris . The middle peak of the mountain , however , was evidently the highest , and we determined to first visit it . Retracing our steps along the narrow crest of Peak Success , as we named the scene of our triumph , we crossed an intervening depression in the dome , and ascended the middle peak , about a mile distant and two hundred feet higher than Peak Success . Climbing over a rocky ridge which crowns the summit , we found ourselves within a circular crater two hundred yards in diameter , filled with a solid bed of snow , and inclosed with a rim of rocks projecting above the snow all around . As we were crossing the crater on the snow , Van Trump detected the odor of sulphur , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed issuing from the crevices of the rocks which formed the rim on the northern side . Never was a discovery more welcome ! Hastening forward , we both exclaimed , as we warmed our chilled and henumbed extremities over one of Pluto 's fires , that here we would pass the night , secure against freezing to death , at least . These jets were from the size of that of a large steampipe to a faint , scarcely perceptible emission , and issued all alone the rim among the loose rocks on the northern side for more than half the circumference of the crater . At intervals they would puff up more strongly , and the smoke would collect in a cloud until blown aside and scattered by the wind , and then their force would abate for a time . A deep cavern , extending into and under the ice , and formed by the action of heat , was found . Its roof was a // @ @ @ @ @ @ @               @ @ @ @ @ @
