POLiTICAL PORTRAITS WITH PEN AND PENCIL . MAJOR GENERAL JOHN E. WOOLS UNITED STATES ARMY . A PROMINENT feature of American character is the wonderful facility with which the man embraces the opportunity , the instinctiveness with which genius avails it*elf of an opening for its development , and the rare energy with which it displays itself amidst the most discouraging circumstances . Never was a nation more affluent in men of genius , and never were institutions more admirably adapted to their scope . In every practical department of life , the highest intellect has been found equal to the most trying exigencies . Hence it is , that whether upon the land , or on the ocean , in the machinery of industry , of legislation , of defence , or of conquest , in every branch of practical science , America has taken the lead , and offered the world examples of the greatest excellence . In the rapid advance of the civilized world during the last half century towards the amelioration of the condition of the human race , some self-taught Amencan intellect has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the recent campaigns in Mexico have shown the world how even the horrors of war may be softened , and desolation of conquest converted into blessings , by the military skill and administrative genius of American commanders . In this view , the Mexican campaign of General John E. Wool will stand out in history as a model campaign . General Wool is emphatically a self-made man . Every step of his promotion has been gained by substantial services , and nothing by favor . Feebly supported by professing and lukewarm friends , and opposed by calumniators and enemies , he has forced his way without faltering over the roughest paths of life , with a firm step and a stout heart ; and , without being trumpeted into a transient notoriety , has cut his path to glory with his own sword . Although he has been his own schoolmaster , yet it must not be understood that he disdains to swell the volume of his knowledge from the humblest as well as the highest sources . Without other military education than the instincts of his own genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our military history , and , almost by his single arm , turned the tide of conquest , raised our drooping banner from the dust , reanimated the troops , and revived the hopes of the nation ; subsequently , for twenty-five years , he was , as inspector general , the " backbone " of our military system . He kept up the efficiency of our little force , and , when the army of occupation was trembling on the brink of destruction , his incredible energies prepared , in six weeks , the material of succor and of conquest , and then pressed forward at the head of a column , nine hundred miles into the heart of an enemy 's country , without spilling one drop of blood ; yet converting enemy 's into friends by protecting them , not only from the rapacity of his own troops , but from the inroads of savages ; acting the part of leader , conqueror , pacificator , protector , administrator , and dispenser of justice ; and leaving on his path peace , security and plenty , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his can*paign by the display of a combative genius and a fiercer energy in conflict , for which the considerate kindness of his march had prepared neither friends nor foes . // The ancestors of General Wool emigrated early to New-York , and , at once , became devoted to the interests of their adopted country . James Wool , the grandfather of the Major-General , a respectabl* farmer , lived on his own farm in Schaghticoke , in the county of Rensselaer ; and when the Revolutionary War commenced , was almost on the frontier , and exposed to the incursions , not only of the Indians and the British from Canada , but to the depredations of the Tories , with which the country abounded , and whose feelings were much embittered against the patriots , to whose principles he was enthusiastically attached . Under such circumstances , he frequently carried arms into the fields which he0cultivated . Of the sons of James Wool , five bore arms in the war of the Revolution . Two were made prisoners at the capture of Fort Washington , and underwent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his sufferings , and the other barely escaped with his life . Another was a Ca tam in Lamb 's Regiment of Artillery , and went with Montgomery in his expedition to Quebec . Afterwards he was under the command of Washington in New-Jersey ; and in one of the battles in that state he was so severely wounded , that for a long time he was unable to do duty . Another  --  the father of Major-General Wool , was with Gen. Wayne in the storming of Stony Point . Another was with Stark at the battle of Bennington , and another of the name , a great uncle , was one of the Committee of Safety in the city of New-York in the early part of the Revolution , and afterwards an Alderman of that city . General Wool was born at Newburgh , Orange county , and had barely completed the fourth year of his age , when his father died . He was then taken into the family of his grandfather . During his residence with him , he attended a common country school . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he entered the store of a merchant in Troy , with whom he continued till he was 18 , when he was induced to take charge of a book and stationary store , with the privilege of selling merchandise on his own account . He thus continued until his hopes were blasted by fire , when he entered upon the study of the law , at the office of John Russell , an eminent lawyer in Troy , and pursued with great assiduity the study of the law for more than one year . At this period there were strong indications of a war with Great Britain , and Congress authorized an additional force of 25,000 men . The expectation of war induced Wool to seek an appointment in the army , when , on the recommendation of Governor Clinton and others , he was , in the spring of 1812 , just before the declaration of war , appointed a Captain in the 13th Regiment U. S. Infantry . He immediately entered upon the duties of his office , and after recruiting his company , joined his regiment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment was ordered to the Niagara frontier . On the arrival of the regiment at Onondaga , five companies , under the command of Lieut . Col. Christie , were detached and ordered to Niagara by way of Lake Ontario . The success of the allied armies in Europe against the immortal French emperor had iniparted a color of invincibility to British arms , and there were not wanting the usual base tools of tyranny operating through the pulpit , prostituted as on recent oc'casions , to the schemes of English intriguers , to lend effec*t to that delusion , and to attempt , by internal strife , to prostrate the country at the feet of England . An unfortunate series of even*ts* had aided to discourage the people and to dishonor the flag . The // Political Portraits with Pen and Pencil . 437 declaration of war found the country unprepared for defence , with a large party in the country in the British interests ; nevertheless , the war commenced , and the honor of opening the campaign was conferred upon General William Hull , upon whose unfortunate proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , that the nation 's character was degraded , and a strong effort was necessary to retrieve its honor . It was at this moment that General Stephen Van Rensselaer determined to cross the Niagara River , storm Fort George , and carry the heIghts of Queenstown . The time fixed for the latter operation was October 13th , 1812 . The American general Van Rensselaer had under his command at different points , about 5,800 troops  --  the British general , Brock , about 2,800 ; the head-quarters of the latter being at Fort George . On the morning of the 13th , about 3 oclock , a detachment of 600 moved to Lewiston under Lieut . Colonels Chrystie and Van Rensselaer , but instead of finding boats for the whole detachment , there were only boats for one-half . The companies of Captains Wool , Malcolm and Armstrong were ordered to cross in one party , while Col. Van Rensselaer followed with another . As Captain Wool , the senior officer of the companies of the 13th regiment , landed , the British retreated . Meantime the colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed . Col. Van Rensselaer soon sent orders to Capt . Wool to advance on the heights and halt at their base , which movement was made . Whilst thus in line , waiting further orders , the 13th was severely attacked on its right flank , by a British party from the village of Queenstown , or from that direction . Captain Wool , without waiting orders from Van Rensselaer , ordered the 13th to the right fronting the enemy , who were finally repulsed and driven towards Qucenstown ; but not until they had inflicted a severe loss on the Americans . Of the 13th Infantry , Lieutenants Valleau and Morris , with a due proportion of non-commissioned officers and privates , were killed , and Captain Wool was shot through both thighs ; Malcolm and Armstrong , and Lieutenant Lent , were badly wounded . Of the ten officers of the 13th in this action , only four escaped injury . Colonel Van Rensselaer having been severely wounded , and Chrystie not having crossed , an order was given to descend to the beach . Here the colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , when Captain Wool , notwithstanding his wounds , volunteered to storm the heights . Van Rensselaer was unwilling to commit an enterprise so hazardous and important to the direction of so young an officer , who , until that morning , had experienced no actual service ; yet , coerced by the necessity of the circumstances , his scrupes gave way , and Wool received his orders . Being gallantly seconded by his officers , Wool commenced the ascent . Captain Wool , under the high excitement of martial enthusiasm , was insensible to physical suffering , or the pain of his wounds , and effected the ascent , apparently with as little difficulty as others . The soldiers , supporting themselves by their muskets , finally gained the eminence in rear of the battery , and this daring enterprise was crowned with complete success . A detachment of the 49th British regiment , which defended the battery , was driven down the heights , and the Americans took possession , and , at sunrise , the flag of their country , surmounting the works , proclaimed the triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Fort George , gathered a large force , attacked Captain Wool 's gallant band with such impetuosity as to force them to the brow of the cliff . This was a trying // moment . Before them were the British veterans , to meet whom was a fearful odds-behind them was an almost perpendicular clifl to be forced down which was sure destruction ; and it is not strange that some hearts faltered . A dastard hand raised the white flag in token of surrender , but Captain Wool tore down this flag , made a manly appeal to his men , checked the panic , caused his little band again to become the assailants , and drove the British veterans down the heights . But General Brock rallied his troops anew , and again advanced upon the Americans . In doing this , however , he fell dead from his horse , when his men flew in every direction , leaving ten prisoners behind on the field . Thus , after three bloody fights , this bold and daring enterprise was achieved by two hundred and forty men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Wool formed his men on the heights , and was soon joined by other detachments . This was about ten o'clock . About two o'clock Lieutenant Colonel Scott-now General Scott  --  and others appeared , and took the command , while , after General Van Rensselaer arrived , Captain Wool was ordered from the field , his wounds dressed , and he returned to Lewiston . These deeds were done by a young American officer , in battle for the first time , whose blood. , during all these fights , was streaming from two wounds . It was no ordinary duty that devolved on him . In his first engagement he was surrounded with the direst peiils of war , and saw it in its most terrific aspect . us bark was launched on the " sea of glory , " when the storms were raging over its waters . Under such circumstances , not only the highest qualities of the soldier , but the nerve and energy , and martial enthusiasm of a hero , were indispensable to success . The American arms were saved from disgrace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one man ; and a moral example was given , which , like that of Bunker Hill , imparted its invigorating influence to all the subsequent transactions of the war . The light which spread its radiance over the plains of Niagara and New-Orleans , first dawned on the heights of Qucenstown . Official letters and the public journals abound with encomiums , on the gallantry of Captain Wool and his brave comrades . The National Intelligencer ( 1812 ) says : " Captain Wool , the hero of the heights of Queenstown , is twenty-three years of age . It is presumed he will be breveted or promoted . " This promotion immediately followed , for Captain Wool was made major . Lie continued in the army on the northern frontier and in the 29th regiment of foot , volunteering his services wherever there was danger to be met or duty to be performed . More especially did Major Wool distinguish himself by his usual coolness and intrepidity in the battle of Plattsburgh , in 1814 , from the 6th to the 11th of September . The action at Beekmantown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hero . General Macomb , while he was entrenching on the Saranac , ordered Major Wool to support the militia ; and with 250 regular troops and the militia under Col. Miller , he kept the whole British column of 4000 at bay-fighting them inch by inch , and killing or wounding nearly two hundred of the enemy . General Macomb ( Sept. 15 , 1814 ) mentioned Major Wool 's services , and recommended him to the particular notice of the government . General Mooers ' general orders of Sept. 13 , 1814-commander of the militia-were also full as to " the cool , intrepid and admirable // skill and good order displayed " by the regulars " under that excellent officer , Major Wool . " For his bravery on this occasion , Major Wool was breveted lieutenantcolonel . Well did General Viele say to General Wool , in an address made to him in 1848 : " The bloody Saranac will never cease to murmur your praise ; " and Governor Young , of New-York , in presenting him ( 1848 ) with a sword , remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Wool at Queenstown , marking his course with his own blood , and Major Wool , at Plattsburgh and at Beekmantown gallantly resisting , with 250 men , the whole British line , embracing 4000 regular troops . " It was such noble gallantry that redeemed the stain that had been fixed on our national character , and gave such joy to the patriotic part of the nation . The government at Washington felt the importance of such an officer as Colonel Wool , and in 1816 he was made Inspector General , he having selected that from three appointments offered him , because it offered the greatest scope for usefulness . In 1821 the iffice was enlarged from inspector of division to inspector-general of the army . It was this long experience and indefatigable attention to business concentrated in General Wool , which made him the soul of the Mexican war , and produced those marvellous results from a volunteer force which have so astonished the world . It has been said in regard to our navy , that a more rigid discipline is necessary on shipboard , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us no rank on shore . That is to say , while in England the officer comes from a family which occupies a social position on shore far above that of the seaman , the habitual respect of the latter comes in aid of discipline . In the United States , nothing of the kind exists , but the social position of the subaltern officer on shore may be higher than that of his superior . So also in the army , a higher degree of discipline is necessary to sustain its efficiency for many reasons . This is peculiarly the case with the eastern division . It is distributed in small coruniands on a seacoast and inland frontier to the extent of thousands of miles ; consequently , the troops being withdrawn from the im. mediate supervision of the chief commanders , require the greatest vigilance and attention to prevent them from relaxing in to idleness and dissipation . In order to remedy this in some degree , the government arranged the districts into departments ; and giving to each a responsible commander , all their commands were subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of these duties , he was required to visit every post , ascertain the exact condition of every company , its state of efficiency and discipline , and to examine into the causes of deficiency , whether physical or moral , estimate the capacity , habits and attention of each officer , and keep the government constantly informed of the means of improvement . It may be interesting to some of our military readers to glance at the nature of the reports rendered to the government at Washington , commencing in 1816. and running through a quarter of a century : ARTIOLF 1. - coups or ARTILLERY . " No arm of the service is of more importance to this country , in peace or war , than the corps of artillery ; and none requires so much the attention of Government . The very nature of its service contemplates essentially , all that relates to the science and practice of war , including the duties of the engineer , the // ordnance and the infantry officer , which connect it with the mechanic arts , as well as the materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its occupation of the important posts on the seaboard , ought , at least , to make it the most perfect , if not the most efficient corps of the army . It is , however , to be greatly regretted , that the officers of this corps have not applied themselves more attentively to the study of this extensive branch of service . While many have been perfectly satisfied at an inspection with the exhibition of a good police , a knowledge of artillery drill , and the performance of a few infantry evolutions ; the high duties of artillery , the due care and preservation of public property , and economy in the expenditure of the public money , have not appeared of sufficient importance to attract their serious notice . " DISCIPLINE OF BATTALIONS . " First Battalion , commanded by Brevet CoL , composed of Capt. - , - , and - , Companies . The first , Capt . - , stationed at - was in good order ; and the public property at that post , as far as practicable , in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The commandant , Capt. - , has neither capacity nor industry sufficient to make a good artillerist ; consequently , I have no hopes of his excelling as an officer , or of seeing his company in high order . " The third , Capt . - , was , as usual , in a condition wholly inadmissible , a stranger to discipline , without system , order , or regularity . As Capt . - is under arrest , I deem it a measure of prudence to spare him for the present . " The fourth excels in personal appearance , but deficient in7a knowledge of artillery duty , and is perfect neither in police nor infantry drills . " The companies of this battalion , collectively considered , can claim no merit or praise ; on the contrary , most of them being deficient in most of their duties , deserve censure . " Throughout the whole army , embracing military academy , infantry , light infantry , artillery , cavalry , &amp;c. , the inspection of corps was carried to a great degree of minuteness . These inspections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the means of preserving it ; while the expenditures of the government are ever carefully watched . " The application of oil and paint to guns and carriages not in use , are not required oftener than once in two or three years , if properly applied in the first instance . At Charieston I examined a number of dismounted guns which had been cleaned and painted more than two years since , and although exposed during that period to the weather , they appeared as if only put in order a few days before . If all the guns on the seaboard , excepting three or four at each port , were dismounted , cleaned , and preserved in the same way , it would undoubtedly save the nation considerable expense . " A constant supervision is exercised over collateral influences upon the moral condition of the men , growing out of suttling , desertion , proximity to cities , &amp;c. ; also in relation to " commandants of departments , " " quarter-master generals , " " commissary-generals of provisions , " and " hospital department . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should pay its old debt , an inspection was ordered of all the coast defences from Maine to the delta of the Mississippi ; and the report of General Wool on that occasion develops a military and business capacity , together with a statesmanlike view of the necessities of the country , which is seldom or ever encountered in official reports . In 1830 , he made a report on the expedie*icy of erecting fortifications on the northern frontier . This he discouraged as a useless expenditure , showing that modern science has ren // dered fortified posts useless between contiguous nations . His report on the western defences , with reference to the economy of the cavalry service , and the best mode of supplying it with horses , contains a volume of information . The reports upon the Florida war are models of military criticism . The reports made from time to time to the government by General Wool , are not only so exceedingly clear and correct in style as to attract the general reader , but they are fraught with the most profound and statesmanlike views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacity in estimating the consequences . The report on the reduction of the army in 1830 , is a model report . It was drawn up during those years of European revolution , which marked the accession of Louis Philip to the throne of France . We regret that we can not give it room ; but we can not pass over one or two passages which are directly applicable to our present state of affairs : " It must be obvious to all who reflect upon the subject , that the condition of nations must be that of alternate peace and war . It therefore follows as a selfevident truth , that a long continuance of peace indicates the nearer approach of war ; and , instead of relaxing the efforts to sustain an efficient military organization , they ought to be increased in a ratio corresponding with the length of the peace . The period when a military organization could be relinquished with the least danger to the national safety , is immediately after the termination of a war . This is submitted as a general proposition . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I conceive , a strong additional argument for keeping our military organization as perfect as possible , and for increasing , rather than diminishing , our military force . Our peaceable relations with the nations of Europe are always endangered , whenever those nations are belligerent , and the United States neutraL It is then that little regard is paid to the neutral flag , and neutral commerce is constantly subjected to vexatious interruptions , and serious depredations . The flag is insulted ; our citizens on the high seas are exposed , not only to the loss of property , but to personal indignities , and the violation of personal liberty ; and the marauder of the ocean , to justify his outrages , points to the belligerent flag of his nation . Such wrongs and indignities , as a nation , we have encountered , and to such , in all probability , we shall again be exposed . " It is impossible to foresee all the consequences which may follow the revolution in Europe . One thing , however is certain ,  --  the chances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , at such a period , deprive themselves of any part of their existing means of defence . " Again , in 1842 , when in the midst of the dispute with England , there was discussion about the reduction of the army , the pen of General Wool on many occasions was powerfully and effectually exerted on the side of patriotism . In 1832 , the government dispatched General Wool to Europe for purposes of information connected with military science , tactics , and improvement generally . He was selected for this mission as having the right qualifications for the office . He sailed in the Charlemagne the last of June , 1832 . He arrived in September , and was kindly received by the then " citizen King . " TIe was one of his Majesty 's suite at a grand revinw of 70,000 men , and 100 pieces of artillery . The minister of war con. ferred upon him power to visit all the military establishments of France ; and directions were everywhere given to receive him with the most marked civilities . General Wool dined repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that prince , had he comprehended the republi // can hints he then received . But the loyal egotist replied , " De French peoples have now de very best government what they can have . " The then famous avowal of Jackson , " to ask for nothing that is not clearly right , and to submit to nothing that is wrong , " was unmistakably personified in Wool . In November of the same year , Wool was the guest of the King of Belgium , and with him reviewed 100,000 troops , and the famous fortifications of Antwerp . He was also present under the siege of that city , under Chasse . In 1836 , General Wool was ordered to the Cherokee country to remove the Indians to Arkansas . This duty he performed in a manner every way satisfactory to the whites , and without giving cause of complaint to the red men ; and upon disbanding the Tennessee volunteers , who had acted under his orders , they addressed to him the most flattering testimonials of respect . In connection with this mission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge upon Wool an " attempt to usurp the power of civil tribunals " in that state , " trampling upon private rights , " &amp;c . In consequence of this , a court of inquiry was , at his own request , ordered , General Scott presiding . The finding of the court was not only an honorable acquittal , but the facts developed redounded greatly to the honor of the general . It also gave him the opportunity of making that masterly defence which has added so much to his reputation . The removal of a body of men like Indians , from a country where they have been settled , in such a manner as to preserve the peace and protect all parties in their just rights , is a matter of exceeding delicacy , and the government showed its judgment in selecting Wool for a duty which required the exercise of such high faculties of the mind . That bad men , whose desigris upon the rights and properties of others , should trump up malign charges against the inflexible justice which frustrated their schemes , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratifying , not only to the friends of General Wool , but to the government , since his defence developed , in some degree , the breadth of his vast administrative capacity , his just conception of the spirit of his mission , and the promptness and precision with which he executed it The full legal consequences of his acts , the high moral sense of his responsibilities , and the firm course with which he assumed them , are finely displayed . He develops a character of the true Jackson stamp . The government decided upon a rigid execution of the treaty , and Wool was the man to do it ; and he did it with an integrity of purpose , decision , and vigor , that Jackson could not have excelled . During the Canadian difficulties , in 1838 , and the grumbling of John Bull , General Wool was employed on a military reconnoisance in the wilds of Maine for the defence of the frontier . This duty , of extraordinary difficulty under the circumstances , was performed under the guidance of that clear perception of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , totally regardless of consequences , which is so characteristic of Wool , and that assimilates him in so marked a degree to General Jackson . This long practical experience in almost every branch of the country 's service , an acquaintance with the means of defence which the country possesses , and administrative qualities which fall to the lot of very few men to acquire or exercise , were combined in him . General Wool is not the man to shrink from any service which his country may require at his hands , or the call of her constituted authorities . // His activity , promptitude , methodical habits , and decision of ch character are too well known to need specification , and these qualities make him as indefatigable a man of business as he is an intrepid and scientific soldier . Such was the man of pre-eminent abilities , and so experienced , who became efficient in supporting the government when the Mexican war took place . To his industry , address and energy , in organizing , inspecting , and mustering into service , 12,000 men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down to the support of the enveloped column of Taylor , and leading a portion of them on his immortal march of nine hundred miles through an enemy 's country , and effecting a junction with Taylor , without losing a man ; organizing and drilling the united command , selecting the frontier of Buena Vista , and promptly occupying it in the face of the advancing Mexicans , may the great success of that war be attributed . It is not necessary here to enter into the causes of the Mexican war , either in respect to those remote ones growing out of the misconduct of a nation doomed to destruction , or those immediate ones which , growing out of mismanagement on the part of the leader of the army of occupation , precipitated hostilities . While General Taylor was creating difficAiltries for himself through want of sufficient capacity to understand the nature of his position in Texas , he was constantly discouraging the employment of volunteers . His reiterated reports to the government , continued even while danger was thickest around him , were all in opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise : " CORPUS OHRisTI , August 30 , 1845. - That communication will , I trust , reach New-Orleans to-night or to-morrow , in time , I trust , to stop the employment of any more volunteers . " " September 14 , 1845. - In view of the large reinforcements of regular troops ordered to join me , I can not believe that it will become necessary , under any circumstances , to ploy volunteers from the United States . " " October 4 , 1845. - It is proper to add , that , should any auxiliary force be required , I propose to draw it wholly from Texas . I do not conceive that it will become necessary , und any circumstances , to call for volunteers from the United States . " " October 15 , 1845. - Three hundred recruits are now wanted in the regiments and detachments here . " " February 4 , 1846. -I shall not callfor any militia force in addition to what I already have , unless unforeseen circumstances shall render its employment necessary . " " MATAMoRA5 , March 29 , 1846. - Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , call your attention to the necessity of speedily sending recruits to this army .

" " April 26 , 1846. -I have this day deemed it necessary to callupon the governor of Texas for four regiments of volunteers ; as some delay must occur in collecting these troops , I have also desired the governor of Louisiana to send out four regiments of infantry as soon as practicable . If a law could be passed , authorizing the President to raise volunteers for twelve months , it would be of the greatest importance to a service so remote as this . " " May 3 , 1846. - Owing to thepeculiar nature of the country , and our deficiency in the proper description of light troops , I have been kept ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy 's ) movements . " // This last letter is dated May 3d , and twelve days after it was written , Gen. Wool , then in the midst of his arduous duties at his head-quarters at Troy , New-York , received an order to repair to Washington . From this moment the military preparation became animated and efficient . In order the better to estimate the extraordinary activity , energy and skill with which this veteran soldier entered upon the execution of his new duties , we shall state his movements chronologically . August 25th , 1845 , he had orders to concentrate troops for Corpus Christi , to be drawn from Boston , Portland and Portsmouth , to New-York . On the 26th , the orders were all transmitted . The whole arrived , were mustered , and paid off on the 31st , and ready to sail , but the ship was only ready on the 2d . On the 15th of May , 1846 , he received orders to repair to Washington . He reported himself at the War Department in 48 hours . May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to organize and muster into service the volunteers from Kentucky , Tennessee , Ohio , Indiana , Illinois and Mississippi , Which had been required by the President . On the 5th of June he was in Columbus , holding conference with the Governor of Ohio . On the next day he opened correspondence with all the governors , generals , colonels , and regimental officers on one hand , and the War Department on the other . Moving between Cincinnati , Louisville , St. Louis , Memphis and Alton , he was everywhere efficient . He was the only man present who formed any conception of what was necessary for an invading army . " It is impossible , " said the general , in a communication to the War Department , " for the volunteers to get along without experienced staff-officers . They know nothing about the service . I assure you we have few among them that know any thing about any duty which appertains to furnishing supplies . From the colonel down , they do not know what they want , or what is necessary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the field . I have been obliged , in anticipation , to supply all their wants . " The general gave himself no rest ; he was compelled to perform duties which really appertained to subordinate officers of various departments . He kept a vigilant and almost sleepless eye over every branch of the service , from the artillery department down to the nosebags of the horses and the medicines of the hospitals . During the revolutionary war , such an amount of actual labor was never thrown on a general officer . He was compelled to listen , and did listen with patience , to the countless complaints of the volunteers , and endeavored , as far as possible , to redress them , if well founded ; and in all cases , to soot he and keep them in good humor . In restraining the ebullitions of a temper naturally fiery and impatient , he discovered great forbearance and self-command . Familiar with every branch of military service in all its details , the address and management with which he encountered the difficulties that beset him , discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of reconciling the most in dependent and the most refractory spirits , but little accustomed to restraint and to the subordination of the camp . The volunteers soon learned that he was not one to be dallied with , and that in all things where he had the right to command , he would be obeyed ; he was no trifler , and they soon were convinced that he exacted nothing but what was just ; and if he refused indulgences to them , he allowed none to himself . Even his reputation as a severe disciplinarian did not extinguish the desire to serve under his command ; for they were well assured , that when opportunities occurred , he would give full play to their enterprise and martial spirit . // By the 11th July , General Wool had prepared , in all its details , an army of 12,000 men . That is to say , in six weeks , or in less time than it took General Taylor to find out whether he wanted volunteers or not , General Wool , almost alone , had converted 12,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , July 11th , he received an order to turn over his command to General Butler , and to repair to San Antonia , Texas , there to concentrate the troops that were to form his column of march against Chihuahua . Without a moment 's rest , he set out . July 15th , he was at Alton , illinois , inspecting the Illinois regiments . Eleven days after , July 26th , he was at New.Orleans , giving a multitude of orders to procure wagons , horses , mules , munitions , and all the supplies for the forward movement . August 1st , he was in Lavaca , Texas , disembarking the troops , looking after supplies and munitions , reviewing regiments , and perfecting full instructions to act after his departure . August 14th , he was in San Antonio , where he was to concentrate the troops of his column , and whence , after his own incredible exertions , he was compelled to write , August 15th , to General Taylor : " I find , " said he , *neither men , munitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was confidently believed , would have preceded me . If the troops under Colonel ilarney had been here , it was my intention to have proceeded at once to the Rio Grande , to select a point near the Presidio for the establishment of a depot . " These difficulties , his immense activity and indomitable will , overcame . With but few staff officers , he did most of the duty himself even that of quartermaster ; collected supplies , sent instructions to expected troops , and took efficient measures to protect both Mexicans and Texans from the daily inroads of savages . As the troops came up , the indefatigable general set himself to form an army out of corps that met each other for the first time . He rose early , and retired late ; he indulged in no amusements , but devoted every hour , except the few in which he sought some rest by sleep , to the service ; and by incessant exertion , he began by degrees to form the excellent but inchoate materials of the column which he was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously sought information in relation to Chihuahua , and the road thither . All the accounts confirmed , in a most discouraging picture , the difficulties of the route ; nevertheless , General Wool , with 622 regulars , and 2,339 volunteers , the larger portion of those which he had mustered into service , having been sent in admirable order to General Taylor , commenced his perilous march , September 26th . October 8th he reached the Rio Grande , making his own road through hills and over streams as he went . The Rio Grande was 270 yards wide , and was passed by a flying bridge , in face of a small Mexican force , and on the 11th the invading army marched forward , under an inspiriting address from General Wool . On the 24th October it entered Santa Rosa without resistance . Santa Rosa is at the base of the mountains , which can only be passed on the road leading from Saltillo to Chihuahua . The city of Monclova , with 7,000 inhabitants , was reached October 29th . Thus a march of 600 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of General Wool were tied by the absurd armistice of Monterey , which was for 27 days . This time was spent in the most incessant duties , drilling the troops , perfecting their discipline , reconnoitering the country , collecting information // respecting the movements of the enemy . The extent and accuracy of the information thus ac4uired , and the clear manner in which the state of affairs was stated , by him , procured an abandonment of the Chihuahua expedition . Having ascertained that the Mexican troops at Chihuahua had fallen back to Durango and Zacatecas , and that nothing was to be gained by going to Chihuahua but conquering distances , and that Santa Anna was concentrating all the available forces of Mexico at San Luis de Potosi , for the purpose , as he said , of driving the barbarians of the North across the Rio Grande , if not the Sabine , General Wool , on the 1st of November , wrote to General Taylor and urged him , if he had authority , to abandon the expedition to Chihuahua , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow Santa Anna to beat him in detail . " He again wrote to the General on the 12th and 13th , repeating what he had previously communicated ; and again on the 19th , at the same time to Major Bliss , his Assistant Adjutant General , and sent these communications by his Aid-dc-camp , McDowell . In his letter to Major Bliss , he says , " delays are dangerous . This is the favorable time for operating against the enemy . Take time by the forelock and push on before the enemy collects too large a force to bring against us . Urge the General to concentrate his forces . Do not allow the enemy to beat us in detail . " At this time it was ascertained that at least 15,000 men were concentrated at San Luis , and daily increasing . General Taylor having received instructions from the Secretary of War to withdraw Gen. Wool 's command from Chihuahua , if he should deem it advisable , transmitted to the latter by his Aid-de-Camp an order to occupy Parras , which he did on the 5th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the self-reliance of a great captain , he " cut the cord " of his communication , by ordering the companies to join the army in front , and on November 24th resumed his march . On the 26th he received notice that the Chihuahua expedition was abandoned , and also orders to occupy Parras , 180 miles from Monclova , 100 from Saltillo , and 150 of Monterey , which he occupied December 5th ; and the admirable manner in which this city was governed by General Wool , endeared him to its people . At this time Taylor was at Monterey , and Worth at Saltillo . Wool had orders , that in case Worth should be menaced , to proceed thither and assume command ; and Worth having sent notice of the approach of Santa Anna and solicited aid , Wool , with his column , was in motion to join him December 17th , in two hours after the receipt of the notice . It may be remarked , so excellent had been his management , that only 14 of his men were too sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the privilege of nursing them . On the 21st of December , Wool encamped at Agna Nueva , twenty-one miles in advance of Saltillo , and fourteen in advance of the memorable field of Buena Vista ; thus completing a march ' of six hundred miles , through an enemy 's country , not only without shedding a drop of blood , but having conquered the hearts of the enemy . In the course of the march , his army had levelled hills , filled ravines , constructed bridges , crossed rivers difficult of passage , and sandy plains , scaled mountains , and finally , in eighty-five days , including twenty-seven lost by the unfortunate armistice of Monterey , encamped at Agua Nueva , the advanced position of the army of occupation , in high health , scarcely losing a man on the march , and in a state of discipline which was the // 447 admiration of all military men . His column was so thorough in its appointments , that it was the model of an army : it wanted nothing ; and with the means then existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this had been accomplished by unceasing vigilance , by an irresistible energy , before which the most formidable obstacles gave way ; and by a system of admirable military diplomacy , which enabled the commander to feed his army from the resources of the country , and to sustain his credit by the undeviating honor which characterized his conduct in all his engagements , and the prompt manner in which he fulfilled all his stipulations . The annals of history furnish no instance of such a march as General Wool 's : no disasters occurred ; nothing was lost , and the army was brought out in fine condition at the termination of this stupendous march , and the military ability of the commander was too plainly manifested to be controverted . He had shed no blood , converted enemies into friends , and was in all places received as a protector rather than as a conqueror . Slander was silenced ; and the restless spirit of envy , if not quelled , was quieted . Compare this with the friendly marches of Wellington in Spain , as described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , under Cole , chiefly of one regiment , finding the inhabitants had fled , according to their custom , whichever side was approaching , broke open the houses , plundered , and got drunk . A multitude were left in the cellars of Waldemors , and two hundred and fifty fell into the hands of the enemy ; and the excesses committed by some of the soldiers were glaring , and furnished proof that the moral conduct of a general can not be fairly judged by following in the wake of a retreating army . On this occasion there was no want of provisions , no hardships to exasperate the men ; and yet I , the author of this history , counted , on the first day 's march from Madrid , seventeen bodies of murdered peasants . And a shallow observer might thence have drawn the most foul and false conclusions against the English general and nation . " So far Colonel Napier , upon a march of Wellington , three hundred miles in a friendly country . Now , General Wool marched six hundred miles through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage having been committed by his men , the safety and morality of the townspeopie had never been so great , as during his presence , and this was entirely owing to the high character of the General . What did General Wool when he approached a town , even a hostile one ? He protected the persons and property of the inhabitants from any ill usage on the part of his own men ; he even rescued some captives from the Indians who infest Northern Mexico ; he saw that every thing got by his soldiers from the Mexicans was fairly paid for ; in fine , he kept his division in such excellent subordination , that not a single family was obliged to flee at their approach , or had occasion to dread the outrages which so oftenwe had almost said invariably-attend invasions , whether gratuitous or provoked . Napier endeavors to screen Wellington from blame for his incapacity to command , but the condemnation of that officer is found in the example of Wool .

When the party reache&amp; Angostura , which they had passed in a thick fog the previous evening ' Wool halted , and after viewing the ground , exclaimed : " This is the spot of all others I have yet seen in Mexico , which I should select for battle , wure I obliged with a small army to fight a large one . The net . work of deeply-worn channels on the right will completely protect that flank , and the heights on the left will command the road ; while the ravines in front , which extend back to the mountain on that side , will cripple the movements of the enemy , should he attempt to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged much on the superior advantages of this as a battle field . Carleton communicated his opinions to the officers of the camp , many of whom visited the spot , and all concurred in the opinion of General Wool . December 26 , General Butler assumed command , and , for some reason , ordered General Wool to fall back to Encantada . There he remained some weeks in a situation which was unfavorable to the efficiency of his corps . On the 21st January , General Butler proceeded to Monterey , and thence to the United States , an event which placed the troops in and near Saltillo under command of Wool . Immediately active preparations were commenced . General Lane , governor of Saltillo , received full instructions for the defence of that city , and Captain Webster was ordered to complete a field work , and occupy it with two 24 pound howitzers . This work commanded the city , and incessant exertions kept the command in fine order . January 30th , the reports of the movements of the enemy and the appearance of large bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor at Monterey , who , in opposition to the advice of General Scott and the War Department , established his camp , February 5th , at Agua Nueva , with the intention of there fighting the Mexicans . February 10th , General Wool followed with Lane 's brigade , leaving Major Warren with four Illinois companies to hold Saltilbo . General Taylor now placed the whole camp under the command of Wool . His own troops were in a high state of discipline ; not so with the volunteers // under General Taylor . The army had been weakened by the withdrawal of the regulars for the service of Scott 's campaign , and the volunteers of Taylor required the skill and activity of Wool to improve their efficiency . That general , although complained of by the volunteers for his alleged too strict discipline , was nevertheless respected for his own indefatigable industry and manifest genius . These qualities , as is always the case , ultimately secured him the admiration of the troops after they had learned to appreciate the value of discipline . " And each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the aptness and intelligence of the volunteers , who were taught under his superintendence . " The great difficulty with General Taylor was his mental and physical indolence . When he had once imbibed an idea , no matter how erroneous , nothing but positive blows would induce him to relinquish it . He had a notion that the large army at San Louis was destined for Vera Cruz ; and he would not relinquish it until Santa Anna was capturing his wagons . As late as the 14th February , in a communication to the Adjutant General , he says : " Rumors reach our camp from time to time of the projected advance of a Mexican force upon this position , but I think such a movement improbable . " It was , however , his determination , if the Mexican chief should attack him , to meet him at Agaa Nueva . From the 30th January to February 20 , there were constant rumors of the approach of 20,000 to 30,000 Mexicans ; and every American officer was convinced of the truth of those reports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to Agua Nueva , but was fully determined to fight them there , if they did come . On the 20th the actual advance of the Mexicans dispelled one illusion , and with that fled another , viz. , the ability to fight at Agua Nueva . He had been there three weeks , never doubting that it was strong battle ground ; when the Mexicans were actually upon him , he reconnoitered , and found it could be turned ; then , for the first tune , he listened to General Wool . He writes himselfMarch 4 : " Not exactly liking my position , having ascertained that Santa Anna could gain my rear by two roads on my right and one on my left , and deeming it prudent not to divide my forces , and having apprehensions about my supplies , which were in Saltillo , I determined at once to fall back towards that place about 12 miles , and occupy a strong position between two spurs of a mountain with a narrow valley between them . Said position had been closely examined by the topographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it admirably adapP*d to meet a large with a small force , as well as adapted to the description of force which composed our army . The statement that the engineers had examined the pass was not true . General Wool alone had examined it , and his advice had , under the illusion that the army would fight at Agua Nueva , been utterly neglected until the moment of retreat , which took place on the evening of the 21st , 14 miles , to Buena Vista . Colonel Yell was left at Agua Nueva , to bring off or destroy the provisions which there was now no time to save . McKee , with the Kentuckians and a section of Washington 's artillery , were stationed at Encantado , to cover the retreat of Yell . The army arrived at Buena Vista on the evening of the 21st , and Taylor immediately continued his march with the Mississippi regiment , Sherman 's and Bragg 's batteries , ( eight guns , ) and May 's dragoons , that is , all the V OL . XXIX. - KO . V. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Saltillo , five miles further in the rear thus leaving Wool , with 3,000 raw troops , to meet the enemy pouring down from Agua Nileva , flushed with supposed victory , capturing wagons , and driving before them the American advanced guard . Wool knowing his ground , promptly set to work to stem the enemy 's advance . The farm of Buena Vista is five miles from Saltillo , on the road to Agua Nueva , which runs through a narrow valley , formed by two ranges of mountains . A branch of the river Tigre flows through this valley ; and one mile and a half in advance of Buena Vista , is the pass of Angosturo . On the right of this pass , and between it and the mountains , the river had worn a net-work of deep channels , which were impassable for any troops . On the left of the pass were a succession of plateaux separated by deep ravines , and forming tongues of land , stretching from the mountains to the road . The most elevated of these tongues approach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pass La Angosturo . The whole American army consisted of the following troops : UNITED ST&amp;TES ARMY-FEBRUARY 22 .

As soon as Taylor left , Wool ordered Jiardin to throw up a parapet on the right and left of the road , and also one across the road , where Washington 's battery of eight pieces was stationed , and that was the key of the position . Santa Anna having passed Agun Nueva in the night , was before Angostura early in the morning of the 22d . Wool notified Taylor , who was at Saltillo , of Santa Anna 's approach . He also marched his troops forward , and occupied the pass . Directly in rear of Washington 's battery , was Col. M'Kee 's 2d Kentucky regiment ; on the right , two companies of the 1st Artillery ; on the left of the battery , six companies 1st Illinois , Col. Ilardin ; on the left of M'Kee the 2d Illinois , Col. Bissell ; Gen. Lane with the Indiana Brigade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , with Steen 's dragoons in its rear ; Marshall and Yell were with Gorman 's rifles towards the mountain on the left . After all these dispositions were made , Taylor , at 10 o'clock on the 22d , arrived , and pronounced " the army in a position // of remarkable strength . " He brought back with him six Mississippi com* pames , and Sherman and Bragg 's batteries of 7 pieces , having left one gun to guard his camp at Arispa 's Mills , one mile from Saltillo , with two companies of the Mississippi regiment . On his arrival , Wool rode along the line , reminding the soldiers that it was Washington 's birthday , and " he trusted no American soldier would disgrace it . " The troops responded with great enthusiasm . At 11 o'clock , Gen. Taylor received from Santa Anna a summons to surrender , stating that he was surrounded with 20,000 men . This was declined , of course , and soon after the light troops of Ampudia were seen to ascend the mountain on the left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gorman 's rifles , to meet and check the movement . At the same time Gen. Taylor , by some strange fatality , ordered M'Kee 's regiment , with two pieces of Bragg 's battery , and Pike 's squadron , across the gullies to the right , a distance of two miles , over a most difficult route . Knowing the impracticable nature of the ground , Santa Anna paid no attention to the movement . Three of Washington 's pieces , and Bowle 's Indiana regiment , had been also detached to the left . Having thus weakened the centre , and placed M'Kee kors du combat , in case of a vigorous attack of the enemy , at the close of the day , Gen. Taylor says in his report : " I became convinced that no serious attack would be made before the next morning , and returned with the Mississippi regiment and the 2d dragoons to Saltillo , thus leaving the battle ground in charge of General Wool . " The troops bivouacked on the field , and slept on their arms . The night was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the enemy reinforced Ampudia in the mountains , with 2,000 infantry . At 2 o'clock in the morning , the American piekets were driven in , At dawn of day Ampudia again attacked the left , and was successfully met by Marshall , with Gorman 's rifles . These Wool reinforced with Trail 's Illinois rifles . At this moment , viz. , dawn of day , Santa Anna organized three columns , one under Villamil , to attack Washington 's battery by the road , and two others under Pacheco and Lombardini , to force the American left , and then join Villamil , on the Saltillo road . At the same time he established a battery of three pieces under the mountain , 800 yards from the American left . To meet this storm , Wool had less than 3,000 men . Thus there were at Saltillo 370 men ; and Taylor further disposed of the following : Marched to Saltillo , the only troops that had ever been in battle . - Marched to the right . Davis , . ... 358 M'Kee , - - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bragg , 2 pieces , . 50 May 's troops 70 Pike 's squadron , .150 Men , 448 Men , . .744 Together make 1,562 men , leaving Wool in hand 2,815 men , with which to meet twenty thousand Mexicans . Thus the small army of 4,600 was divided into three parties , and Wool met the storm as best he might . At 7 A. M. Villamil attacked by the road , and was repulsed by the most wonderful calmness and precision of firing by Washington 's battery . They were so roughly handled , that they never renewed the attack . At the same time Pacheco and Lombardini attacked the left centre . Here they encountered Lane with Bowles , 2d Indiana , O'Brien 's artillery , 3 pieces , Bissell ' * 2d Illinois , and Sherman 's batteries . They were repulsed with great loss , and the new corps disperseQ At the moment of the dispersion of these corps , Lane ordered an advance // and Bowles , of the 2d Indiana , ordered a change of position , which produced panic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In vain the gallant Bowles and Lane strove to remedy the disaster . The opening left by the departure of the regiment was seized upon by Santa Anna , who promptly organized and thrust in a new column , which broke the An*rican line , compelling O'Brien to change position , by which he lost a piece . The Mexicans p*ured in upon the plateau , converging towards Washington 's battery in great force . They were gallantly met by the 2d Illinois , part of the 1st Illinois , Sherman 's battery , and M'Kee 's Kentuckians , which had with incredible exertion heen recalled by Gen. Wool from its idle position on the right , where it had been ordered by Gen. Taylor , but it was a long and difficult march back . This united force drove the Mexicans back to the mountains with great loss , but several thousands passed to the American left and rear . At this moment Taylor got back from Saltillo with May 's squadron , having left the Mississippi regiment to follow . These were the first three attacks* Washington 's batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under General Lane ; and the last was repulsed by Wool 's bringing from the right , and uniting with the others , the Kentucky regiment , where it had been so erroneously sent the night before . If Wool had had that regiment in hand to support the Indianians , the Mexicans would never have got upon the plateau , and the battle would have been terminated in a victory , before Taylor returned from Saltillo. * Or even had Taylor not kept the Mississippi regiment uselessly marching and countermarching , but left it where it wanted to be , viz. , to meet the enemy , no disaster would have occurred . He marched that regiment from Agua Nueva to Saltillo on the 21st , from Saltillo to Angostura and back to Saltillo on the 22d , and again to Angostura on the 23d . That is to say , the regiment marched 40 miles without any object , and returned just in time to meet the Mexican rupture on the American left . As we have seen , when Taylor arrived , Wool having forced the Mexicans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He overtook Lane , Bowles and Gorman wounded , and hastened in the direction of Buena Vista . At half distance he met the Mississippi regiment coming up . Col. Davis and Wool succeeded in rallying some of the Indianians behind the Mississippians , and they charged the advance of the column of Mexicans who had escaped to the rear , and forced theruto the mountains . At the same time Torrejon , with a body of lancers , outflanked the Mississippians and attacked Buena Vista , whence they were driven partly - over the mountains by the cavalry of Marshall and Yell , and , the rifles of Trail and Gorman . Many of them regained the column in front of the Mississippians . At this juncture Wool brought up the 3d Indianians , some of the rallied 2d Indianians , and Kilburn 's piece of artillery ; these being joined by Sherman and Bragg with five pieces , drove back the Mexicans with great vigor . At this moment , General Taylor , with singular fatality , again played into the hands of the Mexicans . Santa Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent a flag to Taylor to know " what he wanted . " Although the Mexicans never ceased firing , General Taylor entertained the flag , and sent Wool to meet Santa Anna . Although General Wool remarked that the officers denied that they came with a flag , he undertook the mission of course , but on reaching the battery of the Mexicans , as they refused to cease fire , // 1851 . Political Portraits with Pen* and Pencil . 453 he terminated the parley and returned witi3out seeing Santa Anna . After reporting the result of his mission to General Taylor , he returned to the left , and with the Mississippi and 3d Indiana regiments , and Sherman 's and Bragg 's batteries , set to work to repair lost time by renewing the action ; and pursuing the Mexicans with great havoc , forced them to the mountains , where some 2,000 dismayed Mexicans became huddled together in the recess of the mountain . At this moment General Taylor was seized with compassion for the Mexicans , " and to save human life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surrender of the Mexicans thus huddled together in great confusion , and which Captain Bragg refers to in his report of the part he acted . The troops were ordered to cease firing , " and the Mexicans with the flag made their escape , and regained the plateau . " As the retreating column came upon the plateau , Ha*din , Bissel and McKee sent it flying towards the Mexican lines with great havoc . General Taylor was absent at this critical moment . He says , " I had left the plateau for a moment , when I was recalled thither by a heavy musketry fire . " Now , what had happened in this " moment ? " Santa Anna had formed all his reserves behind the plateau , and as the Americans drove the rescued column before them , Santa Anna fell upon them with his whole line , and overwhelmed the American centre , driving them before him . This was the crisis of the battle , and it was saved by Wool , who , foreseeing the play of the Mexicans , as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left , hurried Sherman and Bragg 's batteries , with the Mississippians and the 3d Indianians , to the right . We may let Taylor describe what followed himself : " I had left the plateau for a moment , when I was called hither by a very heavy musketry fire ; on regaining that position , I discovered that our infantry ( Illinois and Kentucky ) had engaged a greatly superior force of the enemy , evidently his reserves , and that they had been overwhelmed by numbers . The moment was most criticaL Captain O'Brien , with two pieces , had sustained this heavy charge to the very last , and was finally obliged to leave his guns on the field , his infantry support being entirely routed . Captain Bragg , who had just arrived from the left , was ordered at once into battery , without any infantry to support him ; and , at the imminent risk of losing his guns , this officer came immediately into action , the Mexican line being a few yards from the muzzle of his pieces . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and third drove him back in disorder , and saved the day . " The Mexicans were driven back , but made a show of returning . Gen. Wool rallied all the troops on the plateau , and concentrated them to meet him . But the attack was not renewed . Whilst this contest was going on at Buena Vista , Minon with 2,000 cavalry attacked Saltillo ; but was repulsed by means of the arrangements previously made by Wool in that view . It was confidently expected that the enemy would attack again the next day . Generals Taylor and Wool occupied the same tent  --  the former slept , while the latter was occupied the whole night with orders and supplies . At dawn he mounted his horse to reconnoitre , and discovering the retreat of the enemy , announced the fact to the troops , and reported it to Taylor . That which presents itself most forcibly to the mind of the reader on reviewing the facts of the battle , is the universal agency of Gen. Wool . // He foresaw all , planned all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the mental inactivity of Taylor caused him to commit . First , the army was three weeks at Agua Nueva before Gen. Taylor ascertained that a battle could not be fought there safely , and became convinced of what Wool saw at a glance sixty days previously , viz. , that Angostura was the point to fight . When concluded upon retreating in face of the enemy , he left Wool with the raw troops to meet the Mexicans , and took all the veterans with him to Saltillo . For what reason he went to Saltillo , has never been explained . He says himself ; generally " to look after its defences . " But Wool had put it in a state of defence thirty days previously ; and Gen. Taylor in those visits made no change in those arrangements of Wool ; but Minon was repulsed by Webster on the instructions issued by Wool to Major Warren . If there had been defences to look after , it was not the business of the Commander-in-chief to leave a battle field to look after them-he should have sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line of battle . He pronounced " the position very strong . " And all that he did , was to order McKee 's Kentuckians two miles to the right , to a position where it was impossible for the enemy to attack . He did so , because he did not know what Wool knew , viz. , that the nature of the ground rendered a force there useless . It was for the same reason that he remained so long at Agna Nueva , viz. , that he had neglected to reconnoitre . Thus he marched 500 men ten miles for no other purpose than to weaken Wool 's line of battle . The efficiency of the best troops was immensely weakened by their long , useless marches . He again returned on the 23d , only to save the Mexican column from the blows of Wool , by sending Crittenden with a flag-giving the enemy great advantage . At the final onset he was absent from the field , when the battle was saved only by the foresight of Wool . Twice the battle of Wool was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of American life . As we have seen , on General Wool devolved the duty of creating the army which won that victory . Volunteers submit to military restraint with but a bad grace ; and Wool , who imposed those restraints , was the object of dislike to the troops until they became soldiers ; he was then the object of their admiration . No man , without the iron nerve of a Jackson or a Woo , would have borne up so long against this feeling . They were at Buena Vista surrounded by an arfriy of twenty-four thousand of the best disciplined , the most numerously officered , and the most veteran army ever raised in Mexico . Ten thousand of them , with Ampudia , had been under fire at Monterey , and there were officers and men who had fought against old Spain , and made civil war their pastime for twenty-five years . What would have been the fate of our brave and devoted little army , if discipline had been neglected 3 Probably in one hour they would have been thrown into confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suwarrow of Mexico had been carried out , seconded by his licensed assassins , the infuriated lancers  --  and his Cossacks , the rancheros-who were placed as additional outposts to cut off every straggler , and were all thirsting for blood and plunder ,  --  not one man of our heroic band would have survived to tell the tale of horror . It is not surprising , therefore , that we find not only a change of opinion as to the absolute necessity of discipline , but an outpouring of grateful admiration towards General Wool , for his steady determination in enforcing // it , and his admirable example in directing it to the best advantage on the field of battle . He had knowa battle fields before . But the volunteers , with the exception of one regiment , had never been under fire . He knew that his sole dependence in the hour of trial would be from that self-confiding bravery which discipline alone inspires . Accordingly he had , from the moment his army was concentrated at Sen Antonio , in the latter part of August , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he presented them in front of Saltillo , on the alarm of General Worth in the latter part of December , and thence up to the very day of battle , directed the whole energies of a long military life to make his column not only the proudest model of an army in all its appointments , equipments and supplies , but the best in its discipline and military deportment . In this he did succeed , but it cost him his popularity with many of the volunteers . The temper Jackson encountered at New-Orleans before victory , was expressed prior to the battle of Buena Vista . They had dreamed not of the hardships of drill and subordination , of order and discipline , but of the romances of military marches and encampments ; and consequently , as the Saltillo Picket Guard in its plain style says : " No General ever had so many curses for so few offences . " But now , how changed is the language of the volunteers : " I take back , " says one of them in an Aikansas paper , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little as his column liked him before the battle , " says another , " they all now admit that he is a splendid general . " General Wool , " says a third , ( Telegraph &amp; Review , Alton , April 9 , 1,847 , ) " behaved most gallantly , and has earned 11 the country can do forh im , besides the respect , esteem and admiration of his brigade , who , before the battle , had a long account of what they considered petty annoyances , treasured against him . " We would offer the following extr* ets from the reports of General Taylor and other officers , relative to General Wool at Buena Vista Extract from the first Report of General Taylor , dated February 24 , 1847 . " I may he permitted here , however , to acknowledge my great obligations to Brigadier General Wool , the second in command , to whom I feel particularly indebted for his services on this occasion. ** A*ain , in General Taylor 's detailed report of the battle , dated March 6,1847 , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due . The high state of discipline and instruction of several of the volunteer regiments was attained under his command ; and to his vigilance and arduous services before the action , and his gallantry and activity on the field , a large share of our success is justly to be attributed . During most of the engagement he was in immediate command of the troops thrown back on our left flank . I beg leave to recommend him to the favorable notice of the Government . " The following is an extract from the account given of the battle , by Major Coffee , one of General Taylor 's staff :  --  " General Wool led the main body in person , and was seen every where rallying and encouraging the volunteers . " " The details of the battle were confided to General Wool , who nobly justified the confidence of his commander and brother veteraa by the most active , zealous , efficient , and gallant conduct . Throughout the whole action he was constantly engaged in the disposition of our forces , and in rallying them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thick flying balls which thinned the ranks he was marshalling . There was but one complaint made against him , and that was , that he exposed himself too much . " // The following is a copy of a letter from General Lane to General Wool , on leaving the country BUENA VISTA , MExIco , 2Vfay 20 , 1847 . " DEAE GENERAL ,  --  In a few days we are to take up the line of march homewards , and from my understanding of the law I am soon to be discharged , and I greatly hope that the cause that gave rise to my appointment may soon cease to exist . A speedy and honorable peace with this country is much desired by every American citizen . " But , my dear general , I can not think of parting with you without expressing my high opinion of your great worth as a military man . During the whole time that I have been under your command , I have found you prompt , faithful , and vigilant in the discharge of your duty ; looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor and glory of your country . " A strict disciplinarian , you have discharged your duty with ability , and an impartiality worthy a great man . Your exertions as second in command , at the great and glorious battle of Buena Vista , moving to and fro in every part of the field , watching the movements of the enemy , exposed to danger almost every moment of the day , ordering and disposing of our forces in the best manner , to meet and repulse the enemy-by your exertions , coolness , and courage in gaining this victory , you have won laurels and a fame that will endure as long as the traces of American history shall exist . " Hoping that you may live long to enjoy the thanks of a grateful people , . I remain , Sir , your most obedient and humble servant ( Sd . ) Josz*n LANE , Brig . Gem . " The Illinois Volunteers wrote to General Wool , as follows " BRAEos SANTIAGO , June 23 , 1847 . BEIG . GEN . WooL ,  --  The officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eve of leaving Mexico for their homes , would do violence to their own feelings , did they not tender to their immediate commanding general a testimonial of their regard . Upon entering the service a year since , they were not prepared to appreciate the importance of discipline and drill , and consequent'y complained of them as onerous and unnecessary ,  --  complaints were loud and Inany . " Their judgment convinced , these feelings have undergone a change , and they iiow thank you for your untiring exertions to make them useful to their country , and a credit to the state . " Whatever , sir , of service , we may have done our common country , or whatever of honor we may have done the state of Illinois , to General J. E. Wool is due the credit . You , Sir , brought your column into the field well provided for and disciplined , and fought them well when you got them there ; and should our country ever ag in need our services in the field , it would be our proudest wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in whose energy , watchfulness and courage , we , and the whole army , have the most unlimited confidence . " With the best wishes for your future fame and happiness , on the part of the regiment , we beg leave to subscribe ourselves your friends . ( Sd . ) W. WEATIITAiTORD , C*ol . Xst Reg't Illinois Vol 's . W. B. WARREN , Licut . Colonel . and forty company and staff officers . " In relation to General Wool 's conduct in the battle of Buena Vista , Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Itoane , of the Arkansas Volunteer Cavalry , says , in his report " On the morning of the 23d , the position of my command was designated by our gallant general himself to whose cool and heroic courage , military judgment and commanding genius , I would add my hunible testimony . " // Major A. F. Morrison , of the Illinois Volunteers , in a letter to his Excellency , Governor Whitcomb , relating to the battle of Buena Vista , says , that " General Wool was next in command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engagement . He is a brave and competent officer , and merits the gratitude of his countrymen for his services on this great occasion . " Captain Pike , a friend of General Taylor , in his sketch of the battle , says , " General Wool has gained great credit . He made all the dispositions for the battle . He was cool , calm , and composed , and exhibited the most quiet and unpretending bravery . " Carleton , in his work on the battle of Buena Vista , says , " Wherever the fury of the battle was greatest , there was General Wool , riding from point to point , encouraging and stimulating the men to still greater exertions . " General Wool , in his report of the battle , says , " I can not close my report without expressing , officially and formally , as I have heretofore done personally , to the Major General commanding , the feelings of gratitude I have for the confidence and extreme consideration which have marked all his acts towards me , which has given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the execution of the responsible duties with which I have been charged . " In a letter to the Hon. John A. Dix , General Wool speaks of General Taylor , as follows " Of all the men I have ever seen in battle , he appeared the most calm . His cool and determined bravery , sound mind and judgment , which never forsakes him , even in the most critical moments , will ever command my admiration . His brilliant achievements from Palo Alto to the termination , at Buena Vista , will be appreciated by a magnanimous and generous people . " Letters of the same import , and some perhaps stronger , were written to the Hon. Francis Baylies , Daniel Webster , John Bell , William C. Rives , Lewis Cass , Joshua A. Spencer , General 0 . Clark , of New-York , and many others ; and in no letter , public or private , touching General Taylor 's conduct , has General Wool ever said less . Colonel Jefferson Davis acknowledges the receipt of a similar letter , to General Gibson , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mv DEAR GENERAL ,  --  I have just read with great pleasure the copy of your letter to General Gibson , which you did me the honor to send mc this morning . " It shall be preserved for the use permitted , and be assured , under circumstances requiring , that it will give me great pleasure thus to apply it . In these times of petty jealousy and ignoble strife for public approbation , it is quite refreshing to see one so prominent in the scenes you describe , forgetting himself to sustain and commend his commander . " With assurances of my regard , I am , cordially , yours , ( Sd . ) Jzrr . DAvIs . " In looking back at the results of Wool 's march , the moral influence of it was immense : as Taylor advanced on his line of operations , the people // deserted their homes , flocked to the mountains , and became guerillas , with which the country swarmed , becoming daily more formidable . The advance of Wool , holding his men in admirable discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that the Americans committed no outrage , paid for what they had , protected them from the Indians , and introduced strict justice into the courts . General Wool ascertained also , that the guerillas remained under arms through fear . He promptly proclaimed amnesty to those who were peaceable . The consequence was , an immediate return of the people to their houses , and the guerilla chiefs found themselves without supporters . This was " conquering a peace . " He pacificated the country on Taylor 's flank , and gave an example which stamps with infamy and incapacity the operations of Wellington in the Peninsula ; whose ability manifested itself in brutal conduct and abusive speech . Having relieved Taylor from fears of the rising of the people on his flank and rear , Wool appeared in front with an efficient column , without the aid of which , Taylor must have retreated , when Scott drew from him the regular troops . The volunteers , who had made the loudest complaints against Wool for what they thought harsh discipline , expressed to him personally their deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world over . It may he remarked , that notwithstanding the many attacks which have been made upon Gen.Wool gratuitously by the friends of Gen. Taylor , that Gen. Wool , with great magnanimity , has never replied , directly or indirectly , or in any degree detracted from the merits of the Commander-inChief . The unscrupulous zeal of many of Gen. Taylor 's friends , have induced them from time to time to attack Gen. Wool , seemingly from fear that the merits of that officer should interfere with their claims on behalf of Gen. Taylor . It has been matter of surprise in some quarters , that no reply has ever been made to those slanders . But Gen. Wool seems uniformly to have resisted the desire of his friends to see justice done him in that respect . Content with having well served his country , he would not condescend to defend his own claims from mercenary detractors . He was too magnanimous to ever interfere with the civil triumphs of a brother officer . Gen. Wool having been promoted to the rank of Brevet Major-General for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command at Saltillo until November 25 , 1847 , when Gen. Taylor left for the United States , and the whole command devolved upon Wool , and so continued until June 5 , 1848 , when the Commissioners , Sevier and Clifford , communicated to Gen. Wool official notice of the termination of the war . The army was then put in motion . The general leaving Monterey June 20 , reviewed the troops at Matamoras , July 4 . Gen. Wool arrived at Brazos St. Jago , in Texas , in July ; and on the 20th , visited Point Isabel , where he was received with the usual military honors . On the 26th of July , he embarked in a steamboat for New-Orleans , where he arrived on the first of August , and was visited by the governor and suite , and other distinguished citizens . On the 2d , he left for Cincinnati , where he arived on the 12th , and on the 17th reached Washington . General Wool arrived in the city of New-York on the 18th of August , where he was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a committee of one hundred citizens from Troy . On the // morning of the 19th , he was escorted by the New-York City Guards , the Troy Citizens ' Corps , and a committee of one hundred , to the steamboat Hendrick Hudson , which the Trojans had chartered to conduct the general to their city and his home . On his way up the river the general was frequently cheered , as he passed , by the citizens on the shore ; and especially at Poughkeepsie , Albany , and West Troy . On his arrival at Troy , he was greeted enthusiastically by the whole people , who had assembled to receive him . So great and dense was the assemblage on the docks , and in the streets , that several hours elapsed before he reached his residence , where he was affectionately received by his family and friends . The city of Troy presented him with a sword , in testimony of her share of the nation 's gratitude ; and on this occasion " General Wool , standing alone , erect and dignified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which powers of endurance scorned written , " made the following reply : Friends , Fellow- Citizens , and Soldiers : On my return from the war in Mexico , I find myself in your midst , unexpectedly in a new sphere of action . I find myself engaged in the delightful , but difficult task of responding to those spontaneous outpourings of the heart ; those cordial and enthusiastic receptions which have greeted me , since my arrival in my native state . I had anticipated a welcome from my friends ; but such a welcome as I received on landing in this city , and such as is now indicated in this vast assemblage , I neither anticipated , nor can venture to claim for mere public services . Much of it can only be ascribed to your partiality , to long-standing associations , to the companions of my youth , and the associates of maturer years , whom I recognize before me , and whose steadiness of friendship and kindness has never failed to cheer and animate me in the darkest hour . Such friendship has been especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence ; for , there have been times , when , in the full consciousness of directing all the energies I possessed to the public good and the honor of my country , I found myself in situations where the encouraging voice of friendship was needed to cheer me under the heavy responsibilities which I was struggling to discharge . In the execution of those duties , I was sure to incur the displeasure of the discontented , and of those who could not appreciate the necessity of discipline . It would not have been difficult to flatter the love of indulgence and of ease , and to present the column I had organized and brought into the field of battle , in the garb , without the discipline of soldiers . But those who were at first most loud in their complaints , for my refusing to listen to that syren voice of popularity which would have extricated me at once from a labyrinth of unpleasant service , were the first in their acknowledgments , when convinced by the trial of a battle , of the mercy I had shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the contest . To you , the chief magistrate of this beautiful and enterprising city , my home and residence ; and to you , the representative of the voice of its citizens I make my grateful acknowledgments for the complimentary manner in which you have been pleased to present this splendid sword , as the common gift of the city and of its citizens individually . I receive it with a depth of gratitude which can not be expressed by words . It is the testimonial of my own neighbors , my countrymen at home . It is the symbol of their appreciation of my character as a citizen and a soldier . Could ambition seek a higher reward ? Could pride enjoy a nobler triumph ? I can truly say , that lam more than compensated by this magnificent presentation and reception : this warm , glowing and heartfelt greeting , for all the toil , hardships , and dangers to which I have been exposed since I entered upon the duties that called me to Mexico . The sword which I have received , I shall hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country should again need my services in the field , and this arm should // not become , by age , too feeble to raise itself in vindication of the natural rights , your confidence , as implied in this gift , shall be sustained to the fullest extent of my ability . It is not necessary for me to follow the tenor of your addresses , by recapitulating the course of my action in the two wars to which you have alluded . History has recorded the events of the first : the future historian will embody the materials of the last . In reference , however , to the battle of Buena Vista , to which you have so flatteringly alluded , my services prior to , and during that engagement , are sufficiently noticed in the official language of the commanding general , which you have quoted ; and I agree with that distinguished officer , that " a soldier 's share " is all that need be claimed in the glories of that memorable conflict . Citizen Soldiers : It gives me pleasure to witness , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have displayed . We are an armed republic , but our arms are in our own hands . We stand ready to defend the public liberty , because it is our own . The world is awakened to the fact that a citizensoldiery constitutes their own government , the strongest on earth . No large standing armies are here necessary . A small regular force , and a sufficient number of educated and experienced officers , may always be an expedient resource to give example and instruction . I thank you , with a soldier 's heart , for your attendance on this occasion ; and , on your return to your respective homes , bear with you , and to your families , my best wishes for your prosperity and happiness . And now , my friends , townsmen , and fellow-citizens , permit me to conclude my part in this interesting drama , by renewing to you all the sincerest expressions of my deep and heartfelt gratitude . On the 10th of April , 1848 , the following resolutions were unanimously voted by both branches of the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature are due , and are hereby tendered to our distinguished fellow-citizen , Brig . Gen. John E. Wool , for his valor , skill , and judicious conduct , conspicuously displayed in organizing and preparing for the service of his country , with unprecedented rapidity , more than 12,000 volunteers , in the summer of 1846 ; in disciplining the column under his command , during a rapid march through the enemy 's country ; disarming the enemy by his humane and vigilant observations of their rights ; in the courage and good conduct displayed in the battle of Buena Vista , his uniform gallantry and activity on the field , and the ability and success with which he has since discharged his arduous and responsible duties . Resolved , That the governor be , and he is hereby requested , to procure a sword , with suitable emblems and devices , and present it to Brigadier-General Wool , in the name of the people of this , his native state , as a testimony of their high approbation of his services . Resolved , That the governor be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be communicated to Brigadier-General Wool , in such terms as he may deem best calculated to give effect to the purposes thereof . The governor discharged the duty assigned him , by employing the most skilful artists in the city of New-York to manufacture a sword . Much taste and judgment were displayed in the selection of the emblems and devices , which were appropriate , and referred in a striking manner to the military exploits of the New-York general . To recapitulate all the honors and congratulations bestowed upon Gen. Wool , would , however , fill volumes , and would not come within our scope . The military progress of the general may thus be resumed : April 13 , 1812-Captain , 13th regiment United States Infantry . October 13 , 1812-Major , 29th regiment , for gallant conduct at Qneenstown . September ii , 1814-Lt . Colonel , for gallant conduct at l'lattsburgh . April , 1816-Colonel of Cavalry and Inspector General . // April 26 , 1826-Brevet Brigadier General . June 25 , 1841-Brigadier General in the line . February 23 , 1847-Brevet Major-General , for gallant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties of Major-General , according to his new rank , Wool applied himself with unrelaxed energies to their discharge , without in any degree neglecting those social duties and interests which society claims at his hands . In September , 1850 , on the completion of the monument to Silas Wright , at Weybridge , Vt. , Gen. Wool delivered the address , which was enthusiastically received . In the following October he received an invitation from the Onondaga Agricultural Society , to attend the Fair at Syracuse . He was here addressed by the Mayor of the city , surrounded by many who remembered Wool as the wounded Captain , soliciting , upon his first field , permission once again to storm the heights of Qucenstown , and retrieve the honor of his country 's flag-men who had followed him through the immortal resistance at Beekmantown , and through all his arduous career , to the crowning fight at Buena Vista . The response of the general was enthusiastically cheered . On the 15th February , 1849 , the corner stone of the Troy Hospital was laid , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this day in 1850 , the Hon. D. L. Seymour made an oration , of which the conclusion was addressed to General Wool , in the following strain : " I tender the congratulations of this occasion to him whose bounty has sustained and whose hands laid the corner-stone of this edifice . Your fame , sir , had already become the common inheritance of your countrymen . That military reputation which has for upwards of thirty years been steadily rising , requires , especially since the victory of Buena Vista , no more laurels . It has become a part of the imperishable records of our country 's history , and will live whilst our nation and its name shall live . But even the splendor of a long and brilliant military career , enhanced should it be by still brighter honors ( as you richly deserve ) at the hands of your grateful country , will not outshine this one noble charity with which your name is identified . And , amid the thunder of popular applause , the " still small voice " of the obscure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; will be heard in grateful remembrance of their benefactor . " In August , 1851 , on the occasion of the visit of General Wool to Buffalo , to review the t35th regiment , the common council determined to pay a tribute of respect to the " Hero of Qucenstown , Beekmantown , Plattsburgh , and Buena Vista . " After the review , the general , escorted to the hotel , was addressed by the Mayor , and replied in an admirable speech , which should be written in the hearts of all Americans . We append an extract : " But these great improvements and advancements in civilization , are not limited to Western New-York . They are to be found everywhere throughout the length and breadth of the land . To what may all these blessings be attributed ? To a kind Providence , our form of government and free institutions , which leave the people free and unfettered by power . It is in this country , and this country alone , that man is a free agent . Here there is no power to restrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculties , mental and physical , are at his disposal . He walks abroad in his own majesty , and there are none to make him afraid . He neither feels nor fears power , or those appointed to administer the affairs of government . He may travel from Maine to California and Oregon , and no one would have a right ts ask him , " Why do you so ? " To all which may we not attribute the advancement of the people of the United States in improvement and civilization beyond all others ? And yet , with all these unparalleled privileges // and a prosperity unknown to any other people , we find those among us who are not satisfied . Strange as it may appear , we have a few discontented spirits who would dissolve this glorious Union established by the sacrifice of so much blood and treasure , and with it our prosperity , and forever blast the hopes of the oppressed and liberal of the world . They are , however , so few in number , that I do not apprehend any serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects . The signs of the times , nevertheless , are sufficient to admonish us that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty . As we are a nation composed of states or sovereignties , with diversified interests , it ought not to surprise us if they should occasionally clash . In such a case , what should be our duty ? Conciliation and harmony , and a strict adherence to the constitution , and faithfully carrying out all its provisions , at the same time doing all in our power to prevent discontent and heart-burnings , which , if encouraged , will do more than all else to endanger the Union and destroy our hopes and prosperity . " In all his replies to the numerous invitations with which societies , philanthropic , educational , religious and political , besiege him , the same earnest straia of devoted patriotism , ardent love of country , and enthusiastic zeal in the cause of human liberties and pro* , ress , are manifest . The writings of General Wool , if collected in a volume , would form a book of extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . They contain not the mere dry detail of official reports* but are fraught with profound views and reasonings in relation to subjects of national interest ; and they disclose the workings of an intellect of a high order , operating upon habits of most extraordinary industry . The general character of this able officer approaches nearer to that of the immortal Jackson than that of any public man lately before the people . There is the same quick perception of the truth in all questions which present themselves , and the same undeviating precision of purpose in reaching it . Although in the sphere of duties in which he has been employed there has been little room for , the display of other qualities than those of a military character , yet the indications are numerous in all his movements , of civil qualities which surpassed even those military ones that have conferred upon Wool the high distinction of being the only American officer who has made no mistake . That the general has not hitherto been better known to the people , is because the natural modesty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , obtrudes not its talents upon the public . He is content that another should have the merit , if only that the country is well served . That country will not , however , discharge its duty , if its rewards fall not on the truly deserving .
